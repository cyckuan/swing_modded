EDITORIAL: A GLORIOUS FIRST FOR FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, where soccer is almost a religion, and where the
nation's identity is bound tightly to the fortunes of its national
team, there will be weeks of mourning and months of bitter
recrimination. In France _ well, the French will be toasting their
heroes for days to come, and might actually begin to work up some
lasting Gallic passion for a sport that has always competed for
public affection with the Tour de France and even rugby.
</P>
<P>
   These are the probable outcomes of France's devastatingly
complete victory over a favored Brazilian team in the World Cup
finals on Sunday. The score was 3 to 0, but even that surprisingly
wide margin did not reflect France's superiority. The French
mounted a robust offense, with two first-half goals from Zinedine
Zidane, a midfield maestro known mainly for his exquisite passing.
Zidane was the toast of Paris last night, and will be forever
remembered as the man who brought France its first World Cup, and
denied Brazil its fifth. But it was France's suffocating defense
that carried the day. The mesmerizing freelance work for which
Brazil is justly famous simply failed to materialize and its
superstar, Ronaldo, disappeared altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended one of the world's great sporting events, a marathon
exercise involving 32 teams playing 64 games over 33 days, and
commanding the undivided attention of most of the world from start
to finish. An estimated two billion people watched Sunday's final.
One notable exception was the United States. Its team disappeared
early and its TV ratings for the tournament were relatively low.
Those Americans who did tune in, however, know how far this country
must travel if it hopes to be a serious contender when the next
World Cup rolls around four years from now.

COMMENTARY: SIDEWALK RHETORIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in the west 30s, in Manhattan's sequin and applique
district, a taxi idles, trapped in a box canyon of double-parked
trucks. There is not much to see from the taxi's windows except an
inaudible conversation taking place between two men standing on the
curb. The tall man is making a point. The short man is taking it.
The tall man's point is so forceful that it bends him forward at
the waist. The short man bends backward to avoid being toppled by
gusts of the tall man's rhetoric. A forefinger prods the air and
then the short man's breastbone. Being prodded, however, causes the
short man to stand up straight, causing the tall man to stand up,
too. The taxi moves on.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city full of the lecturing and the lectured, the
hectoring and the hectored, a city that loves to get things off its
chest and onto someone else's. To tourists _ soft-spoken people
raised in hushed surroundings _ the volume of New York's unceasing
colloquy often seems a little too high, the posturing that
accompanies it a little too dramatic. Dickens read it, in `Martin
Chuzzlewit,'' as the national braggadocio of a still-young city in
which there was no private discourse, only public perorations of a
kind that seemed both immodest and orotund.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has aged, and its conversation has become less
grandiloquent. It is fairly rare, these days, to come upon someone
in the street speaking, as it were, in the agora to an audience of
all comers. There is now a more intimate kind of declamation, which
must have existed in Dickens' day as well _ a man or woman pouring
words of bitterness or counsel, warning or contumely, into the ears
of a rapt or fearful or dismissive listener. There is a
familiarity, a peculiar neighborliness about such scenes that most
New Yorker recognize.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the things that characterizes a city is the timbre of
its speech, not only its accent but its force. New York is a
voluble place, as most of its mayors and many of its cab drivers
have proved. Many New Yorkers would never say boo to a mouse, of
course. But some days, when you watch a crowd of New Yorkers
shuffling impatiently past the visitors at Rockefeller Center on a
sunny lunch hour or striding up Eighth Avenue toward Port Authority
at the end of another day, it is hard to envision them without the
thought balloons cartoonists use bobbing above their heads,
balloons full to bursting with great swarms of ink-black words just
waiting to be loosed.

ROBERT S. BURGER, 84, JOURNALIST AND TEACHER OF CONCISE WRITING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert S. Burger, a former journalist and professor who later
spent more than three decades teaching business executives how to
write, died on July 5 at Chester County Hospital in West Chester,
Pa. He was 84 and lived in West Chester.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, who was a reporter for The St. Paul Pioneer Press and
The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., early in his career,
entered the business of teaching concise, effective writing to
business people in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, when he was teaching at the Amos Tuck School of
Business Administration at Dartmouth College, Burger was approached
by the American Management Association to create and give a writing
course for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Burger remained at Dartmouth until 1961, but demand for the
writing course became so great that he finally chose to leave and
form his own business, Burger Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 30 years, his clients included executives from
some 70 corporations and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Burger encapsulated the course, which ran from one to three
days, in a book, ``How to Write so People Can Understand You'' (the
Management Development Institute), which was published in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very well-structured course,'' said Klaus Wagner, a
planning manager in the petrochemical division of Mobil Chemical, a
subsidiary of the Mobil Corp., who took the course a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really said much about my writing except that it was
too dense,'' Wagner said. ``The course helped me to try and cut
down on that.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Burger taught the course by himself.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1970s he hired a friend of his son Robert Burger
Jr. as an instructor. The young teacher, Dave Barry, subsequently
went on to become a best-selling author and Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist for The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   In promotional literature for the course, Barry says it
``teaches techniques you won't find taught anywhere else,
techniques I use every day in my own writing.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Bronx, Burger enrolled in the City College of
New York at age 14 and graduated with a B.A. in foreign languages.
He subsequently earned a master's degree in journalism from the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A staff sergeant during World War II, Burger later joined the
Society of Friends and became a pacifist. He was active in the
civil rights and antiwar movements and remained involved in other
Quaker and human-rights causes.
</P>
<P>
   Burger is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, of West Chester; four
sons, Robert Jr. and Grant, of Thornbury Township, Pa., and William
and James, of West Chester, and 12 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Anibal Ayala, an economist who helped start the
Inter-American Development Bank in 1959, died on June 22 at
Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. Ayala, who was
born in Paraguay and lived in Alexandria, Va., for more than 40
years, was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Nivea Ayala, his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala was the first to serve as under secretary at the
Inter-American Development Bank, which arranges development loans
for member governments and for private investment and advises
members on financial issues. The bank was started by the United
States and 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala left the bank in 1986 to become a financial consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1959, he worked as an economist and census director in
Paraguay and studied at the American University in Washington,
where he received master's and doctoral degrees in economics.
</P>
<P>
   He immigrated to the United States in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala is survived by his wife, of Alexandria, and a daughter,
Maria Mercedes Ayala of New York.

RONALD L. MACE, 58, DESIGNER OF BUILDINGS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronald Lawrence Mace, a polio victim who devoted his life as an
architect and industrial designer to devising environments suitable
for all people regardless of age or condition, died on June 29 at
his home in Raleigh, N.C. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart arrhythmia resulting from polio, said North
Carolina State University. Mace was a senior research associate,
research professor and program director of the university's Center
for Universal Design, which he founded.
</P>
<P>
   Mace was credited with creating the concept of universal design,
built on the idea that good design ought to accommodate everybody.
The concept helped make Washington landmarks like the Capitol and
the Kennedy Center accessible to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   He was also president of Barrier Free Environments Inc., a
consulting company that offered help in making buildings just that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Mace himself, born in Jersey City, N.J., and reared in
Winston-Salem, N.C., grew up in a world full of barriers. He was 9
when he contracted polio, and used a wheelchair from then on. He
had to be carried up and down stairs to attend classes when he was
a student at North Carolina State, and his wheelchair did not fit
into the men's rooms. But in 1966 he graduated with a degree in
architecture from the university's School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of practicing his profession conventionally, he
became a pioneer in accessible architecture and ``adaptable''
housing: apartments or houses with built-in features that fit the
needs of all people at all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Mace helped develop the country's first accessible-building
code, which, adopted by North Carolina in 1973, served as a model
for similar regulations in other states. His work also set a
pattern for federal legislation forbidding discrimination against
people with physical impairments: the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988 and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he created the Center for Accessible Housing, which
later became the Center for Universal Design at North Carolina
State.
</P>
<P>
   Mace's wife, Lockhart Follin-Mace, died in 1991. He is survived
by his companion, Joy Weeber of Raleigh.

PAUL L. KLEIN, 69, A DEVELOPER OF PAY-PER-VIEW TV CHANNELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul L. Klein, an executive who helped pioneer new
forms of pay television, died on July 4 at the Plaza Fifty Suite
Hotel in Manhattan, where he was staying with his wife. He was 69
and lived in Catskill, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He died in his sleep, apparently of a heart attack, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, after nine years as an audience measurement expert for
NBC, Klein helped form Computer Television Inc., one of the first
companies to deliver pay-per-view movies to hotel rooms. In 1975,
Time Inc. acquired Klein's interest in the venture and later sold
it to Spectradyne Inc., which continues to provide pay-per-view
services in hotels as a subsidiary of SPI Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Klein founded the Playboy Channel, the first to
produce, license and broadcast adult programming on pay television.
</P>
<P>
   While at NBC in the 1960s, Klein developed a reputation as an
aggressive and witty partisan for the network. As NBC's vice
president for audience measurement, he engaged in a long-running
feud with Michael Dann, the senior vice president for programming
at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   After CBS prevailed in an audience ratings report in early 1970,
Klein invoked the theories of Marshall McLuhan, the media theorist:
``They didn't win the season. They won their season. This is what
McLuhan called `the dinosaur effect.' CBS has blown to its biggest
size just before extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein also enjoyed modest fame in the television industry for
his theory that viewers do not turn on their sets seeking their
favorite shows, but rather the least objectionable program, or
``the LOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein returned to NBC in 1976 as executive vice president for
programming. He championed the concept of ``event programming,''
with special shows and live broadcasts in place of weekly series.
NBC's first fall schedule after Klein's return featured a 90-minute
slot on Sunday nights for ``The Big Event.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mini-series and movies that NBC broadcast under the
idea of event programming were ``Holocaust,'' ``Shogun,''
``Centennial'' and ``Sybil.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein left NBC a second time in 1979 and founded PKO Television,
an independent production company. In 1981, he produced ``The
People vs. Jean Harris,'' the first courtroom drama for which the
script was taken entirely from a real court transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Klein renewed his involvement with network
television, producing specials for CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is survived by his wife, Janet; two children, Molly, of
Manhattan, and Adam, of Brooklyn, and one grandchild.

THIGH AGAIN SIDELINES YOUNG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After going 4 for 11 in the first three games
after the All-Star break, second baseman Eric Young did not start
in Sunday's 6-3 loss to the San Diego Padres after complaining of
more soreness in his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth time this season Young has missed playing time
because of the thigh injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want him in there because he is our leadoff guy, but most
of all you want him healthy,'' Bobby Bonilla said. ``No sense in
pushing it. There is a lot of baseball left.''
</P>
<P>
   Young leads the National League with 33 stolen bases. But Sunday
he was limited to a third-inning pinch-hitting appearance,
grounding out to second.
</P>
<P>
   This latest flare-up is considered mild, but there are concerns
that the leg is not getting better. When Young was injured in Texas
before the break, general manager Tom Lasorda said the second
baseman was headed to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Young balked. He took off five games and rested during the
three-day All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to let the doctors make the decision on that,''
Lasorda said. ``We need him to get better. We can't have this
problem lingering.''
</P>
<P>
   Young first injured his thigh May 19 in Chicago and has missed a
total of 14 starts. Although Young was out, he was not examined
Sunday. Therapist Pat Screnar said Young was scratched after
complaining of soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's personal best: Wilton Guerrero took Young's place at
second and had a career-high four hits, raising his average to
.286.
</P>
<P>
   It was Guerrero's first start of the homestand. He pinch hit
Friday and Saturday and played center in Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is be ready,'' said Guerrero, who demanded a
trade after he was sent to the minors in late May. ``I heard today
during stretching that I was going to play. That's fine. Just being
in there is what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard gone: To make room for Sunday's starter Brian Bohanon on
the roster, the Dodgers optioned outfielder Trenidad Hubbard to
Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Dodgers tried to option Hubbard to the
minors, but he came up with a sore left knee and was placed on the
disabled list. Hubbard batted .323 in 39 games with the Dodgers,
including four homers and eight RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hubbard went 3 for 5 with a homer and two RBI in the
Dodgers' 12-3 victory over San Diego. In his last nine at-bats with
the Dodgers, Hubbard had five hits.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Ken Caminiti's two-run homer in the eighth inning
snapped Antonio Osuna's scoreless-inning streak at 162/3 innings.
Osuna had not allowed a run since June 6 at Seattle, a span of 13
outings. . . . Raul Mondesi went 0 for 4 to snap a season-high 11
game-hitting streak. Mondesi batted .362 during the streak.

CLYDE RYALS, EXPERT ON CARLYLE, IS DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clyde de Loache Ryals, a Duke University English professor and
an authority on British Victorian literature, died on Friday at his
home in Durham, N.C. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor, said a friend, Fred Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryals was a co-editor of a multivolume edition of the letters of
Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), the Scottish essayist and historian,
and his wife, Jane Welsh Carlyle, who was also a gifted
letter-writer. Not long before Ryals' death, he finished working on
the notes for the 27th volume in the series of books, which are
being published by Duke University Press. Duke and the University
of Edinburgh are collaborating on the scholarly project. The
editors plan to produce an additional 15 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, who teaches English at the City University of New York
and is a biographer of Carlyle and Henry James, said on Sunday that
the series, ``which brings vividly alive daily life in Victorian
literary and cultural Britain, is arguably the most important
edition of Victorian documents being made available for modern
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Modern Language Association of America presented
its Morton N. Cohen Award for a Distinguished Edition of Letters to
Ryals and his co-editor, Kenneth Fielding, a retired University of
Edinburgh professor, for their work on volumes 22 through 24,
spanning the period from mid-1847 through 1849. The association
said, ``These generously annotated volumes allow readers to witness
the personalities and events of a turbulent era through the eyes of
two eloquent, witty and passionate observers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 The Times of London said, in a review of the same three
volumes, that the multivolume project was an ``epic of
scholarship.'' The review added: ``There is nothing in these three
volumes to detract from the view that the Carlyles were the finest
letter-writers of the 19th century. The vividness, the immediacy of
the world described, jumps off the page. This scholarship does not
come cheaply, but the fruits it has unearthed are golden.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Atlanta, Ryals received a bachelor's and a master's
degree from Emory University and a doctorate in English from the
University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor from 1960 to
1973. He joined the Duke faculty in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   His many writings include well-received and influential books
about the British Victorian poets Robert Browning and Alfred Lord
Tennyson.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Hildegard Thun Scheffey Ryals, whom
he married in 1971; a stepson, Mark Ellerkmann of Baltimore; and a
brother, Chester Arthur Ryals of MacRae, Ga.

BRAZIL KICKED IN THE CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France On the eve of the World Cup final, when talk
turned to who might make the greatest impact on the planet's
biggest stage, Mario Zagallo scoffed when Zinedine Zidane's name
was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got lots of players like him,'' the Brazilian coach
said. ``France has got one Zidane, but Brazil has several
Zidanes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Zagallo was wishing he had just one, and one
was quite enough for the French, who used a pair of goals by the
midfield giant and another superb effort from their defense to make
history, routing the Brazilians, 3-0, to claim their first World
Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Before an adoring audience of 75,000 at the Stade de France and
an estimated billion more watching on television France, by turns
brilliant and gutty, dominated the defending champions early, then
held on after losing its top defender, Marcel Desailly, to a red
card in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary,'' gushed Zidane, who headed home a corner
kick in the 27th minute and again nearly two minutes into
first-half injury time. ``It's fabulous. Words fail us to describe
our joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after saying it 10 times, we can't believe it,'' added
reserve forward Christophe Dugarry. ``We could have won, 5-0 or
6-0. We played fantastic football.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning defeat for Brazil, which expected an
unprecedented fifth World Cup crown, but instead endured a pregame
``trauma'' involving star striker Ronaldo, who apparently came down
ill before the clash but played because his teammates panicked when
they learned he wasn't in Zagallo's initial starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo wasn't going to play he wasn't fit to play,'' Zagallo
said in a contentious postgame news conference. ``It wasn't a ruse,
it wasn't a trick. But the players were distracted and overwhelmed
when they found out he couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think the team could overcome it, so I had to play
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo was on the field the full 90 minutes, but it didn't
help.
</P>
<P>
   With Franck Leboeuf proving an expert fill-in for suspended
sweeper Laurent Blanc, and the rest of the defense particularly
left back Bixente Lizarazu and defensive midfielder Didier
Deschamps closing off access to the French box, neither Ronaldo nor
his teammates provided much danger in what turned out to be a very
one-sided affair.
</P>
<P>
   France dictated terms from the start, and once Zidane was
through, the only mystery was what exactly was wrong with Ronaldo,
the acknowledged ``world's greatest player.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd had a nagging knee injury since the start of the Cup, but
Brazilian officials said his left ankle had forced him to seek
treatment at a hospital before the game Sunday. Then it was said he
had an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates suggested the pressure confronting him caused a
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was emotional,'' said wing-defender Roberto Carlos.
... ``At about four o'clock in the afternoon (five hours before
game time), he suddenly got ill. It was like a malaise had come
over him. It was strange.''
</P>
<P>
   How much impact it truly had is debatable. With Deschamps and
Emmanuel Petit winning nearly every 50-50 ball in midfield, and
playmaker Zidane weaving his magic, the French created myriad
chances and failed to score more primarily because of Stephane
Guivarc'h's inability to finish. Guivarc'h, who has epitomized
France's offensive struggles through the tournament, was provided a
trio of superb scoring chances, blowing all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``France dominated it completely,'' admitted Zagallo, who
Saturday said it would be a ``disaster'' if Brazil did not win.
``Through the first half, I was watching, thinking, `It's got to
end, it's got to end.' I just wanted it to stop, so I could make
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time that opportunity arrived, it was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   On the first goal, from a Petit corner kick from the right wing,
Zidane stepped into an open chunk of space at the near post about
nine yards from the net, sharply nodding the cross past goalkeeper
Claudio Taffarel and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The second was nearly identical. It came from the left, from a
Youri Djorkaeff corner kick; Zidane's header, from seven yards,
split Roberto Carlos' legs at the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to score a goal in this World Cup, and I scored two.
It's amazing,'' said Zidane, who had been indispensable for France
but hadn't found the net in the first six games. ``In the final,
too, and with my head, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very good with my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil tried to make a game of it in the second half, with
Zagallo bringing on Denilson, whose tricky ball handling sparked
several waves of attacks. Few led to anything concrete, and when
they did, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez was flawless. His best save was
on a Ronaldo blast at the right post from a Roberto Carlos throw-in
that got through the box in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Desailly's explusion in the 68th minute, after picking up his
second yellow card for a late tackle on Cafu, should have empowered
the Brazilians, but instead bolstered the French. Petit moved back
into Desailly's spot, and Patrick Vieira's appearance seven minutes
later, in place of Djorkaeff, regained France control of midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had just one more chance, a Denilson lob that kissed the
top of the crossbar, and then Petit put the finishing touches on
the victory, finishing a counterattack more than two minutes into
injury time.
</P>
<P>
   It made France the first new World Cup champion since Argentina
won in 1978, and the first host country to win since then, too. And
it rewarded an effort that, for once, had unified France, given the
country an identity that was real, that was current.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fabulous dream,'' Coach Aime Jacquet said. ``When I
think about all we've gone through, all the work done by this team.
A whole group of players has decided to make France happy.''

TOLER KEYS QUICK START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sparks got exactly what they needed Sunday: a fast start and
a solid finish.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Toler was responsible for the good beginning, scoring 16
of her career-high 22 points in the first half, and defense made
the difference in latter part of the game as the Sparks routed the
Cleveland Rockers, 87-66, before 7,032 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (4-8) exploited the Rockers' zone defense by making a
franchise-high eight of their 14 3-point attempts. Toler, a former
All-American guard from Long Beach State, made 4 of 5 from behind
the arc, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself wide open,'' said Toler, who also had a
season-high nine assists, one short of tying her career mark. ``It
was like the parting of the Red Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie had 18 points, 11 rebounds, and a career-high six
assists, while Tamecka Dixon contributed 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland was really testing us to see if we had some
shooters,'' said Sparks coach Julie Rousseau. ``We had some
wide-open gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penny Toler was aggressive tonight. She looked for he shot,
and when Cleveland went with the zone defense early in the game,
everyone stepped it up on the perimeter. Lisa adjusted to the zone
after a while also.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks never trailed since early in the first half (3-2),
and had a 42-36 advantage at the half. The Rockers (6-7) went on a
12-2 run to pull within 57-55 on basket by Michelle Edwards with
12:13 to go. But that's as close as they would get, as they Sparks
played great defense down the stretch, and outscored the Rockers,
30-11, the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks got quality production off the bench from Jamila
Wideman, who came in to score a season-high nine points and played
great defense late in the game against the Rockers' Suzie
McConnell-Serio. Another key was reserve 6-foot-3 Eugenia Rycraw,
who was matched up against against 6-5 Isabelle Fijalkowski. Rycraw
scored only four points, but had four rebounds and two blocks in 12
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``However I can contribute to the team,'' said Rycraw, a former
All-American from Cal State Fullerton. ``Tonight, it was defense,
blocking out. It was a physical game, but we practice physical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks forced the Rockers into 20 turnovers, while they
minimized their mistakes to 15. They shot 48 percent from the
field, including 57 percent from the 3-point line, and 83 percent
from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers shot 49 percent from the field on the strength of
Janice Braxton (13 points), Fijalkowski (12 points), who has been
fighting the flu, Edwards (10 points), and McConnell-Serio (nine
points). But they were scoreless after McConnell-Serio scored with
2:22 to go.
</P>
<P>
   `They picked up their defensive intensity,'' Cleveland coach
Linda Hill-MacDonald said about the Sparks. `I have to give them
credit for that, particularly in the second half which caused us to
turn the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks Notes: Pamela McGee gave an emotional spill to the fans
after the game, proclaiming, `The drought is over.'' The Sparks are
0-1 against the Phoenix Mercury (9-3), after losing 70-60 on the
road. The teams split last year. `Now we have to momentum going
into the desert tomorrow,'' Rousseau said.

PADRES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two steps forward, two steps back looks more and
more like the Dodgers' dance of doom.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first two games in their series with
first-place San Diego, they finished with a split Sunday after Ken
Caminiti hit three home runs in the Padres' 6-3 victory at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It put the Dodgers back where they started the second half, 13{
games behind the Padres in the National League West. Only now, they
have four less games, heading into a three-game series with
second-place San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are the NL wild-card leader but also have struggled
after the break, dropping three of four to Colorado. The Dodgers
trail them by 6{ games but say they are not playing for second
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important whenever you are playing teams in front of you
to do well,'' Eric Karros said. ``Even with all Caminiti did
tonight, we had some great chances to win and blew them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the first inning. They
already had scored two runs and had a chance to put away Padres
starter Joey Hamilton. Instead, they didn't score, Hamilton (7-9)
recovered and even hit a home run. Then Caminiti took over.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to three homers and five RBI, it was the ninth time
in his career that he had hit home runs from both sides of the
plate, a National League record.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the ninth, the Dodgers got two hits against the Padres
close-horse Trevor Hoffman and had the tying run at the plate. But
Matt Luke, the Dodgers' best pinch hitter, grounded into a
game-ending double play and Hoffman had his 27th save in 27
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure you want to win more after you win the first two,'' said
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who also is Trevor's brother. ``It
could have been a nice roll, but we have to think about the Giants
now. We aren't thinking about the wild card, we're just thinking
about making a move on a team we need to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost even though Tony Gwynn, the Padres' eight-time
batting champion, went 0 for 3 to extend his hitless streak to a
career-high 0 for 17. But Caminiti, the 1996 NL MVP who helped beat
the Dodgers on the final weekend of that season to the win the
West, made Gwynn's slump seem insignificant. He hit a two-run homer
in the first off left-hander Brian Bohanon, who was making his
first start as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Bohanon (2-3), acquired Friday from the Mets for
Greg McMichael, appeared to be out of trouble when he got Gwynn to
ground into a double play. But Caminiti drove a 2-1 pitch down and
away into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with that pitch,'' said Bohanon, who will stay in
the rotation for now because the Dodgers have one day off until
Aug. 10. ``It's the one I wanted to make, but he went and got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti turned around to bat left-handed against Antonio Osuna
with one out and one on in the eighth. Again he went with the pitch
and drove it into the lower left-field stands for his third of the
game and 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big day for me,'' he said. ``It feels good especially
because I've been struggling. If you try to hit three home runs,
it's not going to happen. I could get the same pitches and have
different results. Everything just fell into place and it was a big
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing wrong with Caminiti's explanation was that part
about struggling. He entered the game 19 for 41 in his past 12
games with six doubles, two homers and nine RBI. Sunday, he tied
Chili Davis for third on the list of players who have hit home runs
from both sides of the plate in one game. Eddie Murray is the
leader with 11 followed by Mickey Mantle (10).
</P>
<P>
   More important for the Padres, he helped get them back on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``After losing the first two, you have to be very satisfied with
the split,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It's important for
the psyche of the club. You have to give our guys credit.''

CORRECTS GIANTS-ROCKIES SERIES IN FOURTH GRAF 
By MATT McHALE

RED SOX CAGED AGAIN BY BIRDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ So, after being swept in a four-game series in Charm
City for the first time in 37 years, in the same year (1961) that
JFK delivered his inaugural address, the Red Sox boarded a plane
for Florida, hoping to find refuge under the roof of a St.
Petersburg dome.
</P>
<P>
   Which, it should be noted, is less drastic than jumping off the
roof of the nearest tall building.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Sunday's 11-7 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, Mo
Vaughn said he is making it his personal mission to squelch any
hint of panic in the Red Sox clubhouse. First order of business
Monday, he said, will be to call a meeting in which he very well
may be the keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ask not what your team can do for you, but what you can do for
your team?
</P>
<P>
   ``We put ourselves in a good position,'' Vaughn said, alluding
to the Sox' one brief shining moment Sunday, when they scored more
runs in the fifth inning (six) than they had in the previous three
games combined (five).
</P>
<P>
   ``We got ahead,'' said Vaughn, whose two-run home run followed a
two-run double by Darren Lewis and a two-run single by Nomar
Garciaparra to give the Sox a 6-4 lead. ``We wanted to settle the
whole thing down, but it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles worked out against Korean rookie Jin Ho Cho and a
cast of scatter-shooting Sox relievers, seizing the lead back in
the bottom of the fifth with four runs and taking advantage of
eight Red Sox walks and a wild pitch to pull away in the only game
in this set that wasn't decided by a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got to regroup,'' Vaughn said. ``We're gonna sit
down in the clubhouse and maybe have a little talk.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Hong-Koo Lee, South Korea's ambassador to the
US who thought it important enough to come up from Washington to
see native son Cho make his second start for the Red Sox, the less
said about this one, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid from Jun Ju City gave the ambassador something to brag
about at his next Beltway cocktail party when he struck out the
first two batters he faced, Robbie Alomar and Brady Anderson, and
set down six in a row. But Cal Ripken, like most of the other
Orioles as foreign to Cho as the room service menu in the team's
hotel, opened the third with a single, Chris Hoiles followed with a
surprise bunt single, and Cho was suddenly as vulnerable as any kid
who walked off a college campus one day to find himself in the big
leagues three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis made a terrific running grab of Mike Bordick's bid for
extra bases for one out, and Alomar was caught looking again at a
third strike. But Anderson walked to load the bases, and Eric Davis
followed with a grand slam that ripped Lewis's glove off his hand
as he tried to make the catch at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the ball hit my glove, but it was over the fence so
I couldn't see it,'' Lewis said. ``My shoulder hit the wall, and it
just jammed my glove off. But I did feel the ball hit my glove.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after the slam, Cho was three outs from qualifying for
his first major league win when the Red Sox put their six spot up
against starter Doug Drabek and reliever Norm Charlton, who threw
the hanging slider that Vaughn hit over the Mason-Dixon line to
make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams sensed trouble, however, as soon as
Bordick drew a walk in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball wasn't coming out of his hand the same way,''
Williams said. ``Our long inning might have had something to do
with it. I asked the umpire if Cho could throw a few extra warmups,
which he did, but I don't think he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar doubled, Anderson singled off the glove of diving rookie
second baseman Donnie Sadler to score Bordick, and Davis accounted
for his fifth RBI with a sacrifice fly. That tied the score, and by
the time Ron Mahay was done with his three batters, the Orioles led
for good, as Mahay went walk, intentional walk, and two-run single
by B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relievers didn't throw a lot of strikes,'' Williams said
dryly. ``You get behind in the counts, the walks hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles added a run off Derek Lowe in the seventh on three
singles and a sacrifice fly by Hoiles, and touched up Dario Veras
for two more in the eighth. Boston's only scoring outside the fifth
came on Vaughn's RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's on to a two-game set with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
the bottom-feeding expansion team that has lost 10 in a row after
being swept by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Lost weekend? ``We move on and we're gonna play the schedule and
go to Tampa,'' said Williams. ``We can't look back. We've got to
look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   And wait for Mr. Vaughn to take the floor.

   Then, 80 laps into Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300, Burton made his
move. Gordon gave him just a little bit of room and Burton roared
past and pulled way.
</P>
<P>
   And that was that. End of race.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were still 220 laps to go before Burton crossed the
finish line in his No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford ahead of Mark Martin
and Gordon and Rusty Wallace and collected his first victory of the
season and the $128,575 that went with it. It was a couple of hours
before he dusted them all by 7.439 seconds that might as well have
been 7 1/2 minutes and picked up first-place points in the race for
a season championship.
</P>
<P>
   But when Burton blew past Gordon _ barring a crash, a flat tire
or some other serious misfortune _ it was only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Martin knew it. Wallace knew it. Chances are everyone in the
field and most of the 90,000 auto racing fans in the stands and
suites and infield knew it.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin and Wallace and others talked about what they could
have done to improve their stock in the race, they usually didn't
even bother to think about catching Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Burton was in his own field,'' Wallace said. ``He whipped
everyone's butt. He smoked 'em. No doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin: ``We had a good day, we're chasing points. We just
couldn't beat Jeff. The last set of tires was loose and I just did
what I could with them. I saved 'em because I knew we couldn't race
with the 99.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton became the first driver to win back-to-back Jiffy Lube
300s, doubling up on his win here last July. He won with an average
speed of 102.996 miles per hour in a race slowed by six caution
flags covering 40 laps.
</P>
<P>
   He led the last 84 laps and 191 total and only lent out the lead
a couple of times when he went in for pit stops. Being dominant
felt great.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say it that often, but today, boy, things just went
right,'' Burton said. ``Four laps out of that last pit stop (with
about 90 laps to go), when we put on four tires, it was like we've
got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stoddard, the crew chief, and Buddy Parrott, the manager
for the Jack Roush-owned team, followed along on the radio from the
pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy and I kept prodding him to just be smart,'' Stoddard
said. ``I thought the computer was broken. He kept running lap
after lap after lap at the same speed. That was an impressive
performance by Jeff Burton. He's a super smooth race car driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton returned the compliment. He praised the work of Stoddard
and Parrott. He noted how he enjoys working for Roush, whose
expectations for the team are high.
</P>
<P>
   This was a win born of those high goals. A win born of what
might have been a season-saving race at California in early May,
with what might have been a weekend-turning assist to John Andretti
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton won three races last year and finished fourth in the
points and much was expected of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The team went to California a furstrating 16th in points and was
10th in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly,'' Burton said. ``What we did in California was
disgusting. It was well below expectations of what we want for
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday morning and the gathering
went long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our heads back together,'' Burton said. ``Jack didn't
panic. Frank didn't panic. Buddy didn't panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton finished fifth or better in the next five races before
handling problems left him 39th at Sonoma coming here. He climbed
from 16th to eighth in points.
</P>
<P>
   They came here and thought they were running pretty well in
practice Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then John Andretti came up behind us and passed us,'' Burton
said. ``Frank and I got together and decided we had some work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   They made some changes before and during the race.
</P>
<P>
   Their race started inauspiciously with Burton missing a gear on
the first lap and then tangling a little with Kyle Petty and
bumping with him down the backstretch. It ended gloriously.
</P>
<P>
   Burton stayed in eighth place in the points race, but solidified
his hold on the spot. Gordon held onto first and Martin and Dale
Jarrett slipped past Jeremy Mayfield _ who lost his brakes and hit
the wall with six laps left _ into second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace strengthened his hold on fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real happy with the race,'' he said. ``We gained some
points and that's what it's all about right now. We're trying to
win a championship. We're working at it.''

MARINERSS GET THAT SINKING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-MARINERS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By Ronald Tillery  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners are trying their best to hang on. By the
looks on their faces, though, the strain of riding high one day and
low the next is killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Some days the Mariners look vastly better than a team with a
39-53 record. Then there are days like Sunday, when they suffered
an 8-5 loss to the Anaheim Angels before 32,797 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the M's do these days, they can't escape that
sinking feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't (help) as far as the standings, but we're starting
to play better baseball,'' said Ken Griffey Jr., who went 2-for-3
and stole a base but did not hit a home run. ``That could lead to
turning the season around. We've got to do everything we can.
There's not one guy in this locker room who likes the position
we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had hoped to win their four-game series with
Anaheim before starting a two-game series with the Texas Rangers
Monday night. However, Sunday's loss earned them only a split. Even
though the defense is markedly better and the team's pitching has
stabilized, the Mariners are no better off than they were five days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   They stand 13{ games behind first-place Anaheim and 13 games
behind Texas in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Mariners realize that the later it gets in the
summer, the ``chances of making up that ground are not very good,''
said first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hole we're in (right now) is not insurmountable,'' Segui
said. ``We're very capable of (climbing into the race). We just
have to do it. That second game ... if we win that game, we've got
some momentum. Everything would have been different _ especially
after Randy (Johnson) came out and dominated (last Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson put the M's in position to win the series with a
15-strikeout performance. The M's won 2-0. However, they lost 5-3
on Friday night after coming back to tie the game and force extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   That game served as another example of how the M's are running
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're behind, a split doesn't do you very much,'' M's
manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey sat at his locker Sunday, clearly dejected by the
situation. He is left to ponder what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can do is go out and play,'' Griffey said.
``I can't call a meeting and just say `You guys are (terrible).'''
</P>
<P>
   M's starter Bill Swift (8-5) lost his first decision since June
16. Despite yielding seven earned runs, he suffered through just
one horrendous inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim sent eight batters to the plate in the second and scored
five runs on four hits. The most damaging blow came when Dave
Hollins sent a 1-0 fastball into the bleachers in right-center
field for a 3-run homer and a 6-1 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Mariners nibbled away at the deficit. Rico Rossy
led off the third inning with a double and came around to score on
Alex Rodriguez's sacrifice fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners made the score 6-3 in the fourth when Dan Wilson
blasted his sixth home run to straightaway center.
</P>
<P>
   Swift allowed the Angels to manufacture a run on two hits in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I thought I was throwing hard,'' Swift said. ``I
made the one bad pitch to Hollins and it turned out to be the
game-winning runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner got the Mariners within 7-4 with his fifth homer of
the season in the M's half of the sixth. Then, second baseman Joey
Cora flexed his muscles in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Cora belted his fourth homer off reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa
with one out, and the Mariners trailed 7-5. The Mariners scored
four runs off Anaheim winner Jason Dickson (9-6), who was chased in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Swift lasted six innings before yielding to relievers Paul
Spoljaric and Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swifty hadn't been out in a while. He was up with the ball
early, but he pitched well in the middle innings,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will send Ken Cloude to the mound Monday night
against the Rangers, who will counter with Todd Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing better,'' Piniella said. ``We need to get on a
roll, though. We need to put together a little streak and go from
there.''

`MR. SNAPPER' PERPLEXED BY MR. SNAPPY

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No fences were mended Sunday. There was no clubhouse
group hug, despite Ken Griffey Jr.'s playful but earnest request:
``Can't we all just get along?''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after their clubhouse scuffle, David Segui and Randy
Johnson still are not talking _ so forget the theory that Friday's
pre-game shoving match between the two Mariner stars released all
kinds of pent-up tension, especially for Johnson, who has been
riding a roller-coaster of emotion all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's created more tension,'' said Segui, himself
a highly charged sort of individual prone to his own fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I'm a snapper,'' Segui said recently. ``I've never
broke any body parts, but there are guys I really admire. Paul
O'Neill. He's a good snapper. My favorite was Kirk Gibson, I loved
the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scuffle, Segui missed Saturday's game _ which
Johnson won in Cy Young, 15-strikeout, shutout fashion. Segui
sprained his wrist, he said while lifting Johnson away from him and
sending the 6-foot-10 lefty into Segui's locker.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Segui spent the morning getting treatment on his sore
wrist. He then talked his way back into the lineup after manager
Lou Piniella had left him out, thinking another day off was in
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I mad? Hell, yeah, I'm pissed,'' Segui said, adding that
Johnson has not offered an explanation or apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't make a difference anyway,'' said Segui, who denies
saying or doing anything to provoke Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson has another side to the story, we won't hear it.
Johnson has refused all media interviews since mid-June, when the
Mariners pulled out of a deal that would have sent him to the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Segui envisioned about playing for the Mariners before
he signed his free-agent deal last winter, some of the luster and
wonder has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   Segui has had an All-Star-quality season. He leads all AL first
basemen in fielding percentage, carries one of the best batting
averages and RBI-to-at-bat ratios, too. But the season has twisted
into a knot of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been done,'' Segui said once about players-only meetings
that attempted to clear the air and create momentum for win
streaks. ``We're not going to talk about it, but it's something you
take care of in the clubhouse. You don't talk about it in the
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The altercation with Johnson is just the latest and most
publicized bit in a season marked by an enormous sense of under
achievement. And it is the thing that has raised questions about
just where the fire and leadership is coming from inside the
Mariner clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Griffey tried to respond to this issue. Sunday, Griffey
made an emphatic point that he tries to lead by example on the
field. He is adamant that as the most talented player, he feels
awkward demanding that his teammates turn it up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Griffey did intervene in the Johnson-Segui clash,
separating the two men, who still haven't resolved the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand the whole situation,'' Segui said
about the tiff with Johnson. ``If you want to fight, let me know
and we'll go somewhere and fight. But to just walk up and shove me.
I've always had quite a bit of respect for him. I understand his
frustration, in general about the season, but otherwise . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Although Segui denied that his wrist bothered him during the
game, the M's 8-5 loss to the Angels sorely lacked Segui's usual
productivity. Segui went 0-for-4, ending three innings (two fly
balls and one strikeout) that left five Mariner runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Segui's wrist didn't hurt him Sunday, the price of any
clubhouse burst of emotion is too high right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who split the series with the Angels, wanted to
win at least three of the four games. This is crunch time. This is
about reclaiming some measure respectability and the Mariners have
barely a week or so to demonstrate some whiff of contending in the
AL West. It is no time for a breakdown or a flare-up, especially
between any of the team's best players.
</P>
<P>
   Segui said Johnson was one of the reasons he wanted to play for
the Mariners, since Johnson has been all but a guaranteed win to
this team in years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this guy has done a lot for this franchise,'' Segui
said. ``He took this ballclub somewhere it never went before. I
respect his stance on that. And I always felt I wanted to play
extra hard when he's pitching. ... I wanted him to have a great
year and show the organization that by not signing him they made a
big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's win on Saturday only proved what Segui has known all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Randy Johnson I remember. All that talk about him
losing his stuff. That's all a bunch of bullcrap. I just think it's
the situation. He's letting it affect his play,'' Segui said,
adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can step up. He's the kind of guy a lot of guys
look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of '98, emotions have been at a slow boil for
the Mariners. Now, the heat is on and there are two ways for the
M's to handle it: Fighting each other or fighting together. Only
one of the ways does justice to the level of talent in that
clubhouse.

IT'S BECOMING A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Think things are bad in Brazil today? There's
another country with a flag at half mast.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart, you citizens of Brazil. Red Sox Nation shares your
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing truly equates with losing the World Cup final, but the
followers of the Red Sox are frustrated and nervous.
</P>
<P>
   And now Mo Vaughn has called for a team meeting to stop the
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Lost Weekend ended the only way it could end Sunday _
with another loss to the Orioles, this time by a count of 11-7. Sox
watchers now must deal with the fact that the purportedly
playoff-bound Townies have come out of the All-Star break with four
straight losses. It was Boston's first four-game sweep in Crabtown
since July 25-27, 1961. That would be Carl Yastrzemski's rookie
year, when Jim Gentile was Lord of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a team that did not need a break, it was the
pre-All-Star Game Red Sox. The Sons of Jimy Williams were rolling
before the midsummer stoppage, and Vaughn says he'll address the
team before Monday night's game in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna sit down in the clubhouse and maybe have a little
talk,'' said the first baseman. ``We've got to put it all together
and get one win and take it from there. The main thing is not to
panic.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Vaughn's All-Star break contract news (he turned down
$37 million over four years) will be cited as the start of this
slide. When Vaughn was asked if he thought he'd get blamed for the
slump, he said, ``I really don't know how to answer that question.
I don't think anyone who's out there working, playing nine innings,
is thinking about my contract situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some hope Sunday might be the day the Sox turned it
around. They had Korean righthander Jin Ho Cho making his second
major league start. Cho's birthday is Aug. 16 _ the same date that
Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley died.
</P>
<P>
   The stars were improperly aligned. It's always a bad sign when
your center fielder loses his glove over the fence trying to snatch
an opponent's grand slam (see Darren Lewis).
</P>
<P>
   The Sox locker room had an international flavor after the game
as an interpreter translated Cho's remarks. We should have asked
for the Korean word for ``panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Vaughn was auditioning for the Orioles for next
season, he couldn't have had a better series. Sunday he hit his 23d
homer, an opposite-field double, and an RBI single. Mo's homer was
his 13th at Camden Yards, more than any opposing player except
Albert Belle, who also has 13.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has family in Baltimore, you know. And Orioles first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro is in the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but back to the business of preserving a wild-card spot. The
Sox will send Steve Avery to the hill Monday night against the
immortal Julio Santana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move on and we're gonna play the schedule and go to
Tampa,'' said Williams, the Sox' cliche-driven manager. ``Good
things will happen. We can't look back. We've got to look ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   And like they say, Jimy, you can lead a horse to water, but you
can't make him drink. And only time will tell. Stay tuned. That's
life. Play 'em one at a time (yeesh, it's kind of exhausting trying
to talk like Jimy).
</P>
<P>
   The inimitable Jim Corsi, a Newton guy, advises Sox fans to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had one bad game here,'' said Corsi. ``In three games
we had good pitching and we'll go as far as our pitching takes us.
It could be worse. We could be 10 games under .500. We've lost four
in a row before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' added Darren Bragg. ``No one said we were
gonna run away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monday night Vaughn will try to calm everybody down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through this situation,'' said the slugger. ``I
just want to make sure everybody goes out and plays and does their
job. You can't play with pressure. I don't know if that's the
attitude, but you've got to make sure that we have the right
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox lost six in a row in May and bounced back with a pair of
wins against the Yankees. Now they've got two games in Tampa to get
straightened out before they come home to the place where regional
baseball panic was invented.

FIX WASN'T IN FOR UNLUCKY CRAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
 LUBE 300-CRAVEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Ricky Craven had the pole position when the Jiffy
Lube 300 started at New Hampshire International Speedway Sunday,
but he knew there were problems early on with his Chevrolet when
oil leaked to the back of the car.
</P>
<P>
   He led for the first 13 laps before giving way to Jeff Gordon,
who was beside Craven at the race's start. Craven, who was born in
Newburgh, Maine, and has homes in Greenville, Maine, and Concord,
N.C., then dropped steadily. When the race was over, the
32-year-old placed 29th in going 295 of the 300 laps, worth
$46,950.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much knew by looking at the tire wear that it was
going to be a long day,'' said Craven, who never has won a Winston
Cup race but qualified for the pole with a lap of 128.394 miles per
hour. ``We weren't going to fix it under caution. We're going to
have to rebuild the car.''
</P>
<P>
   First there was the oil leak, then trouble with the right rear
tire, and then the right suspension became faulty. ``It's something
that we had to live with,'' Craven said. ``It couldn't be fixed, so
we lost a lap in the pits (on laps 131 and 132). There was more
testing than racing. We battled some problems the first 25 laps on.
It was an education and we learned a lot. You can't rebuild a race
car on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven said the troubles could not have been predicted. ``It's
just a day where we had our struggles, but in the scheme of things
it wasn't bad,'' he said. ``Cars run like (his did Sunday), and
that's as hard as it gets. It's just another example of how
difficult this is.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Craven's first race in 3 1/2 months; he had been
suffering from post-concussion syndrome, the illness building up
over time. He said he felt fine Sunday, with the temperature on the
cool side for racers, at 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were really hot, it would have been an issue, but I feel
great, I really do,'' said Craven, who picked up $5,000 for winning
the pole. ``There's no question, though, that I'm a bit rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't had many races with Tony Furr, his crew chief, just
five since Furr came over from the Cale Yarborough team last year.
``It's never predictable, but there's still a period of
transition,'' Craven said. ``It takes time to get used to each
other, to determine what we exactly need.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday was outstanding, however. On that day he gained the pole,
his third in 98 career starts. ``I had a wonderful weekend. I had
fun,'' Craven said. ``In some respects, Friday was the highlight of
my career because of how difficult it has been the last 3 1/2
months and how quickly things turned around in my first day back in
a Bud car. It was a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been about poles and wins, and we got a pole, but
we sure didn't have a good day (Sunday). But that comes with the
business. I'll guarantee there'll be some other days like this. You
never ever prepare for them. I was disappointed in the day, but we
have a pretty good understanding of where we're at and why we
didn't run that well. Then again, we shouldn't be judged by one
race.''

   Craven's next race in New Hampshire is Aug. 30, the New
Hampshire 300. He hopes not only to gain the pole, but earn the
checkered flag as well. ``I know what I'm going to say when I get
to Victory Lane,'' Craven said. ``I'm just going to have to save
it.''

PAES WINS FIRST PRO TITLE

 CLASSIC-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Once again the Newport Casino is Indian country,
and the new chief is Leander Paes.
</P>
<P>
   That's Indian as in sub-continent, from which the whirring
Calcutta Clipper, 25-year-old Paes, took off 15 years ago. Sunday,
on a grass runway, he finally landed at a long-sought destination:
a professional tennis championship. He was doubly delighted to take
the crown thrice worn by countryman Vijay Amritraj, the event's
most prolific champ (1976, '80, '84).
</P>
<P>
   In a sunny, sea breeze-tormented struggle of have-nots, Paes
became a have at last, in his 52d tournament start. He won the Hall
of Fame Championship over the tourney's escape artist, goateed
South African 23-year-old Neville Godwin, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man had graced a final before, and Godwin, ranked No.
170, was worn and shaky after coming through three successive
three-setters. He had squelched a match point against American
Justin Gimelstob in the quarters and next removed top-seeded Aussie
Jason Stoltenberg in a third set tie-breaker. But Paes was
escape-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Lone American among three Aussies, Doug Flach of Atlanta,
grabbed the doubles in the company of Sandon Stolle, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6
(7-5), over Scotty Draper and Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of nervous, my first final,'' said Godwin. He
double-faulted eight times, volleyed erratically, and was ever
apprehensive of the swift patter of Paes's net-rushing sneaker
steps. Since chip-and-charge is Paes's curry and chutney, Godwin
knew that if he didn't serve well Paes would be at his throat. He
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Paes, a semifinalist the last two years, losing to the champs
Nick Perreira and Sargis Sargsian, had strong approval from the
gallery of 3,398 in his fourth visit to the Casino. His appealing
smile and demeanor, blended with a daring nature, have won him
friends across the world and charmed Atlantans as he seized an
Olympic bronze in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Victory lifted him from No. 120 to 103 in the world rankings.
``It had an extra benefit that I really wanted _ entry into the US
Open without having to qualify,'' Paes exulted. He also hopes it
will get him a wild card for the MFS Pro Championships Aug. 24-30
in Boston. His smarts and volleying have carried him much higher in
the other precinct, doubles, where his status is No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Paes, a compact 5 feet 10 inches, mixed foot speed with offspeed
backhand returns, crisp volleys, and forceful forehand passers to
keep the shorter Godwin reaching. Paes lost serve to 1-2, broke
back immediately and again to 4-2, ducked two breakers to 5-2, and
cruised.
</P>
<P>
   He thought back to his very first title, 1983 in Hong Kong.
``First time I left India. I was 10 and won the Rice Bowl
12-and-unders. The trophy, which I value, was a silver pendant, an
angel. A long way from that title to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An angel, he said, may have been on his shoulder _ where he
landed _ in diving for a winning volley against David Dilucia (3-6,
6-3, 6-4) in the first round. ``I was down a set and a break point.
If I hadn't saved it with that volley, I'd have probably been
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   What a kick the day was for Paes, who wears a miniature silver
soccer shoe in his left ear, a good luck gift from India's national
captain Dai Chung Bhutia. He has done better than they, losing
early in World Cup qualifying to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As a recognized name and face at home, one of his country's few
internationally prominent athletes, Paes was awakened much earlier
Sunday than he would have wished by phone calls from eight national
newspapers. ``I asked them to please let me sleep, and call after
the match. I'd try to have good news.''
</P>
<P>
   He had the best possible news _ that the
green-white-and-orange-striped flag amid those atop the Casino
seemed to be fluttering at its proudest because Newport was again
Indian country.

Tech let WR play 
in spite of memo
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readmittance violated rules, said NCAA
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Texas Tech administrators allowed receiver Malcolm McKenzie to stay
on the field even after they were made aware of an internal NCAA
memorandum asserting he was readmitted to the university in 1995 in
violation of NCAA rules, newly released documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Tech administrators were made aware of the memo, written by a
senior official in the NCAA's membership services department, a
matter of weeks before the Red Raiders played Iowa in the Alamo
Bowl on Dec. 29, 1996, the documents show. Despite the memo, Tech
allowed McKenzie, then a junior, to play in the game. The memo also
did not dissuade the university from letting McKenzie play last
season, when he caught 42 passes for 462 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's eligibility is perhaps the most contentious issue
under review by the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions in its
deliberations regarding alleged impropriety within the Tech
athletic program. The committee heard the Tech case April 24 and 25
in Cleveland. Tech officials expect a decision to be announced
before the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has imposed a variety of penalties on its athletic program,
including three years' probation and scholarship cuts in six
sports, but the committee could decide additional sanctions are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Tech chancellor John Montford, interviewed last week, said he
and others at the university were aware of the NCAA memo regarding
McKenzie at the time it was written but did not believe they were
bound to act as a result of it. Tech should not be viewed as having
acted irresponsibly, he said, because the memo was not an official
interpretation by the membership services staff and because the
university believed strongly that no violations occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you there may have been wrong decisions made at the
time, but I believe they were good-faith decisions based on
evidence and advice of counsel,'' Montford said. ``I don't think
there was any flagrant disregard of a memo or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo was included in the case summary prepared by the NCAA
enforcement staff prior to the hearing in Cleveland. Such a summary
is used to lay out the issues involved in a case and highlight the
areas in which the enforcement staff and the school under scrutiny
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement staff included the memo in the case summary to
buttress its argument that NCAA rules were broken when McKenzie was
readmitted to Tech in the fall of 1995 and that the university
failed to properly deal with the matter when it came to light later
that year.
</P>
<P>
   The case summary was provided to the Chronicle by Tech on June
23 as a result of a request for the document under the Texas Open
Records Act that was made April 16. Names of current and former
student-athletes were deleted from the copy provided to the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of official inquiry submitted to Tech last October,
the NCAA enforcement staff described 18 areas of alleged
wrongdoing. The letter included two matters developed largely
through Tech audits _ widespread mistakes in eligibility
certification and calculating financial aid _ and 16 stemming from
a lengthy investigation by enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The university's response, made public April 14, showed Tech
agreed with all or portions of 10 of the enforcement staff's
assertions, including the charge tying former Raiders assistant
coach Rhudy Maskew to academic fraud involving defensive lineman
Stephen Gaines and the contention that Tech lacked institutional
control in the operation of its athletic program. The charge
relating to the McKenzie matter is among those disputed by Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's view of Tech's actions in the McKenzie matter
could be crucial to whether the university receives additional
penalties. Committee decisions typically are harsher when schools
are found to have been lax in dealing with potential rules
violations. Acting contrary to a memo from a representative of the
NCAA's membership services staff could be a factor in such a
decision, according to several administrators involved in NCAA
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Membership services, until recently known as legislative
services, is the branch of the NCAA that interprets the
association's complex set of rules. Some rules interpretations are
official staff opinions and meant to be binding. Others are
unofficial, intended only to serve as guidelines for those who
request them.
</P>
<P>
   The McKenzie memo was written by Steve Mallonee, an NCAA
director of membership services, and dated Dec. 16, 1996, 13 days
before the Alamo Bowl. It was directed to Dirk Taitt, the NCAA
enforcement director who has overseen the Tech investigation. Taitt
requested the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The case summary includes portions of the transcript from an
NCAA interview with Tech faculty athletic representative Robert
Sweazy on Jan. 29, 1997, in which the memo was discussed by Sweazy,
Taitt and Mike Glazier, Tech's lead attorney. During the interview,
Taitt acknowledged he had provided the memo to Glazier. He said he
believed the memo, while not intended to put Tech ``on notice,''
might help ``folks deal with the matters that we've all been
reviewing for some time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Sweazy: ``We certainly disagree with Steve's
assessment of the situation, and if that's what the enforcement
staff is going to come forward with, we will disagree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallonee's memo took the same view of the McKenzie matter that
NCAA enforcement personnel would take 10 months later in the letter
of official inquiry _ that Tech's handling of the situation
violated a variety of NCAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, placed on scholastic suspension by Tech in the spring
of 1995, was readmitted to the university that fall as a result of
an A for a summer American History course at San Antonio College
when he had earned a B. Because he had failed American History
during the first summer session, the A enabled him to complete the
summer with a 2.0 grade-point average, the minimum necessary for
his readmission to Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Thomas M. Settles, agreed to give the A based on
an arrangement in which McKenzie would do extra-credit work during
the fall. A Raiders assistant coach, David Moody, was aware of the
plan and helped facilitate it.
</P>
<P>
   When McKenzie did not complete the assignment, Settles rescinded
the grade and sent a letter to the Tech registrar's office in
December 1995 detailing the situation and stating his belief that
he had been ``conned'' by McKenzie and the Tech coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sweazy and other Tech athletic administrators were aware of
Settles' letter before the Raiders played Air Force in that year's
Copper Bowl, but a review of the situation by Sweazy led him to
conclude there was nothing about it that should keep McKenzie from
playing in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tech withheld McKenzie from the first game of the 1996 season
but allowed him to return the following week. He continued his
career without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA alleges that McKenzie's A in American History
constituted special treatment based on his athletic reputation and
that Tech failed to follow its readmission policy in allowing his
return to the university based on a grade he had yet to earn.
Further, Tech stands accused of compounding the matter by failing
to act when confronted with evidence of possible infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Montford last week declined to discuss specific student-athletes
involved in the infractions case but spoke in general terms about
Tech's response to the Mallonee memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, that was not intended for us, and I'm not sure
we were supposed to receive it,'' he said. ``But when we did
receive it, it was reported to me that Sweazy or one of our
representatives talked to Taitt about it and that he indicated the
memo was not meant for us and we were not obligated to adhere to
it. I think I had that discussion with Glazier, as best I can tell
from my notes, and, based on the advice of counsel, we decided to
go ahead and allow the player to play because we felt like our
position was correct all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Montford said the issue was revisited last summer by Glazier and
Bob Burton, who became Tech's associate athletic director for
compliance in August 1997 and has since taken a job in the
University of Nebraska athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I have confidence in Burton and the
recommendation he and Glazier made,'' Montford said. ``I think Bob
went through that program like Roto-Rooter. I believe he made some
calls that were unpopular and against the grain. We supported him
all the way. This call was no different. We stuck with our position
based on his decision and the advice of our hired attorney.''

PRIME MINISTER RESIGNS AFTER GOVERNING PARY IS DEFEATED IN
ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating 1st 11 grafs with Hashimoto's resignation)   (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned on Monday
afternoon after voters gave Japan's governing party a brutal
drubbing in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials in the Liberal Democratic Party are
jockeying to succeed Hashimoto, and a decision is expected in the
coming days to reassure the unsettled financial markets throughout
Asia. But whoever takes over, the transition is sure to create new
uncertainties about Japan's political and economic course.
</P>
<P>
   A grim Hashimoto told Japanese television earlier, as the dismal
election results rolled in: ``The results are attributable to my
lack of ability. We could not live up to the people's expectations,
and it is all my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While the voters were apparently punishing the confusion and
lack of decisiveness in the government as it faces Japan's worst
economic crisis in more than half a century, the election result
may create more disarray than ever in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who will lead the country _ whose economy is second
only to that of the United States in size _ as it tries to
extricate itself from recession, or what will happen to Japan's
recently announced plans to deal with its mountain of bad loans
held by banks.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be harder than ever for the Liberal Democrats to
govern Japan and push economic legislation through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of the main contenders within the party for the prime
minister's job are the kind of new and dynamic leader that many
Japanese say they want, and that the United States and other
countries fervently desire. There is even some risk that the job
will go from a man who exhibited little leadership to a rival who
has shown none.
</P>
<P>
   In an early verdict on the result, currency traders sent the yen
plunging in trading against the dollar on Monday morning. Japanese
stocks also tumbled initially, though they rebounded by midday and
the currency recovered somewhat. Stocks in other Asian markets
fell.
</P>
<P>
   The markets would have tumbled more if it were not for the
possibility that the election shock may force the Liberal Democrats
_ who have changed policy in the past in reaction to electoral
defeat _ to become more aggressive in tackling the nation's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   There may now be more possibility of tax cuts and of another
economic stimulus package, although it is not clear that there will
be any push for the kind of market-oriented reorganization that
many economists urge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the elections were for the upper house of Parliament, not
the more important lower house, they did not directly affect
Hashimoto's post as prime minister or his party's lock on power.
But he billed the vote as a referendum on his leadership, and the
party won only 44 of the 126 seats up for election.
</P>
<P>
   The 44 seats won by the Liberal Democrats were still far more
than the 27 seats won by the leading opposition group, the
Democratic Party, but far less than the 61 seats that the Liberal
Democrats held going into the election.
</P>
<P>
   Other seats were won by the Communists, who did exceptionally
well as a winner of protest votes, and by independents and other
groups in Japan's deeply fragmented opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval comes at an odd time in the Japanese political
world, when the country is neither the one-party state it used to
be nor a Western-style system where parties go in and out of power.
The Liberal Democrats traditionally ran the country with only token
opposition, but they were evicted from power in 1993 after a poor
election performance and a series of defections by members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many thought that old-style Japanese politics were
gone forever, but a year later, the Liberal Democrats clawed their
way back to power as part of a coalition. Then Hashimoto took over
as prime minister in January 1996 and led the Liberal Democrats in
a long slog in which they managed to regain majority control of the
lower house of parliament, so that five years later the situation
is much as it was before _ but with much less sense of expectation
that the political system can be a vehicle for far-reaching change
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's vote was an unambiguous rebuke of the Liberal
Democrats, it is less clear whether it was a vote in favor of
anything. By most accounts, the voters were simply annoyed by the
Liberal Democrats' lack of strong leadership at a time of national
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason is the lack of economic recovery,'' Taku
Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic leader, told NHK Television.
Yamasaki said that the top party officials, including Hashimoto and
himself, should resign, but he added that he worries about the
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if something happens like the collapse of a financial
institution while our financial restructuring scheme is still
unfinished?'' Yamasaki mused. ``I'm very worried about the power
vacuum created by this election result.''

 TOKYO: election result.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hashimoto had planned to go to Washington for a state visit
later this month, but that will almost certainly be called off or
postponed until a new leader is in place. The Liberal Democrats
will be under strong pressure to act within a week to choose a
replacement, and probably to summon parliament into session so a
new person can formally take the prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders are Keizo Obuchi, the foreign minister and
leader of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party;
Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran politician who was the chief Cabinet
spokesman for a time under Hashimoto; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former
prime minister; and Yohei Kono, who had been the Liberal Democratic
leader until he resigned to make way for Hashimoto. Whoever takes
over, fundamental changes are not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP has a firm lock on power in the lower house, and
that's not going to change,'' said John Neuffer, an analyst of
Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo,
speaking of the Liberal Democratic Party. ``Hashimoto was being
pulled around by his nose by party elders, and whoever is in there
is going to continue party-established policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer said that while financial markets will be jittery, the
humiliation may encourage the Liberal Democrats to become more
aggressive in tackling bad debt problems, cutting taxes and
approving a new economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, I think this is good for the nation and the
world, but in the short term I think everybody's going to be
nervous,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   One important winner was the Democratic Party, which
consolidated its role as the leading opposition force. While the
party is a poorly organized and newly formed coalition of various
factions, it shows hints that it may eventually emerge as a
Western-style opposition force, distinguishing itself from the
governing party on issues and seen by voters as a credible
alternative force.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is led by Naoto Kan, who opinion polls
suggest is by far Japan's most popular politician. Kan, who made
his name as a Cabinet minister crusading against the bureaucracy,
will now push to build his party's organization so it can wrest
power from the Liberal Democrats in general elections that must be
held by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously that the new-born Democratic Party
has been given a chance by the people,'' a jubilant Kan told
reporters at his party headquarters. ``People said no to what the
Liberal Democratic Party has done. They realized that the Liberal
Democratic Party cannot reform, is totally bound by special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected the bureaucracy-led government,'' Kan added,
calling for early elections for the lower house as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Ozawa, who once was the main opposition leader but now
heads only a small opposition party, said, ``I think lower house
elections are inevitable.'' The Liberal Democrats may see things
differently, however, since they would almost certainly lose ground
in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   With the election, Hashimoto becomes the latest in a series of
politicians who entered the prime minister's residence strong and
self-confident but left ignominiously with their reputations in
tatters. When Hashimoto took office, he was welcomed
enthusiastically as a dynamic leader who was an expert on policy
issues. He was thought to offer a sharp contrast to his
predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, a grandfatherly socialist who was
widely viewed as extremely nice and extremely lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto initially did indeed exhibit leadership and
decisiveness, but in retrospect he chose to exercise it in the
wrong way: He pushed through an increase in the national sales tax
from 3 percent to 5 percent. It was a bold and politically
courageous attempt to put Japan's finances on a better footing, but
it turned out to be economically catastrophic, tipping the nation
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hashimoto proved much less firm in tackling the
recession. He eventually pushed through a large stimulus package,
but it took so long to put it into place that the economy tumbled
in the meantime and further endangered the country's weak banks.

NO OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO HASHIMOTO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf to update with Hashimoto's resignation) (With JAPAN-eLECTION) 
(lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may have angered his
own citizens and the rest of the world with his reluctance to
tackle Japan's economic problems, but if he seems lackluster, the
alternatives could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hashimoto has resigned after his party's dismal
performance in parliamentary elections on Sunday, the leading
candidate to replace him is Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi. Obuchi
has never been tainted by scandal and has generally avoided
missteps, but analysts describe him as someone who could make
Hashimoto seem dynamic by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and many Asian countries are desperately
hoping that a fresh face will emerge _ someone who will take charge
of the government and begin tough steps to revive the economy, no
one in Japan seems to see such a person in the wings. Obuchi
certainly does not fit that description, for even in a country that
has specialized in faceless leaders, Obuchi has had a career that
has not been memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi has all the pizazz of a cold pizza,'' said John F.
Neuffer, a specialist in Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine
Research Institute in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be calling the shots,'' Neuffer added of Obuchi,
if he were to become Prime Minister. ``He'd simply be a puppet for
the party elders.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also true to some extent of Hashimoto and other
candidates who might replace him, but even by comparison to his
peers, Obuchi seems unusually colorless and malleable. He is
relatively little known in Japan and has never been associated with
major policy initiatives _ and it is unclear what he stands for.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi helped carry out some of Hashimoto's diplomatic
initiatives, such as warmer ties with Russia, Obuchi has been
largely a figurehead who made few decisions himself. Diplomats say
that he generally allowed the career bureaucrats in the Foreign
Ministry to make the crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Obuchi serving as prime minister raises some
intriguing questions about the Japanese political system. Polls
indicate that people want leadership, but the governing party may
replace a prime minister who has exhibited little leadership with a
Cabinet minister who has demonstrated none.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this puzzle, say Japanese politicians and
analysts, is that in a virtual one-party state like Japan, the key
to rising in politics is seniority and congeniality. And Obuchi,
61, is extremely senior and congenial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He succeeded his father in a parliament seat in 1963 and has
been there since, working his way up the leadership ladder. A
gentle, low-key figure, he has often played the role of a mediator
and now heads the largest faction in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi's lack of both charisma and obvious leadership
skills might add to the party's problem with voters, the
fundamental problem that it faces is that while Hashimoto is
unpopular, there is no one else in the party who seems a clear
improvement. Indeed, the lack of alternatives is what has kept
Hashimoto in office in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you take care of the situation after him?'' asked
Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, in an interview last
week. ``Without knowing that, they can't get rid of him. Who can
succeed Hashimoto under these circumstances? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, someone will have to succeed Hashimoto, and talk is now
turning to Miyazawa as a possible emergency replacement. It would
be highly unusual to turn to a former prime minister, and he is not
the kind of fresh face that the party would like. But he is
recognized as an expert on finance and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa's term as prime minister was not memorable _ except to
Americans, who remember President Bush throwing up in Miyazawa's
lap during a state visit to Tokyo in 1993 _ but his expertise in
finance would bring some credibility to efforts to grapple with
Japan's economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender is Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran Liberal
Democratic Politician who has called for more aggressive efforts to
tackle economic problems. Kajiyama suffers, however, from an image
of an old-style political horse-trader _ just the image that the
Liberal Democrats are trying to shed.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama caused an uproar in 1990, when he was justice minister
and told a news conference that prostitutes were taking over and
harming a district in Tokyo. He said this was ``just like in
America, where blacks move in an area and whites are chased out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate for the prime minister's job might be Yohei
Kono, a former party leader who has a fresher image than some of
his rivals but who like Obuchi appears to have more friendliness in
his belly than fire.

<P>
   PHOENIX - If France could win the World Cup on Sunday, certainly
Diamondbacks pitcher Brian Anderson would finally win a game at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Oui?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson took a 3-2 lead over the Cincinnati Reds into the
eighth inning and gave up a game-tying home run to Barry Larkin, a
past All-Star and present Superman, at least during this series.
Then, in the ninth, Alan Embree served up a two-run homer to
Scottsdale's Paul Konerko, and suddenly, the Diamondbacks lost
their fourth straight (and seventh in eight games), 5-3, at Bank
One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have won seven in a row and 12 of their last 13, all
this coming off an 11-game losing streak that included a three-game
sweep by the Diamondbacks at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 6-3 on the road but 0-5 at home, has never been more
upset with himself than he was after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing that I can't stomach in sports, and that's a
guy who chokes,'' the left-hander said. ``When you get to the
eighth inning with a lead, you finish it. I absolutely choked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything that makes my blood boil more than
choking, and I am A-No. 1 at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, the veteran shortstop and a nine-time All-Star, led the
Reds' three-game sweep in their first trip to BOB. He had seven
hits _ three homers, three doubles and a triple _ and drove in
seven runs. His defense was equally as damaging to the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson didn't want to hear about anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horrible,'' he said. ``Absolutely horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitch to Larkin ``wasn't anything close to being a strike,''
Anderson said. ``But there's still absolutely no excuse for that.
It makes me want to puke.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Embree came in after Anderson gave up a single
to Dmitri Young to lead off the ninth. The next hitter was the
right-handed Konerko, the Scottsdale Chaparral High School graduate
just obtained from the Los Angeles Dodgers. Diamondbacks Manager
Buck Showalter said that despite the lefty-righty percentages,
Embree was the right man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Konerko homered off Willie Blair, but Embree got
him out. This time, Konerko smacked a 1-0 fastball deep into the
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Embree said was trying to pitch Konerko away to set him up for
something in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't hit my spot,'' said Embree, who was as down as
Anderson. ``It ran back over the middle of the plate. Good hitters
hit it out. I could have hit it out, for gosh sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pitched like he did early in the season, struggling
early and then getting sharper. Reggie Sanders led off with a
double in the top of the first. Chris Stynes sacrificed, and
Sanders scored on a double by Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Pokey Reese singled with one out, and backup
catcher Brook Fordyce doubled to make it 2-0. It was just Fordyce's
ninth RBI of the year. But then Anderson toughened up, holding the
Reds until the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring in just one of the previous 21 innings against the
Reds, the Diamondbacks tied the game in the fourth on a two-out
double by Tony Batista, who started at shortstop to give Jay Bell a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   In his next at-bat, leading off the bottom of the seventh,
Batista hit a solo homer to give the Diamondbacks a 3-2 lead. Which
could have been more, but the Diamondbacks, as during the entire
series, squandered an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   After Jorge Fabregas grounded out, Karim Garcia and Anderson
singled, putting runners on first and third with one out. Yamil
Benitez, pinch-hitting for Andy Fox, hit a short fly to right, and
Garcia tried to make it home. Stynes' throw to Fordyce was perfect,
and Fordyce and Garcia collided. Garcia accidentally kicked the
catcher in the head and shoulder, but Fordyce held on and Garcia
was out.
</P>
<P>
   Then Larkin and Konerko blasted the Diamondbacks into another
loss. That's what hurt, Anderson said, not that he has yet to win
at home. &QL;

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY SHAKES FINANCIAL MARKETS IN ASIA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating and rewriting throughout)   (sw)

<P>
   TOKYO _ Asian markets and the Japanese currency tumbled on
Monday morning, as investors worried about economic disarray in
Japan following the severe beating that the governing party took in
parliamentary elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's leaders have been under pressure from abroad for months
to clean up the banking system's morass of bad debts and to lift
the economy out of recession. Though they finally have the
beginnings of a blueprint to tackle the problems, the defeat of the
governing Liberal Democrats suggests that pushing through economic
legislation will be even more difficult than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainties are enormous,'' said Russell Jones, chief
economist at Lehman Brothers Japan. ``Who leads Japan? Are we faced
with lower house elections? What does it mean for the process of
putting through the legislation for the bank bailout and tax
cuts?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 minutes of stock trading, the benchmark Nikkei
225 average fell to 15,810.09, down 279.97 points, or 1.74 percent
from its close on Friday. And the yen fell sharply against the
dollar to a one-month low, falling to 144 yen, down from 141.39 in
late trading in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock markets in Asia were also down. At midday in
Singapore, the index fell 3.46 percent. In Hong Kong, stocks were
down 2.86 percent and in Thailand they fell 2.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been relatively sanguine about the prospects for
economic policy in the last couple of weeks, particularly with talk
about permanent tax reform and a cleanup of the nation's bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the resounding message of protest against the Liberal
Democrats throws into question the ability of the nation's leaders
to push through economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats will now have to work more closely with
the opposition parties to pass legislation, and this is likely to
stall the process.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan's economy was sinking in a recession this spring,
governments abroad were already criticizing the slow pace at which
Japan's Parliament was pushing through a $116 billion spending plan
to spur growth _ and that was when the Liberal Democrats had a firm
hand in the governing coalition and when the opposition parties
were extremely weak.
</P>
<P>
   The election results now raise the possibility of calls for an
election in Parliament's lower house, where the governing Liberal
Democratic Party currently has a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market rebounded after its initial fall, and in late
morning trading, the Nikkei benchmark stood at 16,023.58, down
66.48, or 0.4 percent, from Friday's close. The yen recovered to
trade at 142.55 near midday. Nonetheless, the market's jitters
themselves are likely to aggravate the problems for the banks and
for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese have been suffering a credit squeeze as the nation's
banks have cut back on their lending around the country. The banks
have also pulled back from lending elsewhere in the region, leading
to credit squeezes in Hong Kong, South Korea and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that part of their capital cushion is made up of
stocks, so as the prices of those stocks fall, there is more
pressure on banks to trim lending to insure they have enough
capital in proportion to those loans.

TELLING IT LIKE IT IS RUNS IN THE FAMILY  
 BRENNAMAN VOICES ECHO IN PRESS BOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There are times when the most unpopular person in the
Cincinnati Reds clubhouse is Marty Brennaman. That's because the
veteran broadcaster tells the fans the bad along with the good, and
many players don't like his honesty.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Thom, the Diamondbacks play-by-play man, also isn't
hesitant to criticize when the situation calls for it.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who say they are more like very good friends than
father and son _ Marty was divorced from Thom's mother when he was
a youngster _ were able to spend some time together during the
weekend when the Diamondbacks played the Reds in a three-game
series at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style has changed a lot,'' said Marty, celebrating his 25th
year with the team, whose most-memorable moment came when Pete Rose
got his 4,192nd hit. ``I was a cheerleader because that's what they
expected. But I wasn't comfortable doing that. I remember talking
to (pitcher) Jack Billingham once, and I said, `We played well
today.' And he says to me, `What the hell did you do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I adopted a philosophy. If it's praiseworthy, you
say that, but you also have the right to criticize. A lot of
players don't like me, but that's OK. I don't like all of them,
either. I don't want to be liked. What everyone needs is a degree
of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   His honesty, he said, almost cost him his job in 1983, when he
was at odds with General Manager Dick Wagner. But it was Wagner who
got fired instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wagner told me to say it and forget it, but if a play in the
second inning determines a game, I'm not going to forget about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thom's situation is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to beat up young players,'' he said. ``But you
can't accept it forever. You can say things like `will he be here
three or four years from now?' I'm not a homer, either, and even
with a young team you can be critical, and we have been critical at
times of some of the veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty, 55, has had numerous opportunities to leave Cincinnati,
but he says he plans to finish his career there, in less than 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thom, 34, who came to the Diamondbacks from the Cubs, likewise
hopes for a lengthy stay in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They have worked together only once, in 1995 on the Baseball
Network, when the Cubs beat the Reds, 1-0. (``That game stunk,''
Marty said.) They took turns doing play-by-play and color analysis.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't critique each other that day, and they say they
never will.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son share a pet phrase, ``Um, um, um,'' when things
go wrong, either at the ballpark or elsewhere. And the like-father,
like-son bond extends beyond baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In January of 1991, Marty developed polyps on his vocal chords.
That's when he quit smoking. Thom, taking a belated cue, quit
smoking a number of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put the fear of God in me,'' Marty said. ``The doctor
said two things could happen. One, they could remove my voice box,
and I would never work again, or two, I could get cancer and die. I
quit smoking, and I'm more proud of that than anything else I've
ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm just thrilled that Thom quit. But you know, he used to
steal them from me all the time. When Lou Piniella was the manager
of the Reds, he was the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom, who played high school basketball in Cincinnati, took care
of himself as a teenager, recalls Denise Seomin, a classmate who is
now media relations director for Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that Thom is an accomplished singer
and actor,'' Seomin said. ``He was a tenor in the chorus, and he
performed in school musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brennamans are one of a handful of families in the
announcing business on the big-time level, along with the Alberts,
Bucks, Carays and McDonoughs.
</P>
<P>
   Second-generation announcers, much like second-generation
ballplayers, aren't necessarily pushed into their fathers'
footsteps, but they often get there by assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   Thom says broadcasting was never in his plans when he was
attending Ohio University, but that the bug hit him one day when he
realized he didn't want to go a whole day without knowing all the
baseball scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no pressure from me at all,'' Marty said. ``But I do
view it as a tremendous compliment to me and my life's work. I've
seen way too many parents push their kids into things they didn't
want to do, whether it was being a doctor, a lawyer, or a
ballplayer. Kids should do what they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom remembers an early lesson: ``He taught me and my sister
(Dawn) to first be good citizens, and then be happy in whatever you
do.''

MERCURY WARY OF SPARKLESS LA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If the Los Angeles Sparks played half as well as their
opponents speak of them, they wouldn't be in this fix. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Even after beating Cleveland, 87-66, on Sunday, the Sparks (4-8)
are eight games behind Houston (13-1) in the WNBA Western
Conference and five behind the second-place Mercury (9-3) going
into a game at 6 tonight at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' home attendance dropped to a franchise low 4,851
last week, then rebounded to 7,032 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed inconceivable that Los Angeles, which finished so
strong in 1997 and almost bumped Phoenix from the West title and
the playoffs, could start this season like the last one. But the
Sparks actually are a game worse than in '97, when they were 5-7
after 12 games en route to 5-10 before closing with a 9-4 rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when they're going to wake up,'' Mercury center
Jennifer Gillom said.
</P>
<P>
   The wake-up call seemed to come six days ago, when the Sparks
came off a four-day break to beat Eastern Conference leader
Charlotte, 86-79. But they lost to Sacramento for the third time
this season, 76-71, the next night before taking three days off and
regrouping for the victory over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Sparks' four wins are over New York and Charlotte,
which are a combined 3-0 against the Mercury. That and the
simmering rivalry between the clubs _ five games, all decided by 10
points or less, two extending into overtime _ creates a healthy
respect for a team that, despite its struggles, is only 2{ games
out of the fourth and final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is a great team, I don't care what their record
is,'' Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller said. ``They have too much talent
for us to think we're going to steamroll them. They have too many
weapons to look at and say we can't get beat. They're not a
Washington,'' which is 2-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' arsenal, however, is depleted. First down was
first-round draft pick Allison Feaster, who fractured her right
foot three games into a pro career. The nation's collegiate scoring
leader remains in a cast and will be fortunate to return this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Three games later, 6-foot-8 Haixia Zheng tore cartilage in her
right knee that required arthroscopic surgery. Her return is two or
three weeks away. Zheng has not been a force against the fleet
Mercury, but she can be effective in half-court games, as in her
19-point effort in a victory over New York.
</P>
<P>
   All-WNBA first-team center Lisa Leslie and shooting guard
Tamecka Dixon are near the top in league scoring, and Leslie has a
league high nine double-doubles. But the supporting cast is
inconsistent, be it veterans Pam McGee and Penny Toler or
21-year-old Mwadi Mabika. Toler stepped up Sunday with her WNBA
career high of 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, six games over .500 for the first time in its brief
history, spurted to a 39-23 halftime lead and won, 70-60, when the
teams played here June 14. Toni Foster, now out with a stress
fracture, played just 13 minutes because of an ankle sprain and was
scoreless in that game, throwing newcomer Michelle Griffiths into
the fire against Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths responded with 16 points in 31 minutes. The Australian
now has seven starts and ranks among the league's top 20 in
free-throw percentage and steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Sparks) can be 0-20, and you'd better be ready,'' said
Foster, whose buzzer beater won a game at Los Angeles last season.
``They are a dangerous and a good team.'' &QL;

BIG GAIN, NO RISK STRATEGY

<P>
   Criticism of Oscar De La Hoya's opposition goes to the heart of
boxing's remaining credibility and it also raises questions about a
manager's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has been credibility's last refuge in a game that
would embarrass Jerry Springer, who might as well be a matchmaker
these days.
</P>
<P>
   But his victory over Patrick Charpentier belongs right there in
the garbage with Mike Tyson-Peter McNeeley and the projected Larry
Holmes-George Foreman bout, a Viagra special.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, De La Hoya's drawing power suffers no erosion. A more
significant number than the 45,000 people at El Paso's Sun Bowl for
the Charpentier demolition is Home Box Office's 12.0 rating, a
network high that amounts to 3 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Those are convincing factors, especially if you happen to be De
La Hoya's manager/promoter``'' Bob Arum. The business-based credo
is simply this:
</P>
<P>
   Maximum profit for minimum risk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, De La Hoya is ripped for not fighting the best
welterweights _ Felix Trinidad, Ike Quartey and Jose Luis Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, he can make nearly as much money in fights that are
perceived to be less of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at all of this, I know I don't need any other
fighter,'' De La Hoya said. ``Personally, I want a Trinidad or a
Quartey, but I don't need them.''
</P>
<P>
   The counter is that De La Hoya needs the fans, many of whom will
inevitably tire of their favorite fighter against one punching bag
after another. Fair enough.
</P>
<P>
   The other argument is that he owes something to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   If the payback is in scrambled brains, boxing never quits
paying. It's also easy and cynical for some fans to say fighters
are in their debt. HBO or pay-per-view is cheap compared to the
risk of one day living with a head that works like cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
   The choice ultimately belongs to De La Hoya. He, and Arum, are
wealthy, regardless of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But great?
</P>
<P>
   Only if he chooses to take that risk, says longtime Valley
manager/promoter Steve Eisner, who is guiding the young careers of
heavyweight Paea Wolfgramm and cruiserweight Sione Asipelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a right to be careful on the way up,'' Eisner said.
``But once you're champ, isn't the public defrauded when you don't
have tough fights? You can have an easy one. But where's the tough
one?
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya fought second-rate fighters to be a champion and
second-rate fighters to stay a champion.'' &QL; 
A cancellation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The traveling sales job by De La Hoya and``'' Julio Cesar Chavez
for a Sept. 18 rematch was KO'd last week. An eight-city tour was
scheduled to stop Thursday at the Valley's Celebrity Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Money was a factor. The journey would have cost $500,000. Each
fighter would have traveled in separate jets at $84,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, one jet wasn't enough. De La Hoya and Chavez
genuinely dislike each other. At 30,000 feet, De La Hoya would have
bloodied Chavez just as surely as he will at sea level. &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An interesting pro debut by Phoenix bantamweight Homero Sierra
is planned for Tuesday night at Midnight Rodeo, a club near 32nd
Avenue and Indian School Road. Sierra was runner-up in the national
Golden Gloves. Opening bell is scheduled for about 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _De La Hoya echoes: Evander Holyfield is hearing doubts about
his willingness to face a taller opponent. Why? He is asking for
$25 million to fight Lennox Lewis, who possesses some of the
Riddick Bowe-like reach and height that often troubles Holyfield.
HBO's current offer is $20 million. &QL;

SHOWALTER'S COLLEGE COACH PAYS A VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 and MARK ZUCKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The 1998 USA National Baseball Team visited Bank One
Ballpark on Sunday prior to leaving for the World Championships in
Italy on July 19-Aug. 3. Arizona State's Willie Bloomquist and
Arizona's Keoni DeRenne are on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Polk is the coach. Polk for many years was head coach at
Mississippi State, where in 1977 he had a player named Nat
Showalter, who later became known as ``Buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter played just one season but owns the highest lifetime
average in school history (.459).
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells people that (Will) Clark and (Rafael) Palmiero are
2-3 in hitting at Mississippi State,'' Polk said. ``He just waits
for someone to ask him who's number one.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter ``looks the same,'' Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't changed that much. He was a very intelligent
baseball player. He came back and got his degree. He made that
commitment. He was very serious about the game.'' &QL; 
Don't ask, don't tell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showalter gave shortstop JayBell and All-Star center fielder
Devon White the night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Devo's All-Star break,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another reason _ Reds starter Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to tell him that he's 0 for 17 against
Harnisch,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   We won't, either. &QL; 
Musical chairs &QL; 
With rookie Danny Klassen now looking like a permanent fixture at
second base, Andy Fox is a man without a position. That doesn't
mean, however, that Fox is not still a regular in Showalter's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough making out a lineup without him in there,''
Showalter said. ``We're going to try to find a spot for him in
there.'' &QL; 
Streak rolls on &QL; 
Tony Batista's fourth-inning double extended the Diamondbacks'
streak of consecutive games with at least one extra-base hit to 78,
tops in the National League. Only Cleveland's string of 89 is
longer in the majors. &QL;

KONERKO SHOWING SIGNS OF PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He came, he saw, he conquered, which was a far cry
from Paul Konerko's visit to Bank One Ballpark earlier this year
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his family and friends were in attendance, but a
struggling Konerko was a no-show except for pre-game batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the case Sunday night, however, as the former
Scottsdale Chaparral High School star treated the 50-strong
contingent of family and friends to a big show.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman went 3 for 4 and stroked a game-winning
two-run homer deep into the left-field seats in the ninth inning as
the Cincinnati Reds completed a three-game sweep of the
Diamondbacks with a 5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The homer, his second in two nights since being traded to the
Reds by the Dodgers, came off reliever Alan Embree. It raised
eyebrows because Diamondbacks skipper Buck Showalter bucked
baseball's sainted percentages by bringing in the left-handed
Embree to face the right-handed Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised,'' Konerko said. ``He's a good pitcher
who's in the big leagues because he throws in the mid-90s (mph).
When a guy throws that hard, it pretty much takes the lefty vs.
righty thing out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, the homer was probably more him than me. I
didn't swing that hard at it. He supplied the power. When a guy
throws that hard, you know it's his pitch. I just looked for it in
an area, and he got it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade sent closer Jeff Shaw to the Dodgers for Konerko and
southpaw pitcher Dennis Reyes. Now Reds Manager Jack McKeon has to
figure out what to do with Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles didn't know what to do with him, either,'' McKeon
said. ``He played first, third and outfield for them. We don't know
where we're going to play him, either. He'll probably play third
base (today) against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose we'll audition him all over until we figure it out.
He's a good young player, but I don't think anybody is ready to put
Paul Konerko into the Hall of Fame yet. He's going to struggle at
times, but he's a good player, and we'll find a place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, baseball's Minor League Player of the Year after
battling .323 with 37 home runs with Albuquerque last season,
doesn't care where he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whichever one gets me into the lineup,'' said Konerko, who
upped his average to .229 with Sunday's solid showing. ``I'd like
to settle down and play one position because that's the way you get
good at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for now, I'm willing to bounce around and do whatever they
want. I'm under a mind-set to just swing the bat well and produce
as a hitter. If I do that, they'll find a place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko put so much pressure on himself in Los Angeles to live
up to the ``can't miss'' label that he had trouble hitting his
weight (211) early in the season. He came to Cincinnati with a
different outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought before I came here that if I didn't get off to a
good start, not to press because I'll probably get my at-bats here,
regardless of how I'm doing,'' he said. ``It's probably why I had
such a good series. I knew if I didn't do well, it wouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games doesn't make a season for a team or a player, but
first impressions are important in baseball. I got off to a bad
start in Los Angeles, and I think because I struggled at the
beginning, they didn't want to give me that good second chance.
Hopefully, I won't have to worry about second chances here.'' &QL;

RATTLERS CONFRONT 2 GAMES IN 4 DAYS  
 ALBANY'S 3-LOSS STREAK MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rattlers' weird and wacky schedule will continue tonight
with a rare Monday game in Albany, N.Y., then a Thursday game at
home against the New York CityHawks.
</P>
<P>
   They've had 11 days to get ready for this. That worries Coach
Danny White, even though his wounded warriors needed the rest.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've done better on the shorter weeks, easily winning
two Thursday games on the road after playing on a Saturday or a
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more adversity they face, the better team they are,''
White said. ``We're starting to see that. You always wonder what
kind of personality your team will have. When we have a full week,
everyone is rested. That's when we struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go on the road after three days rest, all beaten up, we
don't have a fullback, and we blow a team out. How do you explain
that? It forces you to focus more.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened July 2 in Grand Rapids, where the Rattlers
(8-2) got a ton of breaks and whipped the Rampage, 69-27, for their
largest rout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face a team similar to the one they played June 20,
when they lost at home to the Orlando Predators, 42-40. Orlando
came in having lost three of four but put together one of its best
games.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's three-game losing streak is its longest in six years.
Its offense is almost as potent as the Rattlers', with quarterback
Mike Pawlawski and offensive specialist Eddie Brown putting up
similar numbers to the Rattlers' Sherdrick Bonner and Calvin
Schexnayder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had some weird things happen to them in games,'' White
said. ``They should have won two of the three games.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those lost opportunities was last week, when the
Firebirds (6-4) blew a lead in the final minute, then came up a
yard short of the goal line as time expired in a 55-48 loss to
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a danger playing a 6-4 team,'' White said. ``You think
6-4, so they must not be one of the top teams. But they're better
than that. We thought they had the best pass rush in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's the third-best, with 16 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   That presents a challenge to the Rattlers' line, which hasn't
allowed a sack of Bonner in two seasons. Bonner's quick reads and
mostly three-step drops keep him from getting dumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot you can to do to rush that, but you can try
to deter it,'' Firebirds Coach Mike Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner passed just 18 times against Grand Rapids. The Rattlers
ran the ball 17 times for a team record 94 yards. The big lead
allowed them to keep the ball on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have that kind of yardage against every team, but it
helps your confidence to know you can run the ball,'' White said.
``The line is starting to develop a rapport.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers know they can't count on another wild array of
breaks. In Grand Rapids, they scored a touchdown off the net on a
kickoff, another on an interception and a third on a fumble
recovery, all in a matter of two minutes, to break open a close
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got all the breaks,'' White said. ``I was kind of sitting
there and hoping, `Let's not use them all up in one game. Let's
save some of those turnovers. Those will be critical against a
really good team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Good teams, however, don't usually make so many mistakes. And
White doesn't expect Albany to be so generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hungry for a win, and we'll have our work cut out,''
he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Congressional fix: Save the flag, burn the First Amendment
 &HT;    ATTN: Editorial, Op-Ed Page editors
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, kids, I've got a swell idea. Let's get a lot of people to
burn American flags. Then we can have a bunch of political trials
and send people to prison and then there'll be protest rallies to
free, like, the Austin 3 or the Washington 7 or Dayton 4 and _
well, wow, it'll be just one long show.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I know the problem. Almost nobody is burning flags. As
near as anyone can tell, only five did all last year, and when they
do, nobody makes a big deal out of it, so the show-offs quickly go
the way of their own smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a surefire way to get a lot of new flag-burning
going: fix the U.S. Constitution so the free-speech thing in the
Bill of Rights won't cover it any more. Then the states can begin
making flag-burning a big-time crime. You can bet they will, and
maybe Congress will even make it a federal crime, so the FBI can be
called in.
</P>
<P>
   That will raise the stakes way up and make flag-burning a major,
major political act. All you'll have to do to call huge attention
to yourself or to your cause is fire up a flag, stand back and let
the fame pour in.
</P>
<P>
   Well, good news. It looks like the U.S. Senate is getting ready
to set all that up, maybe this fall. The House has already approved
an amendment and 49 states have passed resolutions begging for a
chance to ratify it. Getting two-thirds of the Senate to nail the
deal shouldn't be tough in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment is real simple: ``The Congress shall have the
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, that might set off even more fun than Congress
imagines, since nobody knows just what desecration means, legally.
The dictionary says desecrate means ``to treat irreverently or
contemptuously often in a way that provokes outrage on the part of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   So those kids who sew flag patches on their ratty jeans could
find themselves going up the river, and you folks who plop barbecue
on paper-plate flags on the Fourth of July could wind up doing a
little time, too, though I'm sure you won't mind because it will
make you more patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   And the courts can have a lot of sport figuring out what a flag
is. Is it only the cloth version you buy at a store? Or what if
somebody draws a big paper picture of a flag and burns that? And
what will the courts make of the ``Flag-Burning Page'' on the
internet, where you can burn a virtual flag? Will you go to virtual
jail?
</P>
<P>
   With luck, taking this first-ever nick out of the First
Amendment will be just the start of some real changes. Patriotism
deserves all the help politics can give it. Shouldn't there be a
law to stop comedy groups from writing parodies of the National
Anthem and singers from rocking it or giving it a soul twist or a
Latin turn? Is this a nation or a mosh pit?
</P>
<P>
   And there are few more sacred symbols of our nationhood than the
Statue of Liberty, but over the years, editorial cartoonists have
done the grossest things to our Lady Liberty. Does anyone seriously
doubt the nation would be better off if it were swept clean of
editorial cartoonists?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there's a ``Burn the Flag Burners!'' web page, too.
I'm afraid freedom is sometimes messy, and will be till Congress
cleans it all up for us.

RIDING ON GREED AND ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL SENTIMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the '40s, a person learned that to ride the rails
successfully, he must be quick and quiet lest a railroad bull crack
his skull and toss him off the moving freight. Quick and quiet are
also the hallmarks of a rider successfully attached to an
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 appropriations bills that will be signed into law
by the end of September in order to keep the government open for
business.
</P>
<P>
   They're sure bets.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that must be passed _ like an appropriations or a highway
spending bill _ is called ``A train'' in the vernacular of those
who work the halls and floors in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A rider attached to a ``must pass'' bill doesn't go through the
usual hearing process that a proposed piece of legislation faces.
</P>
<P>
   The normal legislative process is designed to be deliberative.
Passing a bill into law takes time. Hearings are held. Concepts and
language are debated. Those who object to the proposed legislation
are purposely brought into the debate. A bill may successfully pass
through subcommittee hearings, then full committee debate, and
finally to a floor vote in one of the houses of Congress and yet be
defeated because of inherent weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate can each pass a separate version of a bill.
A compromise bill is then hammered out and voted on again.
</P>
<P>
   Other versions of an unsuccessful bill may come back the
following year, and the year after that _ until it has eventually
accommodated some of the criticism, ideas and language of those who
opposed it. Or it may be dropped altogether. It often takes five or
six years to create an effective piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative process is supposed to allow time for debate in
both houses of Congress. The process responds to special interest
groups and watchdog organizations. Most importantly, it allows time
for the public to let its feelings be known. Dialogue is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for riders. They may not face any debate, merely a
cursory vote.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a rider onto a fast moving train. An appropriations bill
moves relatively quickly. Many riders aren't subject to any
scrutiny _ either by the public or by our elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriations bills are huge, hundreds of pages long _ a rider
can be easily secreted.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason that some of these riders are kept hidden from
the public _ they smack of smarmy deceit. They couldn't stand up to
open debate; they'd shrivel up like snails in a salt storm.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the House GOP leadership pushed to attach an anti-gay
rider to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, and later
attached a rider to the agricultural spending bill that would block
the Food and Drug Administration from using federal funds to test,
develop, or approve any drug that would induce an early abortion,
including the French pill, RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these riders concern issues that should have been
debated on their own merits and been introduced in the proper
committee where hearings could be held. The riders bypassed the
more democratic pathway.
</P>
<P>
   Public scrutiny was sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee attached a rider to the
Interior Appropriations bill that will delay new federal and Indian
oil valuations regulations until Oct. 1, 1999. The regulations
would help ensure that the American taxpayer receives a fair market
value for oil taken from federal lands. This little tactic _ unless
the rider is stripped from the bill _ will cost the taxpayer more
than $66 million per year in royalty payments and cost state public
school systems a large portion of that. Indian tribes will lose an
estimated $4 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The oil valuations rider was proposed by Sens. Kay Bailey
Hutchinson, R-Texas, and Pete Domenici, R-N.M., _ both receive a
huge hunk of their campaign contributions from the oil and gas
industry. They pocket the dough; our children's schools suffer. The
Interior's Minerals Management Service estimates that Wyoming
public schools will lose $770,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Avarice rides again. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., attached a rider
to the Interior bill to halt the review of current hardrock mining
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   It would effectively delay mining reform. No surprise: Reid
receives a large chunk of his campaign funds from the mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Riders are stealth legislation. No debate. No time for the
public to react. No time for those who oppose the rider to mobilize
their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes riders are attached to a bill at 4 in the morning.
Who's watching our elected representatives at that hour? The rider
process can be intentionally, resolutely anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at the 20-plus anti-environmental riders attached to
either the House or Senate Interior Appropriations bills shows no
real surprises.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's entire congressional delegation, Sens. Frank Murkowski,
Ted Stevens, and Rep. Don Young, are once again attacking the
Tongass National Forest, wilderness and wildlife refuges in their
state with road construction, helicopters, timber sales and
giveaways of federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., attached a rider that would block
the reintroduction of grizzly bears into the Selway-Bitterroot area
of Idaho and Montana _ an important species recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., is once again attacking American
Indian tribal sovereign immunity and self-determination. Sen. Mike
Enzi, R-Wyo., is once again pushing to limit a tribe's right to
establish gambling on its lands. And Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla.,
is using a rider to force tribal governments to pay state and local
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stream beds are sensitive to grazing cattle. One rider forces
the Bureau of Land Management to automatically renew grazing
allotments in 1999 whether or not poor land-use practices cause the
destruction of fish habitat, or riparian areas.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of these riders reveals a congressional leadership
driven by anti-gay, anti-Indian, and anti-environmental sentiment.
They leave the president with no choice but veto.

INTERNETTERS REACT TO WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something like 1.5 billion people around the world watched the
final World Cup soccer game Sunday (France over Brazil, 3-0).
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the final whistle, the Monday-morning
quarterbacking began on the Internet. (Monday-morning
quarterbacking? That's an American football term. It means
second-guessing the game, a sport favored by couch potatoes who
never get close to the field.)
</P>
<P>
   The early opinions were posted in the Usenet newsgroup
alt.sports.soccer.worldcup98, where the argument certainly will
rage for days. Samples:
</P>
<P>
   _``Why didn't Brazil play football tonight? It was too easy for
France! A boring final!''
</P>
<P>
   _``It is exactly how (the Brazilians) have been playing for the
last couple of years, and they never deserved to get to the final
game. There are so many better teams than Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Have you seen the last few World Cup finals? This one was a
miracle compared to those. France actually played some flowing
football in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   _``How much would England have won that final?''
</P>
<P>
   _``Oh here we go _English sportsmanship at its best. Someone
better tell him England can't get to the final without winning.''
</P>
<P>
   _``The French should be congratulated. They staged a well
organized tournament and an excellent final. They deserve it and
I'm glad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Again the `what if' questions. England had a decent squad but
certainly not a magical one. People seem to forget that before the
penalty loss to Argentina, England were well beaten by Romania.
Does this make Romania more worthy a World Cup winner than
England?''
</P>
<P>
   _``If England (had won) the World Cup they would have rioted and
tipped over the Eiffel Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   _``I must say after watching all the games and hearing most of
the comentary on this world cup, Brazil were made out to be virtual
supermen but, alas, they were exposed. Well, if you beat weak teams
you would obviously look good .... France on the other hand
stumbled along slowly, playing well, averagely and also scraping
out a victory against Italy, but unlike Brazil their defence is
tops and deserved to be called world class.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Well said. France put on an excellent display _especially in
the first half .... The French were not at all intimidated by the
Brazilians and ran at them from the beginning _consequently
exposing Brazil's lack of cohesion (which some of the fawning
press, in unconditional worship of Brazil, failed to remark on).
</P>
<P>
   ``The hosts have won, setting France alight and adding a new
name to the short list of World Cup victors. Felicitations les
blues!''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Edward Burns arrived in Ireland last summer to begin
filming ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he was feeling pretty good _ if
not downright cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him? He had just wrapped his third movie as
writer, director and star, and Steven Spielberg had cast him in the
World War II epic without an audition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Burns had landed the part of a wisecracking soldier
without so much as taking a meeting with the most powerful man in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   His first day on the set went off without a hitch. It was the
second day that knocked the wind out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it was absolutely terrifying,'' Burns
remembers. ``It was this big, long scene with me and Tom Hanks
going toe to toe. I had to sort of get in his face. We did a bunch
of takes, and it was great, and I felt really good, and then Steven
said, `I want to try one more angle.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the take, and it's going great, and I forget my
line near the end of the scene, and I think, 'Oh damn,''' he
continues. ``We do it again, and I screw up the line. Now, I see
Steven's concerned because we're running out of light, and then it
hits me: Oh my god, that's Steven Spielberg, this is Tom Hanks, and
I'm screwing up.''
</P>
<P>
   On take three, Burns choked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks was just like, 'Eddie, calm down. You can do this,''' he
says. ``And then it was fine. I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns likes to joke that watching Spielberg at work on ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was his graduate degree in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was feeling like I knew anything about filmmaking,'' he
says, ``that sort of woke me up to how much I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since he became an instant sensation at the
Sundance Film Festival _ shocking the movie industry by taking home
the Grand jury Prize for his debut film, ``The Brothers McMullen''
_ Burns has parlayed the hype into a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brothers McMullen,'' shot for a paltry $25,000, went on to
gross more than $10 million, making it, percentage-wise at least,
the most profitable movie of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 30-year-old actor has filmed ``She's the One,''
a kind of McMullen redux with one fewer brother and a $3 million
budget, and ``No Looking Back,'' about a 30-ish diner waitress
trapped in a small Northeastern shore town and torn between her
sweet-tempered boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and her no-good ex (Burns).
</P>
<P>
   Edward Burns grew up on Long Island, the son of a New York City
cop. (He's Eddie to his friends _ Screen Actors Guild has been on
his back about press references to ``Ed Burns,'' a name already
phonetically spoken for by 1960s TV actor Edd Byrnes of ``77 Sunset
Strip.'')
</P>
<P>
   When his NBA dreams didn't pan out _ he still has the thin,
squeaky voice of a kid calling plays in a schoolyard game _ Burns
enrolled in SUNY Albany, thinking maybe he'd become a sportswriter.
</P>
<P>
   Never a movie buff, he was hooked by a film-appreciation course
he took for an easy A. Burns later transferred to Hunter College in
New York City, unable to afford the more prestigious film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a tale that has become modern-day movie lore, he spent
four years doing grunt work on ``Entertainment Tonight'' while
writing screenplays in his down time and piling up rejection
letters from agents and producers.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to quitting when his dad offered the seed money to
make ``The Brothers McMullen,'' which he shot over the course of
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack (Mulcahy, who played the oldest brother) was the only guy
who had been in front of a camera before,'' Burns says.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were more rejection letters, this time from film
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, he thrust a tape into the hands of Robert Redford _
the godfather of indie films _ after an ``ET'' interview. It was
the only time, Burns says, that he hit up a celebrity at work. Even
that approach failed.
</P>
<P>
   But by coincidence, Redford's Sundance accepted Burns'
submission. Only later _ after Burns won the top prize, Fox
Searchlight bought the picture and Redford called to congratulate
the young filmmaker _ did Burns remind the venerable actor/director
of their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Redford has since become his mentor, serving as executive
producer on his last two movies.
</P>
<P>
   For ``No Looking Back,'' Burns had a budget of $5 million _ more
than he was used to, but still far less than what your average
mega-star commands for one picture.
</P>
<P>
   He says he spent the extra cash on ``five more days of shooting,
my first crane shot and a rain machine for an afternoon. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I made less than half of what I made on `She's the One,'''
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns says that was an easy price to pay for the opportunity
to make the ``tough little drama'' he wanted. Besides, he says,
``When you make a film for five, they leave you alone. Working with
a lower budget just gives you more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as shooting was to begin on his next film, ``No Looking
Back,'' Burns split from his girlfriend of eight years, Maxine
Bahns. Their relationship had become part of the Burns mythology:
They met working in a restaurant in the Hamptons, lived in his car
that summer and had been inseparable ever since. He had even cast
her, with no acting training, in his first two movies.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit for their breakup, he says, was not success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just Max and I were together such a long time, and it
was a case of, was either of us ready to get married?'' he says.
``I certainly wasn't ready to say OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Bahns left the picture, Holly entered it. But
Burns denies having an on-the-set romance with his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he smirks, ``Jon and I were having the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains cagey about his relationship with Holly, calling the
two of them ``really good friends, underline really.''
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing ``No Looking Back,'' Burns has been working on
the script of ``The Long Blue Line,'' the story of an
Irish-American cop family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about my heritage,'' he says, admitting he's on
a quest to become the Irish-American Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Woody Allen and Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Again he intends to direct and star in the movie. At heart he
considers himself a writer, but he has always been afraid ``to
surrender (a script) to someone and let them potentially massacre
my vision,'' he says. ``I wanted control of it. So directing was
just an extension of my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   He began acting for the same reason _ to maintain control of his
own work. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in fact, was ``the first time I
ever uttered a line of dialog that I didn't write.''
</P>
<P>
   He has never taken an acting class and doesn't have a coach. But
with his strong features and easy manner, he seems a natural for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach is from the gut,'' he says, ``and I guess it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns says he would gladly act again in someone else's movie,
particularly if it pays well _ eliminating the need to earn money
from his own films.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has already made more money than he expected to earn
in a lifetime, Burns insists his daily fife hasn't changed much. He
still rents an apartment _ he swears it isn't much bigger than his
last one _ and he hangs out at the same neighborhood bar and plays
basketball with the same guys.
</P>
<P>
   But he does eat out more often.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the clout he has gained, allowing him to hobnob
with his heroes, from Spielberg, Redford and Hanks to Tom Petty and
Bruce Springsteen, and to form Irish Twins Productions with his
younger brother, Brian. They co-created a sitcom, ``These Are the
Days,'' for ABC and are now developing a one-hour drama for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware that he is only three short years removed from his
peonship at ``Entertainment Tonight,'' Burns is savoring every
minute of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work _ I make movies,'' he says. ``Ten years from now
I might be working in a diner.'' &QL;

   Although he has already made more money than he expected to earn
in a lifetime, Burns insists his daily fife hasn't changed much. He
still rents an apartment _ he swears it isn't much bigger than his
last one _ and he hangs out at the same neighborhood bar and plays
basketball with the same guys.
</P>
<P>
   But he does eat out more often.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the clout he has gained, allowing him to hobnob
with his heroes, from Spielberg, Redford and Hanks to Tom Petty and
Bruce Springsteen, and to form Irish Twins Productions with his
younger brother, Brian. They co-created a sitcom, ``These Are the
Days,'' for ABC and are now developing a one-hour drama for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware that he is only three short years removed from his
peonship at ``Entertainment Tonight,'' Burns is savoring every
minute of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work _ I make movies,'' he says. ``Ten years from now
I might be working in a diner.'' &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 4, 1998,
at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

   &UR; BENJAMIN'S CROSSING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Parini. Owl/Holt, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This elegant biographical novel probes the life, death and
paradoxical character of the social critic Walter Benjamin, who was
both the beneficiary and the victim of the theorist's exile from
reality before his suicide in 1940. ``Parini's story is at once
painstakingly researched and dramatically recounted,'' Robert
Grudin wrote in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WHOLE SHEBANG: A STATE-OF-THE-UNIVERSE(S) REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Ferris. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, the author of this arresting status
report on cosmology, which was selected by the editors of the Book
Review as one of the best books of 1997, has a lot on his mind.
Starting with the Big Bang theory and finishing with reflections on
God and humanity's role in the grand scheme of things, he works on
a breathtakingly wide canvas, offering chapters on everything from
the shape of space, the riddle of dark matter, quantum weirdness
and the inflation of the universe and all that implies. ``A skilled
and experienced popular writer, Ferris serves as one of the best
guides for the curious reader,'' Owen Gingerich wrote here last
year.

<P>

   The narrator of this antic hall-of-mirrors novel, which explores
the compulsive appeal of communism for Britain's upper classes in
the 1930s, is based on the distinguished art historian Anthony
Blunt, who was named as a Soviet spy during the Thatcher years.
``Contemporary fiction gets no better than this ... extraordinary
book,'' Patrick McGrath said here in 1997.

   &UR; MAN CRAZY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Joyce Carol Oates. Abrahams/Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Boone is a sociopathic serial victim who is dehumanized
by a satanic motorcycle cult and its monstrously charismatic
leader. The violence in this perverse coming-of-age novel is
unrelenting, but ``there is no gainsaying the effectiveness of
Oates's writing,'' A.O. Scott wrote in these pages last year.

<P>
   &UR; WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR: A MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Doris Kearns Goodwin. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author recalls her feisty girlhood in the prefeminist,
prosperous 1950s on Long Island, and how she grew up in love with
both her family and the Brooklyn Dodgers. ``For
self-esteem-building female role models, for baseball lore and
inning-by-inning action and for a lively trip into the recent
American past, you could hardly do better,'' Ann Hulbert said here
last year. A classic account of those same Dodgers,  &UR; THE BOYS OF
SUMMER &LR; , by Roger Kahn (Harper Perennial, $15), has been reissued
with a new epilogue by the author, who covered the team when the
lineup boasted guys with names like Reese, Robinson and Hodges. In
1972 our reviewer, Grace Lichtenstein, called this ``a very stylish
piece of '50s nostalgia that puts us back in touch with our
heroes.'' In  &UR; CREATING THE NATIONAL PASTIME: BASEBALL TRANSFORMS
ITSELF, 1903-1953 &LR; , by G. Edward White (Princeton University,
$14.95), a historian describes the various factors -- including the
fortunate foolishness of many team owners -- that turned a marginal
urban sport into a national institution. In 1996 in these pages,
George F. Will praised the author as ``an affectionate but
agreeably dry-eyed student of the game.'' Meanwhile, down on the
field, the player who broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130
consecutive games played reveals a refreshingly old-fashioned,
team-spirited attitude in  &UR; THE ONLY WAY I KNOW &LR; , by Cal Ripken Jr.
and Mike Bryan (Penguin, $12.95). ``Cal Ripken provides one of the
best reasons for even the most jaded fan to keep on rooting,''
Diane Cole wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FALLING BOY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Long. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   When a young carpenter marries one of four sisters in a small
town in postwar Montana, he unwittingly adds fuel to a smoldering
sibling rivalry with disastrous results. The author of this ``love
poem for an era, a place and a people'' displays a ``calm capacity
for warmth and gentle humor,'' Robert Houston said here last year.
Big Sky country is also the setting for  &UR; NOTCHES &LR; , by Peter Bowen
(St. Martin's, $5.50), the latest mystery featuring the brooding
lawman Gabriel Du Pre, who here tracks down a couple of serial
killers who may have murdered thousands of young women over a
20-year period. Last year in these pages, Marilyn Stasio called
this a ``mesmerizing series ... informed by Western legend, steeped
in Indian superstition.''

<P>
   &UR; SISTERS IN ARMS: CATHOLIC NUNS THROUGH TWO MILLENNIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jo Ann Kay McNamara. Harvard University, $18.95.
</P>
<P>
   This mammoth history is both a lament for the sad state of women
in religious orders over the centuries and a positive record of
their formidable achievements in administration, nursing and
education. The result is an ``engrossing and challenging work,''
Antonia Fraser wrote in the Book Review in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mameve Medwed. Warner, $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Katinka O'Toole is a youngish wannabe writer living alone in
Cambridge, Mass., whose spirits are lifted when a handsome new
mailman takes over delivery of her rejected short stories. Last
year our reviewer, Fran Handman, called this an ``off-the-wall
sendup of the take-charge-of-your-life novel.''

   A Long-Running Battle Over Breast Implants  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning Corp. and lawyers representing the tens of thousands
of women who claimed injury from silicone breast implants agreed to
a $3.2 billion settlement, bringing to a close one of the nastiest
disputes in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement has enticements for both sides. The
170,000 women who filed claims against Dow Corning could recover
damages as early as next year. Dow Corning, forced into bankruptcy
by injury lawsuits in 1995, can now emerge from Chapter 11 without
admitting any liability over its silicone wares.

   Misconduct at the Top  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As deputy inspector general of the Army, Maj. Gen. David Hale
oversaw investigations of sexual misconduct by Army brass. Problem
was, Hale was facing some of the same allegations himself. Yet he
was still allowed to retire in February, with the investigations
unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon report last week found that he had engaged in a
pattern of ``inappropriate behavior'' or adulterous affairs with
the wives of four officers under his command in an earlier
assignment. The report fueled charges of an Army double standard,
in which senior officers accused of misconduct are allowed to
retire quietly while enlisted personnel or juniors officers are
prosecuted and jailed. Hale denied the misconduct charges.

</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court rejected the Clinton administration's
claim that Secret Service agents should not have to testify about
what they knew of the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. The Secret Service has argued that if its agents were
compelled to testify about the private life of the president, they
would be pushed away and unable to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Lewinsky's former colleague, Linda Tripp, made
two more appearances before a federal grand jury in Washington,
just as another investigation was beginning. A Maryland prosecutor
announced that he had convened a local grand jury to examine
whether Ms. Tripp broke a law when she secretly recorded her
telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.

   HMOs Pull Out of Medicaid And Medicare in Some States  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employers give health maintenance organizations the credit for
stopping inflation in the cost of their workers' health benefits,
and Congress and the Clinton administration want them to do the
same for their big benefit programs _ Medicaid, for the poor, and
Medicare, for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But blaming inadequate reimbursements for their services,
leading HMOs have been pulling out of at least 12 states. Aetna
U.S. Healthcare has dropped Medicaid programs in Connecticut and
New York, leaving only New Jersey with one. Medicare beneficiaries
are losing programs in 10 California counties and 22 in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The move is more a trickle than a flood, with most of the
managed care organizations still operating their programs. But
President Clinton called the trend ``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned elderly have no choice but to return to more
costly fee-for-service medicine, and the poor to ``Medicaid mills''
that provide inferior care.

   Maybe it's because it just bought Rolls-Royce, but Volkswagen is

Jewish slave laborers during World War II, it was, to use that
chilling excuse, ``just following orders.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, in an about-face, the company will set up a fund to
compensate those workers, many of whom now live in Israel. As
usual, though, justice delayed will often be justice denied: Many
of the workers are dead.

   Bully Pulpit
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the government would no longer do
business with any health insurance company that flouts a 1996 law
intended to guarantee access to coverage for people who change or
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you violate the letter or the spirit of the
Kassebaum-Kennedy law, we will, if necessary, terminate your
contract to provide health insurance to federal employees,''
Clinton said. ``If you say no to people with pre-existing
conditions, the federal government will say no to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers insisted there was no evidence of abuse. The Health
Insurance Association of America called the president's
announcement an election-year stunt _ ``a frivolous misuse of his
bully pulpit.''

   A Gain for the Palestinians At the United Nations

   A large majority of United Nations members, concerned about the
lack of progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians,
voted with a group of Arab and developing countries to expand the
Palestinians' rights in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has
administrative functions over real territory, the General Assembly
granted its delegation a special (though nonvoting) observer
status, with the right to take part in debates as well as United
Nations conferences. Washington opposed the move.

paintings.
</P>
<P>
   And they also ignored this: While Italy has Renaissance art on

assigned more than 100 law-enforcement officers to the case,

   With Russia's economy hanging in the balance, the International
Monetary Fund has offered to give a helping hand to the government
of President Boris Yeltsin. But last week Russian officials and
Western investors were asking whether the fund was providing too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's initial suggestion was to provide $5.6 billion in new
financing, a small part of the $20 billion or more the Kremlin is
looking for. As the dance between the fund and the Russians went
on, the Kremlin was trying to prod the fund to double its
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin was not simply waiting for the fund to get the
message. On Friday, Yeltsin decided to go over the head of the fund
and telephone world leaders.

   A Bouquet for Pepe Le Pew &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given both the shape and the scientific name of the
Amorphophallus titanum, the Viagra jokes were inevitable. And so
Carolyn White, the security guard who stood sentinel last week
beside the world's largest flowering plant, was amused but not
particularly surprised when visitors wondered aloud whether the
potting soil had been fertilized with a monster dose of the
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, in the horticultural event of the decade at the
Atlanta Botanical Garden, the 6-foot-2-inch tall plant began to
bloom. It was only the seventh time that the rare and unpredictable
plant from the Sumatran rain forest had flowered in cultivation in
the United States. During the next four days, until the bloom
wilted and shed, thousands of visitors jammed the normally tranquil
botanical garden like gawkers at a carnival freak show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting sucker, that's for sure,'' said an
admiring Carl Beck, a 72-year-old retiree. ``It's a wonder what
nature can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amorphophallus, which is also known as the Titan arum, is
not only a sight to see but also to smell. In order to attract
pollen-carrying insects on the first day of its brief bloom cycle,
the plant gives off a stench that is often compared to that of
rotting flesh.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the Amorphophallus seedling four years ago from
a botanical garden in Sarasota, Ron Gagliardo, curator of tropical
plants for the Atlanta garden, began nurturing it with bone meal
and chicken manure. It sprouted leaves but never showed signs of
blooming until June 12, when a bud first emerged from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Gagliardo, 33, was justifiably proud when the vast, vaselike
spathe, which is the color of dried blood, began to unfurl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first walked in the room and looked at it I was just in
awe,'' he said. ``It made my heart stop.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Judge Lorin Duckman first came to wide public
attention in 1996 it was for lowering the bail of a man charged
with beating and threatening his girlfriend and ignoring court
orders to stay away from her. The man was then released, and three
weeks later he killed his girlfriend and himself.
</P>
<P>
   But when New York state's highest court ruled last week that
Duckman could be stripped of his judgeship, that case was not part
of its decision. Instead, he was banished from the bench for a long
record of behaving imperiously and preposterously in his Brooklyn
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The killings served only to shine a spotlight on Duckman's
misbehavior, which had been widely known among lawyers who had
appeared before him but did not cause judicial authorities to take
action against him.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Duckman decided to dismiss a case without
hearing the district attorney's arguments. According to court
documents, he was especially nasty to prosecutors, telling one that
he probably got his law license on the back of an orange juice
carton and another that he would prefer she appear in his courtroom
in short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Duckman's erratic and tyrannical behavior is hardly unique.
``Megalomania is an occupational hazard for judges,'' said Prof.
Paul Carrington of the Duke University Law School, noting that a
trial judge inevitably has a great deal of power over everyone in
the courtroom. ``Judges can get awfully full of themselves,'' he
said. ``Put it this way: everybody laughs at the judge's jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and public defenders in any city are able to point
to errant judges who are local legends, but they typically do so
only among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are intimidated by the fear of retaliation,'' said
Prof. Monroe Freedman of the Hofstra Law School. ``They usually
think they can't complain because they will eventually have to
appear before the judge and he will take it out on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some jurists, like Duckman, do manage to become infamous.
Brian Duff, until recently a federal trial judge in Chicago, was
the subject of courtroom chatter for several years. He once ordered
the arrest of his personal clerk and had her held in contempt and
fined $20 after a quarrel in which he complained she had handed him
a file facing the wrong way. She was held in custody for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Duff refused to accept briefs unless they spelled out his middle
name, Barnett, and once mused aloud during a criminal trial that he
had recently been on a flight where a female attendant had
wonderful legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Council of Lawyers finally issued a report that said
Duff's ``outbursts go far beyond the range of irascibility that
judges sometimes show towards lawyers.'' The report also hinted at
why judges may feel they are above criticism: ``Some lawyers report
that the only way to avoid Duff's ire is to grovel and constantly
flatter him.''
</P>
<P>
   The few instances in which judges are removed from the bench
usually follow notorious publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Duckman, Gov. George Pataki asked the State
Commission on Judicial Conduct to remove him following the
bail-lowering incident.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most state judges, federal judges have life tenure and
can only lose their jobs after impeachment by Congress, a rare
occurrence that usually follows a criminal conviction. Duff retired
shortly after a drunken-driving arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Another egregious example of judicial arrogance in New York
occurred in 1975, when Judge William Perry of Suffolk County court
had a marshall bring into court in handcuffs a man who operated a
refreshment truck outside the courthouse because the judge thought
his coffee tasted bad. Perry was later thrown off the bench, not
for abusing his office but for lying about the incident to a
disciplinary panel.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Richtel, a state trial judge in Boulder, Colo., said a
big part of the problem was that judges are obliged to keep a
seemly distance from lawyers and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job that's isolating and they are deprived of the
opportunity to have feedback as to their behavior,'' he said. ``You
get very little criticism from the people in front of you and you
don't hear the truth about your performance. You can get deeper and
deeper into a pattern of behavior that's wrong and not even suspect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Schwarzer, a senior federal trial judge in San
Francisco and the former director of the Federal Judicial Center in
Washington, said, ``Much of the misconduct of judges in the
courtroom is a reflection of their insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that most people viewed judges as being in total
control. ``But when you're up there having to deal with attorneys
at each other's throats arguing about tough issues, you're under an
awful lot of pressure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges who are unable to handle that kind of pressure, Schwarzer
said, resort to arbitrary and sometimes foolish behavior. ``There
are times when you get mad at a lawyer,'' he said. ``But consistent
heavy-handed and arbitrary behavior is as much due to insecurity
and intellectual laziness as anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwarzer warned that some attacks on judges mask a wider
political agenda aimed at diminishing judicial independence, as
when a politician criticizes an unpopular ruling to win favor with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes what's really occurring is really an attack on
judicial decision making,'' he said. ``It's one thing to complain
about judges who conduct themselves badly or arrogantly, but it's
something else to censure judges for what they say in the
decision-making process.''

<P>
   The United States may not yet resemble France, which is
paralyzed every year or two by a strike, but suddenly American
labor unions have taken to the streets in a way not seen in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong walkout that has shut down General Motors is the
auto industry's longest strike since 1970. An unusual two-day
general strike threw Puerto Rico's economy into chaos last week as
unions battled plans to privatize the government-owned telephone
company, a move the workers fear will mean large-scale layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And 12 days ago, 40,000 construction workers crippled midtown
Manhattan by staging a sometimes violent rally against a nonunion
contractor. It was the biggest, angriest demonstration by New
York's normally docile hard hats in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor stalwarts who grew up singing ``Solidarity Forever''
hail these developments as a signal that union militancy, squelched
in the Reagan years, is making a comeback. But other analysts
suggest that the recent three-ring labor circus is a coincidental
confluence of events that should be viewed as exceptions to the
long, steady decline of militancy.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling evidence of labor's waning belligerence is that
the number of strikes nationwide has slipped to its lowest level
since World War II. There were just 29 strikes last year involving
1,000 workers or more, about half the amount of a decade ago and
one-eighth the level two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kruger, a professor of industrial relations at Michigan
State University, said the recent turbulence did not signal an
upswing in strikes or union aggressiveness. ``Sure, we're going to
have occasional strikes, but nothing of the magnitude we had in the
past because it's very dangerous to go on strike. People see it's
easy to call a strike, but hard as hell to end a strike and to win
a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Many factors are behind the decline in unions' strikes and
stridency. Unions now represent 14 percent of the work force, down
from 35 percent in the 1950s. Fears of layoffs engendered by
repeated rounds of downsizing have made many workers scared to
stand up to management.
</P>
<P>
   And union members often fear they will lose their jobs during a
strike because management is increasingly using permanent
replacement workers, as President Ronld Reagan did after dismissing
the striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Unions are also
shunning walkouts because they have seen several big strikes fail,
like the one six years ago against Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate officials attribute labor peace largely to improved
labor relations. At many companies, there is increased
employer-employee teamwork and managers are treating workers with
more respect. With many employees receiving bonuses and
profit-sharing, more and more workers feel allied to management,
rather than opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many situations where labor relations have
matured,'' said Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Auto
Workers and now a professor of labor relations at Wayne State
University. ``Companies and unions are finding different ways to
find solutions to problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some labor experts insist that the recent militant
actions are not exceptions, but instead reflect important changes
in the labor movement and in the economy. Since John Sweeney was
elected to the AFL-CIO's presidency in 1995, he has urged the
beaten-down union movement to stand up and be willing to confront
management.
</P>
<P>
   With the lowest jobless rate in 30 years, workers are feeling
more confident about job security, and union leaders are convinced
it will be harder for management to find permanent replacement
workers during strikes. In addition, many workers are bitter that
their pay has barely kept pace with inflation while Wall Street and
executive compensation have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting an increase in strikes, Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor
relations professor at Cornell University, said union militancy was
at a turning point. ``What we're seeing is workers are fed up with
being told that there is this great American economic boom and
they're not sharing it, and their patience with Corporate America
is waning,'' she said. ``We see that at GM and we saw that last
year in the UPS strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind every strike is a unique set of circumstances, so it is
often hard to tell whether strikes are one of a kind or part of an
underlying trend. The GM strike began when the UAW grew angry that
the company had failed to make out a promised investment at a plant
in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The New York construction workers rallied, shutting down most of
Manhattan's unionized building sites, because they feared that the
growth of nonunion contractors would cost them their jobs. Even
though these actions differed in cause and means, some experts say
they were both inspired by Sweeney's more muscular tone for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a bottoming out of strike activity because
it couldn't go much lower,'' said Greg Tarpinian, president of the
Labor Research Association, a New York-based research group.
``Given the tight labor market and the unhappiness with attacks on
workers, people are finally starting to feel a little more
confident about flexing their muscles.'' &QL;

THE NEW YORKER AFTER TINA BROWN

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We raised a quizzical eyebrow on hearing that Tina
Brown had abruptly, insouciantly sashayed her way out the front
door of 20 W. 43rd St. after six buzzful years as the editor of the
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   This was rare news indeed. Resign? From The New Yorker? In the
past, editors either died or were forced to walk the plank, their
pockets weighted down with bullion. The restless Ms. Brown simply
left, rather than commit to a five-year contract. She signed on
with the film company Miramax to run a new company that will
produce a new monthly magazine, books, films and television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something's perfect, it always seems like a good time to
leave,'' she told The Washington Post, applying a nifty gloss to
her tenure at what Fortune magazine recently called ``one of the
biggest money pits in American magazine history.''
</P>
<P>
   Strolling past the New Yorker's offices, and stopping in for a
haircut on the ground floor, we pondered the meaning of it all, as
Frank, our favorite barber, applied his sensitive hands to the
complex topography of our skull. Surely, life will be a shabbier
thing without Ms. Brown, we thought. No longer will it be possible
to speculate on our favorite conundrums. Is it S.I. Newhouse, the
owner of Conde Nast, who's fed up with Ms. Brown, or is it the
other way around? Which Florio does she work with, and how does she
know which one is which? Does she truly understand the damage that
a fused participle can wreak?
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Tina-less New Yorker dampened our mood. Ms.
Brown ran the magazine as though she were giving a party in a
deconsecrated church. Readers felt a guilty thrill at the
brazenness of it all, grabbing a glass of champagne as they
circulated among the guests. Here was Norman Mailer, jabbing a fat
forefinger as he engaged in spirited debate with Queen Latifah.
There was Jeffrey Katzenberg, deciding the fate of empires, as
Richard Avedon clicked away with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   What larks! No more treatises on tectonic plates, Letters from
Washington that read like a VCR manual, langorous ruminations on
the fate of the earth, nattering Reflections or twitty Talk of the
Town observations in the first-person plural. No longer did we have
to worry with Bill McKibben in the Adirondacks. Away, dull care!
The new New Yorker was a kaleidoscopic swirl of power people,
synergists, media moguls, publicity pashas, superstars, and
megamodels. It was more fun than E! and sometimes nearly as deep.
When things got a little too giddy, there was always a report from
the latest trouble spot to provide some moral ballast, and darned
if writers like Simon Schama, Ken Auletta and Anthony Lane couldn't
be just as long-winded and boring as the great ones.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally _ well, more than occasionally _ some mauvais types
slipped past the velvet rope. We confess to a certain perplexity at
the thought of Roseanne Barr as a guest editor. That woman over in
the corner with the spiked dog collar and the cat o' nine tails?
Was she invited? And shouldn't someone have taken the drink out of
Ms. Brown's hand before she started going on about Princess Di, or
threw herself at Bill Clinton in an article that should have been
titled ``The Sexiest Man Alive''?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we thought, with an indulgent smile, Harold Ross' New
Yorker was a bit raffish in its own way, and William Shawn's New
Yorker, as decorous as a Sunday service, has spent so much time
spinning in its grave that by now it's drilled a tunnel halfway to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autres temps autres moeurs,'' we murmured, slipping an
emolument into Frank's waiting hand. With a cheery wave, we
sauntered off to catch up with the buzz about the buzz.

<P>
   It was the lure of a $100,000 reward that solved the mystery of
who killed Bill Cosby's son, but as prosecutors learned during the
trial that ended last week, the solution created a problem. The
reward, offered by The National Enquirer, provided the defense with
its strongest argument: Money can be a powerful motive to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out for prosecutors in the Cosby case. A jury
convicted a 19-year-old, Mikail Markhasev, of killing Ennis Cosby,
who had stopped to change a tire in Los Angeles. Markhasev could be
sentenced to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The reward was turned over last week to Christopher So, a former
friend of Markhasev. After hearing about the reward last year, So
told the police that Markhasev had admitted to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The offering of rewards has increased in recent years, in part
because of successes like the Cosby case. But there is little
evidence that they do much to solve most crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are no studies that demonstrate a connection
between rewards and crime clearance rates. In fact, the multitude
of leads generated by the announcement of a large reward can send
detectives off on time-consuming and fruitless tangents. And
rewards can inject mercenary motives into an act that should be
seen as a civic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards have become a fact of life in police work and are
necessary, said Robert Louden, the director of the criminal justice
center at John Jay College. Louden, a former New York City police
official involved in confidential informant and reward programs,
said detectives must be careful to strike a balance so they don't
waste time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes the concept of the rat or the stool pigeon,''
Louden said. ``They are a reality of life in this day and age.''
Many people call not because it is the right thing to do, he added,
but for revenge or money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Crimestoppers reward programs, run by
non-profit organizations in conjunction with local police
departments, have sprung up across the country. They offer up to
$1,000 for information that leads to the conviction of any violent
criminal. Generally, the money is not set aside for specific cases,
but can be used on any case.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS and
other federal agencies offer standing rewards for such information.
And late last year, the FBI Investigation posted a $50,000 reward
for the arrest of anyone on its top 10 fugitives list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that public interest in our top 10 program was
waning a bit, so we decided to give it a breath of fresh air and
initiate rewards,'' said Roy Tubergen, chief of the FBI's violent
crime fugitive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's Most Wanted,'' a television program that profiles
crimes in cooperation with the police, draws more than 12 million
viewers an episode, said Mike Molnar, a spokesman for the show.
Many of the crimes featured have awards attached to their
resolution. The program has been responsible for 500 arrests in the
last decade, Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   But a troubling aspect of the surge in informant calls is that
many callers are criminals themselves, said Arthur Lurigio, the
chairman of Loyola University's criminal justice department. Some
make a living by informing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond anecdotal evidence, Lurigio said, there is no proof that
offering rewards is a more efficient way to solve crimes than
old-fashioned police work.
</P>
<P>
   Often, even enormous rewards lead nowhere. The Globe, a
competitor of The National Enquirer, offered a $500,000 reward for
information leading to the conviction of the killer of JonBenet
Ramsey, the 6-year-old beauty queen. The murder remains unsolved.
(The National Enquirer offered her parents $1 million to take a
lie-detector test last year. They declined.)
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 reward offered by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
not helped solve the disappearance of a couple from their loft in
November. Nor has anyone been arrested for the murder of restaurant
owner Abe Lebewohl two years ago. His family has offered a $100,000
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases are hard to explain because calls are generated,
but they just haven't solved the crimes,'' said Lt. Richard
Kuberski, who heads New York's Crimestoppers program. ``Sometimes
their leads don't pan out and we have been on wild goose chases
before, but a lot of our callers know what's going on on the
street. They can get the ball rolling for us.''

<P>
   There's a curious new genre that seems to be emerging in
American journalism: the media obituary. In the hushed, somber
tones used for that most solemn of news accounts, reporters have
been busy churning out virtual death notices for the careers of
disgraced colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the recent chronicles of Stephen Glass' New Republic
exploits, in which he concocted parts or all of 27 of the 41
articles he wrote for that magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the reports of Patricia Smith's fabricated Boston
Globe columns, in which more than a few of the people quoted were
phantasms of her imagination. Or review the coverage of April
Oliver, the producer of a CNN report that the U.S. military used
poison gas in Laos, which both the network and its collaborator on
the story, Time magazine, have now repudiated.
</P>
<P>
   Much like actual obituaries, these accounts include paragraphs
detailing, in an already distant past tense, the decedent's career.
There is often a mention of parents, perhaps an aside to upbringing
and educational background. Also included are survivors _
producers, fellow columnists, editors. In the case of Glass, who
would not talk to reporters, the reporting sounds airless,
unleavened by any self-scrutiny or a whisper of personal
psychodrama. Ms. Smith left a misty apologia last month in one last
abject Globe column.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greene, a former editor of Newsday and recipient of two
Pulitzer Prizes for his work as an investigative reporter, said he
had noticed the media-obit trend in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've also seen this in the past,'' he said from his office
at Hofstra University, where he teaches journalism. ``We wrote
about Janet Cooke in that past tense, I think rightly,'' he said,
referring to the Washington Post reporter who falsified an article
about an 8-year-old inner-city heroin addict, for which she won the
Pulitzer Prize in 1981 before the hoax was discovered. ``But we
have such an onslaught of victims right now that it seems new. It
becomes more stylized and sophisticated as we keep _ there's no
other way to say it _ piling up the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The media obit evolved because post-Watergate journalism depends
on a kind of professional schadenfreude, said Jerry Nachman, a
former editor of The New York Post. ``The sad thing about our
business,'' he said, ``is that as these journalists step out on a
ledge warily and appear to be attempting suicide, it's terrifying
to see how many of our brethren are standing below, yelling
`Jump!'''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, an obituary announcing the premature death of a
career signals an opportunity to try a more creative venture _ a
chance to write a novel that may become a movie. After the
journalist Clifford Irving was sentenced in 1972 to 17 months in
federal prison for a hoax involving his fabricated autobiography of
Howard Hughes, he wrote mysteries and a play titled ``Versus the
IRS,'' which was based on his own experience suing the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Mere weeks after Glass' doom was sealed as a reporter, editors
at Simon &AMP; Schuster and Random House bandied about the idea of
enticing him into writing a novel, according to editors at both
houses. Eventually the publishers concluded that his pattern of
deceit was a shade too morally ambiguous _ this judgment from the
people who paid $2 million for the memoirs of Dick Morris, the
former strategist for President Clinton who left the White House in
a scandal involving his relationship with a prostitute. Ms. Smith,
who is already an established poet, surfaced at the 17th annual
Taos Poetry Circus in June, where poets dueled and their verses
were judged by a cocktail waitress, a master carpenter and an
elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who return like the phoenix, their sins
forgiven and their careers resilient. Michael Daly resigned from
his job at The Daily News in 1981 after admitting that a British
soldier he quoted in an incendiary article about Northern Ireland
was a composite; his departure was noted with funerary aplomb. But
weeks later, New York magazine hired him. He has since returned to
his post as a Daily News columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast news has a similar ratio of phoenixes to ghosts. In
1993, Michael Gartner resigned as president of NBC News after
acknowledging that the team behind a ``Dateline NBC'' report had
rigged a General Motors truck to explode for a report on truck
safety. Gartner retreated to Ames, Iowa, where he edits the Daily
Tribune (circulation 10,000). Last year, he won a Pulitzer Prize
for editorial writing.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cooke now lives in Ann Arbor, Mich., where she was
studying for a fine arts degree until recently. Years after her
downfall, she received a little help from her friends. Mike Sager,
a former Washington Post reporter who dated her at the time of her
dismissal, turned the situation to their mutual advantage by
writing an article about their relationship for GQ magazine in
1996. He sold the film rights to James L. Brooks, the director of
``Wag the Dog'' and ``As Good As It Gets,'' for reportedly as much
as $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the victims themselves have resorted to the language
of death. Jack Smith, the CNN senior producer who was fired along
with Ms. Oliver, remarked to the Associated Press that ``the
bloodlust for another body was rising'' when CNN president Tom
Johnson issued a reprimand, rather than a vote of support, to the
correspondent Peter Arnett last week. (The New York Post reported
that a senior executive producer, Pamela Hill, also ``walked the
plank.'')
</P>
<P>
   But why do some journalists re-emerge and others sink forever
under the waves? When will Marv Albert surface again? And why is
Ms. Cooke never heard from?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the most basic, driving motivation,'' Sager
said. ``Are these people who are struggling and just barely
treading water? Do they make these dramatic gestures in order to
save themselves, or do they do it to get caught? Or is this a
person who actually makes a mistake, carries it through, then
realizes it and is a person of some talent and credibility? The
well-balanced writer can carry out this tack and survive.''

<P>
   Over and over, through hard sell and soft-pedal, with wheedling
pledge and beggared compromise, the world has tried to make America
finally grow up, join the community of nations and love soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a parent pushing broccoli or slick car salesmen hawking
next year's models, the sport's promoters _ some earnest, some
frustrated at their marginal role in the lucrative U.S. market _
have oversold every argument and overstated every claim about what
soccer is or does or can be.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of such tactics have yielded an obvious result: As
soccer reaches its apogee in Paris on Sunday with the World Cup
final between France and Brazil, the game remains as mysterious to
vast numbers of Americans as it was when all they saw of it was
grainy photographs of Pele leaping in triumph about something or
other. Although millions of children and their parents now know
what a corner kick is, soccer as a national passion still remains
pint-sized _ a prisoner of its own hype, trapped in a nebulous
cloud of promises and myths that the sport, however great, cannot
possibly sustain in real life.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup games _ whose U.S. TV ratings are down markedly
from 1994, when the games were held in the United States at more
congenial viewing times (and the Americans went further before
elimination) _ offer the occasion to refocus some basic questions:
What the heck IS soccer anyway? And why can't a whole lot of
Americans be sold on it?
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of soccer is ``American free enterprise at its
best, and its worst,'' said Stephen Hardy, who teaches sports
studies at the University of New Hampshire and is a soccer dad.
``There's been no uniform presentation of the sport, and with so
many different approaches to selling the game, it's like clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   One professional team in Pittsburgh, for example, tried several
years ago to position soccer as a kind of athleticized Chippendales
show _ a place for women to ogle men with nice legs. Other teams
have sold soccer as a squeaky clean game of wholesome family fun,
with an old-world integrity and finesse to make supposedly low-brow
games like U.S. football appear primitive or corrupt by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that soccer is perceived as a foreign game, Major
League Soccer, a 12-team professional league founded in 1996, has
tried to mandate that the game be more American, imposing a limit
of five foreign players on any team. Other promoters hype the
game's athleticism, claiming that soccer players are the world's
fittest athletes, because _ just look at them _ don't they run all
the time out there on that big field?
</P>
<P>
   The truth about soccer is that, like most successful sports,
it's an ugly, mean, complicated game, with deceit, trickery and
occasional brutality. Also, the people around the world who most
appreciate its dark side are, by no coincidence, the ones who love
it most.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, soccer's biggest tactical blunder in America, some
sports experts say, has been to try to infiltrate the culture
through children. Millions of suburban kids out there in fussy
British-schoolboy shorts have given soccer deep associations with
moms and minivans and Saturday family obligations _ the very things
people go to sports bars to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-class Americans know soccer as a game played at nice
places, by nice kids,'' said Allen Guttmann, a professor of
American Studies at Amherst College who studies the role of sports
in culture. ``People in South America who shine mirrors in the
goalie's eyes know it's not about good sportsmanship. It's about
winning no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that soccer is not art, or that it's not
entertaining, but simply that it is often not what it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the way people get ``hurt'' in soccer.
When players run into each other on the soccer field, even in the
mildest of collisions, they roll around and writhe like they're
near death. What's that all about anyway? Are they wimps?
Americans, who have been schooled to value stoicism in all things
(especially in male pursuits), mostly still don't get this. If a
quarterback gets flattened by a 350-pound lineman in American
football, he's expected to lie there quietly and die, or get up and
play, but not to make too much a fuss about it either way. It's not
good form.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in soccer _ because the game, through its rules and
culture, places a premium on overacting. If an official can be
convinced through a player's faux death throes that an opponent did
something really odious, the offending player can be ejected from
the field, giving the actor's team a huge advantage. Football, by
contrast, has institutionalized grit by allowing only a grudging
15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness. In hockey, full-scale
assaults on an opponent are barely punished at all _ the offender
gets some time in the penalty box, much like a naughty 2-year-old
is sent to sit in time out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, soccer has been deliberately sold as a ``nice''
sport, clean to its core, which, again, probably sounds a little
wimpy to the average American fan. Once again, however, the myth
about soccer is misplaced. Real soccer players, when they think
they can get away with it, gouge and foul with the worst beasts of
football or basketball, though certainly with more subtlety than,
say, hockey's goons. In just the first round of games in the World
Cup, referees issued 15 red cards, each requiring the expulsion of
a player for committing a dangerous tackle. That's a higher level
of infractions than in 1994, when as many cards were issued during
the entire World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed games and connections with gamblers have also become an
issue in many countries as well. In the game's best interests,
these flaws should perhaps be advertised to Americans as plusses:
``Soccer _ not as wholesome as you think.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about the myth of the super-athlete? Is that really
something that serves soccer's interests? Over and over, we hear
that soccer players, what with all that running, are probably at
the pinnacle of fitness. Of course, they don't run all the time, as
anyone who has ever played the game, or even watched it, can see
right away. Players who are far from the ball mostly walk or stand
there waiting for the action to come to them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe soccer should publicize this as well. Some sports, after
all, thrive on tedium. The common sight of players standing around
doing nothing but scratching themselves and spitting certainly
doesn't seem to have hurt baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soccer's promoters seem intent on reaching for something
more, something nobler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much drama, so many side plots going on, that there
is a certain comparison to opera,'' said Alan Rothenberg, president
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, which oversees both amateur and
professional soccer. ``It's a combination of great ballet and great
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, and who knows? Maybe ballet will finally catch on with the
shot-and-beer crowd, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The potential nuclear arms race between India and
Pakistan is an uneasy and unwelcome test of how to get along in a
world where non-proliferation appears to have failed.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States and the Soviet Union confronted one
another at the beginning of the nuclear age, they faced a similar
test. With time, they stumbled into a doctrine of ``mutual assured
destruction,'' and it became their best guarantee of security. They
never used the ultimate weapon against one another. In fact, they
never fought directly in a hot war of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   So MAD _ the doctrine that two adversaries armed to the teeth
with nuclear weapons won't go to war because they know they can't
win one _ became as good a theory as the world had for how to make
a nuclear standoff stable.
</P>
<P>
   Can it work just as well between India and Pakistan as it did
between the United States and the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   Most of those in Washington who worry about such questions are,
unfortunately, gloomy. Like Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, they are working _ and hoping against hope _ to convince
the Indians and Pakistanis to stop where they are, halt testing and
refrain from turning their nuclear knowledge into weapons. That
hope was not bolstered last week when Congress, out of deference to
American farmers, voted to lift sanctions on grain sales to India
and Pakistan that had been intended to punish them for their
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, director of the Non-Proliferation Project at
the Carnegie Endowment, says that every time the Pentagon has
conducted a war game between a nuclear-armed India and Pakistan,
the result is a nuclear exchange, something that does not happen
between Iran and the United States or Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say it, but South Asia is fundamentally different
than the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Cirincione said.
``If both India and Pakistan deployed nuclear weapons, I think it
would almost certainly lead to a nuclear exchange in combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say senior U.S. officials and analysts, is not
India, per se, nor even the smaller and altogether more fragile
nation of Pakistan, but their history, proximity and relatively
primitive technology. All of these factors, they say, argue against
South Asia achieving the kind of stability that allowed Russians
and Americans to survive the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   These are powerful points. But each assumption about what is
most dangerous in a nuclear race is speculative rather than
demonstrated, because the world has not yet reached a point where
the theory fails.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the only standard of success available:
the Cold War. Even during those 40 years, there were some terribly
close calls, most notably during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when senior U.S. military officials urged President John F. Kennedy
to use nuclear weapons against the Soviets. That raises the
question of what role chance played in the decisions that kept the
peace once the brink of war was reached, and whether it is just
arrogance to say, in hindsight, that it was inevitable that the
Americans and Soviets, for reasons of culture and sophistication,
would pull back.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of racism or arrogance aside, there is general
agreement on the ways in which a nuclear-armed South Asia would
find it hard to manage confrontations in the same ways the Cold War
antagonists did. But the same facts can often be looked at in a
different way _ revealing not so much that the Indian subcontinent
is a safe place, but how little can be known about just what makes
a nuclear confrontation dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major reasons why some experts on the Cold War are
so worried about South Asia:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unlike India and Pakistan, Washington and Moscow share no
common border, let alone a disputed one, and had a considerable
buffer zone between them _ oceans in the first place, and Eastern
Europe in the second. This, the experts believe, gave Washington
and Moscow fewer flashpoints and more time for diplomatic maneuver
when tensions rose than India and Pakistan have. (On the other
hand, the very proximity of India and Pakistan could argue for more
caution, given the vagaries of fallout, if nothing else.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington and Moscow never fought one another, while the
Indians and Pakistanis, in 50 years of hostility, fought in 1948,
1965 and 1971. Even more unsettling, Indian and Pakistani troops
today face one another in the fiercely disputed territory of
Kashmir, shell each other's villages and fire on one another's
positions, and soldiers die. (On the other hand, both countries
have exercised considerable restraint since India carried out its
first nuclear test in 1974, and have not let tensions produce
another war.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington and Moscow developed a triad of nuclear weapons _
deliverable by rocket, plane and submarine _ that made real the
notion of mutually assured destruction. But with so few nuclear
devices, both Indian and Pakistani military planners have to fear a
successful first strike, or destruction of their nuclear capacity
by conventional attack. (On the other hand, the Cold War had an
equally uncertain beginning, and even today, the Russians take
seriously the threat of nuclear pre-emption by conventional cruise
missiles.)
</P>
<P>
   _ It took Washington and Moscow nearly 15 years to develop a
reliable command and control system for their nuclear weapons and a
reliable nuclear doctrine to go along with it. For the first four
years of the nuclear age, the United States was alone in having the
bomb, and for the next 10, there were no intercontinental missiles,
only bombers. So the two countries had the luxury of time to do
their planning and confidence-building. They built a formal means
of contacting one another in a crisis, including constantly
monitored hot lines. (On the other hand, in 1995, after the Soviet
Union collapsed, President Boris Yeltsin pulled out Russia's
equivalent of the nuclear football, containing launch codes, when
Russian warning systems interpreted the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket as a possible nuclear attack. The Russians had
lost a notification they received from the Norwegians, and experts
still wonder, uneasily, why the Russians were in such confusion.)
</P>
<P>
   Caveats aside, it is South Asia's lack of technological
sophistication that has experts and officials most concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries military people the most isn't detonation by
design, but by unauthorized use, screw-up and miscalculation, a
stray electron or misreading the screen,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies security.
``There have been in the past, for whatever reasons, major
explosions at ordnance factories in Pakistan. What if there was a
major explosion at a nuclear storage site, or a major accident at a
missile production or storage facility? What would be the pressures
then?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than discussing a sophisticated early warning system,
Krepon points out, India and Pakistan are talking of developing
nuclear-tipped missiles that can reach each other's major cities in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Washington and Moscow shouldn't just provide India and
Pakistan with the doctrine and equipment for safe deterrence,
Talbott scoffed at the idea of some ``manual'' for a South Asian
MAD. ``If they locked themselves into the mentality of MAD, they
will then be tempted into _ like us _ a considerable escalation of
the arms race,'' he said. Further tests would be followed by
weaponization and by deployment of missiles, ``and then we'd be off
to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may also be that in the new world of proliferation, even
for the best and brightest, the most successful balance of terror
may result from luck as much as doctrine. Having been lucky thus
far, there is no guarantee that the world will continue to be so
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just assemble all the risk factors and multiply it out,''
Cirincione said of South Asia. ``This is the most dangerous and
unstable military situation in the world.''

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Amid the turmoil here that has followed the
abrupt death of the opposition leader Moshood Abiola, there lurks a
simmering anger against the United States, which was so
conspicuously present at the moment of Abiola's demise Tuesday, but
generally absent as Nigeria had slipped into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where was America over the past four years while my husband
was in jail?'' asked a grief-stricken Mrs. Bosede Gloria Abiola as
she mourned at Mr. Abiola's home. ``America has done nothing and I
find it very strange and suspicious that at the very moment when he
died, American officials were watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Abiola's sentiments are by no means isolated. Femi Falana,
a prominent opposition lawyer well known at the U.S. Embassy here,
has gone as far as to demand the detention of the Undersecretary of
State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, who was with
Abiola when he died of what Nigerian authorities have called
cardiac arrest. ``He is needed here as a witness,'' Mr. Falana
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, grief and frustration are at fever pitch among
Abiola's followers, and America may be no more than a convenient
target. But the extraordinary shifts here over the past month _
from repressive dictatorship to tentative opening, from hope that
Abiola would be freed to disorientation at his loss _ have
underscored the challenge now being posed by Nigerians for America
to rethink its relationship with Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge is being posed most clearly by the very people
angriest about Abiola's death; beneath the expressions of suspicion
and resentment they direct at the United States lies a sense that a
closer involvement by Washington from now on may be Nigeria's best
hope for assuring a passage to democracy. Put bluntly, there is a
void here, and it seems that if America does not move to help fill
it, an already tense situation could become more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   While Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the new military leader, is
talking of ``the imperative'' of democracy, there are no credible
political parties, scant recent tradition of democracy, no
surviving figure with the breadth of appeal of Abiola and serious
ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole transition will be treacherous and will require an
international monitoring process in which the United States could
play a leading role,'' said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria lies at the distant antipode of Bill Clinton's ``new
Africa,'' the land of promise and economic change energetically
showcased on the president's recent visit to several African
states. Indeed this country, which Clinton avoided, amounts to
towering testimony to just how deep into misery a potentially
wealthy nation can be dragged by mismanagement, corruption and
oppression.
</P>
<P>
   There is' no gas at the pumps here although Nigeria is a major
exporter of oil, earning over $10 billion a year in hard currency
from oil sales. Per capita annual income has fallen to about $250.
Power cuts are frequent; some telephone lines simply lie collapsed
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Street hawkers sell everything from bifocals to calculators in a
bid to get by. Markets sell slabs of meat beside open sewage in
central Lagos. The education system, once one of Africa's best, is
falling apart. ``Nobody wants to be a teacher,'' commented a weary
Lagos resident. ``Everyone wants to be a customs officer because of
the bribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such disintegration _ moral, social and economic _ reflects the
five years of ruinous rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died suddenly
last month of what was officially called a heart attack. The United
States imposed sanctions on Nigeria while the the general ruled,
and called periodically for Abiola's release after he was
imprisoned in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with Abacha already dead, Pickering came to press
personally for Abiola's release _ but, in the words of one official
here, ``he scarcely managed to get past the formalities.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, what America did not do over the past few years
that made some Nigerians simmer with the anger they expressed when
Abiola died. While Abiola was in jail, U.S. calls for his release
were not accompanied by any insistence that Nigeria should respect
the results of the presidential election that Abiola appeared to
have won when the army annulled it in 1993. A certain U.S.
ambivalence about the opposition leader often seemed to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration avoided invoking the most potent
potential weapon of protest _ U.S. sanctions on Nigeria's oil
exports. Indeed, U.S. oil companies sharply increased their
investments here to about $7 billion during the Abacha years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Americanism is a source of concern,'' said one
official in Lagos. ``It is not that widespread, but it is more
widespread than I would like to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, for many Nigerians, the most tangible contribution the
United States could now make would be to coax Abubakar to adopt a
fairly rapid timetable for a shift to democracy and then oblige him
to stick to it. The General has made clear that he wants to get
sanctions lifted _ particularly those that prevent Nigeria from
buying military spare parts. That seems to give the United States
some leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's new ruler attended military training programs in the
United States and officials said he is generally viewed as well
disposed toward Washington. For now, he appears to have convinced
U.S. officials of his good faith.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears to loom for the Clinton administration, in this
nation of 105 million people, is a critical test of the relative
weight it gives to its political and economic interests. The U.S.
investments here in oil are huge, and to be viable they depend on
stability. But the promised Nigerian shift to democracy will be an
inherently unstable process.

<P>
   In writing, ``Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,''
Shakespeare couldn't have imagined the likes of Nicholas II,
Russia's last czar, whose remains will be interred Friday in St.
Petersburg along with those of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was considered a lightweight, a weak, unengaged but
brutal ruler who preferred family life to affairs of state, even as
the 300-year-old Romanov empire was collapsing around him.
</P>
<P>
   His burial, however, is a potent political symbol for
post-communist Russia. Taking place 80 years to the day after the
Bolsheviks executed him along with Czarina Alexandra and their son
and four daughters, it will implicity censure the communist era by
acknowledging the imperial murders that ushered it in.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivities are such that the ceremony will not be
attended by President Boris Yeltsin, who ordered the Romanov bone
fragments dug up from a forest in the Urals seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is commemorating the last Romanovs in other ways too _
notably in an exhibition of imperial artifacts that opens in
Wilmington, Del., on Aug. 1, at the start of a three-city American
tour. It includes recently disclosed letters and diaries, many
never published, covering the family's final months.
</P>
<P>
   Even as their end loomed, they show little awareness in their
diaries. ``There is no indication of their lives as political
beings,'' said Robert Steven Bianchi, a curator and planner of the
tour. ``It is the mundane affairs of a family that is very close.''
Excerpts follow, from translations in the exhibition catalog (Harry
N. Abrams, New York, in association with Booth-Clibborn Editions,
London).
</P>
<P>
   _ By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Nicholas was a reluctant czar. On his
accession after his father's death, he wrote in 1894 that it was
``the very worst thing has happened to me.'' He frequently
submitted to the wishes of Alexandra _ even more out of touch with
national life than he was. On Dec. 14, 1916, with the monarchy
teetering during World War I, she wrote to Nicholas at his
headquarters on the Western front:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Be Peter the Great, be Ivan the Terrible, be Emperor Paul _ and
smash the lot of them. Do not laugh. . . . I am desperate to see
you like this with these people who are trying to control you. Show
them the fist. Prove yourself a sovereign. You are the autocrat and
they should not dare forget it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On Feb. 24, 1917, he wrote to her, ``My mind
is at rest here _ no ministers and no tiresome questions.'' But
Bolshevik-supported unrest in the capital, St. Petersburg (then
Petrograd), was worsening. En route to the city by train on March
2, Nicholas wrote in his diary:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Ruzsky (a senior general) came in the morning and read me his
long telephone conversation with Rodzianko (the president of the
Duma, or Parliament). In his words, the situation in Petrograd is
such that at present a ministry from the Duma is powerless to do
anything, because they are opposed by the social democrat party in
the guise of the workers' committee.
</P>
<P>
   My abdication is necessary. Ruzsky communicated his conversation
to headquarters and Alekseyev (the supreme commander) to all the
commanders-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   By about 2:30 answers had arrived from all. The crux of the
matter is that it is necessary to take this step, for the sake of
Russia's salvation and of maintaining calm in the army at the
front. I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The draft manifesto was sent out from headquarters. In the
evening Gutchkov and Shulgrin (senior Duma members sent to seek his
abdication) arrived from Petrograd, and after talking to them, I
handed over the signed and recopied manifesto. I left Pskov
(southwest of St. Petersburg, where he actually abdicated) at one
o'clock at night, with a heavy heart. All around is betrayal,
cowardice and deceit!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)With his abdication, power passed to Grand
Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich, his brother, who renounced the throne
the next day, ending the monarchy. On March 3, Nicholas wrote:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Misha has abdicated. His manifesto concludes
with a call for elections for a constituent assembly within six
months. God knows who advised him to sign such a vile document. In
Petrograd the disturbances have stopped _ long may it remain that
way.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On March 7, 1917, the new provisional
government ordered the arrest of Nicholas II and his wife. The
family was subsequently held in a house in Yekaterinburg, in the
Ural Mountains. Nicholas' diary entries in his final months, in the
custody of the Bolsheviks, deal with domestic concerns like
illnesses of three Romanov children (Olga, Tatiana and Alexei) and
reflect the family's humbled circumstances:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 2, 1918:
</P>
<P>
   German measles has been confirmed (in the girls), but
fortunately they both feel all right today. The day was gray, not
cold but with a strong wind. We go into the garden but there's no
work to do. Today I was bored to tears!
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 3:
</P>
<P>
   Alexei also started German measles, but quite mildly. Olga and
Tatiana are feeling better; the latter even got up. It snowed all
day. The detachment guards' committee instructed me to remove my
epaulettes to avoid being insulted or attacked in the town. It's
beyond comprehension!
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 27:
</P>
<P>
   We are going to have to considerably reduce our expenditures on
household supplies and staff, as the department of appanages
(supporting the royal family) is being closed down from March 1,
added to which we are only allowed to receive 600 rubles a month
each from our personal capital. For the last few days we have been
busy calculating the minimum that will allow us to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Alexei, 13, the hemophiliac son whose
illness preoccupied his parents, also kept a diary. On March 4,
1918, he related how guards interfered with some winter fun:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Spent the whole day like yesterday. In the afternoon I played
with Kolia (his nurse) and made a wooden dagger with my knife.
Kolia too. Later we attacked each other. In the evening the
soldiers destroyed the ice mountain, so we can't slide. We were
told so by the commandant.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)His father was also angered by the guards'
action, for a different reason. He wrote in his diary the next
day:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   This morning we saw from the window that the little mountain has
been destroyed; it appears that the idiotic detachment committee
decided to do this in order to stop us climbing up onto it and
looking over the fence!
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On March 13, the deposed monarch
acknowledges small kindnesses:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A similar day with 12 degrees of frost. I finished ``Anna
Karenina'' and began reading Lermontov. Sawed a lot of wood with
Tatiana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days we have begun to receive butter, coffee,
cakes for tea and jams, from various kind people who have heard
that our expenditure on food has been reduced. How touching!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)But by May 14 the Bolsheviks were tightening
restrictions on the family's movements:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Today we were told by Botkin (a doctor) that we are only to be
allowed one hour's walk a day; in answer to the question, ``Why?''
the commandant's stand-in replied, ``So that it should be more like
a prison regime.'' At least they have brought us a samovar, so we
don't have to depend on the guards.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)On July 13, three days before the Romanovs'
execution, Nicholas' last diary entry betrays little amiss:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Alexei took his first bath since Tobolsk; his knee is getting
better, but he cannot straighten it completely. The weather is warm
and pleasant. We have absolutely no news from the outside.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)July 16, Alexandra's last diary entry:(END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (Niece) Irena's 23d birthday. Gray morning, later lovely
sunshine. Baby has a slight cold. All went out {-hour in the
morning. Olga and I arrange our medicines. Tatiana read spiritual
readings.
</P>
<P>
   They went out. Tatiana stayed with me and we read: The Book of
the prophet Amos and prophet Audios.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning the commandant comes to our rooms: at last after a
week brought eggs again for Baby. 8 supper. Suddenly Lenka Sednev
(the kitchen boy) was fetched to go and see his uncle and flew off
_ wonder whether it's true and we shall see the boy back again!
Played bezique (a card game) with Nicky. 10:30 to bed. 15 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Yakov Yurovsky, the guards' commander, later
wrote that he called a firing squad together at about 11 o'clock
that night. Guards awoke the family and told them that they were to
go to the cellar because of unrest in town. ``The Romanovs did not
suspect a thing,'' he wrote. In his written testimony, the
commander also wrote: ``It's no easy matter to arrange an
execution, contrary to what some people think. After all, this
wasn't the front, but a so-called peaceful environment.''(END

   LA PAZ, Bolivia _ All around Latin America, book stores are well
stocked with new texts about free markets and global free trade.
Such books brim with hope for the future, and they are beginning to
appear even in this backwater capital high in the Andes. But here,
they still have to share shelf space with a rather depressing
best-seller that carries a very different message.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published in 1937, is Alcides Arguedas' ``A Sick
People,'' and it seems at times that every literate Bolivian has
read it. It indicts Bolivia's history and national character as a
blight of corruption, provincialism and racial hatred, a synthesis
of ``laziness, poverty, barbarism.'' That conclusion, and the
book's abiding popularity, highlight the challenges that the global
free-market revolution faces here.
</P>
<P>
   As that revolution is increasingly accepted around the world as
the wave of the future, Bolivia's experience also can serve as a
lesson for other countries _ Cambodia and Congo, for example _ that
are also plagued by intractable geographical disadvantages, caste
structures and unstable political histories. The lesson is the
limits of the miracles promised by global free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Toranzo Roca, a prominent Bolivian economist, sums up the
lesson this way: ``You don't eradicate centuries of structural
social inequalities with 4 percent growth rates.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is exactly what a series of Bolivian governments
has tried to do since 1985, with the help of American economic
advisers including Jeffrey Sachs, the director of Harvard
University's Institute for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the results have been spectacular. First,
the government tackled a 24,000 percent annual inflation rate by
slashing its budget and subsidies, and instituting property and
value-added taxes. The inflation rate was reduced to single digits
virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income, which had fallen by 30 percent between 1985
and 1990, began to climb an average of between 4 and 5 percent a
year, and with economic stability came political stability. The
nearly ritualistic annual coups that Bolivia had suffered through
for more than a century were replaced by a series of clean,
peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last Bolivian government ceded a controlling share of the
government oil, railroad, electricity, telephone and airline
monopolies to foreign corporations and overhauled the country's tax
and pension systems, diversifying the economy and boosting savings
rates in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soften political opposition to the privatization, the
government put large minority holdings in the firms into a private
pension trust fund that is beginning to pay all Bolivians older
than 65 a modest annuity. Foreign investment is blossoming, and a
new pipeline will soon deliver natural gas to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of globalization are popping up in the most unlikely
places. Indian trinket stands in La Paz are beginning to accept
American Express cards. Peasant union leaders now wear cellular
telephones on their belts. A fading mural depicting a defiant Che
Guevara on the campus of the national university now pales
alongside a bright new Coca Cola advertisement. Bolivia, where most
people still drink coca tea and a high-octane maize liquor called
chicha, is even beginning to export wine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the results remain mixed for the great majority of poor
Bolivians.
</P>
<P>
   The average Bolivian still earns $900 a year, less than
one-fifth what the average Argentine or Chilean earns, and few of
the poor can expect to live long enough to see the benefits of
economic growth trickle down to transform their existence into
anything like a middle class lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   While the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz are
booming with new condominiums, banks and McDonald's franchises, the
rural Indian highlands continue to fall behind. Foreign investors
can't be enticed to build factories in mountain areas where
shipping costs are prohibitive, where even a third-grade education
is unusual and where only 1 percent of the people have finished
high school. More than half of all Bolivians speak Indian dialects
as their first language and many speak no Spanish at all. Forty
percent of the children in La Paz are chronically undernourished.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the lower classes have made no progress.
While life expectancy at birth remains a miserably low 60 years,
that is a major improvement over the 42 years that an infant born
in 1960 was expected to live. Only 55 percent of the population
currently has access to potable water, but in 1975 only 34 percent
did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this amount of progress is not enough to stem the
widening of the income gap between rich and poor, and particularly
between city dwellers and rural Indians _ although it apparently
has helped lend Bolivia a semblance of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to sustained economic growth is education, and you
can't educate a country overnight,'' conceded Vice President Jorge
Fernando Quiroga Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The new government of President Hugo Banzer Suarez is planning a
rural literacy campaign, and has proposed steps to help poor people
acquire loans. But with the region's economies beginning to slow in
the wake of the Asian financial crisis, no new economic boom is
anywhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Another intractable problem is Bolivia's virtual inability to
ship by sea, given the fact that its access to the Pacific Ocean
was lost in a war with Chile over 100 years ago, and the two
countries have not forgiven each other. Bolivia and Chile still do
not have diplomatic relations, leaving Bolivia dependent on
unreliable mountain roads and expensive air traffic to export its
goods.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably not any more economic policy dials that can
be easily turned in Bolivia,'' Sachs acknowledged. ``You can do
marvelous reforms, but still have very significant problems in
achieving a rapid improvement of living standards.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing economic reform can't change is history.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's Andean remoteness protected its Indians from the
European smallpox and plague that decimated most of Latin America's
indigenous populations. So a large Indian population remained to be
exploited by the Spanish colonizers as miners and tenant farmers,
and what emerged was a highly stratified society wracked by class
strife.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia was so unruly with caste and Indian wars that its
namesake, Simon Bolivar, fled it in disgust after he wrote a
constitution inspired by the most enlightened European ideals. The
constitution survived on paper, but the society went through more
than 250 rebellions and military coups over the next 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   A longstanding joke among neighboring Argentines compared
Bolivia to a long-playing record: ``33 revolutions a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The quip now seems as dated as the phonograph itself, but many
vestiges of class conflict survive.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. government's 1997 human rights report on
Bolivia, ``some rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of
virtual slavery by employers who charge them more for room and
board than they earn.'' A system of child servitude known as
criadito survives in which Indian parents indenture their
pre-adolescent children to middle- and upper-income families to
perform household chores. Many of the children are badly abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolivia has made tremendous progress,'' said Herbert Klein, a
Columbia University historian who specializes in Bolivia, ``but it
starts from an incredibly backward base compared to everyone else
in Latin America.'' And with virtually every other country in Latin
America following the same successful economic policies, there is
no reason to believe Bolivia will catch up with its neighbors any
time soon.

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ President Clinton launched his $1

program the ``Anti-Drug Media Campaign,'' as if all problems can be
solved with the right spin in the right ads. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   NELSON-MANDELA (San Antonio) _ The world's greatest man turns 80
years old Saturday. A decade ago, it would have been deemed

South Africa. By CARY CLACK.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Eleven years ago, CBS-TV's ``60
Minutes'' questioned whether justice was for sale in Texas. Well,
the national television program is back, and guess what? The
state's judicial campaign finance system remains as troubling an
ethical question _ and fodder for national entertainment _ as ever.
By CLAY ROBISON
</P>
<P>
   TEENAGE-DRIVERS (San Antonio) _ As more teen-agers die in
traffic accidents, I'm convinced teens aren't prepared to drive.

a proposal for a graduated license system. It was one that would
impose restrictions, then ease them as teen-agers gained more
experience behind the wheel. By VERONICA FLORES.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE-CONG (San Francisco) _ When CNN and TIME magazine reported
in June that a U.S. Special Forces unit dropped sarin nerve gas at
an encampment in Laos in order to kill U.S. military defectors, I

any journalist could buy the notion that 20 American military
defectors would somehow show up at the same secret place. By BOB
ARMSTRONG.
</P>
<P>
   FILIPINOS-ELECTION (San Francisco) _ When the newly elected
president of the Philippines heralded his office as ``Ang araw ng

<P>
   Look around at the stars today who have paid attention to the
warnings about overexposure to the sun. Madonna, Sharon Stone and
Kim Basinger, among others, are preserving their beauty by
carefully protecting their skin.
</P>
<P>
   How, once and for all, do you really protect yourself against
the sun?
</P>
<P>
   Ultraviolet-A and ultraviolet-B rays are the sun's harmful rays,
the ones that cause skin cancer and premature wrinkling, and you
can't look for them, because they're invisible. They emanate
directly from the sun, they're reflected from water, sand and snow,
and they're a threat even on cloudy summer days.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you can attract rays and harm your skin simply
by sitting unprotected under a beach umbrella. To protect
themselves, many people follow the conventional wisdom that says a
sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 will screen out
these harmful rays.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with sunscreen lotions, however, is that they do
just that: screen the sun. They cannot effectively provide a
barricade any more than a window screen will keep out a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   For true protection, what you want instead is a sunblock, the
only true barrier against the sun. Read the label. If a sunblock
contains either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, it's a sunblock
that will effectively block the sun. If it doesn't, it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Sunblocks have come a long way since the white pastes that you
used to see plastered over lifeguards' noses. Today, the better
brands blend into the skin, look natural, and provide great
coverage--all the criteria you need.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, apply a thin layer carefully, using a makeup
sponge to blend. (Important: don't forget to apply carefully to the
backs of your hands, one of the first places to reveal those age
spots caused by the sun.) Reapply, in general, every couple of
hours you're out in the sun, and definitely after swimming or
perspiring heavily, after gardening, say, or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the great brands available at most drugstores are Bain de
Soleil's All Day Waterproof, Johnson &AMP; Johnson Sundown, Blockout by
Vaseline Intensive Care, A-FIL cream total block and Oil of Olay
Dily UV Protectant Beauty Fluid, which has an SPF of 15, contains
titanium dioxide, and is also a moisturizer.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the same sunblock on both face and body, although I
myself prefer to use the heavier blocks on the body, and the
lighter cosmetic blocks like Oil of Olay on the face.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you'll want to ``accessorize'' for the sun. Sun
visors in vibrant colors are a protective must for playing tennis,
biking, gardening. J. Peterman makes a great Panama hat; the
``Gauguin'' model, very wide and floppy, is available by calling
1-800-231-7341.
</P>
<P>
   Any tightly woven, oversized cotton shirt will deflect the sun
some, but Travel Smith catalog (1-800-950-1600) offers terrific
``air conditioned'' protective shirts for both men and women.
They're lightweight and cool enough for swimming in. (Be sure to
tie at the waist first, for a sleek look.)
</P>
<P>
   Any tightly woven cotton shirt worn at the beach protects--and
presents a classic Katherine Hepburn image. Turn up the collar to
protect your neck, and leave the cuffs long to protect your hands.
 &UR; Help for Hair &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can also protect your hair before going to the beach by
using a hot oil treatment such as Alberto VO5, sold in any
drugstore, or the Super Luxurious Intense Hydrating Oil Treatment
by Phytogie.
</P>
<P>
   A home alternative is a 20-minute application of warmed
vegetable or olive oil, washing well afterward since these oils
aren't water soluble. With any treatment, be sure to wrap a hot
towel over your head to keep the heat in.
</P>
<P>
   For further protection, Phytogie also offers a fabulous product
called Sun Protection Oil, which does just that. Apply before
sunning or swimming. And where a hat whenever you can.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to dress as carefully for the sun--summer and
winter--as you would for the bitter cold. And start your children
on the same thoughtful sun-protective regimen as soon as they're
exposed. You can definitely have your sun, as long as you protect
yourself against it, too. &QL; 
 &UR; (Gale Hayman is the author of ``How Do I Look?'' and co-founder of
the Giorgio boutique in Beverly Hills.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ---------
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: SUMMER MAKEUP
</P>
<P>
   To layer makeup for summer, always start by applying your sun
block first--even if your makeup has an SPF factor. Apply it on
clean, dry skin, and give it ample time to let it dry.
</P>
<P>
   The next layer is your moisturizer. If your skin is oily to
begin with, it will be oilier in the summer, so one trick is to
dilute your foundation with your moisturizer for a lighter feel.
Dry skin needs its own layer of moisturizer, always.
</P>
<P>
   Next curl your eyelashes with an old-fashioned eyelash curler
from the drugstore, whether or not you're planning to wear mascara.
This will open up your eyes, actually lift the face, and it's a
step far too many women skip.
</P>
<P>
   (Another way to make your eyes look bigger is to apply a dot of
concealer in the corner of the eye socket and pat it in, which
brings the eye out where otherwise it tends to recede.)
</P>
<P>
   To create your own bronzing makeup, test your favorite
foundation in a shade three or four times deeper than your natural
color, blending it well with a damp makeup sponge. Blending is
key--be sure to ease the sponge into hairline, chin, neck, and--as
the pros do in Southern California--over the earlobes; white
earlobes against a glowing face are a giveaway every time!
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to go with a bronzer, they're available in powder
form or, my favorite, creme powder form, which is applied with a
damp sponge just like foundation and covers quickly and well. (The
powders are applied like blush, with a big fat brush all over the
face, under the chin, and over the eyelids.) Choose a tone that's
neither too red nor too orange, and apply it in bright natural
light to check the color.

<P>
   As for lip color, start by defining the lips with a nude-colored
lip pencil. For a natural look, fill in the lips with the same
pencil, then add a touch of lip gloss--long lasting and utterly
carefree. For a dressier occasion, go with brighter lip color, a
light, clear red, pink, or coral offsets a golden tan beautifully,
even if it's a tan from a bottle. --Gale Hayman

<P>
   The call came in while the lingering effects of the
Romanee-Conti '59 let loose its grip on the back of my neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia Roberts needs your help,'' said the voice. ``Thursday?
2:30?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to cancel some overdue knee surgery, but I guess I
can be there,'' I said, rubbing the last of the Romanee away.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what the call was about then, but I had my
suspicions. Somebody in my racket has to read the entertainment
pages now and then. I knew Roberts, who had come off a few bombs,
was trying for a comeback with a movie in which she would play a
New York restaurant critic. I guessed she wanted to pick my brain,
but I don't work cheap.
</P>
<P>
   I gave the woman on the phone my price, telling her, ``I could
always go ahead with the knee surgery instead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, with a grudging resignation in her voice.
``Just make sure you're here for the full hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was five minutes late for the meeting. Dressed in
bluejeans and a tank top that fit her like paint on a Corvette, she
had a handshake as determined as any Hollywood studio head, but
softer around the fleshy part of the palm.
</P>
<P>
   She showed me into her office, lit a cigarette, and said, ``So
you're the guy who's going to spill the beans on how I should act
like a restaurant critic. You know, I already played a waitress in
`Mystic Pizza.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see that one,'' I replied, ``But I'll tell you what I
can tell you. You tell me about this movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said it was called ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' and she
played a New York restaurant critic out to sabotage her best
friend's upcoming wedding in Chicago. I told her she didn't look
like any New York restaurant critic I knew. ``Well,'' she shrugged,
``things are different in the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first thing, you shouldn't be smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do it to keep my weight down,'' she replied, blowing smoke
over her pretty left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe so,'' I said, ``But it'll kill you. More important,
it'll screw up your taste buds. What you can't taste, you can
criticize. And in New York the law says you can't smoke in a
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it under advisement. Here's the script. Give it a
look- see.''
</P>
<P>
   She tossed the blue-covered script on my lap, I opened to the
first page and started reading. It soon became clear that Roberts
was only required to act like a restaurant critic for the first two
minutes of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K., well right off the bat there are a few things wrong
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' she asked, coming around the desk and leaning
over to look at the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, right here you tell the captain hovering over
you what you're going to write about the food. They're not even
supposed to know you're there much less inquire what you think of
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K., what else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tools of the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What tools?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the first thing you do as a restaurant critic is to go
out and buy one of these pen flashlights. Two reasons for that:
Some restaurants are very dark and you can't see the color and
presentation of the dish. Second, you may want to take notes as
soon as you get outside and into a dark taxi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good point. What else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the same key chain, carry one of these.'' I held up a
small, two-inch long thermometer I picked up at a sporting goods
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with that, check out the temperature in the
refrigerator?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you never go into the kitchen, although you might pass it
by and peek in on one of your two, deliberate trips to the rest
room. A woman can make three trips, as long as you come back with
fresh lipstick. The reason you carry a thermometer is to check the
temperature in the dining room. Anything over 75 degrees is too
hot-- which most restaurants are--and anything under 70 is too
cold. That way, you can prove to a captain or maitre d' that the
place is too hot or cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're getting somewhere,'' she said, with that huge smile
of hers showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so. OK, now a restaurant critic is a person paid to be
finicky and to challenge the staff, as long as you back it up. So
you specify every dish you order to be cooked to a certain degree
of doneness, like medium-rare for lamb chops, almost translucent
for a fish, al dente for pasta, tender but not soft for vegetables,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should ask where the ingredients come from. Lobster tails
and shrimp are always frozen, so ask about them and try to trip the
waiter up. Question whether they think a particular vegetable or
fruit is in season, and, if you know it's not, ask where they're
shipped in from. Ask if the salmon is smoked on the premises, and
if not, what ocean it swam in from. Atlantic salmon is always
better than Pacific salmon, but I'm sure you knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure,'' she muttered, as a slight sweat broke out on her
brow. ``What about wines?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the wine list, check the highest and lowest
priced bottles on the list. If there are more wines above $40 than
below, the place is trying to coerce you into buying a big buck
bottle, which are probably marked up outrageously. Matter of fact,
it's good to keep a slip of paper in your pocket with some familiar
wines written down with their retail prices, then compare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a reasonable markup?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure this: A restaurant pays about half of what you pay at
retail for a bottle of wine. You pay $20 at a wine shop, the
restaurant bought it from a distributor for $10. The price on the
wine list is $40. Now, that's a 100 percent markup on the retail
price, but it's actually 200 percent above his price. Most
restaurants charge 200, some even 300 percent, above retail, which
is 600 percent wholesale. Go figure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' she said, placing her hand on my wrist. ``That's
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is crazy, Ms. Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me Julia,'' she said. Then, ``Go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine glasses must be inspected,'' I said. ``When you're paying
top dollar for a good wine, you should be drinking it in a good,
thin wineglass. They should, er, ping! when you flick them with
your finger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean like crystal Baccarat?'' she purred, trying to show
some savoir faire about things she could easily afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't need to be,'' I countered. ``A restaurateur can pick
up great, hand-blown very thin glassware for three or four bucks a
pop. Don't let them tell they can't afford good glasses because the
dishwasher is always breaking them. Get a new dishwasher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pretty tough,'' she said breathlessly. ``I like that in
a restaurant critic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Same with silverware. Pick up the fork, feel it in your hand,
see if it has some heft to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a golf club.''
</P>
<P>
   The light through the Venetian blinds crawled across the script.
``I haven't much time left,'' I said, ``but there are a few things
more I'd like you to keep in mind.'' She just nodded, very slightly
and bit her lower lip a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever let them shunt you to the bar if your table's not
ready, unless they offer to buy you a drink. Otherwise, just stand
right next to the maitre d's desk and don't budge. They'll seat you
pronto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if they give a lousy table?'' she asked, like someone who
had never been given a lousy table in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask for a better one, but you don't throw your weight
around. See, here on page two, where the maitre d' says to your
character, `How does it feel to have your ass kissed by every
maitre d' in New York?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's a funny line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never happen,'' I shot back. ``Even if they know you, they'd
never make a crack like that. I'd take it out of the script.
Pronto.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a sap I believed her, and I said good-bye, receiving the
same firm handshake as when we'd met an hour before, only this time
there was something more familiar in it.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot about the movie, but not about Julia Roberts, in the
months that followed, then all of a sudden I started seeing the ads
for ``My Best friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   I bought a ticket to a late screening and took a seat to the
rear. The movie opens, there's Julia Roberts striding into a dining
room, with shots of the kitchen staff--filmed at Charly Trotter's
in Chicago--going nuts because they know she's there to review
them. And, jeez, damned if she hadn't cut out that dumb line I
objected to. But she kept on smoking throughout the movie.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled to myself, watched the rest of the movie, and got up to
leave. Then I turned halfway around to watch the credits roll by.
Past the assistant directors, past the make-up guy, past the grip
and best boy, even past the ``Lenses by Panaflex,'' and the thanks
to the city of Chicago. I know I didn't miss my name going by,
because it wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged, murmured to myself, ``Some dames. You tell 'em all
your secrets, they use them, then they don't even thank you.'' So I
tossed the rest of my Junior Mints in the wastebasket and walked
out of the theater into the rain. &QL;

 Includes a color slide of Steven Spielberg directing a scene from
``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine that you're a film director so uniquely successful that
not one, not two, but four of your films were included on the
American Film Institute's recently released honor role of the 100
best American films ever.
 &HT;    Would you high-five your cameraman? Slam-dunk your director's
chair? Declare yourself king of the world?
 &HT;    Steven Spielberg tried to give two of them back.
 &HT;    It seems that a couple of his favorites _ a Preston Sturges
comedy and a Marx Brothers romp _ had been omitted.
 &HT;    ``I was honored to be on the list,'' he says, ``but I
immediately called the AFI and volunteered two of my films back in
exchange for two others. I told them they could have `Jaws' (1975)
and `Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) back in exchange for
`Sullivan's Travels' (1941) and `A Night at the Opera' (1935).''
 &HT;    Well, he'd still have ``ET'' (1980) and ``Schindler's List''
(1993) _ not a bad double play in anyone's book.
 &HT;    Best of all, and unlike such AFI peers as Alfred Hitchcock,
Frank Capra and John Ford, Spielberg isn't even dead. At 51, in
fact, he's at the peak of his career, wrapping up a period of
remarkable productivity that has produced three movies back to
back, including ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' (1997),
``Amistad'' (1997) and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the World War II
epic that stars Tom Hanks and opens on July 24.
 &HT;    Oh, and he has his own movie studio, Dreamworks SKG.
 &HT;    All this, and it's still a hobby. As a father of seven, he's
bound by the terms of a longstanding deal with Kate Capshaw, the
lovely actress who is his wife,
 &HT;    ``My job is that I do carpool and I make breakfast every
morning,'' he says. ``You know, those two things are my real
careers. Then I go to work.''
 &HT;    Currently, work brings him to Los Angeles' Ritz Carlton Hotel,
where he's doing a rare round of interviews to promote ``Saving
Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    He doesn't look much like a Hollywood powerhouse, however, in
his jeans, black-and-white tennis shoes and a tattered
brown-leather jacket. In fact, with wire-rimmed glasses framing a
warm, kind face, he looks rather like a college professor.
 &HT;    The topic of today's seminar is World War II, the setting for
``Private Ryan'' as well as several other Spielberg films,
including the disastrous ``1941'' (1979), the epic ``Empire of the
Sun'' (1987) and, of course, the Oscar-winning ``Schindler's
List.''
 &HT;    Oh, and one more: ``Fighter Squadron,'' a low-budget affair he
directed at age 15.
 &HT;    ``That was my first air-to-air-combat film,'' Spielberg says,
laughing. ``The budget was about a hundred dollars. I remember for
the bomb explosions, I got firecrackers. My mother wanted to kill
me.''
 &HT;    He acknowledges that maybe it was strange for a young boy
growing up in Phoenix to be so obsessed with war, even if his
father, Arnold Spielberg, was a veteran who had fought on Guam as a
sharpshooter.
 &HT;    ``My Dad is 82 now, and he fought in World War II,'' the
director says. ``I didn't know who to believe _ my Dad and his
friends, or the war movies Hollywood was making? I chose to believe
the war movies. My Dad's stories were so outrageously harsh to me.
 &HT;    ``He would tell me about the freezing cold and just the
suffering and how they had to endure watching their friends die,''
Spielberg recalls. ``War always fascinated me because, I think, at
the core of every war is this question of how far we can be pushed
and how deep you can reach down in your soul to walk those extra 10
miles in the morning. It still amazes me how the human spirit is
endless.''
 &HT;    This isn't the prettified war of 1940s films, in short. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' was reportedly involved in a ratings controversy,
rare in that it was about extreme violence, not sex or nudity.
Ultimately the film received an R rating, though some observers
whispered that a less influential director would have drawn the
commercially hazardous NC-17.
 &HT;    ``That whole thing is not true,'' Spielberg says heatedly. ``I
didn't get any special favors. We got the R rating. We were never
going to get an NC-17.''
 &HT;    The director freely admits that the film is very violent.
 &HT;    ``It's a war movie,'' he says with a patient sigh. ``I really
wanted to give the audience a physical experience.''
 &HT;    So important was it to him, he insists, that if he'd been hit
with an NC-17 rating, he'd have still refused to make cuts.
 &HT;    ``I would have taken the NC-17,'' he says. ``I would have taken
the rating without protest.''
 &HT;    This isn't the kind of movie that the young Spielberg grew up
watching. Lonely as the only boy among four children, he was drawn
to movies from an early age.
 &HT;    As a child, he recalls, he would stage his own horror movies by
pulling off the heads of his sisters' dolls, carefully placing them
on a dish and garnishing them with lettuce and tomato. Bigger
budgets _ and an indulgent mother _ led him to ``Fighter Squadron''
and, seemingly inevitably, to ``Private Ryan.''
 &HT;    His own children _ 13-year-old Max, his son with ex-wife Amy
Irving, Capshaw's 21-year-old Jessica and the couple's own five
children, 9-year-old Theo, 8-year-old Sasha, 6-year-old Sawyer,
2-year-old Mikaela and 1-year-old Destry _ don't seem to share his
interest in moviemaking, despite gifts of video cameras and such.
 &HT;    ``None of them cares about it, and I have seven kids,''
Spielberg laments.
 &HT;    Then he brightens.
 &HT;    ``The two babies don't know about it yet,'' he says hopefully.
 &HT;    Spielberg's passion for movies has led him to be one of the most
productive filmmakers of his generation, and he has a long list of
projects in mind, from a Tom Cruise film to a fourth Indiana Jones
picture. But the repercussions of fame have led him to plan a
couple of years off in the not-too-distant future.
 &HT;    ``I've heard I'm part of a government conspiracy to make America
and the rest of the world conducive to accepting an alien
neighbor,'' Spielberg says, laughing, ``and that's why I really
made `ET' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977).
 &HT;    ``I love it, but the answer is no.''
 &HT;    More seriously, he recently was forced to testify in court
against a stalker who had threatened his family.
 &HT;    ``I don't really want to talk about it,'' the director says,
``except to say that I'm glad it's over.''
 &HT;    Spielberg has long been noted for his childlike imagination, a
sense of wonder which has fueled many of his most successful films.
But when he turned 50 last year, with ``Schindler's List'' and
``Amistad'' behind him and ``Private Ryan'' underway, many wondered
if their more serious tone meant that Hollywood's wunderkind was at
last feeling his age.
 &HT;    ``Turning 40 was really hard for me,'' he recalls. ``I had all
my midlife concerns. It was a terrible, terrible birthday where you
start to feel like you're getting old.
 &HT;    ``You know what? Fifty sucked, too.''
 &HT;    In retrospect, he says, he finds himself facing the question
that Private Ryan himself grapples with: Have I been a good man?
 &HT;    ``I think everybody asks that question at one time or another:
Have I been a good person?'' he says. ``It's a question we should
ask ourselves, not when we're really old and standing in the
cemetery. It's the kind of question we need to ask ourselves every
day of our life.''

 Includes a color slide of Christina Applegate with Lloyd Bridges
and Jay Mohr in a scene from ``Mafia.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Goodbye blue-collar bimbo, hello Madam President. That's one way
to sum up the career of actress Christina Applegate.
 &HT;    As the blond, bare-bellied Kelly Bundy on the long-running Fox
series, ``Married ... With Children,'' Applegate won legions of
fans _ as well as an image as a trashy, empty-headed beauty. In the
year since that series was canceled, the 26-year-old has been busy
on film sets trying to change that image.
 &HT;    Her latest effort is ``Mafia,'' a spoof of gangster classics
such as ``The Godfather'' (1972) and ``Goodfellas'' (1990), in
which she plays a Mafia moll who becomes the president of the
United States. The film is directed by Jim Abrahams, the master of
the big-screen parody, with hits such as ``Airplane!'' (1980)
``Naked Gun'' (1988) and ``Hot Shots!'' (1991) to his credit.
 &HT;    Applegate's character Diane is the WASPish girlfriend of Anthony
Cortino (Jay Mohr), son of the crime boss Vincenzo Cortino,
portrayed by the late Lloyd Bridges. While Diane may be more than
vaguely reminiscent of Diane Keaton's character, who married into
the mob in ``The Godfather,'' Applegate wants to make it clear that
she's not doing an impression.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't trying to be Diane Keaton any more than Lloyd Bridges
was imitating Marlon Brando,'' she says. ``We all loved and
respected `The Godfather' and all those other great mob movies, so
we weren't making fun of them _ we were just making light of
them.''
 &HT;    Still, Applegate readily admits that one of the biggest
challenges she faced was trying to play it straight while gags flew
on the set.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes they had to kick me out of a scene because I was
laughing so hard,'' she says. ``I quickly discovered the key to
this kind of parody: The actors can't try to be funny. In fact, Jim
Abrahams, the director, wanted me to get dramatic.''
 &HT;    The actress recalls playing one scene in which her character
breaks down in tears.
 &HT;    ``I remember saying to Jim, `I thought I signed up for a comedy,
not a melodrama,''' Applegate says. ``I ended up acting my heart
out, even though the audience will end up laughing at me.''
 &HT;    She took many of her cues from Bridges, a veteran of the genre.
 &HT;    ``Lloyd was an inspiration to all of us,'' Applegate says of the
actor, who died shortly after the film was completed. ``He was the
master of this kind of satire. His timing was always so perfect.
We'll miss him, just as all of his fans will.''
 &HT;    When asked to explain how her character progresses from Mafia
girlfriend to U.S. president, Applegate smiles.
 &HT;    ``All I can tell you is that she's on a quest for world peace
and it leads her to the presidency,'' she says. ``I must admit I
felt a little weird being the first female chief executive.''
 &HT;    If she had the chance to run for the highest office herself,
what would she propose?
 &HT;    Applegate flashes a sly grin.
 &HT;    ``I think mandatory meditation would be the key,'' she says. ``I
think everyone should get out and have that mandatory moment of
daily silence so they could kind of get in the zone.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think I'd make a really fabulous president,'' she
adds with a laugh, ``but I'm not planning on pursuing a career in
politics. I'm too much into this acting thing.''
 &HT;    Applegate has been into ``this acting thing'' since she was 3
months old. She made her debut in the arms of her mother, actress
Nancy Priddy, playing the baby of one of the characters on the
television soap opera ``Days of Our Lives.''
 &HT;    She went on to become a regular on the series ``Heart of the
City'' as a teen-ager, and made numerous guest appearances on other
shows before she was cast as the Bundys' daughter in ``Married ...
With Children.''
 &HT;    During the popular series' run, millions of fans seemed
convinced that Applegate was just as vacuous and boy crazy as Kelly
Bundy.
 &HT;    ``I sometimes wondered if I might be labeled as Kelly for the
rest of my life,'' the actress says. ``But I'm a fighter, and I was
determined not to let that happen, because I'm really nothing like
her.''
 &HT;    Applegate says she has no regrets about her years as Kelly
Bundy.
 &HT;    ``In a lot of ways she was a wonderful character to play,'' the
actress says. ``It was fun to come in and just be sort of vacant
all week _ I got to turn my brain off.
 &HT;    ``And for 11 years we got to make people laugh every week,'' she
adds. ``I think laughter is so healing, and I loved taking it into
people's living rooms. But I was worried that I wouldn't get a
chance to play other kinds of roles.''
 &HT;    It turns out that Applegate had nothing to fear. She was
recently seen as a ``Jewish American Princess'' in ``The Big Hit''
(1998), opposite Mark Wahlberg, and she plays a motel laundress who
moonlights as a stripper in the low-budget feature ``Claudine's
Return,'' which has not yet been released.
 &HT;    The latter film gave Applegate a chance to stretch her acting
muscles.
 &HT;    ``It's a very dark piece,'' she says of the offbeat drama in
which her character falls in love with an Italian drifter. ``I had
some of my darkest hours as an actress doing it. It's a very heavy
film _ a tragic love story.''
 &HT;    The love story was scripted to include a nude love scene for
Applegate, but the actress had other plans.
 &HT;    ``I convinced (director Antonio Tibaldi) it wasn't necessary,''
Applegate says. ``I don't know if I'd ever do nudity. I just see so
much of it in films that is really unnecessary. After the love
scene in `Claudine's Return,' even though I didn't take my clothes
off, I felt violated. I actually broke down and cried.''
 &HT;    Her next project is much more light-hearted. This fall,
Applegate will return to prime-time television in the NBC sitcom
``Jesse,'' playing a single mother, not unlike her own mother, who
raised Applegate alone after a divorce.
 &HT;    ``In a way, this series is going to reflect my mother,''
Applegate says. ``I respect what she did for me totally on her own.
She went through a lot of trials and tribulations when money was
tight. As I look back, I just wish she could have had more of a
life, instead of sacrificing for me.''
 &HT;    Applegate remains close to her mother, and the two spend a lot
of time together. But she also has time for an active social life.
When asked if she's getting tired of the dating game, she grins
before replying.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to get older,'' she says, ``and I know that at
some point I'm going to have to stop having silly little flings and
think about getting married. I'm interested in a long-term
relationship. I'm definitely looking for that in my life.
 &HT;    ``The things that I pray for are a lot different than they used
to be,'' she adds. ``I pray that I'll find joy and happiness in
whatever comes my way, rather than being totally focused on getting
the thing that will advance my career.
 &HT;    ``It's not that I'm less ambitious,'' she hastens to add. ``It's
just that I used to feel that if my life wasn't a certain way I
wasn't going to be happy. Then I discovered that being happy with
what you have is what makes your life more beautiful.''

 Includes a color slide of Courtney Thorne-Smith in a scene from
``Ally McBeal.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles is humming as Courtney Thorne-Smith settles in for
an interview during a break from taping on ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorne-Smith, the fresh-faced blonde who dazzled on ``Melrose
Place'' before making a splash on ``Ally McBeal,'' isn't
responsible for most of the day's buzz. The night before, both
``Seinfeld'' and Frank Sinatra signed off, and this morning brought
word that the city's most popular athlete, the Dodgers' All-Star
catcher Mike Piazza, had been traded to the Florida Marlins. (He
would later move on to the New York Mets.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Thorne-Smith is ready to put in her two cents'
worth on two of the three developments:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to live up to the hype,'' she says diplomatically
of the ``Seinfeld'' finale.
</P>
<P>
   She has more to say about Sinatra, having recently watched his
1956 musical, ``High Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' she says. ``He was so profoundly cool, and
he knew it. It would have been wild to be in the Rat Pack, to be
literally the coolest people in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Piazza, though, Thorne-Smith has to take a
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this one, I claim total chickdom _ don't care,'' she says
with a laugh. ``Call me when he designs a clothing line.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has announced no such plans, which is probably just as
well _ Thorne-Smith doesn't have time to ponder him, even if she
were so inclined. She's moved from the trashy romp of ``Melrose
Place,'' in which she played the alcoholic Alison and struggled
with abuse, blindness and carjackings, to the tonier environs of
creator David E. Kelley's ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally'' surprised the critics to become one of 1997/98's few
breakout hits. Among the most popular characters, of course, is
Thorne-Smith's lovable Georgia, who gets to go home with Gil
Bellows _ who plays her husband, Billy _ every night while Ally
(Calista Flockhart) seethes and whimpers. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: What kind of reaction have you been getting from fans
this year? Have they been along the lines of ``Stand by your man,''
or more like, ``How dare you stand between Ally and Billy?''
</P>
<P>
   COURTNEY THORNE-SMITH: People who talk to me probably have a
different take. They say to Calista, ``You guys were meant to be
together,'' while to me, they take the party line: ``How can you
let her do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I think the triangle's done. One of David's strengths as a
writer is he gets bored with a story line before the audience does.
I think he finished with that a while ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the triangle fading, they're discovering Billy and
Georgia's relationship, and that's fun. They had spent time and
thought a lot about why Billy and Ally couldn't be together, and
they thought about why Ally and Georgia should be friends, but they
sort of forgot why Billy and Georgia should be together. Now we're
starting to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You had decided to sit out 1997/98, until David Kelley called
to ask you to be in ``Ally McBeal.'' How difficult was it to hop
back into things?
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: It was tough. For one thing, I wanted a year off
because I was tired _ so tired. And here I was, coming on a new
show, everything was new.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, you have either no hiatus or a four-year hiatus _
you have to be grateful for what you have.
</P>
<P>
   But this first year was an extraordinary experience in the
writing, the energy and the friendliness of the cast, the unity of
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I would have made it if it hadn't been for that.
That made up for my lack of physical energy _ it was intellectually
stimulating and emotionally challenging, and that made it easier
for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've gone from ``Melrose Place,'' a show where the writing
...
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: (Laughing) Careful ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: ... wasn't considered one of its strong suits, to this highly
acclaimed show. How would you compare the atmosphere on the
respective sets?
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: They're extraordinarily different in every way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose'' does what it does extremely well. We looked for ways
to make it light and fun _ we knew what we were making. We were
playing, creating this surreal world.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Ally,'' we're doing that as well, while we're searching for
the tone. It gets exaggerated in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose'' was melodrama, ``Ally'' is comedy and straight
drama. ``Melrose'' had 15 very separate story lines _ once you
would see one to the end, something would explode and people would
die. Here we work as a group more, which is more fun.
</P>
<P>
   I love that. There were some times on ``Melrose Place'' where
you'd have scenes with just one other actor for weeks and months at
a time. In this first year of ``Ally,'' we were all playing off
each other, getting the tone of scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun, and creates a sense of unity among the cast. People
would come on ``Melrose'' _ like Lisa Renna, I don't think I ever
had a scene with her. I can't say that about anyone on ``Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your favorite subplot involving your character on
``Melrose?''
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: I had the most fun. I liked when she was drinking,
because I got to go hysterical _ she got mad and had some backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, she just whined a lot. And who wouldn't? Look at her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Georgia is certainly a switch from your last role in a Kelley
production, as the Laker Girl on ``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: I was told she was an aspiring actress. Then the
first day I walk into wardrobe, and there's this tiny leotard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' they told me, ``she's a Laker Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea, but there I was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you didn't even make the cheerleading squad in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: Yes, thanks for bringing it up.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was dramatic and terribly important _ everyone
else was on the squad, but I wasn't. But I ended up in the drama
department.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the reaction of the cast and brain trust to the
endless deconstruction of ``Ally McBeal'' in the media?
</P>
<P>
   THORNE-SMITH: It's hysterical to us.
</P>
<P>
   David writes what is interesting and funny to him. There's no
committee _ he just puts it out there. And suddenly there are all
these people discussing the show, like why she wears such short
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Calista looks great in short skirts. There have been all
these articles. She has great legs _ there's no sinister plot.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got a haircut. David had a whim, so I got my hair cut.
Now I can't walk down the street without people demanding to know
why I did that.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd _ we're just going to work and doing our jobs, and all
these people are analyzing and psychoanalyzing. I wonder if David
thinks it's as funny as we do.

ADAM BEACH: `SIGNALS' OF RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Adam Beach in a scene from ``Smoke
Signals.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's all just a bit overwhelming for Adam Beach.
 &HT;    Beach, the Native American star of the acclaimed art-house hit
``Smoke Signals,'' can't believe he's at the Soho Grand,
Manhattan's trendiest hotel. He can't get over seeing his face on a
poster plastered on the wall of a building just a stone's throw
from the hotel. He can't comprehend that journalists want to
interview him, and is amazed that everyday people are beginning to
recognize him on the street.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe how everything has worked out,'' the
soft-spoken 25-year-old says, as he settles into a chair in the
hotel's bar. He's dressed casually in black running shorts and a
gray tank top, and his thick black hair flows over his shoulders.
``I came to New York to audition, and on my second reading they
offered me the part.
 &HT;    ``The whole thing _ my getting the film, actually making the
film, it coming out even better than we could have imagined,
Miramax picking it up _ happened so fast,'' he says. ``I'm one to
go with things as they go down in life.
 &HT;    ``I kind of sensed that something special might build with
`Smoke Signals' from the day I first read the script,'' Beach adds.
``You can never be sure, but I felt good about this experience from
the start of it.
 &HT;    ``It's all just flowed beautifully.''
 &HT;    Billed as the first feature film written by, produced by,
directed by and starring Native Americans, ``Smoke Signals'' casts
Beach as Victor Joseph, a young Native American who travels to
Phoenix from his reservation in Idaho to claim the ashes of Arnold
Joseph, his late, estranged father. Joining Victor on his journey
is Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams), whom Victor's father
rescued from a fire when Thomas was an infant.
 &HT;    Together, through laughter, tears and old stories, Victor and
Thomas learn about each other, themselves and the enigmatic Arnold.
 &HT;    ``You have to let go of some of the baggage you carry in life,''
says Beach, who was born in Asher, Manitoba, and raised ``on and
off'' a reservation near a small Canadian village called Vogar.
 &HT;    ``Everybody carries traits of their parents,'' he says, ``and
everybody hides a part of themselves, their vulnerability, their
anger, their happiness.
 &HT;    ``People need to live their feelings, whatever they are, and let
them go,'' the actor says. ``I would love people to see `Smoke
Signals,' feel it, relate to it and enjoy it.''
 &HT;    Upon reading the ``Smoke Signals'' script, which Sherman Alexie
based on his own book, ``The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in
Heaven'' (Grove-Atlantic, 1993), Beach instantly related to Victor.
 &HT;    ``My own life was more complicated than Victor's, because I lost
both parents,'' he says quietly. ``My mother was eight months
pregnant when she was hit by a drunk driver, and my dad drowned two
months later.
 &HT;    ``I was adopted by an aunt and an uncle, then by another aunt
and uncle,'' he recalls. ``So, even though I was with my two
brothers and even though we were close, my life was all sorts of
shifting around.
 &HT;    ``I felt that nobody wanted me around, and I blamed all of my
mistakes on my parents,'' the actor says. ``So, even though my
personal story was a little more dramatic, I could relate to Victor
and get into his head.''
 &HT;    The actor says that most Native Americans who see ``Smoke
Signals'' love it, that they find in it an accurate, realistic
portrayal of their people and of their lifestyle. Those elements,
he adds, are vital because there are so few works of entertainment
that ever reflect the Native American experience, and what few
there are rarely do so in an honest, authentic fashion.
 &HT;    ``That `Smoke Signals' is in theaters and is being well received
is important,'' Beach says. ``It's strengthening us as a people, as
artists, as storytellers.
 &HT;    ``The story crosses over,'' he adds. ``Everyone can relate to it
in some way. We live a different lifestyle, but we share a lot of
the same experiences.
 &HT;    ``The film doesn't beat anyone over the head with the lifestyle
differences, but it's good that people see those differences,'' the
actor says. ``We, as a people, are very nonchalant. We're not in a
hurry.''
 &HT;    Beach hopes ``Smoke Signals'' catches on with audiences, that it
makes money for everyone who kept the faith and got behind the
picture. But he knows it's not ``Armageddon,'' and he's actually
quite happy about that.
 &HT;    ``I'd rather 100 people at a time sit in a small theater and
watch our film, then leave with a good feeling about themselves and
Native Americans,'' he says. ``That would be better than a million
people going, `Oh, yeah, that was good,' and walking away with
nothing.
 &HT;    ``I think success for us with `Smoke Signals' will be a
different kind of success.''
 &HT;    Beach's own success has come slowly but steadily. After his
parents' deaths, he drifted for a while, directionless and lonely.
He eventually found solace in sports and then, after working as an
extra in a film, discovered that he could escape into other
characters via acting.
 &HT;    ``I said, `This is what I want to do. I want to re-enact a
moment, release what I have inside, express myself,''' he says.
``Now I can't imagine doing anything else.''
 &HT;    Beach counts among his credits the films ``Cadillac Girls''
(1993) and ``Squanto: A Warrior's Tale'' (1994), a Disney family
adventure, as well as guest shots on such television series as
``Lonesome Dove,'' ``Touched By An Angel'' and ``Walker, Texas
Ranger.'' He also spent a year as one of the stars of ``The Rez,''
a recently canceled Canadian television series.
 &HT;    Next up is ``Mystery Alaska,'' a big-screen hockey comedy
starring Burt Reynolds and Russell Crowe.
 &HT;    ``I'm a hockey nut, so that was great,'' Beach says. ``It's not
a big role, really _ I'm just one of the hockey players. I got paid
to play hockey for three months, so I didn't care.''
 &HT;    Now, however, Beach has to care. Coming off the success of
``Smoke Signals,'' he's got some serious choices to make.
 &HT;    ``I've got to decide on where I want my career path to go,'' he
says. ``Do I want to be an actor who sticks to roles that are
meaningful, that can impact lives, or do I want to be an actor who
wants to do important movies, but knows he has to work, to pay
bills, and may not always be able to be in movies that have
something to say?
 &HT;    ``I'm an actor who wants to work, and good films that have
something to say don't come along very often,'' Beach admits. ``So
I really have to think this through.''
 &HT;    And then he smiles.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I can find a middle ground.''

 &HT;    More people making meat a shrinking presence on their plates
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Northside Hospital in Atlanta offered a seminar
called ``Almost Vegetarian'' on its roster of health classes this
summer, folks such as Cheryl Whitten made it an immediate sell-out.
</P>
<P>
   Whitten, 52, is watching her weight and her overall health and
thinks eating more meatless meals is a way to stay fit and well.
``I know meat has a lot of calories and fat, so I'm trying to limit
it,'' Whitten said. ``I probably won't eliminate it altogether _ my
husband wouldn't let me _ but I am going to eat less meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the Marietta, Ga. couple order pizza, she makes her
half veggie only. And Whitten is eating more pasta and salads and
sneaking ground turkey into the chili instead of using ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Whitten is like a growing number of Americans who don't want to
swear off indulging on a steak occasionally, but they are trying to
work more meatless meals into their daily diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a trend. I'm seeing more and more clients who
are cutting back on meat, but they don't want to cut it out,'' said
Page Love Johnson, a nutritionist with Nutrition Solutions Inc. in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Polls vary on how many Americans consider themselves strict
vegetarians, meaning they eat no meat, fish or fowl. A Roper poll
sponsored by the Vegetarian Resource Group last year showed only 1
percent of Americans say they fit that description. But 46 percent
said they were trying to reduce their red meat consumption, and 24
percent said they were eating more meatless meals than the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs that vegetarian options are in demand.
Many airlines, including Delta, report that vegetarian meals are
the No. 1 special request. And more foods that used to be found
only at health food stores, such as tofu and veggie burgers, are
showing up in the mainstream grocery stores. The Vegetarian
Resource Group this year surveyed 12 major grocery chains
representing 1,800 stores and found that several items are more
available. For instance, veggie hot dogs were sold in 42 percent of
the stores, compared with only 9 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   College and school cafeterias are offering more vegetarian
meals, and so are restaurants. Ciboulette, an upscale restaurant in
the Atlanta area, has offered special five-course vegetarian meals.
And vegetarian restaurants, such as Cafe Sunflower, say business is
brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, steakhouses are hot, too. Diet books touting
``eat-all-the-meat-you-want'' high-protein diets are top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the barrage of warnings on the health effects of
diets rich in red meats, the average U.S. consumption of beef has
held steady the past three years at about 64 pounds per person.
(That compares with 50 pounds for chicken.)
</P>
<P>
   So it's not that we are letting go, but rather seeking a
balance, nutritionists say. ``I've cut meat out of breakfast and
lunch, but still include some kind during dinner,'' said Darlane
Coulter, 28, a client of Love Johnson's. ``But I love eating
vegetables and trying out all the veggie burgers, and Cafe
Sunflower is one of my favorite restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Denkinger, manager of Cafe Sunflower in suburban Atlanta,
said a good number of customers there aren't vegetarians. ``They
just want interesting food, and I think that's great. Even if they
don't go strict vegetarian, it's wonderful they are becoming more
conscious of healthy eating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite persistent myths about the poor health of
vegetarians, vegetarian diets can be very healthy. Recently, after
several years of study, the American Dietetic Association adopted a
position paper favoring vegetarian diets as a sound alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarians do need to get enough protein, calcium, iron and
zinc, but a vegetarian diet can provide those nutrients, and
there's mounting evidence that vegetarians are healthier than meat
eaters.
</P>
<P>
   That's because vegetarian diets tend to be higher in fiber and
lower in saturated fat and cholesterol. The ADA position paper
notes that vegetarians have lower morbidity rates from several
chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, colon cancer and
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Can part-time vegetarians reap some of those benefits? ``Yes, if
they are actually bringing more high-fiber and nutrient-rich
vegetables and fruits into their diet,'' said Chris Rosenbloom,
professor of nutrition at Georgia State University. ``But not if
they are simply living on french fries and Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloom said her biggest caution is to learn more about
vegetarian eating before trying to shift to more meatless meals by
attending a seminar such as the one at Northside Hospital, working
with a nutritionist or reading books on vegetarian eating. Too many
cut out the meat, but don't replace it with healthful alternatives,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Love Johnson agreed. ``I've had some clients, especially teens
and young women, who are all ready to cut out meat,'' she said.
``But then you learn they don't like beans or garden vegetables and
are scared of tofu.

 &HT;    Newt Gingrich's ``Yankee'' manners
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -Political style counts, especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   When I told my 94-year-old south Georgia aunt that House Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) did something good this week_ unveiled a plan
for 48 miles of greenbelt along the Chattahoochee River _ Autrey
Lewis Randall huffed over the phone. ``He still has Yankee
manners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ungracious'' is the way she termed Gingrich's name-calling of
the first woman secretary of state. (Gingrich recently accused
Madeleine Albright of being an agent of the Palestinians.)
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Autrey's favorite Georgia politicians include the
chivalrous Sam Nunn, former U.S. senator, whom she says ``has solid
small-town values.'' She likes Georgia Gov. Zell Miller because he
credits his mother and his North Georgia upbringing with his
success. The only politician she ever sent money to, though, is
former President Jimmy Carter, whose mother she knew when she was
living in Dawson, Ga. close to Carter's hometown of Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In south Georgia,'' Autrey says,'' we were always fond of
Jimmy, though the boys used to call him 'sissy' for hanging around
with Miss Lillian and the womenfolk so much.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same aunt who reminded me ``to take galoshes'' when
I hiked part of the Appalachian Trail a few years ago _ no question
her political observations are slightly dated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not just my aunt who feels Southern politicians
should be _ well, Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich isn't, by birth or manners. But I once listened to him
address a group of conservative doctors about the Clinton health
plan. He pounded the podium about ``the road to socialism'' like a
Baptist preacher might do. He seemed very in sync with a mostly
Southern male audience.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that someone who's homebred can represent home best
isn't limited to the South, though it seems a stronger factor here.
Having spent many years in Colorado politics, I remember when Bo
Callaway, whose family is known for Georgia's Callaway Gardens, ran
unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate seat in Colorado. (Of course, he
missed by only a hair becoming Georgia's first Republican governor
when the 1966 race was thrown into the state Legislature and Lester
Maddox was elected.) But in Colorado, no matter how often Callaway
posed against the snow-capped mountains of Crested Butte, the
western Colorado ski resort he started, his Southern accent
reminded more of watermelon and black-eyed peas than cowboys and
ski slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Though we all like to think we assess candidates on the basis of
the issues we care about, I hold the unscientific belief that if
two candidates seem equally appealing , voters go for the one they
feel most comfortable with rather than the one who's the best
qualified or the most articulate on important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's gubernatorial candidates this year nearly all qualify
as to Southern credentials, by birth or length of residence. They
have different styles, though. Republican Guy Millner tells moving
personal stories instead of answering hard issues questions; Mike
Bowers, also Republican, despite his adulterous affair, presents
himself like a deacon on Sunday morning, laying down black and
white principles for making decisions, at least in the
public-policy arena. Democrat Roy Barnes can create the passion of
a tent revival at a political meeting or on the floor of the
Georgia House.
</P>
<P>
   The element of comfort with voters remains a problem for women
and minority candidates, homegrown or not. Though polls and pundits
predict which issues are the hot-button ones for the upcoming
election, there's precious little research to tell candidates that
how they speak and act is as important as what they say.

 &HT;    Commentary: How to parent a college student
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We have been oriented.
</P>
<P>
   My college-bound son and I recently spent two days discovering
everything we wanted to know about his chosen school but didn't
have enough sense to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Given the 100-degree weather, I had only one question: Do we
have to leave this nice air-conditioned auditorium and walk clear
across campus to sign him up for classes?
</P>
<P>
   It was a well-planned and executed orientation. We had
materials, folders, booklets, brochures, course catalogs, resources
and name tags out the wazoo.
</P>
<P>
   If we walked out of there after two days without knowing every
possible detail about the university, it wasn't because every
possible detail hadn't been printed, illustrated, demonstrated or
otherwise conveyed to us.
</P>
<P>
   We learned about meal plans, bus shuttles, dorm room
measurements, campus security, financial aid, the health center,
computer access, degree programs and bookstore lockers. We learned
the school song, colors, motto, logo and history.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly helpful bit of information was for parents
only. It was an article in the orientation booklet titled
``Parenting a College Student'' _ a do and don't list for parents
of incoming freshmen. Some of the advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask them if they're homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is they will be so busy during those first few weeks
with classes and new friends, they won't give a thought to their
parents back home. Well, that's comforting. I really didn't need to
hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write (even if they don't write back).''
</P>
<P>
   That will be no problem for me. The fact is, though, all of my
sons probably wish I would quit writing ... at least about them in
this column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask questions (but not too many).''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, come on. How do you define ``too many''? If I call daily and
ask if he took his multivitamin, is that overstepping? I'm a
mother. It's who I am; it's what I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect change (but not too much).''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour session on financing your child's education,
this bit of wisdom may be referring to coinage. Yes, I am confident
there will be some changes in our son's life. For instance, during
the next four years he will not find clean, folded clothes waiting
for him in his dresser. He will not have all four of his family
members to help him look for his keys, billfold or glasses. Nor
will he have home-cooked meals. Well, as the article states, some
change is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry (too much) about manic-depressive phone calls or
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think my son will. After 18 years, he's used to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visit (but not too often).''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these people and why are they telling me when I can see
my son?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not tell your students that `These are the best years of
their lives.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you're getting to attend the college of your
choice, living with your best friend, meeting new people, learning
exciting new things, socializing and partying ... no, believe me,
these are the tough days. Wait till you graduate, get a job and
work 60 hours a week. Those will be the good days!
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as I can call and visit daily, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, this going to college is really traumatic ... for the
parent. The university also offers a program ``to help parents of
college students focus on the opportunities and challenges they
will face as their sons/daughters begin the transition from home to
adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I quit crying, I'm going to sign up.
</P>

   COMMENTARY: The secret society of tourist photographers
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   My work as a photographer has been displayed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me to be more specific. I seldom find out. I suspect
some of my photographic renderings have found their ways into
private collections in Europe, Japan, England, Brazil and the
Greater Disney Area.
</P>
<P>
   I do not accept money for my work. But I knew from an early age
this would be a lifelong avocation. The first time a sunburned
traveler wandered up a sand dune and said to me, ``Hey, kid! Could
you take a picture of us and make sure the ocean's in it, too?'' I
knew my path was set.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I am one of those people who are regularly called upon to
practice random acts of photography and senseless acts of
documentation. I am one of those people to whom tourists
instinctively turn when they must trust a bystander, a stranger,
anyone to take their photograph in a new place before it all
disappears into the abyss of memory.
</P>
<P>
   I have been tossed disposable little cardboard cameras and
gingerly handed pricey single-lens-reflex cameras with lenses the
size of oatmeal cartons and hieroglyphics flashing inside their
viewfinders. I have listened to suggestions about taking the shot
that have ranged from a gesture made toward a landmark to
mini-seminars on effective use of depth of field.
</P>
<P>
   I have been implored to take photographs by travelers speaking
20 forms of English as well as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and a
language that sounded like somebody spinning a radio dial but which
turned out to be Finnish.
</P>
<P>
   I have made hikers say ``cheese'' by secluded mountain vistas.
Commanded bathers to smile on beaches pink and paradisiacal. I've
told foreigners on busy city streets to step closer together using
the universal two-handed move-closer-together sign. Recorded the
doomed love of entwined young couples who someday will tearfully
tear up my work or else find themselves sheepishly explaining it to
their eventual spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
   They all find me wherever I go.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' the casual reader might ask. (Despite their
comfortable clothing, casual readers are crotchety as a group.) I
would respond to the casual reader -- and any critical reader
trying to hide his harping under the transparent pose of casualness
-- that these requests do not arise from coincidence or chance.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who are regularly called upon to record the
vacations of strangers are part of a brotherhood. We are people
with the ingrained faculty of looking as though we can work a
camera. And, just as important, we do not appear to be the kind of
people who kill, rob or sell time-share condominiums to innocent
travelers
</P>
<P>
   You must be born with it. It cannot be learned. You have The
Gift.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists often are vulnerable people, acting on their instincts
in a strange place. They can sense the ones who can photograph them
and return their cameras undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   They can find us in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   No scientific study has been undertaken on this phenomenon.
Statistics are not available on which strangers tourists pick to
hand their cameras to.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect, though, that an average appearance helps. I, for
instance, am a person of average height, average weight with an
average smile that is only moderately reassuring. I look vaguely
like someone everyone thinks they know but isn't sure. I used to
imagine I had a double running around meeting people, but I now
chalk it up to extreme averageness.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a strange town, you would rather hand your camera
to a man who looks a little like your cousin's idiot husband than
someone who looks exotic or scary or smarter than you.
</P>
<P>
   That's one theory.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer the mystical gift theory myself. Travelers are more in
tune with The Force. It draws them to someone of my skills to be
photographed in front of marble arches, ancient fortresses and
swaying palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed the strangers you encounter never act
surprised when you ask them to take your picture? Isn't that a
little odd in a suspicion-filled society like ours? Huh?
</P>
<P>
   That's because we expect it. You found us again. We have been
waiting for you.

 &HT;    Megan's Law a reminder that danger may live next door
 &HT;    (EDS: Reference of Thursday in lede is July 9, 1998)
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Cincinnati Thursday, nearly 4,000 mourners paid their
respects at a public visitation service for Mary Jennifer Love.
Strangers cried as they processed past the white casket strewn with
pink and white flowers.
</P>
<P>
   She was 6 years old. Her pastor called her ``a precious little
girl who always had a smile and a hug.'' She trusted people.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor in her Colerain Twp. apartment complex, Ralph Lynch,
48, has been charged with rape and murder in her strangulation
death.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Rosa, Calif., Tuesday, the body of Michael Patton was
found dangling from a redwood tree, a suspected suicide. The Santa
Rosa Police Department had leafletted the community with flyers
bearing the convicted sex offender's photo and rap sheet. Police
said the suicide had nothing to do with their rigorous enforcement
of Megan's Law; neighbors suspected it did. ``I see no problem with
them giving out flyers, and I see no problem with that guy being
dead,'' said neighbor John Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths forced me to confront my profound ambivalence about
Megan's Law, which requires the name and address of convicted sex
offenders to be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably unconstitutional and could invite vigilantism.
Yet, if a convicted sex offender moved in across the street, I
would want to know.
</P>
<P>
   You can get an updated list of area sex offenders at the
Montgomery County (Ohio) Jail. Just walk in the main entrance, turn
left and go to the first window on your right, and it's all there:
names, addresses, Zip Codes.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I decided to do Friday after reading about Mary
Love. About how she loved pizza and dolls and skating and taking
part in the Eager Beavers program for children 2 to 6 at her
church.
</P>
<P>
   About how Lynch allegedly raped her after she was dead, and
dumped her body in the woods. Police said she died June 24, and
Lynch led them to her body nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   I went up to the window at the jail and asked for the registry
of convicted sex offenders. After filling out a request form, I was
handed the list of the 91 men and women in Montgomery County
currently registered as sexually oriented offenders or sexual
predators.
</P>
<P>
   I looked for my Zip Code and counted nine sexually oriented
offenders and one sexual predator, although none in my immediate
neighborhood. Another sexual predator lived a few blocks away from
the shopping center where I frequently shop with my kids.
</P>
<P>
   If Mary Love's parents had requested the same information, might
it have saved her? No. Lynch wasn't registered as a sex offender,
even though he was convicted in 1991 of exposing himself to a
9-year-old girl. Ohio's law isn't retroactive, and Lynch wasn't
sentenced more because the victims in the '91 crime were unwilling
to testify, according to Hamilton County Prosecutor Joseph Deters.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Love's death may not be a textbook-case argument for
Megan's Law, but it's a potent reminder that danger can live next
door. And it is a a textbook example of why sex crimes against
children are so difficult to prosecute _ and why the public feels
such rage and frustration that such criminals are free to commit
their crimes ``over and over again,'' Deters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most horrible of cases, and the most difficult
of cases because of the tender age of the witnesses,'' he added.
``When we handle a rape case involving a child, more times than not
the parent comes to you begging you to plea bargain.'' Deters isn't
inclined to plea bargain, but the reluctance of victims' families
makes his job a lot tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Deters doesn't have a problem with Megan's Law _ he believes
child molesters forfeit certain rights _ but he doesn't think it's
effective: ``We're fooling ourselves if we believe that's the
answer. In some instances it's helpful, but if a pedophile is
reported in a particular neighborhood, he'll go to another
neighborhood and abuse a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this disorder is incurable, and the recidivism rate is
through the roof, when someone is convicted raping a child, they
should be locked up for life.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the pain in Deters' voice when he talks about Mary
Love. He has a 4-year-old daughter named Mary. ``You hold your kids
close to know there's a monster like that out there.''
</P>
<P>
   We hold our civil liberties dear.
</P>
<P>
   We hold our children dear.
</P>
<P>
   How do you weigh the civil liberties of criminals who prey upon
children versus a child's right to ride a bicycle down the street,
or step outside the door of an apartment? Is the law simply putting
children first, where they belong? Or are we deluding ourselves
with the notion that anybody's Constitutional rights come with an
asterisk?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the wrenching questions raised by Ohio's community
notification law, passed one year ago this month. Modeled on New
Jersey's Megan's law, the law requires all convicted sex offenders
to register with authorities and mandates that the community be
warned about sexual predators, offenders deemed likely to act
again.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to say how many children have been protected by
the law. It's easier to point to the potential for abuse: In
Linden, N.J., Jimmy Johnson, 23, fired five shots into the home of
a paroled sex offender. Johnson's mother said her son ``realized
the rapist lives in our back yard. Me and his baby sister, he feels
he's the protector...He didn't do it to try to harm anyone. It was
to scare the rapist to move.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't put myself in Johnson's shoes. I can't imagine firing
shots into a stranger's home. But I understand why it makes people
crazy that anyone who rapes a child is ever set free to do it
again. I feel that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   My head tells me that Megan's Law is not the answer _ that it
violates civil liberties without assuring children's protection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I already know by heart the names of the convicted sex
offenders living in my Zip Code. And I'm glad I know where they
live.

 &HT;    ShortTakes: My Tribute to Roy Rogers
 &HT;    (Column for Tuesday, July 13, but please use at will.)
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wasn't a Gene Autry kind of kid. I wasn't a John Wayne kind of
kid. I wasn't a Lash Larue kind of kid. Who I liked was Roy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like the singing, the girls, the barn dances, the dude
ranches. I liked the clothes. Roy Rogers was some kind of dresser,
white hat, wonderful fringed shirts, boots, gleaming guns. You
can't say Roy Rogers wasn't like anyone else. He was like everyone
else, only better.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Rogers didn't live in the Old West. A real cowboy would have
giggled. There were hints of cowboy things going on, but what Roy
mostly did was catch sidewinders and save dumb girls from back
East. That was all right if they didn't get close and were good
sports. Roy's West was modern and old, a world of horses and
boulders and cars and telephones. No matter. I spent lots of time
explaining why Roy Rogers was better than Gene Autry. Now I can't
remember why.
</P>
<P>
   Circa 1940, my local paper published a color picture of Roy
Rogers dressed to kill on the front of its rotogravure section. I
had a brilliant idea. I cut Roy out and tied a string to the top of
his hat. I passed the string through a keyhole, then ran to the
other side of the door, and started yanking the string. I imagined
Roy was doing all kinds of great things. I kept it up all day. My
mother never noticed.

 &HT;    COLUMN: When the whole world was a green sofa . . .
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Today I find myself wondering whatever
happened to the old green sofa - the one we had in the living room
when I was a little girl. Odd thing to think of but I guess it's
because I've spent most of the day on the dining room floor leaning
against another old sofa. One with brown velvet upholstery and
carved feet.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason I'm here instead of in my upstairs office
or on the porch (my summer writing spot of choice). It's too hot!
It's too hot upstairs, downstairs, on the porch, and even here in
the dining room with the little fan right next to me. It's too hot
to clean up the house or work in the yard. It's too hot to pack my
suitcase for a trip I'm taking next week and it's too hot to run
errands.
</P>
<P>
   The basement is cool but there's nothing to do down there but
wash and iron and I've already done that.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, due to circumstances well within my control,
nothing I own is air conditioned. The house (radiators and no
duct-work) never was, and the old Bronco used to be but hasn't been
for quite some time. About four summers ago it started blowing hot
air which I knew was not a good sign. The Ford folks looked it over
and wrote up an estimate which was about fifty bucks higher than
the blue book value of the car. I politely declined but had to pay
for the estimate anyway. I came out $35 poorer and still hot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story of how I came to be spending most of this day
in the dining room leaning against the sofa and watching the big
ficus by the window drop its leaves. It's getting a little scary
because I think I'm beginning to identify with that tree.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't I remember it being this hot when I was a kid and
hanging out on that old green sofa? I can remember everything else
about it.
</P>
<P>
   I recall lazy summer afternoons when my girlfriend Tootie and I
would choose up ends, plunk our heads down on an armrest, fling one
leg over the back and read Wonder Woman comic books. When my mother
wasn't around we'd sneak in a couple of Birely's orange drinks.
</P>
<P>
   One winter I had whooping cough on that old green sofa and had
to miss my own birthday party. Another, it was chicken pox. My
mother slid the sofa into the dining room so she could keep an eye
on me from the kitchen to be sure I didn't scratch and make scars.
</P>
<P>
   Summer evenings I would lie on it listening to ``Gangbusters''
and being scared stiff. One night an evil character named ``The
Blonde Tigress'' really got to me and by bedtime I was terrified. I
stalled with the old ``I'm hungry, thirsty, and whatever'' routine
in an effort to buy time to outsmart that half-human, half-wildcat
whose bloody claws awaited the reckless stair climber.
</P>
<P>
   Strange how quickly my father caught on and offered to walk
upstairs with me, checking along the way for any killers who might
be lurking behind toy chests or under doll beds.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, the old green sofa became a launch pad for my
movie-inspired adventures. Once, the back of it was the open door
of a C-46. I bailed out over enemy territory and crawled among the
furniture seeking cover from snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Another time it was the stage for a hula recital complete with a
grass skirt that I had made from cut-up newspapers - including the
one my father had been looking forward to reading when he came home
that evening. His reaction was somewhat short of thrilled and my
dance played to cool reviews.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of my 8th Christmas, I recall curling up on the old
green sofa in my chenille bathrobe - the one with the ducks around
the hem - and eyeballing a suspicious looking package with my name
on it under the tree. I suspected it might be the Sonja Henie doll
I'd been driving everybody crazy for since Thanksgiving. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja and I set up housekeeping on the old green sofa, and when
she wore her fur-trimmed skating costume, the middle cushion became
an ice rink. The scenario shifted with each change of the doll's
clothes. It became Westminster Abbey when she marched the length of
it in a white satin bridal gown trailing a cathedral-length veil
behind her. For a day, the old green sofa became an entire world.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later I had a first boyfriend. His name was Harry
and he sat on the edge of the old green sofa, making polite
chitchat with my eagle-eyed father who thought 16 was too young to
date. He was holding out for 30.
</P>
<P>
   After a decent interval, Mother dragged my father off to another
room. Harry and I played records and cooked french fries. We danced
a few and sat out a few on the old green sofa. Whenever it got too
quiet, my father coughed.
</P>
<P>
   And then one day the unthinkable happened. I came home from
school and it was gone. Just like that - no ceremony, no warning -
nothing. It was just gone. My whole history wiped out in the blink
of a Burdine's furniture truck and when I asked my mother where it
had gone, she cracked wise: ``Probably to sofa heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, I'd sure like to think so. If a piece of furniture ever
deserved it, it was my old green sofa.

 &HT;    Florida fire survey shows apathy among residents
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In 1989, state foresters visited the
woody lots of Palm Coast and asked its residents: exactly how
afraid of wildfire are you?
</P>
<P>
   Going door to door, they handed out 200 surveys to homes most
likely to burn if a blaze broke out. Only 94 bothered to answer.
Those who did conceded fire was their biggest natural enemy. But
the chance of a fire actually occurring over the next 10 years,
they wagered, was less than fifty-fifty.
</P>
<P>
   The survey came just four years after a deadly wildfire season
killed two firefighters, burned 443,816 acres and destroyed 131
houses in Palm Coast, a subdivision carved out of forests in rural
Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half quizzed even knew about the fires.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a lesson to be learned here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't take long to forget things,'' said Victor Buckles, a
retired timber man who managed 90,000 acres of forest in Volusia,
St. Johns and Flagler counties for the St. Regis paper company _
now Champion International Corp. _ until retiring in 1996 after 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Memorial Day fires that scorched over
495,000 acres and destroyed or damaged 337 structures, state and
local officials say they'll examine how to better predict, control
and fight wildfires. Technology has improved considerably in the
last decade, with computers to forecast fire and formulas to
determine how it burns. Meteorologists are more accurate and
foresters are getting creative, even using goats to tame their
woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   That said, most _ timber men, firefighters, even the scientists
_ agree wildfire is one force that will never be completely
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nature wants it to burn, it's going to burn,'' said Karen
Terrill, information officer for the Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection in California, the epicenter for wildfires in this
country. ``Nature is more powerful than we are. However, we can
have isolated successes by using what we know works.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires burn because of three elements: fuel, oxygen and heat.
This summer, Florida found itself with an abundance of all.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, summer rains help counteract the thousands of
fires ignited by lightning, trash burning and other things. But as
early as April, foresters realized they were in for a tough
wildfire season. The rains hadn't come and the drought index had
climbed to an alarming level in central and north Florida, one
usually reached in August when thunderstorms are more scattered,
said Greg Thayer, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service stationed
at the command center set up for the Florida wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem was something weather forecasters call the
Atlantic ridge, a weather system that typically blankets the state
in spring and leaves in time for June rains, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the ridge persisted, foresters started worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to watch the Atlantic ridge. It would stay for
five, six, eight days and break down, then come back again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crews with the division of forestry alerted to normal lightning
fires got a special warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (told) field units, out of 15,000 normal lightning strikes,
you're going to get a large percentage that will actually cause a
fire. And we were right,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day weekend, thunderstorms ignited dozens of fires.
Fanned by high winds and feasting on dry vegetation, they streaked
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went instantly into fire threat situations,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Perry area and Osceola and Apalachicola National Forests
burned first and fastest, he said. Waldo came next, forcing the
evacuation of most of the town's 1,000 residents. Then fires in
Brevard, Volusia and Flagler counties intensified, erupting in
fierce blazes that chased more than 70,000 people from their homes
last week, including all of Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was with woods and fields so dry, foresters were
getting the worst kinds of fires.
</P>
<P>
   Brush fires spread to woods where thick ground cover created
ladders for fires to climb into trees. Once in the crowns, fighting
the fires is virtually impossible because they create their own
firestorm. The intense heat builds wind that whips the fires
around, one time shooting a fireball across a four-lane divided
highway. Worse, the kinds of pine that fill Florida forests have
highly flammable resins. So sometimes the trees just heat up until
they explode.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters finally got the upper hand this week when winds
died and they had enough trenches dug to contain them. (Fires won't
burn soil stripped of vegetation.) And Saturday, the drought index
finally fell, dropping more than 100 points. At its peak, it was
near dessert level.
</P>
<P>
   Now many want to know what exactly happened.
</P>
<P>
   On some levels, the answer is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, state foresters and timber men set their own winter
fires to rid areas of palmetto shrub, thick layers of pine needles
and other fuel that feed fires. The fires also leave behind
nutrients that help the forests thrive.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy rains in October and November made many fires useless.
In March, Flagler County commissioners authorized state foresters
to burn their county's overgrowth, said county commissioner George
Hanns.
</P>
<P>
   The drought, however, made conditions too dry there and around
the state, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approval (for burning) was in place, but only for perfect
conditions and we were far from that,'' Hanns said.
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated answer to controlling wildfires is how to
strike a balance in developing a state where fire is a beneficial
part of its ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Before the early 1980s, large tracts of land were routinely
burned, Buckles said. In fact, controlled fires go back to the time
American Indians used it to raze woods for planting or clear out
brush for easier hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Everglades routinely burned every two years and some
forests even evolved to survive fire. Longleaf pine, for example,
concentrates growing its roots during the first five years so it
can survive when leaves are consumed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization, however, has put an end to much burning.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Palm Coast. When ITT purchased the land it was a
42,000-acre managed pine forest. ITT began building roads and
sewers and by 1982 was selling off houses, targeting out of state
buyers, according to the division of forestry study. The area was
planted with pines expected to mature before and during
construction. Before the fires, most were about 30 years old and
had not been thinned. Likewise, most houses had just 30 feet
separating them from heavy, flammable brush.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled fires in the past always prompted complaints from
residents, Hanns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sunny Florida, they decide they don't want to be
inconvenienced by smoke unless it's from a barbecue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laws have also become more strict for conducting fires, said
Rep. Kelley Smith, R-Palatka, a timber man for 30 years. Less than
10 percent of the forests once burned now get cleared by fire, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules and regulations have become so stringent and
liability so great that many fear controlled burning. And the cost
has increased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Private landowners who want to burn their land must be certified
and follow state notification laws of nearby landowners. Foresters
have their own set of complicated guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually write a contract and provide a prescription and we
don't set it if the prescription isn't right,'' said Terrill, of
the California forestry department where 40,000 acres were
intentionally burned last year. Officials in Florida said Saturday
they are still researching the number set here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be right and some contracts are many, many
pages long. The first one I saw was 72 pages long,'' she said.
``It's very much a science and if we show up and conditions
changes, the wind, we go home. We don't set it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running into difficulty in many places . . . due to air
quality regulations and laws that have been passed for rare and
endangered species,'' Thayer said. ``It's shrinking down our window
of opportunity. You might go out and just in early, early spring,
it's moist and cool and a preferable time, but it's the nesting
time for some animals. What would happen if during the nesting
season of our birds we had those fires? We would have wiped out a
whole year's worth of nesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who helped write legislation in 1992 to ease rules for
burning permits, said legislators will probably look at changing
laws in the aftermath of the Memorial Day fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then (in 1985) the fire was kind of localized in the
Flagler area and it now runs across central Florida, the
Apalachicola Forest and into the Panhandle. So I think more members
of the legislature will have an interest than before. Plus, the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cost of fighting the fires has reached $104 million
with damages estimated at $276 million, most due to timber loss.
</P>
<P>
   Hanns said he will suggest hiring more firefighters to help the
nearly all-volunteer brigade in his county that has only 18 paid
members. He also wants brush trucks at every station.
</P>
<P>
   Besides setting fires, there are other ways to protect homes.
The city of Malibu, plagued by severe fires in 1993, keeps a herd
of brush goats that eat star thistle and other thick undergrowth
called chaparral, Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   California also has strict building regulations in fire-prone
areas that require fire-resistant roofs and guards on chimneys.
Brush must be kept trimmed within 100 feet of houses and trees
planted at least six feet apart. Also, golf courses and parks are
used like moats to protect communities. Herbicides can also be used
to kill brush.
</P>
<P>
   Some western states use roads as barriers to fire, building them
perpendicular to prevailing wind patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest difficulty is putting houses in the middle of
wildlands where fire can and should burn because it is part of the
natural cycle, foresters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, a lot of people just don't think about it,'' said
Dave Tippets, public affairs officer for the U.S. Forest Service's
Rocky Mountain Research Center. ``They buy a home in a beautiful
forest environment, they love the trees and the vegetation and they
don't think what it's going to mean if a fire gets started.''
</P>
<P>
   What it will mean, at least for the next 30 years is a different
environment, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a canopy of trees, different kinds of plants will grow
and young plants will attract more rodents, he said. Forests can be
replanted, but it is difficult and expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this in many parts of the U.S.,'' he said,
``and we have a big job ahead of us.''

 &HT;    Movie review of Hands on a Hard Body
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ In S.R. Bindler's fascinating documentary ``Hands on a
Hard Body,'' to place a hand on the sturdy gleam of a factory-fresh
pickup truck _ a ``hard body,'' in East Texas argot _ is to rub the
genie bottle of cramped limbs, imminent dementia and unchecked
agony.
</P>
<P>
   It's to forfeit reason and stand firm with one hand on the
candy-apple blue vehicle for more than 70 hours straight. It's to
sweat, ache, cry real tears and marinate in impossible tedium. It's
about all of these factors wiping out your opponents and leaving
you the last person standing. All in the name of winning the spiffy
Nissan truck, the truck on which 23 exhausted paws rested for so
long with so much iron resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're suffering; we're hurtin'.''
</P>
<P>
   That's contestant Benny Perkins, a whip-smart man who serves as
the film's wise and gnomic elder, for Benny won Hands on a Hard
Body two years before this bruising bout.
</P>
<P>
   Benny is a simple man. And he and his 22 rivals compose a richly
compelling gallery of regular folks who want something we all want.
Director Bindler _ a native of Longview, where the film was shot in
1995 _ crafts a frank, funny and massively entertaining survey of
human quirks and values that opens worlds to the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Bindler's camera scours emotional terrain most documentaries
only skim and produces a textured microcosm of the human
experience. A war of attrition whose sole weapon is unblinking
will, the competition is much like the marathon dance contests of
yore and a bit like the Donner party: It's a not-so-pretty petri
dish of how we behave under the most unforgiving conditions. ``You
have to realize it's a human drama thing. It's more than just a
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hands on a Hard Body was a human drama thing held by the local
Nissan dealer, with contestants picked by lottery. Bindler weaves
precontest interviews with the 23 players throughout the film,
striking wonderful juxtapositions between bright-eyed declarations
(``I can't picture myself walking away,'' says one. ``That's just
something I won't do.'') and moans of doubt in the withering heat
of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the desire to own a truck in Texas, competitors have
disparate reasons for doing this. Young Kelli Mangrum wants to win
the truck and sell it to pay bills, go to school and get braces.
Russell Welsh had a rough winter on the farm and had to hawk his
pickup to pay the bills. He needs this truck.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Norma Valverde, a deeply religious woman who finds
strength listening to sermons and church music on a Walkman and by
laughing hysterically at apparently nothing at all. (``That
uncontrollable laughter will take you down,'' warns Benny.)
</P>
<P>
   Several families are praying for her on the sidelines in the
dealership lot, and, indeed, cheerleading pit crews composed of
family and friends await each contestant with restorative
provisions during the five-minute breaks allotted every hour. Here,
feet are rubbed, cigarettes smoked, bellies filled and endurance
strategies formulated.
</P>
<P>
   Contest rules are strict, and we see a player disqualified after
two days because he leaned on the truck. Another contestant quits,
charging people are cheating under the unwary eyes of the judges.
She even admits to taking her hands off the truck. This makes for
high drama, and Bindler catches it all, even the glints of delight
in the eyes of those left standing. ``When they drop off, it's an
exhilarating thing. Like killing a deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a hand-held, Hi-8 video camera, Bindler shoots in true
ve(accent)rite(accent) fashion, chasing the unscripted drama as it
unfolds in unforeseeable bursts. ``So-and-so left!'' you hear far
off, and there goes Bindler dashing with shaky camera to see who
has bailed out and why, followed with often moving, tear-stained
interviews. The documentary ripples with impromptu emotional
charges like this.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th, 40th, 60th hour ticks by, physical transformation
wracks the participants. Half-mast eyes, matted hair, nascent
beards, not to mention unintelligible muttering and swaying bodies,
signal encroaching delirium in this pilgrimage through boredom and
displeasure. We feel the pain. ``There's extreme boredom . . . Your
mind is looking for input. Anything. Something.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a whiff of condescension mars Bindler's exploration of a
slice of Americana. Any humor in the film is inherent in the
subject, a quotation straight from the ongoing human comedy.
</P>
<P>
   What Bindler captures in this amazing document far transcends
the importance of a good pair of tennies, the ills of a hamburger
and the power of prayer. He captures the bare essence of being
human: desire, the root of unhappiness and something some people
will go to incredible lengths to satisfy.

 &HT;    Latest 'Lethal Weapon' misfires with tired routines
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Lethal Weapon 4' Starring: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene
Russo, Chris Rock, Joe Pesci, Jet Li Director: Richard Donner MPAA
rating: R for violence, language
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ `Lethal Weapon 4'' looks and feels like it was made 10
years ago. Ten looong years ago. The broad, dumb, retrograde
action-comedy reunites Mel Gibson and Danny Glover with a thousand
cop-flick cliches that once, in the days when Howie Mandel and Guns
'N' Roses were peachy, seemed so invigoratingly hip.
</P>
<P>
   Cliche(accent)s like: The villains are Ruthless Foreigners who
ply their sinister trade in a warehouse in America. The Heroic,
Funny Cops insult the bad guys with borderline racist gibes. A guy
gets thrown through a plate-glass window. A truck drives off the
end of a pier and goes headfirst into the ocean. A road
construction site serves as a perfect car jump.
</P>
<P>
   Wheezing along, the shockingly uninspired movie reveals a
franchise past its prime. There's a scene in which Gibson and
Glover's detective duo chant mantralike, ``We're not too old for
this (expletive)!''
</P>
<P>
   Correction. You are too old for this (expletive). The stars
aren't even trying, and wasted co-stars Rene Russo, in the waiting
girlfriend role, and Joe Pesci, in the hapless short-guy role, add
nothing to the insipid mix. Even tart-tongued comedian Chris Rock
and the chop-socky gymnastics of Jet Li can't generate enough sass
and spice.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Weapon'' movies were once hybrid action-comedies, but
what's lethal here is the extravagant lack of anything very funny.
Gibson and Glover are wretched comedians clearly tired of the
bullets-and-banter s htick. They painfully remind us of Jack Lemmon
and Walter Matthau getting back together in ``The Odd Couple II''
for patently mercenary motives.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson has never been more charmless (unless seeing Gibson
feigning a stereotypical Chinesying.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years since the series' zesty first installment, cops
Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) are still a
bickering team. This time they're out to stop a Hong Kong triad
that's smuggling slave labor into America and printing piles of
counterfeit Hong Kong currency. It's as simple as that. It even
ends with the mandatory shootout in the bad guys' warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The other story threads concern Murtaugh's chronic aversion to
his pregnant daughter marrying a cop (enter Rock's wisenheimer
officer) and Russo and Gibson expecting a baby.
</P>

   In 12 years, Glover's Murtaugh hasn't changed much. He's still a
warmly gruff family man, with one eye on keeping his sitcom-happy
brood safe and the other on keeping his renegade partner in line.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Riggs has changed. The combustible cop, a
wounded, wild-eyed soul, has grown up. Originally, Riggs was a
suicidal, vaguely psychopathic officer who'd eagerly risk his life
to quash a crook. He was human TNT, an attractive character
withetic Hong Kong action idol, here reduced to a cipher _ is
exploited solely for his pin-wheeling legs. (Series director
Richard Donner hasn't a clue how to shoot a martial arts scene.)

<P>
   No fewer than five screenwriters pounded ``Lethal Weapon 4''
into a witless, rehashed pancake. You've seen it all before, and
better. Even with Gibson's massive Richard Marx 'do shorn, the
movie feels weirdly passe(accent).

   Like many summer blockbusters, it's trash and it knows it. But
it's not fun trash; it's recycled trash. Chris Garcia is the film

   COLUMN: Autobiography sheds light on supporter of Kerrville Folk
Festival
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Milner
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Want a good coffee table book that people will actually pick up
and look through, at the pictures if not the text, although they'll
probably find time for the text as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``Music from the Heart,'' Rod Kennedy's autobiography, (Eakin
Press, $29.95 paper; $39.95 hardback), a 400 page book filled with
photos and illustrations on almost every page _ more than 500 in
all, tells the remarkably story of one man's dream and the people
who helped him achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard of the Kerrville Folk Festival, and maybe
you've attended one or more event over the course of the 25 years
that the festival has been around. But helping to organize Kerville
is not by any means all that Rod Kennedy is noted for.
</P>
<P>
   From a historical standpoint, the book reveals some interesting
twists in Texas history. It tells of Kennedy's fledgling FM radio
station, Texas's first radio stereophonic broadcast station.
Kennedy's company also built Austin's second television station _
Lyndon B. Johnson's competition.
</P>
<P>
   The book is liberally sprinkled with references to the author's
friends and acquaintances, including Cab Calloway and Carmen
Miranda. Kennedy's early belief in their careers _ and the talents
of Nanci Griffith, Riders in the Sky, Tish Hinojosa, Robert Earl
Keen, Lyle Lovett, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Townes Van Zandt to name a
few _ helped start their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's interests spread beyond music into car racing and his
collection in the late 1960s, which culminated in his Lancia team
winning the 1970 Sebring International Twelve Hours of Endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy tells of the first 25 years of the Kerrville Folk
Festival, spotlighting Michael Martin Murphey, Carolyn Hoester and
Jerry Jeff Walker. During the initial Kerrville festival, Kennedy
describes how he tried just about everything to provide cash to
support the event. It's all told and illustrated in this book, a
book that Pete Seeger called ``a remarkable achievement.'' Fred
Koller, writing in Performance Songwriter Magazine said, ``This is
the best book on the folk scene in America since David Gahr's long
out of print 'The Face of Folk Music.'''

 &HT;    Highway to heaven? It can be a shorter trip with the right
tunes.
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one who listens to music in a professional capacity _ namely,
as a critic for The Post _ I find that when I hit the road, I just
want to relax. I also factor in what my 6-year-old son will
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorites:
</P>
<P>
   1: Jimmy Buffett, ``Songs You Know By Heart'': When I moved to
Florida, my boss told me to pack some Buffett. I took her advice
and bought this delightful greatest hits collection. Whenever the
weather's just right, it makes for the quintessential tropical
listening. Warning: If you've got kids in the car, you may want to
turn the volume down on a ``Why Don't We Get Drunk and . . .''
(well, you know).
</P>
<P>
   2: Dave Matthews Band, ``Under the Table and Dreaming'': Rock
that truly rocks. This first album by Matthews and company finds
them at their most limber. The songs stretch on for minutes _ and
encourage you to take on the open road.
</P>
<P>
   3: Fleetwood Mac, ``The Dance'': If you grew up in the '70s, the
band is already woven into your past. This new live album preserves
the memories and adds to them a nostalgic bittersweetness. It's
music that takes you back and forward at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   4: The Bangles, ``Different Light'': No-frills pop from my
younger days. Every time I hear ``Walk Like an Egyptian,'' I have
to resist the temptation to let my hands off the wheel and do the
Babylonian boogie.
</P>
<P>
   5: Louis Prima, ``The Wildest'': Thanks to the recent swing
revival, everybody's starting to jump, jive and wail. But I've been
listening to this album in the car for years. Prima's wild-man
growl brings out the cool cat in anyone.
</P>
<P>
   6: Lou Reed, ``Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed'':
Maybe this ground-breaking New York rocker isn't most people's idea
of easy listening, but I find his edgy humor lightens any car ride.
And who can resist the spacious, string-laden ``Walk on the Wild
Side''?
</P>
<P>
   7: Spice Girls, ``Spice'': I'm not ashamed to admit I bought
this bubblegum-pop album for myself, not my kid. Then, he
discovered it and it shot to the top of our playlist. Even after
listening to it at least a dozen times straight on a trip to Fort
Myers Beach, I find the dance-pop grooves irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   8: The Beach Boys, ``Endless Summer'': I once put this greatest
hits collection on during the long haul to Key West. Listening to
such songs as ``I Get Around'' and ``California Girls,'' I found
the blue-green water seemed to sparkle even more.
</P>
<P>
   9: John Denver, ``The Wildlife Concert'': I consider the
unfairly maligned Denver the quintessential folkie in that his
songs were meant to be sung by everyday people. Put this two-album
live set on during a slow drive and you'll find it hard not to join
in the chorus of ``Rocky Mountain High'' and ``Country Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   10: Bruce Springsteen, ``The River'': Almost any Springsteen
will do for me on a car ride, but this classic double album
combines the best of Bruce: his blue-collar beat and his streetwise
lyricism.

 &HT;    Taking the worry off the road: how to cope with breakdowns, pets
 &HT;    By Janis Fontaine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever you're getting ready to leave on a road trip, there are
worries, concerns _ questions. We did some research and took our
questions to some experts. Here's what we found out:
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IF I BREAK DOWN?
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Pembrook Burrows of the Florida Highway Patrol recommends
these tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for a call box: Florida's Turnpike has call boxes every
mile. A computer tells the dispatcher exactly where you are when
you pull the switch. When walking to the box, walk against traffic
so you can see what's coming. Get as far off the highway as you
can. Carry a flashlight at night.
</P>
<P>
   When there are two adults, only one person needs to go. But if
you're traveling alone with kids, don't leave them. Raise your hood
to let people know you're having trouble. If you have a cell phone,
dial FHP toll-free. You'll need to know approximately where you are
_ what city, county or mile marker.
</P>
<P>
   If no one comes in an hour, call again. The dispatcher can give
an anticipated time it will take to respond. If there is a major
problem, the Highway Patrol gets assistance from the county
sheriff's office or local police.
</P>
<P>
   _ When your gas tank reaches one-quarter full, fill it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use caution at rest areas: Most turnpike rest areas have
security. If you're on a different road, stick to rest areas with
lots of people. Don't leave your car running or unlocked.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are traveling alone, plan your trip so that you arrive
by nightfall. Tell someone the route you're taking. Stick to it. If
you change your mind, call and let the person know.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT THE RECENT BRUSH FIRES?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Lt. Burrows said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fire: Monitor your car radio for information about any detours
you might encounter. The broadcast frequencies change depending on
where you are, so watch for signs along the turnpike. If you see a
fire, and there are no emergency workers call the FHP.
</P>
<P>
   _ Smoke: Depending on how thick the smoke is, you can drive
through it, but drive with caution. If workers are there, they will
stop you or wave you through.
</P>
<P>
   Should you need to detour, Burrows says signs and flares will
tell you where to go.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S THE BEST TIME TO TRAVEL?
</P>
<P>
   Early morning. It's cooler than midday, for one thing. Try to
avoid the rush hours of 7-9 a.m. or 4-6 p.m. especially around
large cities. And you'll likely find less congestion on the
turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IF I'M TRAVELING WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS SPECIAL NEEDS?
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who have medical needs can get help from Home Care
Medical Services Traveling Patient Care Program and programs like
it. People who need oxygen, walkers, wheelchairs or other medical
supplies can arrange to have the equipment waiting for them when
they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We carry everything from gauze pads to full ventilators,''
said Phil Von Kahl of the patient-care program. ``Many of our
clients are people coming down from the north to go on cruises. We
meet them at the airport with the equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Check with your insurance company to see whether it covers these
expenses. And check the deductible, too. Call (800) 330-7738. Or
visit the Home Care Web site: www.healthtology.com/hcms/.
</P>
<P>
   WHICH PLACES ALLOW PETS?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter of the families who travel bring the family pet
along. Here are some resources that might help you find lodging:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Florida Dog Lover's Companion'' by Sally Deneen and
Robert McClure (Foghorn Press; $19.95) is available at bookstores
or by calling (800) FOGHORN. The 542-page guidebook lists cottages,
seasonal houses and inns along with a few chain hotels that accept
dogs. A new edition is being published in August.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another good guidebook is ``Vacationing With Your Pet''
($19.95 plus $3.95 for shipping; Pet-Friendly Publications), which
is available at bookstores or by calling (800) 496-2665. It lists
more than 23,000 hotels, motels, inns, ranches and bed and
breakfasts in the United States and Canada that welcome pets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Medications. In addition to any prescriptions, don't forget
children's pain reliever and fever reducer. Keep your pharmacy's
number handy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Extra prescription glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency phone numbers such as your pediatrician's and the
number for poison control.
</P>
<P>
   Insect repellent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Roll-up sunshades for the back windows.
</P>
<P>
   First aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   Childproofing products, especially if you stay in a place with a
kitchen. And don't forget safety gates to keep children off
balconies and stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANCE PLANNING: DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Hurricane Andrew threatened to destroy South
Florida, I was visiting New Hampshire, enjoying the cool air, green
leaves and an ice-cold lake. I had made no storm preparations, so I
was panicked when I heard the weather report. I called some
neighbors, who tried to protect my personal belongings, but had the
storm come farther north, I would have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some general precautions from Sentry Group,
manufacturers of fire safe security chests, for things to do
whenever you leave home:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a plan. Ask a neighbor or friend if they will secure your
home if a storm is coming while you're away.
</P>
<P>
   Take photographs or make a videotape of your possessions
(computer, stereo equipment, TV, jewelry) for insurance purposes.
Keep the receipts, or copies of them, with the photos. And don't
store the records at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspend mail and newspaper delivery. Nothing screams
``vacation!'' louder than newspapers piled up in the driveway or a
stuffed mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a timer to turn your lights and a radio on and off. But
unplug your TV, computer and major appliances. They can be a fire
hazard. Plus, a lightning strike can harm them even when they're
turned off.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARE YOUR CAR:
</P>
<P>
   Your car is going to be ``home'' to you and your kids for at
least part of the trip. AAA Auto Club recommends that you give the
car a thorough checkup before you leave. Here are some things to
check:
</P>
<P>
   _ Examine tires for excess wear. Make sure all are properly
inflated. Check your owner's manual for proper tire inflation _ in
addition to being safer, properly inflated tires improve gas
mileage. Don't forget to check the spare tire, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the oil, both the level and condition. You may want to
have the oil changed before you leave. And if you're traveling in
very hot (read, Florida) weather or you plan to haul a trailer,
switch to an oil with a higher viscosity. Again, check your owner's
manual for recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the car's belts, looking for worn or cracked belts, and
hoses, or for blistered or soft hoses. Do this while the engine is
OFF.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check all fluid levels, including coolant and windshield
washer fluid. Fill them if they are low. Nearly half of AAA Auto
Club South's emergency road service calls are for overheated
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stock your car emergency kit. At a minimum, include these
items: two flashlights with extra batteries; warning devices such
as flares or reflective triangles; jumper cables. Carry a cellular
phone to summon help. It's the best emergency device.
</P>
<P>
   RESEARCH YOUR TRIP:
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan your route. If you're a member of AAA, they'll provide
detailed maps of your route. If you're not a member, plan your trip
thoroughly. Use a highlighter to mark your route, a big help when
navigating busy roads or complicated interchanges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call ahead to local visitors' bureaus or chambers of commerce
for information on interesting (and often inexpensive) local
events.
</P>
<P>
   _ Build your schedule around your kids' habits and routines,
says author Christine Loomis in her book Simplify Family Travel
(Reader's Digest, $17.95). When you stop for meals, avoid sit-down
restaurants, where the kids will be further confined. Instead,
choose a picnic area and make sandwiches. The food might not be
four-star, but the mood will be.

Hamid will be performing the 16th and 17th as part of a three-day
jazz summit featuring European and American players whose lineage
stretches from the 60s to the 90s. Hamid is, in many ways, the one

``Music from the Heart'' by Rod Kennedy (Eakin Press, $29.95 paper;

   KABAT-COLUMN _ My college-bound son and I recently spent two

air-conditioned auditorium and walk clear across campus to sign him

   GREIG-COLUMN _ AUSTIN _ Q: Couldn't we save trouble and time by

   FIRE-SURVEY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In 1989, state foresters
visited the woody lots of Palm Coast and asked its residents:
exactly how afraid of wildfire are you? Going door to door, they
handed out 200 surveys to homes most likely to burn if a blaze
broke out. Only 94 bothered to answer. Those who did conceded fire
was their biggest natural enemy. But the chance of a fire actually
occurring over the next 10 years, they wagered, was less than
fifty-fifty. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Jane Greig's consumer column
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Q: Couldn't we save trouble and time by endorsing
checks on the front, lower left? This would make it easier to
compare the information with the signatures. It would also save the
great difficulty in copying the back side, which could be used as a
deposit slip, saving tons paper and storage space.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think? _Harold B.
</P>
<P>
   A: A provocative idea but the
</P>
<P>
   endorsement on the back of a check is a processing requirement
from the American National Standards Institute, adopted by the
American Bankers Association, says the ABA's John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by the payee is just the beginning of the
information that will grace the back of the check _ other payees
and several banking institutions will also use the back (and that's
just if the check does not bounce!). In addition, the magnetic
encoding on the front of a check is adversely affected by ink.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an antique oak mirror that belonged to my great aunt.
The glass has become spotted and discolored in places over time and
I am thinking of having it reglazed. Whom would you recommend?
_Michael Grable
</P>
<P>
   A: Maxey Glass, 305 E. Fifth St., has been resilvering mirrors
for more than 40 years. The process removes the old silver, which
has been damaged by moisture, insects and chemicals. A new silver
layer, a new copper layer and sealer will be applied to the mirror.
The glass remains the same, so remember some scratches may be more
visible after the resilvering than before!
</P>
<P>
   Call ahead for price estimation. Resilvering is good economic
sense for beveled, etched or patterned mirrors. If the antique had
just a plain mirror, buy a new one. The job can be done in 14-20
working days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a money belt. It looks like a regular belt
but has a zipper on its back. I wonder if anyone in Austin sells
them or is there a place I could order one?
</P>
<P>
   I am going to Vegas soon and need one to take money. Probably
won't need one for the return trip. _B.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: A web money belt is available in three colors at REI, 9901
Loop 360, for a mere $12. But for the look of Charles Grodin in
``Midnight Run,'' call TravelSmith at (800) 995-7010. They have a
few leather belts (the end of stock so they may go quickly!) with
the inside back zipper for $29.50 May Sky Masterson be with you!

 &HT;    Spot the millionaire _ it's difficult to do
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard and David Gulliver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He drives a Mercury Sable wagon, with three
hubcaps and probably some junk in the back. His designer label is
more likely to be Levi than Armani, and for lunch, the $5 salad,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Burton R. Saidel, the millionaire next door.
</P>
<P>
   Saidel is a dentist, not a stockbroker or a lawyer or a
high-tech whiz. He's not big on trappings of success. But through
hard work and smart investing the Dayton resident has built a small
fortune, and probably given one away as well.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the thousands of Americans who see themselves not
as tycoons, but as ordinary working folks who have gained financial
security through frugality and prudent investing.
</P>
<P>
   And he is part of a group that has economists, sociologists and
demographers scrambling for new definitions of what it means to be
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   In their recent best-seller, ``The Millionaire Next Door,''
co-authors William Danko and Thomas Stanley found that many
millionaires in America today live rather quiet lives without
ostentation. Instead of splurging on expensive houses and cars,
they save and invest their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were walking down the street, you wouldn't be able to
pick them out,'' said Carrie Coghill, executive vice president of
D.B. Root &AMP; Co. in Pittsburgh. ``They're just average people, only
they have saved and invested to the point that they have achieved
financial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Saidel's income _ near $225,000 in peak years, now lower as he
limits his office time _ is high but neither spectacular nor
unheard of. Where he has made his wealth is through investments,
for which he credits his real estate partners and investment
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been interested in the stock market,'' he said.
What he does know is the investment basic of compound interest that
bankers and brokers preach: Buy a stock, hold it, and reinvest the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Saidel has reinvested in real estate, and is currently a partner
in a Holiday Inn, a shopping center and, until recently, an
apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, an engineer from Pittsburgh who asked that his name not be
used, has an even simpler strategy. Tony has been saving and
investing, largely through his employer's 401(k) tax-deferred
retirement savings plan, for about 20 years. Only recently did he
realize that _ largely thanks to the roaring financial markets of
the past decade _ he had accumulated more than $1 million in
assets, 60 percent of it in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is the so-called ``401(k) millionaires'' like Tony who
confound the experts on income and wealth in America as they debate
who is truly rich.
</P>
<P>
   Not many years ago, a millionaire was a person whose net worth
was $1 million. As recently as 1971, there were fewer than 100,000
of them in America, according to Internal Revenue Service
estimates. But by 1995, the number had reached 1.48 million _ one
in each 178 Americans, according to the most recent IRS estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But although much may separate savvy investors like Tony and
someone like Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who earns more than $1
million a day, the U.S. Census Bureau essentially treats them the
same. The Bureau, the primary source for wealth and poverty data on
Americans, statistically lumps everyone together above $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, ``we really don't know that much about the rich,''
said Dimitri Papadimitriou, executive director and chief economist
of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in
Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there is only sketchy statistical data on ``401(k)
millionaires,'' most of it coming from investment firms. For
example, T. Rowe Price of Baltimore, in a survey of its clients
last year, found 774 millionaires among the 1.4 million accounts it
services.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 million Americans have such accounts. But only 10
percent have balances of more than $100,000, according to Access
Research, a Connecticut-based consulting firm. The average balance
is $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether any money saved for retirement should be
considered wealth. ``I wouldn't call it wealth,'' said Ted Benna,
president of the 401(k) Association, a national retirement account
advocacy group based in Cross Forks, Pa. ``It has to last you the
rest of your life.

 &HT;    Big tax breaks benefit very poor and very rich
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton came to office promising to put
people first by ``honoring and rewarding those who work hard and
play by the rules.'' And in the current push for tax cuts on
Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott repeatedly
characterizes GOP proposals as ``relief for working Americans and
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   But working Americans who have prospered _ particularly those
who have climbed into the ranks of those earning $75,000 to
$200,000 a year _ are finding that the rules don't work in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans, who pay nearly half of federal income taxes,
are unable to take advantage of many tax breaks available to poorer
and richer Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tax income, we don't tax wealth,'' said Jeff Gates, an
Atlanta-based investment banker who was chief counsel to the Senate
Finance Committee in the 1980s and is the author of a new book,
``Ownership Solution,'' which promotes the idea of employee stock
ownership to combat America's growing income inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways high-earning Americans are hit harder under
the current federal tax structure than those with substantial
``unearned income'' from millions, or even billions, of dollars
worth of stocks and property obtained through employment or
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, multi-billionaire Warren Buffett has structured his
investment company in such a way that its more than $14 billion in
increased stock value has yet to be taxed by the federal
government. And it won't be taxed until it is sold, or
``realized.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, ballyhooed as a tax break for
middle-income earners, was nothing more than a Trojan horse to
reduce truly wealthy Americans' tax liabilities on their fortunes,
said Robert S. McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax
Justice, a liberal public advocacy group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's centerpiece was a cut in capital gains taxes, paid on
the profits made when assets such as stocks or real estate are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The tax on capital gains was cut last year from 28 percent to 20
percent. Under the old rate, it constituted $63 billion of the $737
billion in income taxes collected by the federal government last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under tax proposals advanced this summer by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., the top rate on capital gains would be further
reduced to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich characterized the capital gains cut as a ``powerful
motivation for every American to save and invest,'' noting that
``nearly half of all Americans own stock.''
</P>
<P>
   However, critics point out that the richest 1 percent of
American households own nearly 50 percent of the nation's net
worth, meaning a large part of the benefits of capital gains tax
cuts go to a fortunate few.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's proposal may not be enough to satisfy some in
Congress. A flat tax, sponsored by House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, would lower the top federal tax rate to 17 percent
and abolish federal inheritance and capital gains taxes altogether.

 &HT;    Listen up! Audio books make road seem shorter
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a driving vacation, a good audio book or three can save your
sanity, save your marriage and save you from wondering what you
could have been thinking when you decided to have kids. These books
on tape may end up being better than the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But kids may be the problem. Grade-schoolers won't be interested
in these subjects and parents certainly won't be interested in kids
listening to ``Lolita.'' The following tapes are for adults.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget the kids. Most public libraries and every big
bookstore has an audio books section of classics such as ``Tom
Sawyer`` and ``Treasure Island.'' The classics make for great
listening no matter how old the traveler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' by Frank McCourt, read by the author,
abridged, 4 1/2 hours, Simon &AMP; Schuster, $24. Note: an unabridged
version is also available.
</P>
<P>
   This book won everything for author McCourt and deservedly so.
This is a warm, funny recounting of growing up dirt-poor in Ireland
with an alcoholic father. From Depression-era Brooklyn to Limerick,
Ireland, this is an unforgettable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruising Paradise, Tales by Sam Shepard,'' read by the author,
unabridged, two hours, Random House Audio, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of stories about men and women living on the
fringes is as good as it gets for the written word. And Shepard's
reading of his own work ensures classic status. The border town
story ``Opuestos'' and the two-character story ``Just Space'' are
unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's stories, painted with details, trigger the
imagination. You can see rundown motels, smell the whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord of the Flies,'' by William Golding, read by Tim
Pigott-Smith, abridged, three hours, Faber-Penguin Audio, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   Classic literature that's classic literature not only because
your teacher told you so. Mr. Pigott-Smith takes you to the coral
island where Piggy, Ralph, Jack and the other British boys create a
society with no rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds Like Murder.'' Mystery series from Random House Audio,
all unabridged, each two hours, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best idea since audio books. The ``Sounds Like
Murder'' mystery series opens with six tapes, each two hours and a
bargain at $12.95. The stories range from Ed McBain's ``Driving
Lessons,'' about a dangerous 16-year-old in love to the New York
Chinatown story ``A Tale About A Tiger'' by S.J. Rozan. ``Clean
American Fun'' is a murder in Branson, Mo. These are short-trip
books that are each worth the drive.
</P>
<P>
   June Thomson's ``The Case of the Scottish Tragedy'' is a mystery
that begins in Colombia and ends at a resort in Scotland. ``The
Sedgemoor Strangler,'' by Peter Lovesey, will have you guessing,
along with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who solve the mystery of
who's killing off British barmaids. Stephen Solomita's ``The Poster
Boy'' has a veteran cop on the wrong end of a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' by Vladimir Nabokov, read by Jeremy Irons,
unabridged, 11 1/2 hours, Random House Audio, $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the very long drive, you're going to tell yourself
there's no way you'd listen to Humbert Humbert's story about his
obsession with dangerous Dolores, Lolita. But this is writing that
makes it a deep regret to load in the last tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moby-Dick'' by Herman Melville. Read by William Hootkins,
abridged, six hours, Penguin Audiobooks, $23.95.
</P>
<P>
   Another classic that's also a great adventure and you can listen
to it without the high-school dread of writing a paper about the
symbolism. What it comes down to in the final analysis, students,
is that Captain Ahab was as weird about the great white whale as
Humbert Humbert was about Lolita. Ishmael's tale will live forever
and so will Lolita in the minds of every middle-aged man driving
his crabby wife and ingrate kids on another family vacation.

 &HT;    Does your backseat look like a jungle?
 &HT;    By Janis Fontaine

<TEXT>
<P>
   You're packed up and ready to roll out. Or are you?
</P>
<P>
   Have you crammed enough games in the back to keep the kids from
screeching all the verses of It's a Small World (aren't all verses
the same)?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have your prescriptions, phone numbers and SPF 30
sunscreen?
</P>
<P>
   Boy, do we have some tips for you.
</P>
<P>
   It might help to know you're not alone. There's a record number
of moms and dads on the road this summer (and some brave ones in
the air). More than 26 million Americans will take to the highways
for vacation this year. Half of those road trips wil will include
kids, according to AAA Auto Club South.
</P>
<P>
   So, we've decided to offer help (if not a Mickey Mouse bandage).
Let's hit the road!
</P>
<P>
   TAME GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Toobers&AMP;Zots, a wacky flexible foam construction game, comes
with a 20-piece set and a book of ideas and funny stories. (For
ages 5 and up; $14.99.)
</P>
<P>
   Koosh Color Change Markers (For ages 5 and up, $5 from Oddzon,
Inc.) My son likes these because you can use the white marker to
change the color of the other markers. And they have funny names,
too, like Oh My Black Eye and Plum Tuckered Out.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Chests Knights kit lets you make your own catapult and
bomb the cardboard castle, too! The kit also contains materials to
make a signet ring, a book about medieval times and other goodies,
all locked inside a case. (For ages 5 and up, but probably more
appropriate for older kids; $19.95.)
</P>
<P>
   A plastic, see-through carry-all, ($11.95 from FeltKids Play
Systems) lets you keep all your stuff in one place. They also offer
bags that hang on the back of the seat with lots of pockets to keep
toys and games organized.
</P>
<P>
   Bedtime for Bunny Blue: This cute-as-can-be kit with travel
bunny, two books and music box in a traveling case can help make it
seem like bedtime no matter where you are. (For ages 3 and up;
$7.97.)
</P>
<P>
   Books on tape: Bring along your child's cassette player and
headphones and let him or her read along with the tape. My son
loves Star Wars stories and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Baby-Sitters Little Sister Photo Scrapbook: This kit includes a
camera and scrapbook, but you can do the same thing with a notebook
and a disposable camera. (Ages 7 and up, $9.99, Scholastic.)
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry-making kits: The African Trade Bead Bracelet Kit
includes lots of beads, nylon and rubber cord, and an instruction
book. (For ages 8 and up, $10 from Curiosity Kits.) The Jewelry
Book kit contains beads, wires, clips and instructions and a
special keepsake box. (For ages 8 and up, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   Kids MagnePoem ($11.99) comes with more than 250 magnetic tiles,
plus a folding magnetic travel case. Have everyone write a poem and
read it out loud, or pass it around and take turns writing lines
for the same poem.

CLINTON TO KIDS: DON'T INHALE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton launched his $1 billion
anti-drug campaign last week and, like most things he does, it was
all media hype. He even said so.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Clinton calls the five-year program _ the
``Anti-Drug Media Campaign,'' as if all problems can be solved with
the right spin in the right ads. It's the thoroughly modern
non-answer to a problem by the thoroughly modern politician.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is supposed to let teen-agers know _ via
television, the radio and the Internet _ that drugs are bad, and
they shouldn't try so-called ``gateway drugs'' like marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge, multimedia, dot-com version of ``Reefer Madness.''
Yeah, that'll work. That'll keep kids from trying drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see evidence that ads can sell things,'' said Kendra E.
Wright, head of a Washington drug policy outfit called Family
Watch. ``But we have no evidence that they can unsell things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but ads can be so good at selling voters on the idea that
you're doing something positive for America's children.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ads may have exactly the wrong impact.
</P>
<P>
   Wright described some of the ads she and her children have seen
because the nation's capital has been one of the 10 test markets
for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One ad shows a good-looking kid with a skateboard smoking a
joint. We showed it to some social scientists and they said they're
almost glamorizing drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ads, according to Wright, actually gave the wrong
kind of education in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two stepsons, 10 and 14, and they watched one ad about
using household inhalants to get high. They didn't know anything
about this before. Now they know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things you can learn from your government.
</P>
<P>
   Another ad was canceled because of the uproar it caused among
gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed a young boy using drugs, so-called gateway drugs,
going on to heroin, then becoming a male prostitute selling his
body to men,'' Wright said. ``It was as if being gay was worse than
being a heroin addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, ad campaigns are very tricky things. ``It's hard to boil
down large problems to a 30-second spot,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially hard when you're trying to unsell drugs, and
right between ads selling beer. What, exactly, is the message here,
when beer is the gateway to alcohol addiction, which is responsible
for 100,000 deaths a year?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the message I get is that Clinton wants to look tough on
drugs, sympathetic to youth, and stay on the good side of TV
networks, which earn $626 million a year in revenues from beer ads.
</P>
<P>
   Now broadcasters are going to be making almost that much from
anti-drug ads, with no mention of alcohol as the most prevalent
drug of all.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not exactly right. TV is the most prevalent drug of
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What TV and drugs have in common is that they're what kids
turn to when they're bored,'' Wright said. ``What kids need is
after-school programs. If the kids aren't busy, they turn to
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The curious thing about this anti-drug media campaign is that it
presumes kids don't have anything better to do than watch TV,
listen to radio or surf the Internet. Or take drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't actually give them anything better to do.
</P>
<P>
   The president could have funded hundreds of Big Brother/Big
Sister Programs, which actually seem to keep at-risk kids off drugs
and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, alcohol, too, something Clinton's media campaign won't
mention, along with tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine bored kids' responses when they see anti-drug ads on TV
between the images of beautiful young people playing in the Rockies
with Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are natural skeptics and will know that these anti-drug ads
are just the propaganda arm of a failed drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not what they'll say. They'll just say ``bogus'' or
something else beginning with B.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of these kids have been through the Drug Abuse Resistance
Education program. According to a federally funded study published
in the American Journal of Public Health in 1994, kids who went
through DARE are no less likely to say no to drugs than kids who
had not gone through the program.
</P>
<P>
   But adults like the illusion that they're doing something about
drugs, especially when so many adults don't really know what their
own kids are doing, or have much control over them.
</P>
<P>
   They'll probably like the illusion that the president is doing
something, too, even though several presidents have failed in
fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are amazing, considering all the ``just say no''
and all the films of DEA agents making busts.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-seven percent of high school seniors say marijuana is
easy to obtain. Half the kids in America have tried it; however,
only 5 percent of them go on to serious drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is wasting huge amounts of taxpayers' money blanketing
the airwaves and cyberspace to reach kids who will have no problems
with drugs, while leaving the ones with real problems to go without
guidance or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he will reach all the voters.
</P>

Hamid will be performing the 16th and 17th as part of a three-day

stretches from the 60s to the 90s. Hamid is, in many ways, the one

``Music from the Heart'' by Rod Kennedy (Eakin Press, $29.95 paper;

   In most species, the rules are pretty simple: Males try to mate
as often as possible; females, who must bear and provide for
offspring, seek to limit their mates to the best candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Mating systems have evolved over millions of years, as males and
females try to achieve their conflicting agendas. But what if all
members of a species have the same agenda?
</P>
<P>
   For hermaphrodites, says zoologist Nico Michiels, love is war.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral
Physiology in Starnberg, Germany, studies hermaphroditic flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the literature on behavior and sexual conflict
focuses on species with separate sexes and there's very little
known about hermaphrodites,'' he says. ``People had assumed that
hermaphrodites are simply the sum of a male and a female. But the
conflicts hermaphrodites have are very different from those of
species with separate sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hermaphroditic flatworms mate hypodermically _ that is, a
flatworm must jab its penis into its partner and inject sperm.
</P>
<P>
   The sperm courses through the loose tissue of a flatworm's body
until it reaches the ovaries.
</P>
<P>
   This mating method is not uncommon in flatworms, but researchers
didn't realize that mating could escalate into a violent contest.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels and Leslie Newman of the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of Natural History observed matings between 17
pairs of flatworms.
</P>
<P>
   When two flatworms meet, ``they rear up in this spectacular
posture, stick out their penises and try to stab each other,''
Michiels says. The flatworms feint and parry in a duel that can
last an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Michiels calls this behavior penis fencing. The flatworm that
successfully stabs its mate gets to fertilize eggs, while the worm
being stabbed has to bear the cost of healing its wounds and
producing offspring _ hence the fencing match.
</P>
<P>
   Flatworm mating, Michiels says, is ``a sexual conflict that has
almost gotten out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Michiels recently found another flatworm species with sperm so
aggressive that it eats its way through tissue, leaving gaping
holes in the body of the unlucky mate. A worm can lose up to
two-thirds its body mass in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Penis fencing has been seen only in flat worms so far, but
Michiels suspects that other hermaphroditic species have also
evolved violent mating systems. ``Due to the identical but not
compatible interests of two mating partners,'' he says, ``you can
have sexual conflicts that escalate in a violent way, to an extent
that is not known in species with separate sexes.''

<P>
   The first symptoms of infection with the Ebola virus _ sore
throat, headache, muscle pain _ are deceptively mild harbingers of
the horrors to come.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days the virus victims begin vomiting blood and
bleeding profusely, both internally and from the nose, eyes and
gums.
</P>
<P>
   Between 50 percent and 90 percent of them die within two weeks _
some within days _ from blood loss and shock.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for Ebola and no vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 epidemic in the former Zaire, for example, left 245 dead.
At least 44 more died in Gabon in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   How does Ebola induce such massive hemorrhaging, and why do so
few people fight it off?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are only now providing the first clues to Ebola's
virulence. Surprisingly, this preliminary work has already led to
an experimental vaccine that, in guinea pigs at least, seems to
thwart the virus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few things known about Ebola was that during the
initial stages of infection, the virus floods the bloodstream with
a glycoprotein _ a protein with sugars attached.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knew what the glycoproprotein's role was in the
viral assault, but its overwhelming presence suggested it meant bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Michigan and at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta, however, have recently learned that the
glycoprotein is part of a two-pronged attack on the body that
leaves the victim bleeding and defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two forms of the glycoprotein. The virus
releases one into the bloodstream. The other _ a larger version of
the same glycoprotein _ remains attached to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nabel, a molecular virologist at the University of
Michigan, has found that the free form fastens onto a type of white
blood cell called a neutrophil.
</P>
<P>
   These cells are the immune system's frontline troops. They
engulf and destroy invading viruses and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrophils also signal the other fighters of the immune system:
the B cells that make antibodies and the T cells that kill
virus-infected cells.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel suspects that by binding to the neutrophils, Ebola's free
glycoprotein hobbles them so they can't combat the invader or
signal other cells. This frees the virus to attack the body's blood
vessels, using the attached glycoprotein as a key to enter
endothelial cells _ the cells that line the interiors of our veins
and arteries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that as Ebola invades and subverts the cells' genetic
machinery to make more of itself, it also damages the endothelial
cells, making blood vessels leaky and weak.
</P>
<P>
   The patient first bleeds and then goes into shock as falling
blood pressure leaves the circulatory system unable to pump blood
to vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Long before their immune systems can mount an antibody response
_ a process that can take weeks _ most Ebola victims bleed to
death.
</P>
<P>
   This understanding of Ebola's deadly one-two punch may help
Nabel further develop a prototype vaccine that has shown promising
results in guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine consists of the gene that codes for either type of
Ebola's glycoprotein spliced into a plasmid _ a harmless piece of
DNA from a bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel injected the vaccine into two groups of guinea pigs. Two
months later, he infected one group with live Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   After four months he infected the second group. (Guinea pigs
suffer the same hemorrhagic response to Ebola as humans do.)
</P>
<P>
   The animals in the first group not only produced T cells and
antibodies against Ebola but remained entirely healthy. Most of the
animals in the second group also survived the attack. Evidently,
the vaccine gave the guinea pigs enough time to muster an immune
response to counter Ebola.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel hopes his experimental vaccine will one day protect
high-risk populations living in the virus' home turf in sub-Saharan
Africa, as well as the doctors and nurses who attend Ebola patients
and the animal handlers in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nabel is optimistic about the prospects for his vaccine
he points out that diseases often thwart the best effort of medical
research. ``Viruses have a way of mutating and adapting.''

   This understanding of Ebola's deadly one-two punch may help
Nabel further develop a prototype vaccine that has shown promising
results in guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine consists of the gene that codes for either type of
Ebola's glycoprotein spliced into a plasmid _ a harmless piece of
DNA from a bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel injected the vaccine into two groups of guinea pigs. Two
months later, he infected one group with live Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   After four months he infected the second group. (Guinea pigs
suffer the same hemorrhagic response to Ebola as humans do.)
</P>
<P>
   The animals in the first group not only produced T cells and
antibodies against Ebola but remained entirely healthy. Most of the
animals in the second group also survived the attack. Evidently,
the vaccine gave the guinea pigs enough time to muster an immune
response to counter Ebola.
</P>
<P>
   Nabel hopes his experimental vaccine will one day protect
high-risk populations living in the virus' home turf in sub-Saharan
Africa, as well as the doctors and nurses who attend Ebola patients
and the animal handlers in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nabel is optimistic about the prospects for his vaccine
he points out that diseases often thwart the best effort of medical
research. ``Viruses have a way of mutating and adapting.''

   The bouquet of yellow roses. I never noticed the yellow roses
before _ tumbling around the presidential limousine as Jacqueline
Kennedy scrambles over the back seat and onto the trunk in a
panicked attempt to find pieces of her husband's brain and somehow
repair the horrific damage just done to him by the bullets that
exploded from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen images from the Zapruder film; with the possible
exception of man landing on the moon, it may be the most famous
footage in our history. Yet we've never seen it like this. Never
seen the images in such gruesomely clear detail as the presidential
motorcade follows its fateful path through Dealey Plaza, while an
unseen Lee Harvey Oswald takes aim from the sixth floor of the
Texas School Book Depository.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 years after dressmaker Abraham Zapruder stood near the
top of the grassy knoll, pointing his Bell &AMP; Howell 414PD Director
series, 8mm camera directly at President Kennedy's limo as the
shots rang out, his legendary film has been digitally enhanced and
showcased in a new 45-minute documentary, ``Image of an
Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film,'' which goes on
sale today (July 13) and is expected to sell hundreds of thousands
of units.
</P>
<P>
   I obtained an advance copy from the MPI Media Group, the Orland
Park, Ill.-based company that produced the video. While the
documentary is padded somewhat with interviews and
less-than-riveting footage of the lab wizards working on the
project, it also includes fascinating details about what happened
to the film in the hours after the assassination and the decades
since then.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there's the improved edition of the Zapruder film
itself, shown several times. That alone is worth the $19.98 retail
price.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, though: Frame 313, when that second shot hits Kennedy
and tears off so much of his skull, is more shocking and graphic
than the pretend-schlock you see in fictional drama, or even the
violent images on the evening news or in documentaries. It is not
for children or the squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Image of an Assassination'' does a thorough job of chronicling
Zapruder's moves from the morning of Nov. 22 through the following
week. After the assassination, a semi-dazed Zapruder was walking
back to his office in the Dal-Tex Building across the street from
the Book Depository when he ran into a reporter for the Dallas
Morning News and told him about the footage he'd taken.
</P>
<P>
   They brought the film to WFAA, a local TV station affiliated
with the paper, thinking there might be facilities to develop it.
Zapruder was snagged for a live interview with the anchor on duty.
</P>
<P>
   While the anchor smokes a cigarette and listens to a hand-held
earpiece, Zapruder says, ``I heard a shot. He slumped to the side,
like this ... then I heard another shot, or two, I couldn't tell if
it was one or two. I saw his head practically open up, blood and
everything. I kept on shooting (film) ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV station couldn't develop the film so it was taken to
Kodak. In a move of astonishing clarity and calculation, Zapruder
obtained affidavits from Kodak and from the lab that developed the
film on the spot, stating that only three copies would be made.
Zapruder gave two copies to the government and kept one for himself
_ and in a matter of days, he had sold all rights to Time Inc., for
a total of $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine published still-frame photos, but the chairman of
Time Inc. didn't think the American public should see the film, so
it was out of circulation for years. The first time it was shown in
public was at the 1969 trial in New Orleans when Jim Garrison tried
(and failed miserably) to prove there was a conspiracy to
assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder's widow and children regained the rights to the film in
the 1970s; they occasionally made copies available for a fee, and
are now negotiating with the government, which has offered $3
million for ownership of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a deal was made to produce ``Image of an
Assassination,'' which has received tremendous hype in the last few
weeks. The images on the film were not altered in any way, but the
digital process removed scratches and hairs _ and the viewing area
is enlarged considerably because for the first time we can see the
section of the film between the sprocket holes. (Paranoid alert: A
few frames, damaged by previous archivists, are missing from the
original and thus are missing again here.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Zapruder film is shown once, twice, three times. In
slow motion. In close-up, focused just on Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He waves to the crowd. A sign obscures our view for an instant _
and the next time we see the president, he is clutching at his
throat as his wife becomes aware that something is wrong. She is
tending to him with her white-gloved hands as the second shot rings
out.
</P>

THE MEN BEHIND THE MASK: HOPKINS AND BANDERAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Antonio Banderas takes pride in being the first
Spaniard to play Zorro, the fictional Spanish hero of pulp
magazines, television and more than 50 films dating back to the
silent era.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who is that masked man?
</P>
<P>
   In the first scene of ``The Mask of Zorro,'' a refreshingly
low-tech yet lavish action romp opening Friday, the masked hero
looks strangely like _ could it be? Yes, Welshman Anthony Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   But after Hopkins fights greedy Spanish oppressors in early
1800s California, a 20-year jump-cut brings Banderas into the
picture. He plays Alejandro, a young rogue who's tutored by the
aristocratic Don Diego (Hopkins) to become the new champion of
early California settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Alejandro is donning Zorro's black garb, wielding the whip,
riding the horse called Tornado and brandishing the distinctive
``Z'' with a flick of his sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I saw the film recently that it really
occurred to me: I actually played Zorro,'' Hopkins said with a
laugh during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he and Banderas were fighting for the spotlight. Even
when Hopkins' character teaches the younger man sword-fighting _
with painful precision _ ``we were never really competitive,''
Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it (fencing) without any angst. You rehearse it like a
dance. It's a piece of choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Banderas was more intent on bringing humor than
brawny action mettle, which he's already displayed in films such as
``Desperado,'' to the adventurer's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read the (Zorro) script, I was impressed by all
the different styles, going from full drama to comedy and from
action to romance,'' Banderas said. ``But I felt it was very
important to give a strong accent to the comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas grew up adoring Zorro, from reading Zorro comics to
watching Guy Williams play the role on a Disney TV series.
</P>
<P>
   But as an adult, he wanted Zorro to be more than the stout
defender of justice drawn from Johnston McCulley's stories in 1920s
pulp magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas believed today's viewers ``should laugh with Zorro. In
that way you invite people to participate with you in the
adventure. Otherwise, Zorro becomes an arrogant guy with a sword in
his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   By helping to ``push the comedy further than it was in the
script,'' he feels the film ``plays well, because it makes the
character more sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time this guy becomes a hero, we've seen him failing,
messing around, doing bad things. He begins as a naive, childish
guy _ very raw, uneducated and impolite. He learns what he needs
from the master (Hopkins), but even then he can still make
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes his romancing of Elena, played by Catherine
Zeta-Jones. She proves to be formidable with a sword herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' is Banderas' first film since 1996's
Evita, the big-budget musical in which he starred with Madonna.
That followed a string of U.S. movies that began with 1992's ``The
Mambo Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Banderas had made dozens of films in his native
Spain, some of which appeared on the U.S. art-house circuit,
notably those of director Pedro Almodovar, such as ``Tie Me Up! Tie
Me Down!''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a policeman and a teacher, Banderas might have been a
soccer player instead of an actor. But at age 14 he broke his foot.
Unable to play, he began learning to act.
</P>
<P>
   After Spanish stardom, the transition to U.S. films wasn't easy,
in large part due to language. Banderas is still studying and
learning English and speaks with a strong accent.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Mambo Kings,'' he knew little English and learned his
lines phonetically. Now he has a speech coach ``who's very picky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The English is coming along little by little,'' said Banderas,
37. ``It takes time and work and sacrifice. At first it was really
painful, but it has to be done. English is a tool, an instrument,
and I feel I can control it much more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet his native tongue and accent have hardly been a hindrance in
this country, Banderas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm trapped in America _ that I can only play
certain characters,'' he said. ``But the fact is, I was even more
trapped in Spain. I'd been in 34 movies in Spain and felt I was
repeating myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I started doing different styles. I've
jumped from `Interview With the Vampire,' a horror movie, to
comedies such as `Miami Rhapsody' to thrillers like `Never Talk to
Strangers' to action movies like `Desperado' to a musical,
`Evita.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he was filming `Philadelphia' with Tom Hanks, Banderas
said, Hanks told him ``never to lose my accent, because it's exotic
and it's good. He said as long as people understand you, you'll
have big possibilities in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Banderas, Hopkins, 60, feels the same urge to spread his
wings _ even after a four-decade career that's earned him the title
of a knighted ``Sir,'' an Oscar for 1991's ``The Silence of the
Lambs'' and near-universal praise for his roles in English period
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   That's all very nice, but for Hopkins, action films such as
``The Mask of Zorro'' are like a new toy, and he's playing the game
with a vengeance _ so much so that he was limping and using a cane
on this day in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing an action movie with Cuba Gooding Jr.
(``Instinct``), and I snapped my Achilles' tendon in a fight
scene,'' Hopkins said. ``Before that I was in `The Edge,' another
physical role for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm into the action movies now _ and it's great to break
out of the mold of the stuff I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Mask of Zorro,'' Hopkins watched videos of old films
by Douglas Fairbanks, who played the role, and Errol Flynn, who did
not. Hopkins then worked with a fencing coach before and during the
six-month shoot in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He already had some experience with a sword from his stage
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Hamlet,' in `Henry IV,' in a lot of Shakespeare plays,
there's a sword fight by the end,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   His more recent English dramas, such as ``The Remains of the
Day,'' ``are nice,'' Hopkins said, ``but I'm not that type of
person at all. That's why I live out here (in L.A.).
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked how I played a butler in `Remains of the Day,'
and I said I just walked around and spoke quietly. But really, I've
got as much energy as Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two actors' chemistry and relationship was analogous
to that of their characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the older one and, like Don Diego, I'm a bit of a rebel
and a loner,'' he said. ``Antonio is Spanish, with that fiery
temperament. My character doesn't sweat much, doesn't push, because
he's done it all. As you get older, things become more
effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hopkins gets impatient with younger actors who ``walk
around mumbling, muttering and shuffling. Just say the line. Tell
the story and get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also feels as he's gotten older that ``the parts are more
close to me. It's much more fun now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But really, any role is just another version of yourself, of
your own personality. I don't understand what acting is all about.
Just learn your lines, hit the marks and place the checks in the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas has more of a youthful fervor _ especially when
discussing his new work as a director. He's currently filming
``Crazy in Alabama,'' a dark comedy in which he stars with Melanie
Griffith, whom he married two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 51 movies, I needed badly to jump behind the camera _ to
the other side of the mirror,'' he said. ``I thought it was time
for me to express myself as a filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas said the production ``is going great, but I'm not a
director yet. I have nine days to go. You're not a director when
you start a movie. You're a director when you finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I have to wait several months to see if I'm a good
director or a bad director.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes to play more roles such as in ``The Mask of
Zorro.'' ``I feel an obligation as a Spaniard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very happy if I am representing the Spanish community
for the good things I do. It's a responsibility I want to put on my
shoulders.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The more things change, the more they stay the
same. Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, when a national television program questioned
whether justice was for sale in Texas, the alleged buyers were
plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   They were making millions of dollars in eye-raising _ but
perfectly legal _ political contributions to Texas Supreme Court
justices and candidates and cashing in on court decisions that made
it easier to win big damage judgments for their consumer-clients
and lucrative fees for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that same TV show, CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' is getting ready to
take another look at justice, Texas-style, reportedly for airing
this fall. Producers already have been in Austin, asking more
questions about campaign contributions to judges and judicial
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican and civil justice revolution has transformed the
state's highest civil court and much of Texas' judicial system
since the previous ``60 Minutes'' segment was produced. But our
judicial campaign finance system remains as troubling an ethical
question _ and fodder for national entertainment _ as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys, doctors, insurance companies and other
business interests have long since replaced plaintiffs' lawyers as
the major fuelers of judicial races. And they have succeeded in
electing high court justices who have made it more difficult for
consumers to win large damage awards against doctors and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The same contributors also have convinced the Legislature to
enact major ``tort reform'' laws putting the brakes on plaintiffs
and their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   All nine members of the Texas Supreme Court were Democrats and
most were philosophically aligned with plaintiffs' lawyers when the
``60 Minutes'' program aired in 1987. Now, seven of the nine are
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier ``60 Minutes'' program sharply criticized Texas law
for allowing elected judges to accept large campaign contributions
from lawyers who practiced before them. Some people have given that
program credit for spurring the widespread changes that were soon
to take place in the faces and political philosophies of Texas
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Such credit, however, may be overblown.
</P>
<P>
   The program certainly beefed up some campaign ads for Republican
judicial candidates, but its overall significance may have been a
matter of timing more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   The show aired just as Republicans were beginning to make
significant inroads in the lower Texas courts and campaign
contributions from civil justice reformers were beginning to make
their mark in judicial elections.
</P>
<P>
   It also aired on the eve of some of the most critical elections
ever held for the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democrats, including Chief Justice John Hill, resigned
from the Supreme Court in 1987 and 1988, giving then-Gov. Bill
Clements, a Republican, the opportunity to replace them with
Republican appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Those appointments broke the solid Democratic hold on the high
court and gave the Republicans a headstart on the 1988 judicial
elections. The GOP won three of the six court seats on the ballot
that year and has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the political and philosophical transformation, the
overriding problem persists:
</P>
<P>
   Texas judges and judicial candidates still run in partisan
elections and still take large amounts of campaign contributions
from lawyers and other interests with high stakes in the
judiciary's decisions. Only now, the shoe is on the other foot.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent reports by consumer and campaign finance
reform advocates, the Texas Supreme Court now heavily favors
business defendants over consumers and justices receive significant
contributions from sources with interests in pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court justices and their supporters say the reports are
flawed and unfair and deny that the court's decisions are
influenced by political donations. They say that none of the
court's critics have been able to link a campaign contribution to a
specific decision.
</P>
<P>
   And supporters point out that most, if not all, of the current
justices favor dumping the partisan election system in favor of
gubernatorial appointments with retention elections. But they have
been unable to convince the Legislature to do that _ or to persuade
Gov. George W. Bush to join their reform effort.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Legislature imposed campaign contribution
limits in judicial races, but they are too weak to make much of a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The names, faces and labels may have changed since the ``60
Minutes'' cameras first focused on the Texas judiciary, but the
same perception _ that some people may be trying to buy and sell
justice in Texas _ persists.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions can't replace integrity, but they can destroy the
public confidence that integrity deserves.

PETS ARE SAFE ALOFT BUT MISS THE FUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when the old bones are creaking in the midsummer heat, I
can always depend on a reader to elicit a chuckle, albeit on a
serious subject.
</P>
<P>
   Texas resident Wanda Odom's recent letter, for instance: ``My
husband and I would like to take our little pet poodle with us when
we travel by plane,'' Odom wrote. ``But because of the terrifying
stories we hear of pets dying in the heat or extreme cold or
getting out of their cages and being lost, we hesitate to take
Rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please try to find out the real truth for us,'' she continued.
``Maybe even ride down in that compartment to see how the situation
really is!''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness Wanda added a ``just kidding'' to that last
request. I'd hesitate giving up my assigned seat on the wing where
I can check for any engine malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Odom and countless others who cherish exploring the
world with their dogs can take comfort in knowing that Rusty likely
will be well cared for on airplanes. Most folks who load and unload
carriers love pets, too. And a few common-sense precautions can
ease the journey, according to Eileen Barish, author of several
books that focus on pet travel, including ``Vacationing With Your
Pet and Doin' Texas With Your Pooch'' (Pet-Friendly Publications,
each $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Among Barish's recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Ascertain individual airline policies _ including allowable
carrier size _ well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Book nonstop flights.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Select early-morning or late-evening flights in summer and
afternoon flights in winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Don't feed your dog for at least six hours prior to
departure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Don't give your dog any medications not prescribed by a
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fill the water tray in the dog's carrier with ice cubes, not
water, to prevent spillage during loading.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame that Rusty, according to Odom, ``is a little too
big to fit under the seat.'' Not because of any dangers in the
cargo hold, though, but because he'll miss out on all the
excitement in passenger cabins these days.
</P>
<P>
   First came several much-publicized revelations of fisticuffs at
35,000 feet. Then, a Wall Street Journal report concentrated on
passengers confusing their aisle and window seats for a boudoir.
(``It's uninhibited up there,'' a former United Airlines flight
attendant said.) Another passenger sought a different form of
mile-high entertainment: He tried to board carrying a bowling ball.
</P>
<P>
   Are air travelers confused? InsideFlyer magazine reports the
following ideas have been suggested to Houston-based Continental
Airlines: glass-bottomed aircraft for better viewing, roll-down
windows so passengers can feel the breeze, and soundproofed
children's sections. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Only the pilots seem serene. Alas, so serene that recent
studies conducted by NASA and federal aviation experts indicate
that one in seven pilots has nodded off in the cockpit,
particularly on overnight international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Asiana Airlines has the right idea about keeping pilots
awake. And maintaining passenger control.
</P>
<P>
   For Asiana's new onboard entertainment program on flights
between Los Angeles and South Korea, according to Business Traveler
magazine, 16 flight attendants with musical and artistic talents
have been selected to perform live magic shows, sing and play
instruments, lead stretching exercises, coordinate birthday
celebrations and entertain children with face-painting and cartoon
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't Rusty have a blast?

SOME MAGNOLIAS CAN TAKE YEARS TO BLOOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have a magnolia that is 13 years old. It seems
healthy and grows well but never bloomed until last year, when it
produced two blooms. Is there anything I can do to induce
flowering?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some magnolias, especially seedlings, can take years to
bloom. Those planted in sun flower best. Magnolias prefer an
acidic, loose soil. Add organic matter to enrich the soil. Apply a
12-24-12 fertilizer in early spring to encourage blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was given a plant without a name. I've given several people
a start. It multiplies quickly but can be kept under control by
pulling the plants up where I don't want them. Before the flower
opens, it looks like many dark purple seeds all over the top. They
burst open to a lilac color, so it is pretty in the different
stages of bloom. It is 4 to 5 feet tall in good soil.
</P>
<P>
   A: You have one of the clerodendrums. Match yours to one of the
following descriptions: ``Clerodendrum bungei,'' or cashmere
bouquet, is a shrubby perennial that has clusters of red-purple to
deep pink flowers in summer. It matures to about 5 feet and spreads
by suckers. The large, serrated, heart-shaped leaves have a bad
smell if crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The similar fragrant glorybower, ``Clerodendrum fragrans
pleniflorum,'' tolerates various soils and produces large,
hydrangealike clusters of small pinkish blooms. Some dislike the
odor. The leaves are large, up to 10 inches, and look like those of
``C. bungei.'' This plant also spreads by root suckers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: &UR;  &LR; This spring I bought my first gazania daisy and planted it
in a barrel with several other bedding plants. It's in full sun
through noon with shade in late afternoon. It bloomed profusely and
was a great delight. I was away and let the barrel dry out for two
days. The gazania died while nothing else even looked stressed. I
was in nurseries in June and saw dozens of gazanias dying.
</P>
<P>
   Did my gazania die from lack of water? Is this the natural time
of year for it to die? Is this climate unsuitable for a gazania no
matter what you do? Is it an annual or a perennial? I would like to
have more next year if possible.
</P>
<P>
   A: Gazania daisies come in bold yellow, red and orange as well
as pink, bronze and bicolors. Blooms generally appear well into
fall, but I don't see much action among mine in this insufferable
heat. Those blooms that might open are smaller than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Gazania flowers close at night. Foliage is narrow and is green
above and gray below; some varieties have silver leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It took me awhile to find the right spot in our garden for these
South African natives. The key, I found, to growing these
drought-tolerant plants here is excellent drainage. Given this, the
plants may prove short-lived perennials. Those that have done best
are planted on the sloping side of a bed and around rocks. They are
watered when the rest of the bed is watered, but the excess
moisture drains quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hurd at JJL Greenhouse, a wholesale company in Houston,
says he's found that gazanias dislike competition and organic
mulch. He suggests mulching with gravel. If you plant more next
spring, do not crowd the gazanias with other bedding plants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some of the above factors contributed to the sudden
demise of your gazanias. Quick death is not uncommon with these
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the nursery stock you saw was overwatered as workers
tried to compensate for the heat and drought. Add that extra water
to high humidity and the plants may have drowned. Or the small pots
may have parched in the scorching heat, and the plants were not
watered in time.
</P>
<P>
   Gazania flowers are so striking, I would give them another go
when healthy plants are again available. Morning sun and shade in
the hot afternoon is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have two plum trees, a Methley and a Santa Rosa, that are 3
years old. Both are about 10 feet tall. To this date neither has
produced fruit. This year I got a few blooms on one tree.
</P>
<P>
   A: Plums usually take three to five years to begin fruiting, so
yours may be a little young yet. `Santa Rosa' produces quality
fruit and is said to be a good pollinator for other varieties.
However, keep in mind that it can fall victim to bacterial canker
within 10 years. The `Methley,' too, is a good-tasting plum and is
disease-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a dilemma as to what pest is eating my photinias. All
the leaves look like lace or have been chewed, no matter how tall
the plant is. I have sprinkled snail bait around the plant and
sprayed, but nothing helps. I cannot see a pest.
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; If the leaves are skeletonized, a beetle or the larva of a
beetle or moth may be at work. Leaf beetles will leave only the
skeleton of a leaf; caterpillars, the larvae of various insects,
will do the same. Flea beetles are tiny, hopping black insects that
eat holes in leaves. Beetles can be hard to spot as some move
quickly when they know you're coming.
</P>
<P>
   When you approach a shrub, run your hand over the branches and
watch for escaping pests; maybe you can see what's at work. If it's
a small beetle, look for an insecticide that targets these pests.
</P>
<P>
   If you see caterpillars, use ``Bacillus thuringiensis,'' or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Lace bugs, which look like their name, will suck the juice from
leaves, leaving white or yellow stipling on the tops of the
foliage. The pests leave black excrement on the undersides. Spider
mites cause similar damage, but these are difficult to see. Hard
sprays from the water hose, directed to the undersides of the
foliage, will discourage both pests. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   There are pesticides such as rotenone that help control these,
too.
</P>

AVOID CONSUMER CREDIT-PROPERTY INSURANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you bought an appliance using credit, you may have
purchased insurance you never knew you bought.
</P>
<P>
   It's called consumer credit-property insurance and it pays if
property, such as a computer, refrigerator or stereo, is stolen or
damaged while the loan is being paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage is generally sold by department stores and
specialty stores marketing such goods as electronics, furniture and
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   This is one form of insurance you should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible stuff,'' said J. Robert Hunter, former Texas
insurance commissioner and now director of insurance at the
Consumer Federation of America in Washington, D.C. ``It's
high-priced, and it was my experience in Texas especially that it
tends to be poor people down in the Valley who end up buying all
this stuff because people don't even know they're buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers normally don't even have a chance to say no because
they are not told they are buying the insurance. But that should be
changing soon. Starting in January, rates and policy forms will
fall under the eye of the Texas Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found was that there was a very low claim total on
this type of policy, which made us suspect that a lot of people
didn't know what they were purchasing when they purchased it,''
said Jim Davis, spokesman for the insurance department.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of claims paid for credit property insurance, known
in the industry as ``loss ratios,'' range from as low as 2 percent
to as high as 50 percent. A ratio of 2 percent means that for every
dollar you pay in premiums, the insurance company returns 2 cents
to you in the form of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the property/casualty marketplace, what we like to see are
loss ratios around 75 percent,'' said Rod Bordelon, head of the
Office of Public Insurance Counsel in Austin, a state agency that
represents consumers on insurance matters.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the low-claims level is that this coverage
duplicates the protection in a homeowners or renters insurance
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, retailers will have to tell consumers
clearly that credit property insurance may duplicate coverage on
their homeowners or renters policy.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also have to tell you how much the insurance costs, that
you have the right to cancel the policy at any time, and that this
insurance is supposed to pay for any covered property before your
homeowners coverage kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that makes this insurance a bad deal is that
frequently the premium payments for credit-property insurance are
tacked on to a consumer's loan, which often goes on a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But as you buy other items on your credit card, your balance
goes up, which increases your premium. This is a bad deal since
credit-property coverage will only pay off if the item you bought
is damaged, Bordelon said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-property insurance can be called several names, including
a ``buyer protection program.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to make sure it's not on the tab is to ask whether
you're paying for something in addition to the item you bought. But
that's easy to forget because you're often distracted when paying
for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're focused on whatever it is you're buying, and they slide
this thing in with usually inadequate disclosure,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how three insurance companies owned by Montgomery Ward
got in trouble with Texas insurance regulators earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the insurers encouraged customers to buy a
``Credit Security Plan'' by signing a line on charge account slips,
without informing them that they were buying insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery Ward insurers, without admitting wrongdoing,
consented to an enforcement order by regulators and agreed to
refund as much as $5 million to consumers who unwittingly bought
the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the premium you pay for the coverage is split up as money
for the insurance company and a commission for the retailer that
sold you the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rule at the Consumer Federation of America: Don't
ever buy insurance from somebody who's trying to sell you something
else,'' Hunter said. ``There's usually a huge kickback to whomever
is selling you the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If a retailer sold you the coverage without your knowledge, you
can complain to the insurance department by calling 800-252-3439.

TEXAS BOARD JOINS TREND OF OPTING FOR `FEEL GOOD' INVESTMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When the Texas Board of Education decided to dump $43
million in Walt Disney Co. stock last week because of moral
concerns, it joined a growing trend in the investment world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend some say is being fueled in part by aging baby
boomers who grew up in the world of civil rights and environmental
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, it's a trend supported by investment managers
who have shown that they can invest responsibly without having to
sacrifice strong investment performance, financial analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money invested in socially screened investment
portfolios between 1995 and 1997, for example, more than tripled
from $162 billion to $529 billion, according to the Social
Investment Forum, a nonprofit organization of investment
professionals dedicated to responsible investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more investors and consumers are realizing the link
between their money and many of the social problems we face,'' said
Ross Gaskin, managing director of the Social Investment Forum in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who opt for ``feel good'' investments use a fairly
complex set of benchmarks to evaluate a company's practices,
including its commitment to the environment, labor relations,
diversity and the community.
</P>
<P>
   But social consciousness must be balanced against financial
common sense, said Peter Kinder, president of Kinder, Lydenberg,
Domini &AMP; Co. in Cambridge, Mass., which provides social research on
U.S. and foreign corporations to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you must be socially responsible, but I must also be a
responsible investor, and if you're going to apply social screens
to your investments, you should not reduce the quality of your
financial screens,'' he said. ``You really don't have to give up
performance in order to have social screens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Domini 400 Social Index, created by Kinder's firm, consists
of the stocks of 400 corporations that have passed a socially
responsible test of sorts. The index was up 5.2 percent in June,
beating the 4.1 percent gain of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should divest blindly and without regard for what the
financial implications are,'' Kinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock has been on a tear. It rose a whopping 45 percent
in the last year, zooming past the 29.7 percent return of the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Disney shares split 3-for-1 Friday, rising 1 1/8 to
close at 38 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were advising my clients, I would recommend that they not
sell the stock but that they use the weakness in the price to add
to their positions,'' said Linda Bannister, an analyst who follows
Disney for the Edward Jones brokerage firm in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In evaluating the social conscience of companies, investment
firms that engage in ethical investing apply thorough methods.
</P>
<P>
   At the Calvert Group in Bethesda, Md., for example, money
managers submit the names of financially attractive stocks to the
company's analysts, who then examine the companies' performance in
such areas as environmental responsibility, labor relations,
discrimination and community responsibility, said Elizabeth
Laurienzo, Calvert spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The company also won't invest in firms in the alcohol, tobacco
and gambling industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't like to think of it as a moral issue,''
Laurienzo said. ``It's more of a quality-of-management issue. We
feel that companies that have managements that pay attention to
these types of issues,'' and care about their employees, ``are
going to be successful in the long run.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Time magazine and CNN have retracted their joint
story claiming a U.S. Special Forces unit dropped sarin nerve gas
at an encampment in Laos in order to kill American military
defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an eight-month investigation, the repudiated report
relied heavily on one source: former Lt. Robert Van Buskirk, who
claimed he killed two of the ``beaucoup roundeyes'' when they
slipped into an underground tunnel system.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 20 defectors at the camp, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When this hit the news in early June, I thought the nerve gas
allegation plausible. Given the use of napalm, defoliants and B-52
carpet bombing runs during America's longest war, the clandestine
use of nerve gas would be within the realm of possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But I was struck that any journalist could buy the notion that
20 American military defectors would somehow show up at the same
secret place.
</P>
<P>
   How would they know where this sanctuary was located? Did they
walk through the war zone in Vietnam to Laos? What was the place
called, the Peace &AMP; Freedom Hotel? Did they check in with Tom
Hayden at the front desk?
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk's account sounds to me like a soldier's tale that
has grown richer over time. And April Oliver, the producer for CNN,
bolstered the lieutenant's credibility with additional amazing
snippets and soundbites neatly edited to fit her predetermined Gas
&AMP; Traitor agenda.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Van Buskirk's story reminded me of a famous
defector I heard about when I served as a photographer in 1966 with
the Third Marine Division in Vietnam. I was attached to a photo lab
in Da Nang, but spent a lot of time out in the boonies snapping
pictures of the war.
</P>
<P>
   I was regaled with all sorts of wild rumors while sitting in a
circle with a bunch of grunts eating C-rations and smoking free
cigarettes supplied by the patriotic tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of medical supplies found with Berkeley, Calif., postmarks
in a Viet Cong stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Lurid details of genital mutilation on Marines overrun by the
enemy. Resentment over another company's supposed access to more
than two beers a man at an enlisted men's canteen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the rumors circulating in the Asian mudhole, the one I
heard most often concerned the ``White Cong.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemed everybody in the ``Crotch,'' as it was lovingly called by
Marines, had heard about this guy. Although a traitor, this mythic
Marine fit the Iwo Jima image: macho, brave, willing to take great
risks.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't hiding out in Laos. He was with the Viet Cong shooting
back at us.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew his name or what outfit he supposedly defected from.
He was said to be a big guy with blond hair. (Van Buskirk's
``victim'' also had blond hair: ``Looks like he was running off a
beach in California.'')
</P>
<P>
   I wanted more details. After a few days out with an infantry
company, I'd make an inquiry if the story of this elusive character
didn't come up in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys had heard about him. If not, my bringing it up was
grist for the mill. I may have done more to perpetuate the myth of
the White Cong than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, when I did hear about him it was always second-hand or,
more likely, sixth-hand. On two occasions I spoke with Marines who
claimed they had seen the blond gunner in black pajamas pop out
from behind a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them could give Van Buskirk a run for his money. As the
White Cong story unreeled, the gleam in their eyes _ along with
rolling eyes of their comrades _ confirmed it was all smoke.
</P>
<P>
   I heard about the White Cong in the ancient imperial capital of
Hue near the Demilitarized Zone separating South and North Vietnam,
in the hills and jungles around Da Nang, and in the rice paddies
that seemed to stretch clear to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The White Cong crisscrossed more terrain than I did. But I
jumped from place to place by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   How he did this on foot remains a mystery. Well, not really. I
suppose he rode on a magic carpet, an M-16 in one hand and in the
other a Viet Cong flag, rippling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in my grimmer moments, I kind of wanted to believe the
blond traitor was out there, like some spirit of Death &AMP; Fire
reeking revenge on the Crotch. And what a photograph that would
have been!

MODERN IRONING BOARD THE BRAINCHILD OF A FORMER SLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ To achieve a properly ironed look for bed, table
or garment, it's essential to have a proper ironing board and not
to use a bed or a folded towel on a countertop for ironing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Seymour Housewares Corp. in Indiana,
approximately 5.7 million ironing boards are purchased each year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Early ironing boards simply consisted of a wooden plank placed
across two chairs or a plain table top.
</P>
<P>
   The early collapsible-leg, padded, wooden ironing board was the
brainchild of Sarah Boone, a former slave, who patented her idea in
1892. Soon, the ironing board was modified and tapered at one end,
to accommodate delicate garment pieces and shapes. Because of damp
or wet clothing, the boards would often warp from moisture
absorption. By the late 1920s, boards were lacquered to seal them.
</P>
<P>
   Solid metal ironing boards of the 1950s eliminated the problem
of warpage, but they sometimes buckled under the heat and tended to
collect condensation under the padding. Today's wire mesh surfaces
allow the moisture to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   A deluxe ironing board with an expanded mesh metal top, 100
percent cotton cover and extra thick steam-permeable felt pad,
built-in cordminder, four legs for stability and dual position iron
rest costs approximately $69.99.
</P>
<P>
   Other metal ironing boards without all of the bells and whistles
cost from about $19.99 without a cover to $49.99.
</P>
<P>
   Ironing boards with a stable T-leg design (instead of four legs)
cost about $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   If you hate lugging the ironing board out every time you have to
use it, then a space-saving over-the-door model may be for you.
This one costs $29.99. It installs quickly and folds up and down
instantly, like models that were built into narrow wall closets in
some older homes.
</P>
<P>
   For quick touch-ups, there's a table/counter top model for $4.99
with legs that fold for easy storage.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's a small padded folding board for $10.99 that's
just for sleeves and collars.

TEXAS PUTS TEEN DRIVERS' LIVES IN HARM'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Is a teen-ager prepared to drive?
</P>
<P>
   As more teen-agers die in traffic accidents, I'm convinced the
answer is no. But tell that to the Texas Legislature, which last
year turned back a proposal for a graduated license system. It was
one that would impose restrictions, then ease them as teen-agers
gained more experience behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers ignored the bloody facts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, motor vehicle accidents became the leading cause of
death for Texas teens, surpassing deaths by handguns and drugs. The
national auto death rate for 16-year-olds, meanwhile, doubled
between 1975 and 1996, from 19 per 100,000 licensed drivers to 35
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers point to a pattern in behavior that strongly
suggests many teens may not be prepared to handle the
responsibility of driving.
</P>
<P>
   _ The invincibility factor: Teens often believe no harm can come
to them, an attitude that safety experts say is reflected in
seat-belt use. The Texas Department of Public Safety reported that
58 percent of teens killed in car accidents in 1996 weren't wearing
their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other young people in the car: Studies indicate that a car
filled with teens is a recipe for disaster, raising the likelihood
of an accident by up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speed: After laws raised the speed limit on highways to 70
mph, traffic fatalities among teens increased 38 percent in Texas,
from 373 deaths in 1995 to 514 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states now have some limits on teen drivers, with
California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio
cited by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for including
critical elements of a ``proper'' three-step program.
</P>
<P>
   Those include prohibitions against nighttime driving and a ban
on carrying other teens in the same vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Texas. Permissive laws make it easy for teens to
drive. Too easy. Driver's education now largely is handled by
private enterprise with little oversight to ensure teens are
getting proper instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the dreaded driving test with the uniformed state trooper
isn't even part of the rite of passage as it was for me and many
others. Nothing like a state trooper sitting next to you to make
you drive the speed limit and wear your seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at my own experience as a teen-age driver _ marked
by two memorable wrecks _ I wish I had waited. Then I might have
known better than to follow so closely behind the car I wound up
rear-ending when it stopped abruptly on the highway to avoid
hitting a dog. And I could have known to turn the wheel in the
direction of a skid that, on one drizzly day, caused me to
sideswipe a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, even adult drivers may not know how to control such
situations. But state lawmakers now are leaving teens' lives to
chance. That's not a risk parents should let them take with their
children.

IN MOSCOW, AN UNWELCOME MAT ROLLS OUT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The raid descended on Moscow's Luzhniki outdoor market so
rapidly and stealthily that no one noticed anything until riot
police had surrounded the sprawling stadium where the bazaar is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked buyers fled to the exits. Vendors folded up their metal
stands. Within minutes, police started making arrests and escorting
large groups out of the stadium and into a convoy of buses.
</P>
<P>
   This was no drug bust _ in fact, the suspects had not broken any
laws at all. Rather, this crackdown was the latest example of what
city officials call an effort to ``clean up'' Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is something called the first annual World Youth
Games, 10 days of competition among athletes ages 13-17 from about
130 countries that began Monday (July 13). The games, which have
the blessing of the International Olympic Committee, are more than
a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow authorities want the games to showcase their city as a
possible host for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Streets have been
repaved and tunnels repainted. Workers are planting grass and
flowers, and hanging up Olympic flags and posters that say
``Welcome to Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the welcome is not for everybody. For months, police have
been detaining homeless people and putting them on trains out of
Moscow _ a favorite tactic of the old Soviet police state that the
capital's current mayor, Yury Luzhkov, has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow requires residents to carry with them a passport bearing
a permit that allows them to live in the city. The rule, which
excludes most homeless, refugees, and migrants from other parts of
Russia, violates the country's 1993 Constitution, which grants all
citizens freedom of movement. But it is popular with many
Muscovites, who see homeless people and migrants as the source of
much of the capital's crime.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations protested when Luzhkov swept the
homeless off Moscow's streets during the 50th anniversary of the
end of World War II in 1995, and again last September, for the
city's 850th birthday. But Moscovites applauded the crackdowns, and
Luzhkov shrugged off the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest showcase event for Moscow getting underway, the
mayor, a potential frontrunner for presidential elections in the
year 2000, is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   During preparations for the youth games last month, police
closed down a mobile medical screening center for the homeless run
by the international relief agency Doctors without Borders. The
police's explanation: Young athletes arriving at a nearby train
station might be exposed to infectious diseases homeless people
might carry..
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the point of the clinic was to provide proper
medical care to sick homeless people, with such diseases as
tuberculosis, to reduce the risk of spreading infection.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Luzhniki Market, the people detained in the recent raid were
not homeless, but were found to have violated the city's residence
rule. The market was one of several huge outdoor bazaars closed
down for the duration of the games.
</P>
<P>
   The markets are so lucrative that vendors from throughout the
former Soviet Union are happy to pay high rents, plus a monthly fee
to extortion rackets that averages $12,000. But evidently, the
chaotic markets do not present the image Luzhkov wants to project.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov has ordered into the streets 32,000 police, who have
stepped up document checks of anyone with dark features, figuring
they might be illegal migrants from the Caucasus region or Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One victim of the crackdown was an employee from the Council of
Europe, a Dutch citizen with dark features who was detained twice
in Moscow in recent weeks. Ironically, he was here to attend
seminars on human rights.

CLINTON PLAYING IT SAFE DOWN THE BACKSTRETCH OF HIS TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Full of energy, intensity, and maybe even
mischief, Bill Clinton has all the characteristics of the classic
risk-taker in his personal life. But as he approaches the midpoint
of his second, and final, term, the president is seeming
risk-averse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clings to safe issues: the struggle against drugs, the
effort to keep guns out of schools, the fight to preserve Social
Security. He shies away from confrontation with Congress _ a
quality more dramatic than ever since he was stung by his failure
to win approval of his tobacco bill.
</P>
<P>
   The president who came to office as an apostle for change has a
political style that whispers, ``Stay the course.'' The president
who promised an activist approach now mostly reacts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is strategy; politicians naturally gravitate toward
popular issues. Some of it reflects reality; leaders of the
Republican Congress cooperated with Clinton last year only to see
him steal the thunder _ and the applause _ and they aren't eager to
give the president a break now.
</P>
<P>
   But some of it is also cold calculation: There's a strong belief
inside the White House this summer that the president shouldn't
risk his political capital at the moment because he may need it
later to battle new revelations, developments, or twists in the
investigations being conducted by independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popularity is like capital,'' says Abraham Zaleznik, professor
emeritus of leadership at Harvard Business School. ``Sometimes you
don't spend it, and sometimes you only spend it when you get back
even more _ greater prestige, more willingness to suspend
disbelief, the ability to get people to listen and pay attention to
the next initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Under scrutiny from an office examining his private and
financial affairs, under criticism from Republicans eager to
protect their congressional majorities in the fall midterm
elections, under siege from reporters and commentators, President
Clinton nonetheless remains remarkably popular. The latest CNN/Time
Poll shows that more than three out of five respondents approve of
the job he is doing as president. His ratings are higher now than
they were last October, before Monica S. Lewinsky became a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking inside the White House today: We may need 10 or 20
of those popularity percentage points if Lewinsky makes a deal for
immunity, or if new damaging disclosures emerge, or when Starr
makes his long-awaited report to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not crazy not to want to take risks that might lead to
big mistakes,'' says Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic political
pollster who nonetheless adds: ``Generally there's a bigger risk in
standing still than in moving forward. Even in good times there's a
political downside to not having a clear agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, moreover, no guarantee that such a strategy _
political capital conservation, you might call it _ will work.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity isn't fungible; it has a modest shelf life and can't
be put in cold storage for periods of time. Clinton should know
these properties of popularity; his own ascension to the White
House was built on a challenge to an incumbent president who tried
to conserve his popularity and live off it as times changed rapidly
_ and as perceptions of him changed irrevocably.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings in the
months after the 1991 Gulf War, and then he embarked on a concerted
strategy to preserve those ratings. For a while, it worked; so
great was Bush's popularity that many of the leading Democrats,
including Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Al Gore of Tennessee
and Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri, declined to enter the
presidential race in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cobbled together a modest domestic agenda after the war.
His big initiative in spring 1991: a highway bill so unremarkable
that it prompted catcalls of derision in the capital. Those
popularity rating points evaporated like dew at midmorning. He was
defeated decisively by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush did, Clinton faces a Congress of the opposite party, and
the Republicans who rule Capitol Hill, so compliant in the spring
of 1997, have made no gestures of hospitality to the president in
1998. ``Clinton is working against a very retrogressive Congress,''
says Sherman Lewis, a political scientist at California State
University at Hayward. ``Much of politics is practicing the art of
the possible, and Clinton is trying to do what's possible. If more
were possible, he'd be even bolder. If less were possible, he'd be
even more wimpish than he is now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters argue that his trip to China itself
represented a foreign policy risk. It is true that many Republican
critics urged the president not to go. But it is also true that
American presidents seldom are criticized while they play the
statesman role abroad, and Clinton could count on stunning visual
images everywhere, from the terra-cotta warriors to the Great Wall
to Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the prevailing political culture gives little impetus
for risk-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge hedges these days against risk-taking,'' says
Maury Klein, a historian at the University of Rhode Island who
specializes in 20th-century American politics. ``A hundred years
ago presidents went with what a small group of people around them
and his own gut told him. Today you don't do anything without a
statistical consensus. ... Today you don't approach a decision, but
you look for a certain reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's reluctance to mount bold proposals is no
character flaw. At the end of the month, the John F. Kennedy
Library and Museum will hold a remarkably celebratory retrospective
on Calvin Coolidge; the 29th president will be saluted for his
reluctance to offer the very sort of new departures that Clinton is
resisting in the waning days of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Coolidge, who didn't cultivate an image of a creative
innovator, Clinton campaigned as an activist.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton possesses many traits of the classic risk-taker.
Psychologists have found that such people are motivated by
intensity, variety, novelty, and ambiguity _ a crisp, serviceable
description of the lifestyle and political style of a man like
Clinton, who studies hard, moves from subject to subject, and isn't
a slave to clear policy positions. Risk-takers, moreover, often are
high-energy personalities, and Clinton has a higher energy level
than any president in history.
</P>
<P>
   That the president seems risk-averse may not be as much of a
contradiction as it seems. ``Risk-takers have inner control,'' says
Frank Farley, a psychologist at Temple University. ``And they may
be able to turn off the risk-taking _ particularly when they want
to live for another exciting day. Clinton may be worried about
blowing it and may have throttled back his risk-taking propensity
for another purpose: survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, his advisers agree, like most presidents at the
end of a second term, is running for a place in history. But they
aren't won by campaigns. They're won by action, or vision, or
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a writer saying that he's going to write a
bestseller,'' Kleinsays. ``It doesn't work that way. You don't get
a historical reputation with just rhetoric or by trying too hard to
be appearing to be doing something.'' That's why a policy of risk
aversion may be the highest-stake policy of all.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Calvin Coolidge attended college in Massachusetts. He
spent a career in the Massachusetts bar. He rose through the
state's political ranks to become governor. After serving as
president, he retired to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge liked Massachusetts. But Massachusetts, in the years
since his 1933 death, has happily abetted the notion that the 30th
president, at heart, never really left his birth state of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Proud of its progressive past, and its Quincy-through-Camelot
connection to the presidency, Massachusetts regards Coolidge like a
conservative virus that wafted down from the north, claimed some
victims, and then vanished from the atmosphere without ever
touching down.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the state is reclaiming its misbegotten stepson in
a surprising way: by suggesting that he was really a progressive at
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was part of all the progressive initiatives in this
state from the turn of the century until he left as governor,'' in
1921, declared former governor Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Added Sheldon Stern, historian at the John F. Kennedy Library,
``Coolidge actually had a remarkably pro-labor record in
Massachusetts, and was liked by labor,'' despite his famous
clampdown on the 1919 Boston police strike when he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is the organizer of a two-day Kennedy Library conference
on July 30 and 31, ``Calvin Coolidge: Examining the Evidence,'' an
event endorsed by the Coolidge family and hailed as a moment of
historical resuscitation. At the conference, Dukakis will deliver a
major address on Coolidge's career in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   No ``Silent Cal,'' Coolidge was the first president to use radio
as a bully pulpit, Stern says. And the two brittle epigrams that
cemented his reputation for cold-heartedness _ his insistence that
``there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody,
anywhere, anytime'' and that ``the business of America is
business'' _ are misleading quotes that don't begin to describe
Coolidge's true feelings, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The conference sets out to offer a lesson in the shifting tides
of history: the way the image of a historical figure can be torn
from the context of his times, and distorted for political purposes
by succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
   But, some conservatives ask, will Massachusetts liberals be
practicing some of the same revisionism they condemn?
</P>
<P>
   For while Coolidge's image moldered in Massachusetts' attic, it
was dusted off and hung on the wall of the White House Cabinet room
by Ronald Reagan. And libertarians have adopted Coolidge as an icon
of political rectitude, remembering his pared-down administration
as a golden era of small government.
</P>
<P>
   Why, ask some conservatives, are Massachusetts liberals so
intent on claiming Coolidge for the progressive camp? Are they
trying to rescue Silent Cal's reputation, or sink the current-day
conservative movement that calls him a hero?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the Kennedy people are doing, but I
certainly am not aware of Mr. Coolidge's progressive aspects of his
public life,'' said Richard Viguerie, the conservative fund-raiser.
``Before Ronald Reagan came along, when people asked who you most
admired among 20th-century presidents, it was easy to answer Calvin
Coolidge _ and hard to find a second and third.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Coolidge story doesn't meld with any political
fable. As related by conservative biographers and liberal academics
alike, it is a saga of idealism, success, tragic loss, and even,
some claim, clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the historian, conceives of the conference as a search
for the objective truth. Dukakis, the ex-politician, sees it as
something of an object lesson in the ups and downs of a life in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who grew up in the Massachusetts political
system, developed great skills and abilities, got talked into the
whole national thing, and was not exactly over his head, but very
uncomfortable in a whole different universe,'' Dukakis said, with
sympathy in his voice.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At 92, John Coolidge, the late president's son, still
occasionally trundles from his home near the family homestead in
Plymouth Notch, Vt., to collect his mail. Often, residents report,
he's charming and outgoing; sometimes he's not.
</P>
<P>
   The legend endures that a neighbor once confronted him about his
shifting moods: ``Some days I take after my mother,'' he explained,
adding darkly, ``Some days I take after my father.''
</P>
<P>
   In the living theater of American history, even old John
Coolidge is playing a role, slyly mocking the stereotype of his
famous father.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Calvin Coolidge was, in his youth, a
straight-laced model of Victorian propriety. Serious of mien,
perhaps because of the death of his beloved mother when he was 12,
he was more diligent than brilliant in his early schooling in
Vermont; more respected than beloved by classmates at Amherst
College; and, into early adulthood, more noted for dry wit than
blazing charm.
</P>
<P>
   But upon entering Massachusetts statewide politics, Coolidge
cast himself as a progressive Republican fully in tune with the
``bully'' politics of Theodore Roosevelt. He rose to become a state
representative in 1906, mayor of Northampton in 1910, state senator
in 1912, president of the Senate in 1914, lieutenant governor in
1916, and governor in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   ``He exerted a measure of leadership and spoke out on the issues
_ on which he was by no means conservative, even by today's
standards,'' wrote historian Robert Sobel in ``Calvin Coolidge: An
American Enigma,'' a new biography from the conservative-leaning
Regnery Press.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Coolidge's ascendency was capped by his role as drafter
of the 1917 state Republican platform, a landmark document that
embraced the progressive creed, calling for government intervention
to cure the social ills that attended a state in economic
transition.
</P>
<P>
   As lieutenant governor, he endorsed statewide comprehensive
health insurance. As governor, he increased workers' compensation,
approved women's suffrage, applied rent controls, raised salaries
of teachers and other public employees, and imposed government
regulations to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having been called upon to mediate strikes in the past,
because of his reputation as a moderate trusted by both labor and
management, Coolidge's signature moment came when he crushed the
Boston police strike in 1919, uttering his famous injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stern argues, Coolidge was privately sympathetic with the
police, believing they should have received the pay raises they
sought; after the strikers were fired, he helped many get other
jobs.

BARGAIN OPERA RECORDINGS CAN MEAN GOOD STUFF CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The classical-music recording industry is in deep trouble, and
some would say that it deserves to be.
</P>
<P>
   One dimension of the business seems to be thriving, though, and
that's the low-price end represented by the numerous historical
reissue projects of the major labels, the emergence of the budget
label Naxos as an international market force, and RCA's recent
introduction of its budget line, Arte Nova.
</P>
<P>
   Naxos and the new kid on the block, Arte Nova, are operating
very much the way the smaller labels like Vox, Remington,
Westminster, and Urania did back in the '50s, in the early days of
LP. They license recordings from the archives of European radio
stations or make new recordings of standard and unusual repertory,
usually in Central Europe, and using performers who do not command
high fees and demand prima donna or primo tenore amenities.
</P>
<P>
   I've always enjoyed budget recordings because you never know
what to expect, and celebrity recordings seldom bring surprises.
Budget operas often reflect the knockabout world of real
performance more accurately than slick studio jobs, offering
exhilarating highs, as well as slipping to hilariously
un-acceptable levels. Not that studio recordings with superstars
aren't capable of reaching comparable heights or sinking to lower
depths (like Placido Domingo's computer-sustained high C in Sony's
``Il Trovatore''). When I was a kid, cheap records were all I could
afford; my first part-time job started off at 40 cents an hour, and
it took a long time to save up for my first luxury set _ RCA's
``Aida'' with Zinka Milanov and Jussi Bjoerling, which cost $11.95.
To this day I remain fond of some operatic performances I
encountered and learned by heart on recordings that cost anywhere
from 99 cents to $1.98 a disc: the Mimi and Butterfly of Da-niza
Illitsch on Remington, the Rigoletto of Ivan Petroff, also on
Remington, the Sophie of Adele Kern and the Che-rubino of Pilar
Lorengar on Vox. At the other end of the spectrum, Remington's
``Tosca'' has long held cult status as the worst complete opera
recording ever made, so it's worth holding onto, too.
</P>
<P>
   After some uneven early efforts, Naxos has matched or
outperformed the major labels in at least three of its operatic
efforts: ``The Barber of Seville,'' ``La Sonnambula,'' and ``The
Flying Dutchman,'' which blows the Metropolitan Opera's subsequent
effort for Sony Classical right out of the water. Some other Naxos
recordings remain enjoyable for individual elements rather than for
the excellence of the entire performance.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Arte Nova entered the market with a dozen operatic
recordings, most of them featuring singers you never heard of, some
of whom sound better than singers we have heard too much of
already.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most interesting sets come from the Novosibirsk State
Opera in the former Soviet Union, a theater that boasts a
first-class orchestra and chorus, some important voices, and a high
standard of performance. Tchaikovsky's ``Eugen Onegin'' sounds
thoroughly idiomatic and persuasive under the direction of
conductor Samuel Friedmann. Bolshoi Opera soprano Yelena Zelenskaya
travelled to the Siberian city to sing Tatiana; her opulent, darkly
dramatic tones aren't really suitable to the character, but this is
a fabulous voice. The resident company holds up its end, and it is
perhaps even more impressive in Arte Nova's pairing of
Tchaikovsky's touching ``Iolanta'' (the opera that shared a double
bill with the first performance of ``The Nutcracker'') with
``Aleko,'' the astonishing graduation opera by the 19-year-old
Rachmaninoff.
</P>
<P>
   Two standard Verdi operas were recorded in Vienna by the Europa
Symphony, whatever that is, under the direction of Wolfgang Groehs,
who clearly knows his way around ``La Traviata'' and ``Rigoletto.''
Carmen Gurban is the fifth soprano from Romania to record Violetta
and a pupil of one of the better ones, Ileana Cotrubas; she has a
lovely voice, sufficient technique, and sensitivity to character
and situation. Baritone Georg Tichy may be a little past his prime,
but he's honorably held down the major Verdi roles at the Vienna
State Opera for a quarter-century, and he still makes a more
satisfying Germont than some of the younger competition (he does
omit his cabaletta; the score is otherwise heard complete, and
Gurban sings both stanzas of both her arias). Russian emigre tenor
Sergei Komov presents an agreeable Alfredo. Komov and Tichy
reappear to reasonable effect in ``Rigoletto,'' but this recording
would have profited from some retakes that weren't in the budget.
The American soprano Doreen DeFeis, who once offered a
well-received song recital here in the Pro Musicis series, sings
intelligently, but she doesn't have either the weight of voice or
the virtuoso coloratura Gilda requires.
</P>
<P>
   Four recordings come from the Putbus Festival on the island of
Ruegen, off the northern coast of Germany; the festival was founded
in 1993 by the conductor Wilhelm Keitel, an alumnus of the
Tanglewood Music Center. The orchestra consists of former players
from the Minsk opera and ballet; in its new formation it has won
the favor and patronage of Sir Yehudi Menuhin. Only one of the
Putbus recordings is a loser, Rossini's ``William Tell,'' and even
it is well-conducted and played, with some nicely sung supporting
roles. But the tenor cast in the high-flying role of Arnoldo is in
way over his head, and the soprano offers more wobble than tone.
Recordings of Paisiello's ``The Barber of Seville'' and the version
of the same story by Rossini that banished it to oblivion feature
the same singers (onstage they presumably featured the same sets
and costumes). Mozart admired Paisiello's opera, whose influence
can be heard in his sequel, ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' but after
Rossini, Paisiello's seems a predictable, professional, and
somewhat boring opera. The Putbus singers do better in the
Paisiello, where they do not have to withstand comparison to the
greatest bel canto singers of our century. But at least they seem
to be enjoying themselves, which is a critical element missing from
too many recordings of Rossini's opera. The Rosina, Marina Ivanova,
has sung at Glyndbourne; many of the others have been well-trained
and coached by that grand veteran of countless opera buffa
performances, Sesto Bruscantini. Only one singer is inadequate, the
bass Ezio Maria Tisi, who is faced with notes he doesn't have in
Rossini's aria for Don Basilio.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the Putbus recordings is Donizetti's ``Don
Pasquale,'' which features a full-blooded portrayal of Norina by
soprano Paola Antonucci. Tenor Patrizio Saudelli, who appears in
all four recordings, sings Ernesto with style and charm in an
unusual timbre that recalls Alessio de Paolis on the aria
recordings he made on 78s in Italy before he moved to America to
become the Met's most beloved comprimario tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Arte Nova's recording of Mozart's ``The Abduction from the
Seraglio'' hails from the Mozartean city of Linz, where the opera
house boasts a soprano who can sail through the impossible role of
Konstanze, Ingrid Habermann. The others are competent; the bass
Franz Kalchmair sings Osmin not only in Linz but all over Europe
because he can negotiate a role even less cast-able than Konstanze.
The Bruckner Orchestra plays deftly for Martin Sieghart.
</P>
<P>
   An Arte Nova surprise is a recording of the world premiere of
the challenging ``Gesualdo,'' by Franz Hummel, the work
commissioned for the 1996 opening of the new opera house in
Kaiserslautern, Germany. Elisabeth Gutjahr's libretto is drawn from
the unsavory life of the composer Carlo Gesualdo, whose music
fascinated Stravinsky; in the 16th century Gesualdo quite literally
got away with murder. The opera is a music-theater collaboration,
so it is hard to judge the work's effectiveness on the basis of a
recording alone. The formal intricacies and fever-pitch intensity
of ``Gesualdo'' do demonstrate that the tradition of German
expressionistic opera that began with Strauss's ``Salome'' and
``Elektra'' and continued through Berg's ``Wozzeck'' did not end
with Zimmermann's ``Die Soldaten.'' The audience responds with
hearty applause at the end.
</P>
<P>
   At another extreme is a recording of Johann Strauss's ``Die
Fledermaus'' made with the forces of the famous outdoor operetta
festival, which takes place on a floating stage in Moerbisch Lake
in Austria. The male singers are not outstanding, but nostalgia
will be evoked by the casting of two sons of the noted Viennese
bass Otto Edelmann (Peter sings Eisenstein and Paul Armin, Dr.
Falke) and by the presence of tenor Waldemar Kmentt as the jailer
Frank; Kmentt has been singing various roles in ``Die Fledermaus''
since 1950, so he knows his business. The women are terrific. Ute
Gfrerer offers a spunky, agile Adele, and Silvana Dussman sounds
funny, sexy, and infinitely glamorous as Rosalinde; she can sing
the dickens out of the unsingable Csardas. Casting a countertenor
as Prince Orlofsky is a fashionable idea today, and usually a
terrible one, but Artur Stefanowicz manages the aria better than
most mezzo-sopranos. The dialogue has been omitted for the
international market, so the work comes in at about 80 minutes,
spread over two CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Verdi Requiem is operatic but not an opera, and Arte Nova's
recording differs from most of its other offerings by presenting
name performers in the solo roles. Sharon Sweet, Francisco Araiza,
and Simon Estes have all sung at the Met, and Jard van Nes has made
a lot of recordings. They appear in the context of a committed but
un-idiomatic performance by the Saarbruecken Radio Symphony
Orchestra and the Munich Bach Choir under the direction of
Hanns-Martin Schneidt. One does wonder why anyone would want to
record these particular singers in the Verdi Requiem, especially
now. The answer is, no one did: This recording was made 10 years
ago. Van Nes, so often so bland, summons some passion on this
occasion, but the vocal preening of Estes is preposterous, and
Araiza is a disaster waiting to happen. The surprise is Sweet, who
isn't quite on top of her part, but deploys a resplendent voice
that would never again sound this beautiful and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The bill for all 12 of these recordings would add up to less
than the price of one $200 orchestra ticket at the Met. That ticket
would not come with an ironclad guarantee you would hear a better
performance than some of these Arte Nova bargains.

<P>
   GENEVA _ The theme of the world AIDS conference two years ago in
Vancouver was supposedly ``One World, One Hope.'' But the real
motif _ the amazing effectiveness of the then-new and costly
triple-drug ``cocktails'' to treat AIDS _ rendered the slogan
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise of this year's AIDS conference here was how much it
embodied its official theme, ``Bridging the Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   In every plenary session, press conference, and interview, and
often in the most abstruse virology and immunology presentations,
experts fretted and plotted about narrowing the treatment gap that
separates prosperous, largely northern societies _ where
triple-drug treatment has reversed AIDS mortality and emptied
hospital beds _ from the achingly poor, southern hemisphere
countries that are home to 90 percent of those who carry the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
   Another empty promise? Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question truly universal access to state-of-the-art
HIV treatment is a pipe dream. The global price tag would be $36.5
billion, at a current yearly cost of more than $10,000 per patient,
a Canadian group estimates. That's $6 for every man, woman, and
child on the planet, but an impossible $41 for every citizen of
sub-Saharan Africa, the region hardest hit by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the AIDS-ravaged countries of Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, and
Tanzania, the cost of universal access would exceed half of each
nation's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   But developing nations differ enormously in their ability to
mount HIV treatment programs of one sort or another. Westerners
need to recognize this diversity, experts said, if they are to
shake off the paralyzing notion that treating AIDS is beyond all
but industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   A few developing nations have made considerable inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil stands out. With nearly 600,000 HIV-infected citizens,
that country has pledged to provide triple-drug antiviral treatment
to everyone who needs it. The $250 million Brazil is now spending
represents only a fraction of the need, but it amounts to nearly 5
percent of the nation's health budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is spending more on HIV care than the rest of the
developing world is spending on prevention and care together,''
notes Daniel Tarantola of the Harvard AIDS Institute, which is
launching a $3 million project to enhance care in five developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Such foot-in-the-door efforts generate political pressure, both
within the nations attempting them and on international funding
sources such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and wealthier
nations. Drug companies in particular are feeling pressed to slash
HIV drug prices for the developing world and to forego patent
protections there _ a prominent topic in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Triple-drug HIV therapy, however, is not the only treatment that
could extend lives and diminish misery in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   The opening wedge for all such interventions is the newly proven
use of short-course AZT, the original anti-HIV drug, to prevent
transmission of the virus from mother to infant. By the end of this
year, the UN agency UNAIDS plans to be running pilot programs in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America to identify 30,000 pregnant,
HIV-infected women and provide them with AZT in late pregnancy,
followed by infant formula to prevent viral transmission through
breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies in Thailand show that short-course AZT can reduce
mother-to-infant infections by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond AZT, a number of studies show that simplified drug
regimens to prevent tuberculosis among HIV-infected people could
have enormous impact in the developing world. Similarly, a
relatively cheap drug called Bactrim could prevent many thousands
of HIV-associated pneumonia cases in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Even less fancy care, such as over-the-counter Imodiumfor
AIDS-related diarrhea, could have important impact. One study from
Burkina Faso in West Africa, one of the world's poorest countries,
showed that lives can be extended (and made less miserable) by a
program costing just $20 a month per person.
</P>
<P>
   But for cost-effectiveness, nothing beats the vitamin
``treatment'' that Wafaie Fawzi of the Harvard School of Public
Health and his colleagues successfully tested among HIV-positive
pregnant women and children in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   For less than five cents a day, giving pregnant HIV-infected
women a multivitamin tablet reduced fetal deaths, low birthweight,
and premature births by 40 percent, while boosting the women's
immune systems for months after delivery. Among HIV-infected
children, daily vitamin A supplements cut mortality by nearly half,
and eliminated diarrhea-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Such successes ``challenge the stereotype that AIDS treatments
are only for wealthy nations,'' Tarantola said in an interview.
``We're shifting the emphasis from drugs for the rich to drugs for
the poor.''

NAACP EAGER TO POINT ITS FIGHT OUTWARD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Against the backdrop of this city of black pride and
progress, Julian Bond, in his first major address since taking over
as board chairman of the NAACP, said Sunday that the organization
would work to build a world where ``private prejudice doesn't
become public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond's speech punctuated the opening of the 89th annual
convention of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, and brought him home to a city where he established
his reputation as a respected civil rights leader and savvy
politician.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the confusion and skepticism about the
organization's role in the aftermath of financial and leadership
setbacks _ turmoil that hindered the NAACP's effectiveness and
caused some to question its relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are confused about what our next step should be,''
Bond said to the delegates. ``The task ahead is enormous _ equal to
if not greater than the job already done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise that you are going to read about the NAACP because
we are fighting for civil rights and not because we are fighting
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 3,500 delegates present frequently
interrupted Bond's speech with applause and standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have turned the corner,'' said delegate Leonard C. Alkins,
president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. ``We are not looking
backwards, we are looking forward, because we know where we come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, much skepticism remains about the fate of the nation's
oldest and largest civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the jury is still out on whether the NAACP can and
will make an impact on resolving some of the urgent problems and
being a participant in the policy process in the way that it should
be in Washington,'' said Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the US
Commission on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Walters, director of the African-American Leadership Program
at the University of Maryland, said that, with the NAACP proposing
to get involved in such areas as literacy and fighting AIDS in
black communities nationwide, he wondered, ``What is the difference
between the NAACP and the Urban League, a social service provider?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of other agencies out there, public and
private, who can deliver services. We need a fighting
organization,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the NAACP's biggest fight has been just to stay
afloat and hold on to its reputation. Three years ago, it was mired
in a debt of $4.8 million. Its leadership was in turmoil when in
1994 its director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., was forced out after he
admitted using $332,400 in NAACP funds to settle a sexual
harassment lawsuit filed against him by a former staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, William Gibson was voted out as chairman by one
vote in a bruising campaign for board leadership against Myrlie
Evers-Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson and Chavis ran the organization into the ground,'' said
Roger Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va. and chairman of the NAACP's magazine, The New Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are signs of life in the nation's oldest and
largest civil rights group. Its leaders say it has half a million
paid members and a $2.1 million surplus. It has a new president and
chief exective officer, Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman from
Maryland. In February, it also got a new board chairman in Bond, a
former state senator in Georgia and lieutenant of slain civil
rights leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very dynamic duo,'' said Lenneal J. Henderson,
professor of government and public administration at the University
of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some delegates say they are not ready to exult just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our troubles are completely behind us,'' said
Russell Williams, president of the Greater Hartford branch of the
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have as many branches and as many board members
as we have, you are always going to have to deal with internal
issues and personalities,'' Williams said. The NAACP has 2,200
branches and a 64-member board.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that delegates are eyeing the chemistry between
Mfume and Bond, which he calls ``an interesting mix,'' as well as
the tone they will set for the organization. There have been rumors
of tension, which both men and their associates have either denied
or downplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have specific gifts that have yet to be completely
and succinctly identified,'' Williams said. ``I think there is a
period of evolution taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates say that as the leadership is a work in progress,
so too is the group's focus. Although the NAACP will maintain its
advocacy roots in civil rights, the delegates say it will also
engage in coalition politics with other groups while charting a
course that mixes social justice and social service.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bond, in his address, said, ``At all times we must be
careful not to confuse social service with social justice. Social
justice is what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil rights issue will always be the common link,'' said
Alkins, the Boston chapter president.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Norvel Goff Sr., president of the Rochester, N.Y.,
branch of the NAACP, put it this way: ``We are now going to the
next level. We are prepared to fight the fight we have fought
traditionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are poised to not only take on other issues, but also
stand in the forefront and lead, not react, but lead on major
issues that are confronting not only black America, but America,''
Goff said. ``We're not going to let the tail wag the dog.''

ASIAN CRISIS MAY BEGIN TO CLOUD US PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The US economy's smooth ride on a dangerous wind
from the East is about to get rougher. Maybe a lot rougher, though
there still is no direct evidence that a decade that rivals the
1960s in prosperity will end with a cessation of economic growth or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The last several days have highlighted a different picture from
the uniformly positive news of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   _Employment and industrial production growth are flattening, and
unemployment may be trending higher from the lowest level in a
generation as firms dependent on exports feel the impact of Asia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the announcement by Internet powerhouse Yahoo
Inc. of second-quarter profits that exceeded Wall Street's
expectations served as a reminder that a new economy continues to
churn forward.
</P>
<P>
   _Federal Reserve estimates showed a contraction in the growth of
consumer borrowing during May, the slowest pace since last
November. And that news can be a hint of what is to come in
consumer spending, which remains the source of two-thirds of the
economy's juice.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement by Folgers of a second cut in its list
price of coffee this year, in the face of the biggest Brazilian
coffee crop in more than a decade, is a reminder of how good
inflation news remains. That is in turn a key cause of low interest
rates that are crucial to continued overall growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Americans will begin to see how much the
economy's pace is slowing, particularly when the Commerce
Department makes a preliminary estimate of total output of goods
and service for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement that the extraordinary pace of the
first quarter, a 5.4 percent annual rate, cannot be sustained. The
real question is how much the growth rate dropped. To most
Americans that's just a number. More important is a narrative of
the underlying developments, of which there are primarily two.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a change in how the Asian crisis is affecting this
country. At first, it was more beneficial than harmful. With the
dollar trending higher against the major Asian currencies, above
all the yen, there was a rise in imports from the countries
involved that was noticeable in prices paid by Americans before the
loss of exports was felt in lower production and employment in
affected businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, movement of money to these shores, above all to the
government bond market, in search of security had the effect _
along with the stability at long last in US budget policy _ of
keeping long-term interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   That is now changing. The lost export business and diminished
future prospects are being felt now, and the impact is likely to
continue for at least the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The second development is somewhat technical, but probably more
important to the upcoming estimate of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The huge growth figure in the first quarter turns out to contain
the largest addition to business inventories in the history of
statistics about them. The change, worth slightly more than $100
billion at an annual rate, accounted for fully 1.7 percentage
points of the total rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't gonna happen again, and it definitely did not happen in
the second quarter. Because what counts in measuring the economy is
the change in inventories from quarter to quarter, as opposed to
their absolute level, they were at best a zero last quarter and
more likely a negative.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a less vibrant industrial sector generally, and weak
Asian exports in particular, and it is difficult to see how the
growth rate could have been much above 2 percent, if that.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, that is no surprise. The relentlesssly conservative
Clinton administration, in drawing up its budget documents early
this year, projected growth at 2 to 2.5 percent this year, as well
as in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As the months pass, however, that assumption will be tested by
four major questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Will Asia stabilize? The engine of recovery will have to be
Japan. In the wake of parliamentary elections, the world will find
out whether Japanese recovery policies are credible or
inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   _When will the General Motors strike end? So far, it may cost
the economy a half-point in growth for the year, but if the worst
GM strike in 28 years goes past Labor Day, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   _Will US policymakers goof? One danger would be a premature
tightening of monetary policy by Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve.
The other would be a loss of budgetary discipline by the Republican
Congress. The former is unlikely, the latter a slight danger.
</P>
<P>
   _Will the Asian bug spread? The potential danger areas are Latin
America and the Middle East, but it is only potential at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view remains that the United States will slow
down a good bit for the next half-year or so, but then gradually
speed up. But where near-euphoria once reigned, some very health
concern and skepticism now hold sway.

 BOSTON: ... other jobs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The police strike greased his entry into national politics.
Party bosses, finding his law-and-order reputation an appealing
tonic for the rollicking '20s, nominated him for vice president
under Warren Harding. And when Harding, straining under the weight
of scandal, died during a speaking tour in 1923, Coolidge became an
accidental president.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge moved swiftly to consolidate power. And his early
initiatives _ twice-weekly press conferences, regular radio
addresses, and a flurry of legislative proposals _ pointed toward
an activist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But once elected on his own, on a ``keep cool'' platform of
peace and prosperity, Coolidge seemed more content to allow the
booming economy to raise all boats. Very popular in his time, he
declined to run again in 1928, turning over the keys to the White
House to Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, noting the sharp difference between Coolidge's
progressive stands as governor and his more muted actions as
president, suggests that Coolidge was, at heart, a federalist,
believing in activism at the state level only, with a limited
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis found the shift even more profound. He endorses
Northeastern University professor Robert E. Gilbert's theory that
the death in 1924 of Coolidge's 16-year-old son, Calvin Jr.,  &UR;  &LR; 
plunged him into a clinical depression, and wreathed his presidency
with morbidity. Calvin Jr. died of blood poisoning from a blister
he got after playing tennis on the White House court.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Mortal Presidency,'' Gilbert depicts the
president in a series of plaintive images: capturing a small brown
rabbit on the White House lawn and taking it to his dying son's
room; staring numbly at young Calvin Jr.'s hospital window from the
street below; and, later, talking of looking forward to being
reunited with his son in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend who visited him in the Oval Office reported that
Coolidge wept openly, the tears running down his face, while he
kept repeating, `I just can't believe it has happened. I just can't
believe it has happened,''' Gilbert wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's ``sustained depression,'' Dukakis said, ``certainly
would explain a lot of his presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Viguerie, of course, has a different explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin Coolidge didn't do a whole lot,'' he acknowledged.
``But for us (conservatives), that's the whole objective. And
that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of Coolidge's departure from office, the
chicken-in-every-pot prosperity promised by his administration
vanished into the maw of the Great Depression. A new president,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, had just been elected, and his Democratic
liberalism would define the era.
</P>
<P>
   History turned against Coolidge. Roosevelt assumed the role of
savior, and New Deal historians demonized the Republican presidents
of the 1920s as the bringers of the plague that Roosevelt cured.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's alleged complacency, his willingness to allow the
wheels of business to churn unimpeded, took on the look of
negligence. Journalist H.L. Mencken declared, ``He will be ranked
among the vacuums.''
</P>
<P>
   And, to a great extent, he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin Coolidge has been characterized as a complacent, lazy
and humorless man and an extreme reactionary _ hostile to
government and progressive legislation, oblivious to the needs of
working Americans and devoted only to the material wealth of the
nation and the interests of business,'' declares the opening
statement of the Kennedy Library conference literature.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Coolidge is even less well remembered than
elsewhere. To some, the state's treatment of Coolidge borders on
insulting. Boston Brahmins bearing the Coolidge surname are quick
to declare themselves no relation to the president _ though they
probably share a common ancestor, Stern says. Historians visiting
Amherst College are sometimes surprised to find that Coolidge is
not more honored at his alma mater, though a dorm bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   And among police unions, the word Coolidge still draws clenched
fists. &UR;  &LR; ``He was the person who broke the Boston police strike and
fired a number of police officers,'' declared Frank McGee,
long-time counsel of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association.
``He was a vicious anti-union person who heaped a lot of misery on
a lot of police families.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History, however, is always subject to change, and Coolidge
spent only a few decades in disrepute before being reassessed.
</P>
<P>
   When Ronald Reagan strolled into the Cabinet room of the White
House in 1981, he saw portraits of Jefferson, Lincoln, and Harry
Truman. The curator offered to make a change. And Reagan, eager for
a historical metaphor for his ambitious budget-cutting plans,
replaced Truman with Coolidge, an emblem of parsimonious good
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was born a conservative icon.
</P>
<P>
   For liberals, however, the road to the Kennedy Library
conference has been more twisted.
</P>
<P>
   It began in a theater in Cambridge in 1975, when Dorchester
actor Jim Cooke played the title role in a forgettable,
post-Watergate farce called ``The Calvin Coolidge Follies.'' In the
play, Coolidge was meant to be a perplexing figure, but Cooke found
himself being drawn deeper and deeper into the character.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was cutting and pasting his way through Coolidge's
writings, developing a one-man show. Cooke has taken the show to
theaters throughout New England, playing Coolidge as a man of dry
humor and straight-talking Yankee wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what he thought should be done,'' said Cooke. ``He did
what he thought was right. He didn't care if he ruined his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who has been at the Kennedy Library since its inception
and proudly boasts of ``never having voted for a Republican,'' saw
Cooke's show and enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   He was stunned, however, to learn that the entire script was
culled from Coolidge's words. Thus, he decided to take his own
fresh look at this conservative icon, and discovered that the
Reaganites were praying to a false God.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Reagan admired Coolidge for the wrong reasons,''
Stern said. ``Those reasons were not accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Stern had a conversation with Dukakis, and found that the
former governor had a longstanding curiosity about his famous _ and
infamous _ predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Dukakis) feels Coolidge has been misunderstood and
that he himself has been misunderstood, so he identifies with
Coolidge,'' said Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis maintains that his primary interest is in better
understanding the lively Massachusetts politics of the first two
decades of the century, but he allows that he and Coolidge were
``probably the only two governors to ride the trolley car.''
</P>
<P>
   He offers a story of an official greeting party waiting for the
governor's entourage, only to discover that Coolidge, having taken
the trolley, was already inside staring at the paintings on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis believes a tragic ending is often preordained in
politics, as anyone who seeks national office must surrender to the
crude judgment of history as the price of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you decide to play in that larger pond you're going to be
judged by what you do there,'' he said. ``Sadly.''

HEY, YOU, IT'S A GOOOAAALLLL! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a soccer announcer shouts GOOOAAALLL!, will anyone in this
country hear it?
</P>
<P>
   A generation after soccer started gaining popularity in the
United States (more youngsters now play soccer than any other team
sport but basketball), the American public is turning its back in
astonishing numbers on the planet's most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   In June, when the monthlong World Cup competition began, the
government of Tunisia gave everybody in the nation the day off so
they could watch their team compete against Colombia. On Tuesday,
when Holland and Brazil were playing what had been in the most
dramatic match of the competition _ which ended Sunday when Brazil
France for the title _ most Americans seemed to register a
collective yawn.
</P>
<P>
   TV ratings in the United States for the World Cup are down 53
percent on ESPN from the cup of four years ago. Ratings on ABC went
from 5.3 in 1994, when the United States hosted the World Cup, to
2.3 for this year's version of the quadrennial event, which is
being played in France. That will come as a surprise to most
Americans. According to a Harris poll, only 25 percent of the
people surveyed could identify France as the host country for the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more shocking: Only half _ 52 percent _ knew that the
World Cup was a soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there remains an enormous gap between the
global importance of the World Cup and the importance of the event
to the non-ethnic American population,'' says Matt Scheckner,
director of sports and entertainment practice for Louis Harris &AMP;
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are dismal,'' says Scheckner about the poll.
``Should they set off alarm bells? You bet. Is there anything
soccer can do in the near term to reverse this? Probably not. It is
just not part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that nearly 14 million Americans between the ages of 6
and 18 play organized soccer _ and ``soccer moms'' are sought after
by both politicians and marketers _ yet the game languishes in
roughly the same purgatorial television tier as beach volleyball
and arena football?
</P>
<P>
   ``America's kids love to play soccer, but America loves pro
football, pro basketball and pro baseball,'' says Scheckner, adding
that despite the millions of Americans who play soccer, the game's
nuances are not understood well enough for people to appreciate all
the subtleties in a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Fredrick, executive director of national broadcast for J.
Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York, said his children
played soccer and he once thought the sport would eventually rival
the big three. ``Kids love to play it, but then they leave it and
watch football,'' he says. ``One of the problems for soccer is that
to be really big as a sport, sports fans have to talk about it
around the water cooler. If you talk about soccer, it is kind of
arcane, and you keep it to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The US team's pathetic performance _ it was ousted in the first
round _ did little to spark either patriotic fervor or a deep
interest in the game. And in a country where instant gratification,
fast-food restaurants, and MTV quick-cuts abound, the pace of
soccer is as foreign as the game itself. Consider that in the two
semifinal games last week, both hard-fought dramas, the teams
averaged a shot on goal every 7 minutes. To many Americans, that,
apparently, is as exciting as watching C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic diversity of American youth and soccer's low
profile make rare the child whose dream is to score the winning
goal in the World Cup finals. Rather, most want to hit the home run
that wins the World Series, or to be the next Michael Jordan. In
contrast, the fantasy of youngsters around the world is to be the
next Pele, to score the goal that brings glory to their country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans miss out on a passion that brings the
rest of the world to a standstill. The World Cup, after all, is the
culmination of two years of preliminary matches that winnow the
field of 144 countries down to the qualifying 32. It is sports'
quintessential definition of delayed gratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that right now, everywhere else on the planet,
things have stopped. Traffic lights are blinking and there are no
cars on the road, signs in shop windows say they are closed for the
game,'' says Dick Johnson, curator of the New England Sports
Museum. But, he says, unlike other countries, the United States is
not a single-sport country.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some countries, the ever-dominant United States does
not feel the need to win battles on the soccer field as a way to
retaliate for losses on the battlefield. Not so elsewhere. Earlier
in the competition, when Iran beat the US team, effectively
eliminating us from advancing from the first round of 32 countries,
Iranians were jubilant. Those Americans who were paying attention
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is an automatic nationalism that partly fuels the
popularity of the game everywhere in the world except here. But
more than nationalism makes the World Cup so popular. It is the
world's common denominator. Unlike the Olympics, which has its
share of esoteric sports, the World Cup is just soccer. And soccer
_ or football as the rest of the world calls it _ is what the world
plays.
</P>
<P>
   It creates in spectators feelings toward the athletes that range
from affinity to envy, from rage to joy. Soccer analyst Seamus
Malin notes that not everyone can relate to an athlete skiing
through the snow and then firing a rifle at a target, but everyone
in the Stade de France, and the billions around the world watching
on television, understand soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are hot spots of interest in the United States.
The Boston area's Brazilian community is already out in force, and
the Crimson Sports Grille in Harvard Square was standing room only
Wednesday with foreign students watching France defeat Croatia, and
more people standing on the sidewalk of JFK Street watching the big
screen television through the bar's plate glass front window.
</P>
<P>
   But for every person who can identify Ronaldo and Rivaldo (the
former, one of the world's most recognized sports figures and the
star attacker of the Brazilian team, the latter is his midfield
teammate), there are countless others who could care less.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discouraging Harris poll (which, for the record, a
US Soccer Federation spokesman says must be ``bogus'') and the drop
in ratings, television executives say they are thrilled by the
World Cup, which is being televised in its entirity, live and _
most un-American _ without commercial interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted,'' says ABC's Sports Jon Litner, senior vice
president for programming. ``We think it has been a terrific
tournament, competetive, and great for marketing. We think it
(soccer and the World Cup) is healthy and has a bright, long-term
future, and we will continue to work towards that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whatever lack of passion the US continues to display,
the rest of the world will probably make up for it, sometimes for
the better _ like the spontaneous parties and parades that often
follow victories _ and sometimes for the worse. Defeat has, in the
past, led to desperate acts. For example, when Uruguay stunned
Brazil in the 1950 contest, dozens of despondent Brazilians
commited suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Victory or defeat can also bring out ugly displays of violence.
British soccer hooligans are known and dreaded the world over. And
their mayhem has spawned other acts of violence _ like the severe
beating last month of a French policeman by German fans, believed
to be neo-Nazis, who went wild after a game.
</P>
<P>
   And one cannot forget the most astonishing example of the
extreme behavior, which occured in 1994. In a game against the
United States, Colombian player Andres Escobar accidently scored a
goal into his own net, a pivotal error because Colombia was upset,
2-1. Colombia was eliminated from the competition, and shortly
after Escobar returned to Medellin, he was shot 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   As his murderers fired away, they reportedly shouted, ``Goal!
Goal! Goal!.''

A CHARACTER TEST CLINTON PASSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, a man should
be judged not by the color of his skin, but by the content of his
character.
</P>
<P>
   Apply King's credo to President Clinton, say his critics, and
the president fails. They point to Clinton's relationship (whatever
it may have been) with Gennifer Flowers to his much-publicized
connection to Monica Lewinsky, from his involvement with Whitewater
to charges of illegal fund-raising. Indeed, they say, Clinton may
have the lowest character of any US president in history.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are other ways in which a president's character
can be judged. One of them is how he handles difficult public
issues _ such as race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could have easily avoided any direct involvement with
the controversial _ and, politically speaking, no-win _ issue of
race relations in these United States.
</P>
<P>
   Race and racism have long been employed in negative ways in
American politics. Only a few elected officials have ever run on a
platform that promises to establish a real dialogue with the
purpose of improving race relations. No chief executive since
President Lincoln, including presidents in their last term, has
raised the issue of race to the level Clinton has in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   With foreign policy successes such as his recent trip to China,
and with a domestic economy still booming, Clinton had no need to
get involved in an issue that could lose him more support than he
could gain during these last two years of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year since he established his President's Initiative
on Race, along with his national advisory panel, Clinton has
demonstrated beyond question that he is giving the issue real
significance, not just dismissing it with a gesture of political
tokenism.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither Clinton nor the panel can boast any real
achievements or breakthroughs, the fact that he has kept the issue
alive and well enough to be aired on PBS tonight in Boston and
other cities is noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial last week in a Florida newspaper said, for example,
``President Clinton deserves credit for at least trying to focus
attention on the nation's racial problems. Not only did he appoint
a committed group of individuals as panel members, but he also lent
his considerable communication skills to promote the race
initiative commission and its work.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Clinton and the panel were criticized; some said
they were making too much of the race issue, while others said they
were not doing enough. Even members of the panel, as well as
Clinton himself, acknowledge that a lot more has to be done before
America can completely unite.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton nicely understated, ``unique and still unresolved
issues'' exist between black and white Americans, even as our
society becomes more complex, more multiracial, multi-ethnic, and
multi-religious. And, as Clinton and the panel members know, there
is hardly a consensus on such an emotional issue as affirmative
action, on which opinion remains largely divided along racial and
political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the audience during a town meeting in Ohio, ``Do
you favor the United States Army abolishing the affirmative action
program that produced Colin Powell? Yes or no? Yes or no?'' There
was no simple ``yes'' or ``no'' answer from the audience, according
to reports from the session.
</P>
<P>
   And while he is on record as supporting affirmative action,
Clinton still faced criticism from some black members of the panel
for being ``reluctant'' to deal with the issue. In addition, his
panel selection was criticized, legitimately, for not initially
including a Native American.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the three public discussions that have evolved from the
race initiative have produced more questions than answers about how
to resolve America's race problem. A measure of the problem's
complexity is reflected in how difficult it has been getting people
to open up and talk honestly about race.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's race initiative commission will officially
end on Sept. 30, and a series of recommendations from the
commission is expected by the end of this year, the issue of race
will not be resolved any time in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the very least, this initiative suggests a need for more
public discussion _ which in turn could lead to more effective
policies for resolving at least some of the issues related to race.
</P>
<P>
   As the O.J. Simpson trial documented, and as the recent dragging
death of a black man in Texas, allegedly by three white men,
brutally portrayed, there is still a chasm between the races.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's race initiative, as it comes to a close, was at least
an effort in the right direction _ an attempt to deal with the
problem of race rather than avoid its reality.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton may remembered for his jousting with
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr over Whitewater and Lewinsky,
let us not forget his willingness to tackle the tough issue of
race, with an eye toward healing the nation's painful divide. That
part of his character should not be ignored.

A SURE CURE FOR `REGISTRY RAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Previously moved Tuesdays.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,
but at the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, never. There,
honest men and women are made to feel like serfs, joylessly growing
old in lines that barely move, clutching their identification
papers and their wallets as they wait and wait for their numbers to
come up, never knowing what trivial omission is going to send them
to the back of the line, or to a different line, or to a different
building altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some months ago I urged a gubernatorial candidate to campaign at
the Registry and its branches. Nowhere else, I told him, are you as
certain of finding so many voters so disgusted with the way
government treats them. Nowhere else is the fundamental
incompetence of state bureaucrats so nakedly on display. If you
want to meet citizens at the moment they are most receptive to a
call for government reform, meet them when they are wasting half
their afternoon trying to get their driver's license taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   That candidate hasn't taken my advice. He now lags in the polls.
Others may profit from his example.
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of Rube H. Goldberg is so complicated about
renewing driver's licenses and automobile registrations? American
Express and Visa renew hundreds of thousands of credit cards every
day, cards that are worth real money, and nobody has to stand in
line anywhere. This newspaper manages each morning to deposit a
brand-new edition at your front door, and will continue to do so
for as long as you wish, without ever requiring you to spend your
lunch break dancing attendance on a surly clerk. Travel agents,
insurance companies, overnight shippers _ all of them are able to
dispatch valuable documents by the millions, keep track of the
records you want kept track of, and generally make themselves
accessible to anyone with a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to cars and driving, we have allowed ourselves
to be conned into the belief that a government role is
indispensable. And that that government role, alas, can only be
performed ineptly, inconveniently, and in ill humor. Why?
</P>
<P>
   For no good reason. It isn't (itals)necessary(unitals) that
vehicles be registered. True, cars can be dangerous, but so can gas
grills, Rottweilers, and bottles of cheap whiskey. Registration may
sometimes foil thieves, but (a) most of the time it doesn't, and
(b) on that argument, the state ought to register gold chains,
laptop computers, and high-end stereos.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers likewise. Why, in a free country, should anyone require
a license from the authorities to operate a car? And be forced
every few years to fork over a wad of money to renew it? Why isn't
it enough to have successfully completed a driver's ed course (and
to be liable, of course, for any damage caused by recklessness)? No
one needs government approval to ride a horse or ski down a
mountain or whip around on Rollerblades. What makes driving
different?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing does. The licensing of drivers by the state is not about
safety or the public welfare. It is about revenue. State officials
don't care about the color of your hair or your ability to read a
vision chart. They care about that wad of money. Care so much that
in some places they will humiliate you and treat you as a criminal
in order to get it.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, reports The Washington Post this week, thousands
of drivers caught with an expired license have been ``taken away in
handcuffs and jailed until they pay a $75 fine.'' In just the first
six months of 1998, District of Columbia police have hauled 4,300
drivers off to jail, an average of one per hour, 24 hours a day.
Would that police in the nation's capital threw as many murderers
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts a few years ago, former Governor William Weld
proposed to end his state's addiction to Registry fees _ more than
a quarter-billion dollars annually _ by making driver's licenses
and automobile registrations good for life. No one would ever have
needed to visit the Registry again, because no one would ever have
needed to get his driving papers renewed. Predictably, the
Democratic Legislature balked at the idea; predictably, Weld
shrugged and dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Patricia McGovern, the least knee-jerk of the three
liberal Democrats running for governor of Massachusetts, with a
call for abolishing the Registry outright (good), and devolving its
functions to the cities and towns (bad). ``There's not a private
sector business in the world that would treat its customers this
badly,'' she said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But her terminology is all wrong. Registries of motor vehicles _
in Massachusetts, Washington, or anywhere else _ are not
businesses. They provide no useful service. Drivers are not their
``customers.'' No one stands in those infuriating lines and pays
those larcenous fees because they choose to. They stand and pay
because they are forced to _ because they may be handcuffed and
jailed if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you see a Registry office, there you see a monument to
taxation without justification. McGovern's suggestion is one small
step in the right direction. But the only permanent cure for
``Registry rage'' is to explode completely the myth that the
government _ any government _ should be licensing drivers or
registering automobiles in the first place. The state has no more
business keeping tabs on the car in your driveway than it does on
the books in your bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but where's the candidate who'll say so?

COLLECTOR'S CHARITY IS A STOCKING FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ For Brian Cook, the power of one extends to
a used pair of socks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook collects them by the hundreds of thousands, then helps
distribute them to the needy throughout San Diego County. As Cook
explains it, people who donate clothing to charity usually forget
that poor people need socks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sock problem isn't unique to us; it's worldwide,'' he
said. ``But not every problem means getting out the checkbook.
Sometimes you can just open your sock drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, that's what he did.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Cook, 50, gave up his gig as a local newspaper
columnist and radio commentator to join the Brother Benno
Foundation, a Christian ministry that feeds and clothes the poor.
The foundation pays him $300 a month plus room and board.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes into Cook's second day on the job, a man
mentioned that he needed some socks. There were none.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Cook went home, pulled out his sock drawer, and
dumped it on his bed. There were 26 pairs in all, many of which he
hadn't worn in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Something's not right with this picture,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he took half the pairs to Brother Benno's. The socks, he
said, were a huge attraction: ``They just flew out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he met a nun on retreat at the monastery
where he was staying and told her about the socks. At the end of
her stay, she handed him a plastic bag. Inside was a pair of socks,
still damp from her hand washing. He decided to save them for just
the right wearer.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, a woman whose boyfriend was in jail and whose
clothes had been stolen walked into Brother Benno's. Cook couldn't
resist. He asked how many pairs of socks she had. She pointed to
her feet. He gave her the nun's socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly she was smiling,'' Cook said. ``And it hit me, the
power of one pair of socks.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cook's job was to give speeches, and he told that story
to the Oceanside Kiwanis Club. The group then held a sock drive
that raised 1,000 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cook said, he knew what God wanted him to do. With the
Kiwanis Club's help, he launched a more extensive sock drive,
complete with collection boxes around town and posters featuring a
likeness of Brother Benno putting socks on a boy's feet. (The
Benedictine monk from Kentucky, who died in 1992, was known for
feeding the poor.)
</P>
<P>
   The imagery wasn't lost on the people of Oceanside, about 40
miles north of San Diego. Cook expected to raise 10,000 pairs. He
got 48,314. Of those, he kept 10,000 for Brother Benno's and split
the rest among 17 other nonprofit agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drive is about sharing,'' said Cook. ``You're not even
having to bring the word sacrifice into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Cook's unofficial title is sock drive director. The
drive itself is formally known as the Brother Benno and Kiwanis
Club of San Diego County's Second-Hand Sock Drive. Each year's
poster is selected from a countywide contest for schoolchildren.
The US Navy provides a warehouse where the socks are counted,
sorted, bound, and bagged according to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to wash them, because people are giving us
usable socks,'' Cook said. ``We want ones you would put on your
feet and walk out the door wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent drive brought in 157,248 pairs of secondhand
socks _ the kind Cook prefers _ although some people do donate new
ones. Fifty nonprofits are now distributing the socks to the
homeless and working poor. All told, the drive has netted 482,720
pairs in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is proud of the work he has done, and would like to see
other areas take up the drive. For his part, it's time to move on
to other, as-yet undetermined work. Cook leaves Brother Benno's in
September. Three people will handle his chores next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Cook is writing thank-you notes and overseeing
preparations for the next poster contest. He is making sure the
needy in San Diego County have socks, which he understands may be
his epitaph.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never do anything else,'' he said, ``at least I can say
they got socks.''

SIMPLER REGIMENS COMING IN THE AIDS DRUG QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ When it comes to AIDS treatment, timing and luck are
still as important as virology, immunology, and clinical research.
But that may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the lucky ones,'' AIDS activist Mark Harrington
told a rapt audience at the 12th World AIDS Conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Harrington's AIDS began to worsen ominously two years
ago, a process specialists call disease progression, researchers
came up with a potent triple-drug cocktail, a regimen that has all
but eliminated the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from his
system and rescued his dying immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have progressed at a better time,'' Harrington
said, flashing a slide of his rejuvenated lymph node tissue. ``My
immune system is coming back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   A 49-year-old Rhode Island woman we'll call Christine is lucky
too, in a less dramatic way. Unlike Harrington, she couldn't defer
AIDS treatment until the triple-drug therapy came along. ``She was
progressing so rapidly that we had to layer in each new drug as it
was available,'' said her AIDS physician for the past 10 years, Dr.
Kenneth Mayer of Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   Usually HIV responds to that kind of sequential drug treatment
by developing resistance to each drug in turn, eventually using up
all options. But thankfully, and for reasons no one can explain,
Christine's virus did not become drug resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, she has begun developing the abnormal fat
deposits that are cropping up in about 20 percent of patients on
long-term triple-drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In a more precarious situation is Spencer Cox, a colleague of
Harrington's in the New York-based Treatment Action Group. Like
Christine, he has been heavily treated for HIV _ but now he's
resistant to most of the available drugs. Last December he took
himself off treatment to wait for researchers to come up with a
recipe for a new cocktail that will suppress the HIV in his system,
now hovering at a worrisome 230,000 viruses in each milliliter (1/5
teaspoon) of his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he's hopeful. ``I tend to find the gray cloud in
every silver lining, but I came away from Geneva feeling pretty
optimistic,'' Cox said last week.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Physicians who treat HIV patients and search for
better therapies say they feel optimistic too _ even though nothing
that came out of the Geneva conference tips the balance away from
timing and luck in AIDS treatment and toward reliable, sure-fire
options for individuals at every stage of HIV disease.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there's a case for pessimism, too.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, new drugs in the pipeline appear at least as
potent as current drugs, but they may not come in time to help
those whose current therapy is failing them _ about half the most
intensively treated patients. Also, no imminent drugs represent a
truly new class capable of attacking HIV at a different point in
its life cycle. Thus, it's possible that patients whose virus is
resistant to current drugs will be resistant to new versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my disappointments was that there wasn't more about new
treatments that would benefit those with advanced AIDS,'' said Dr.
Harvey Makadon of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is also still a matter of luck which patients will respond to
current anti-HIV cocktails as dramatically as Harrington did. All
the world's virologists cannot explain or predict why some people's
HIV can be suppressed indefinitely (so far) to a tiny residuum,
while in others the virus roars back.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the cleverest immunologists say why treatment returns
some patients' ravaged immune systems to virtually normal, like
Harrington's, while others' appear beyond redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the frustrating unknowns, many see the glass as
half-full. ``For the individual, there's still a certain amount of
caprice,'' Mayer acknowledged. ``But in the aggregate, we now can
treat HIV as a chronic, difficult, but manageable infectious
disease. That's real progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the positive new signs:
</P>
<P>
   --Much simpler HIV regimens. Instead of the onerous 20 to 30
tablets that patients are now told they must take without fail
morning, noon, and night, it will be possible to swallow three or
four pills a day, split into morning and evening doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a massive reduction in the number of
pills,'' said Dr. Julio Montaner of the University of British
Columbia. ``We have nearly a half-dozen drugs that lend themselves
to once-daily dosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier regimens make it more likely people will take their
medicine faithfully, lowering the risk of treatment failure. That
should also diminish the risk that people will develop
omni-resistant viral mutants that, scientists now know, can be
transmitted sexually.
</P>
<P>
   --More choices. Drugs in the pipeline, and others not far
behind, introduce the possibility of effective regimens that don't
require protease inhibitors, the potent antivirals that made the
big difference two years ago in combination with older drugs. If
so, protease inhibitors can be held in reserve for those whose
virus rebounds after first-line therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``protease-sparing'' regimens may also provide an
alternative for patients like Christine who suffer lipid
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will soon have some really intriguing new choices _ for
beginning therapy or switching therapy _ that look equal or better
in potency to the current gold standard,'' said Dr. R. Scott Hitt,
a Los Angeles AIDS doctor who chairs President Clinton's Advisory
Council on HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   --Immune reconstitution. Researchers are heartened by signs that
current treatments allow patients' immune systems to recover more
completely than they expected. Even many whose virus rebounds seem
to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first conference in which there was any optimism
about the immune system's ability to kick in,'' said Dr. Calvin
Cohen of the Community Research Initiative of New England. ``There
was always this feeling that the immune system was doomed to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are rushing to exploit and augment this immune
recovery, so that even if HIV cannot be eradicated from every last
cell in most patients, it might be controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington articulated the question in many people's minds:
``Are we willing to settle for lifelong therapy, or treat until the
immune system can control whatever residual HIV remains? Do we need
to delete every last...infected cell?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HIV DRUGS IN THE PIPELINE &QL; 
 &QL; 
Clinical trial results on four new drugs promise additional options
soon. But all work in the same ways as existing drugs, so patients
who have developed resistance to standard drugs may also be
resistant to these. &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Efaverenz (Sustiva)  &QL; 
DuPont Pharmaceuticals  &QL; 
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent HIV suppression, even in two-drug combination; Works in
cocktails without a protease inhibitor, saving those drugs for
later. Side effects similar to standard drugs; can alter mood.  &QL; 
Only once daily  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--1592 (Abacavir)  &QL; 
GlaxoWellcome  &QL; 
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent antiviral in three-drug cocktail, even without a protease
inhibitor. Promising in children failing current treatment. May get
into central nervous system. Side effects resemble standard drugs,
but 3 percent suffer allergic reaction that can be fatal if 1592 is
restarted.  &QL; 
Twice daily, no food/water restrictions  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Adefovir (Preveon)  &QL; 
Gilead Sciences  &QL; 
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor  &QL; 
Preliminary studies suggest antiviral efficacy, though perhaps less
potent. As a nucleotide, may work against virus resistant to
nucleosides. Some patients suffer kidney toxicity.  &QL; 
Probably once daily  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
--Amprenavir  &QL; 
GlaxoWellcome/ &QL; 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals  &QL; 
Protease inhibitor  &QL; 
Potent effect in two-drug combination with Abacavir in small
trials. Three-drug combination with nucleosides showed durable
effect. Penetrates into central nervous system. Side effects
similar to other drugs in this class.  &QL; 
Probably twice daily, no food/water restrictions  &QL; 
 &QL;

`GOOD WILL HUNTING' PUTS SOUTH BOSTON ON THE MAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Good Will Hunting''  &LR; _ South Boston's great
home movie _ it does for the alphabet streets what Thomas Crown and
Banacek did for Beacon Hill _ loses nothing on the small screen.
Matt Damon's fine performance survives Robin Williams's overrated
one. The miracle is that Damon and Ben Affleck had the fortitude to
resist alterations in their script, and that the story survived
intact from paper to screen to Oscar night. That means the story of
the making of the movie is actually rarer and better than the film
itself _ but this one is well worth renting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Boxer''  &LR; _ Is there any better actor working today than
Daniel Day-Lewis? He takes chances (both with his roles and his
pocketbook) in low-budget art movies. In this one, set amid the
most recent Irish troubles, he's as good as ever, in a tough-minded
movie that tells a compelling story in an unflinching style _ an
approach that's missing from most films.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Six O'Clock News''  &LR; _ Ross McElwee, the autobiographically
iconoclastic documentarian, sets his sights on an easy target this
time: television news. But the good news is that it's mostly about
his personal evolution. McElwee has the uncanny knack of being able
to document his own life without an overriding ego, making his
insights and imagery more universal than narcissistic.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 (FU)!!! ``Passion in the Desert''  An unusual story about the bond
that develops between a French soldier in Napoleon's army and a
leopard he encounters while lost in the desert. It beats the odds,
compelling us to believe in the way the boundaries of the rational
world dissolve for the soldier once he's cut adrift and the leopard
allows him to return to an elemental world. (PG-13)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Dear Jesse''  &LR; Tim Kirkman's autobiographical memoir doesn't
bash Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) because it doesn't have to. Given
Helms's pro-tobacco, anti-arts, and anti-gay-rights stance, Helms
indicts himself in this documentary, which chronicles his thus far
successful appeals to ignorance. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Madeline''  &LR; Those who fondly remember the Ludwig Bemelmans
books about the free-spirited orphan who keeps breaking out of the
genteel propriety enveloping her Parisian boarding school will
smile upon this charming and carefully wrought film. Britain's
Hatty Jones takes the title role; Frances McDormand is the 12
little girls' mother figure and guardian angel, Miss Clavell. (PG)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ! 1/2 ``Lethal Weapon 4''  &LR; Mel Gibson and Danny Glover peddling
more mayhem. This time their LA cop characters are chasing down a
Chinese triad smuggling in immigrants as the first stage in
establishing a crime empire. If it weren't for shameless appeals to
sentimentality between the set pieces, there'd be no plot at all.
The only breath of freshness comes from Jet Li, making his
Hollywood debut as the explosively proficient young ganglord. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Small Soldiers''  &LR; The smart-gimmick movie of the summer. It's
a toy story with attitude, as macho mercenary action figures come
to malevolent life after real battlefield microchips are inserted
into their musclebound, commando-gear-clad plastic bodies and they
set about leveling a hitherto peaceful Ohio town. Gregory Smith and
Kirsten Dunst are the teens who try to cram these evil genies back
into the bottle. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FD)!! 1/2 ``The Land Girls''  &LR; David Leland's evocation of a trio
of young British women working on a farm during World War II, so
that men will be free to fight, is gorgeously and evocatively
detailed. But its love stories don't equal the impact of its
splendid atmospherics. (R)

HEY, YOU, IT'S A GOOOAAALLLL! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a soccer announcer shouts GOOOAAALLL!, will anyone in this
country hear it?
</P>
<P>
   A generation after soccer started gaining popularity in the
United States (more youngsters now play soccer than any other team
sport but basketball), the American public is turning its back in
astonishing numbers on the planet's most popular sport.
</P>
<P>
   In June, when the monthlong World Cup competition began, the
government of Tunisia gave everybody in the nation the day off so
they could watch their team compete against Colombia. On Tuesday,
when Holland and Brazil were playing what had been in the most
dramatic match of the competition _ which ended Sunday when Brazil
France for the title _ most Americans seemed to register a
collective yawn.
</P>
<P>
   TV ratings in the United States for the World Cup are down 53
percent on ESPN from the cup of four years ago. Ratings on ABC went
from 5.3 in 1994, when the United States hosted the World Cup, to
2.3 for this year's version of the quadrennial event, which is
being played in France. That will come as a surprise to most
Americans. According to a Harris poll, only 25 percent of the
people surveyed could identify France as the host country for the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more shocking: Only half _ 52 percent _ knew that the
World Cup was a soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there remains an enormous gap between the
global importance of the World Cup and the importance of the event
to the non-ethnic American population,'' says Matt Scheckner,
director of sports and entertainment practice for Louis Harris &AMP;
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers are dismal,'' says Scheckner about the poll.
``Should they set off alarm bells? You bet. Is there anything
soccer can do in the near term to reverse this? Probably not. It is
just not part of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that nearly 14 million Americans between the ages of 6
and 18 play organized soccer _ and ``soccer moms'' are sought after
by both politicians and marketers _ yet the game languishes in
roughly the same purgatorial television tier as beach volleyball
and arena football?
</P>
<P>
   ``America's kids love to play soccer, but America loves pro
football, pro basketball and pro baseball,'' says Scheckner, adding
that despite the millions of Americans who play soccer, the game's
nuances are not understood well enough for people to appreciate all
the subtleties in a 0-0 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Fredrick, executive director of national broadcast for J.
Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York, said his children
played soccer and he once thought the sport would eventually rival
the big three. ``Kids love to play it, but then they leave it and
watch football,'' he says. ``One of the problems for soccer is that
to be really big as a sport, sports fans have to talk about it
around the water cooler. If you talk about soccer, it is kind of
arcane, and you keep it to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The US team's pathetic performance _ it was ousted in the first
round _ did little to spark either patriotic fervor or a deep
interest in the game. And in a country where instant gratification,
fast-food restaurants, and MTV quick-cuts abound, the pace of
soccer is as foreign as the game itself. Consider that in the two
semifinal games last week, both hard-fought dramas, the teams
averaged a shot on goal every 7 minutes. To many Americans, that,
apparently, is as exciting as watching C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic diversity of American youth and soccer's low
profile make rare the child whose dream is to score the winning
goal in the World Cup finals. Rather, most want to hit the home run
that wins the World Series, or to be the next Michael Jordan. In
contrast, the fantasy of youngsters around the world is to be the
next Pele, to score the goal that brings glory to their country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans miss out on a passion that brings the
rest of the world to a standstill. The World Cup, after all, is the
culmination of two years of preliminary matches that winnow the
field of 144 countries down to the qualifying 32. It is sports'
quintessential definition of delayed gratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that right now, everywhere else on the planet,
things have stopped. Traffic lights are blinking and there are no
cars on the road, signs in shop windows say they are closed for the
game,'' says Dick Johnson, curator of the New England Sports
Museum. But, he says, unlike other countries, the United States is
not a single-sport country.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some countries, the ever-dominant United States does
not feel the need to win battles on the soccer field as a way to
retaliate for losses on the battlefield. Not so elsewhere. Earlier
in the competition, when Iran beat the US team, effectively
eliminating us from advancing from the first round of 32 countries,
Iranians were jubilant. Those Americans who were paying attention
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is an automatic nationalism that partly fuels the
popularity of the game everywhere in the world except here. But
more than nationalism makes the World Cup so popular. It is the
world's common denominator. Unlike the Olympics, which has its
share of esoteric sports, the World Cup is just soccer. And soccer
_ or football as the rest of the world calls it _ is what the world
plays.
</P>
<P>
   It creates in spectators feelings toward the athletes that range
from affinity to envy, from rage to joy. Soccer analyst Seamus
Malin notes that not everyone can relate to an athlete skiing
through the snow and then firing a rifle at a target, but everyone
in the Stade de France, and the billions around the world watching
on television, understand soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are hot spots of interest in the United States.
The Boston area's Brazilian community is already out in force, and
the Crimson Sports Grille in Harvard Square was standing room only
Wednesday with foreign students watching France defeat Croatia, and
more people standing on the sidewalk of JFK Street watching the big
screen television through the bar's plate glass front window.
</P>
<P>
   But for every person who can identify Ronaldo and Rivaldo (the
former, one of the world's most recognized sports figures and the
star attacker of the Brazilian team, the latter is his midfield
teammate), there are countless others who could care less.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discouraging Harris poll (which, for the record, a
US Soccer Federation spokesman says must be ``bogus'') and the drop
in ratings, television executives say they are thrilled by the
World Cup, which is being televised in its entirity, live and _
most un-American _ without commercial interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted,'' says ABC's Sports Jon Litner, senior vice
president for programming. ``We think it has been a terrific
tournament, competetive, and great for marketing. We think it
(soccer and the World Cup) is healthy and has a bright, long-term
future, and we will continue to work towards that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whatever lack of passion the US continues to display,
the rest of the world will probably make up for it, sometimes for
the better _ like the spontaneous parties and parades that often
follow victories _ and sometimes for the worse. Defeat has, in the
past, led to desperate acts. For example, when Uruguay stunned
Brazil in the 1950 contest, dozens of despondent Brazilians
commited suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Victory or defeat can also bring out ugly displays of violence.
British soccer hooligans are known and dreaded the world over. And
their mayhem has spawned other acts of violence _ like the severe
beating last month of a French policeman by German fans, believed
to be neo-Nazis, who went wild after a game.
</P>
<P>
   And one cannot forget the most astonishing example of the
extreme behavior, which occured in 1994. In a game against the
United States, Colombian player Andres Escobar accidently scored a
goal into his own net, a pivotal error because Colombia was upset,
2-1. Colombia was eliminated from the competition, and shortly
after Escobar returned to Medellin, he was shot 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   As his murderers fired away, they reportedly shouted, ``Goal!
Goal! Goal!.''

ASIAN CRISIS MAY BEGIN TO CLOUD US PROSPERITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The US economy's smooth ride on a dangerous wind
from the East is about to get rougher. Maybe a lot rougher, though
there still is no direct evidence that a decade that rivals the
1960s in prosperity will end with a cessation of economic growth or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The last several days have highlighted a different picture from
the uniformly positive news of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   _Employment and industrial production growth are flattening, and
unemployment may be trending higher from the lowest level in a
generation as firms dependent on exports feel the impact of Asia's
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the announcement by Internet powerhouse Yahoo
Inc. of second-quarter profits that exceeded Wall Street's
expectations served as a reminder that a new economy continues to
churn forward.
</P>
<P>
   _Federal Reserve estimates showed a contraction in the growth of
consumer borrowing during May, the slowest pace since last
November. And that news can be a hint of what is to come in
consumer spending, which remains the source of two-thirds of the
economy's juice.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement by Folgers of a second cut in its list
price of coffee this year, in the face of the biggest Brazilian
coffee crop in more than a decade, is a reminder of how good
inflation news remains. That is in turn a key cause of low interest
rates that are crucial to continued overall growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, Americans will begin to see how much the
economy's pace is slowing, particularly when the Commerce
Department makes a preliminary estimate of total output of goods
and service for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   There is universal agreement that the extraordinary pace of the
first quarter, a 5.4 percent annual rate, cannot be sustained. The
real question is how much the growth rate dropped. To most
Americans that's just a number. More important is a narrative of
the underlying developments, of which there are primarily two.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a change in how the Asian crisis is affecting this
country. At first, it was more beneficial than harmful. With the
dollar trending higher against the major Asian currencies, above
all the yen, there was a rise in imports from the countries
involved that was noticeable in prices paid by Americans before the
loss of exports was felt in lower production and employment in
affected businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, movement of money to these shores, above all to the
government bond market, in search of security had the effect _
along with the stability at long last in US budget policy _ of
keeping long-term interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   That is now changing. The lost export business and diminished
future prospects are being felt now, and the impact is likely to
continue for at least the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The second development is somewhat technical, but probably more
important to the upcoming estimate of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   The huge growth figure in the first quarter turns out to contain
the largest addition to business inventories in the history of
statistics about them. The change, worth slightly more than $100
billion at an annual rate, accounted for fully 1.7 percentage
points of the total rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't gonna happen again, and it definitely did not happen in
the second quarter. Because what counts in measuring the economy is
the change in inventories from quarter to quarter, as opposed to
their absolute level, they were at best a zero last quarter and
more likely a negative.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a less vibrant industrial sector generally, and weak
Asian exports in particular, and it is difficult to see how the
growth rate could have been much above 2 percent, if that.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, that is no surprise. The relentlesssly conservative
Clinton administration, in drawing up its budget documents early
this year, projected growth at 2 to 2.5 percent this year, as well
as in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As the months pass, however, that assumption will be tested by
four major questions:
</P>
<P>
   _Will Asia stabilize? The engine of recovery will have to be
Japan. In the wake of parliamentary elections, the world will find
out whether Japanese recovery policies are credible or
inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   _When will the General Motors strike end? So far, it may cost
the economy a half-point in growth for the year, but if the worst
GM strike in 28 years goes past Labor Day, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   _Will US policymakers goof? One danger would be a premature
tightening of monetary policy by Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve.
The other would be a loss of budgetary discipline by the Republican
Congress. The former is unlikely, the latter a slight danger.
</P>
<P>
   _Will the Asian bug spread? The potential danger areas are Latin
America and the Middle East, but it is only potential at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view remains that the United States will slow
down a good bit for the next half-year or so, but then gradually
speed up. But where near-euphoria once reigned, some very health
concern and skepticism now hold sway.

FIDELITY IMPOSES NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ITS CHARITY FUND

<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments has imposed new restrictions on
the ways in which donors to its hugely popular charity fund can use
their contributions, putting a lid on disbursements that could seem
at odds with the giant philanthropic fund's do-good mission.
</P>

   The changes at Fidelity's Charitable Gift Fund, one of the
nation's largest public charities, come amid carping from
traditional not-for-profit outfits and officials that charities run
by commercial companies can allow donors to benefit themselves
rather than worthy causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of donor-advised funds that cover the
waterfront in terms of behavior and appropriateness,'' said Marcus
S. Owens, head of tax-exempt organizations at the Internal Revenue
Service, referring to a new breed of charities, like Fidelity's,
that allows donors to decide which organizations receive their
assets. ``We are taking a look at some donor-advised organizations
a bit more closely,'' he said. He declined to comment on
Boston-based Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity officials said last month that the IRS had reaffirmed
the $1.3 billion Charitable Gift Fund's status as a public charity.
The IRS had not audited the philanthropic activities of the
nation's largest mutual fund company, said Jamie B. Jaffee, who
heads Fidelity's gift fund.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund, donors with at least $10,000 can set up an account,
sometimes named after themselves and styled like a personal
foundation, and take an immediate tax deduction on the gift. Unlike
traditional charities, which give donors little or no say in how
their money or stocks are used, Fidelity lets customers decide when
and to which cause the assets are disbursed. Customers cannot draw
money out and receive no money back.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR; Fidelity executives acknowledged that a few of the fund's
more than 11,000 donors had in the past misdirected contributions
to private foundations and other non-IRS-registered organizations
that then used the money to buy benefit tickets, pay off pledges,
and finance scholarships and college tuition payments. Such uses
are prohibited by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffee characterized the incidents as small in number and minor
in sum. She declined to provide details but said Fidelity had gone
back to the donors and asked them to return the money to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity explicitly prohibits grant distributions from
being used to satisfy personal benefits, the company has introduced
new restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules, outlined in a letter to gift fund donors last
week, Fidelity will not allow new donors to make grants to private
foundations. But under certain conditions the fund will consider
existing donors' recommended grants to private foundations until
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has also banned donors from directing money to foreign
charities. Instead, disbursements should go to a US organization
that makes grants to foreign charities. And Fidelity now promises
it will disburse at least 5 percent of the gift fund's assets each
year _ a symbolic gesture, since the fund currently disburses 20
percent of its assets annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reviewing the procedures that the gift fund follows, there
were a number of areas where if the object is to avoid questions,
we thought we could make some enhancements,'' said Fred Goldberg, a
former IRS commissioner whom Fidelity hired to review the fund
after allegations of impropriety were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1992, Fidelity's charity fund has been a
runaway success with customers, who have found the idea of being
miniature Rockefellers appealing in a booming stock market that has
stuffed their wallets. Fidelity argues that the gift fund, which
has spawned a host of look-alikes, marries glamorous philanthropy
with average Americans. But such funds have stirred up controversy
among charities run by churches, hospitals, and relief outfits,
which are also wooing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charities are upset because it's competition,'' said Stacy
E. Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, an industry
newsletter. But she added: ``There is concern that it's not a level
playing field, that Fidelity has a marketing machine (to attract
donors) that other charities do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Charitable Gift Fund, the nation's 12-largest
charity by assets, was the country's number-one grant maker among
public charities, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. The
fund gave out nearly $195 million to 16,000 charities in 1997, more
than the American Cancer Society and the March of Dimes Birth
Defects Foundation. Over its lifetime, it has dispersed $680
million to more than 50,000 charities.
</P>
<P>
   Once customers put money or stock into the fund, Fidelity earns
a fee for managing the assets, which are funneled into Fidelity
mutual funds to grow before being disbursed by donor request.
Fidelity says the fee it charges covers administrative costs and
that it takes none of the interest.
</P>
<P>
   Slamming critics who have said the Charitable Gift Fund makes a
profit for Fidelity, company executives said the fund had actually
lost money every year since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied,'' Goldberg said, ``that they have not made a
dime off of this thing.''

DWIGHT YOAKAM: THE REAL BEVERLY HILLBILLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Hollywood sophisticate by day, a hillbilly by night. That's
the duality of Dwight Yoakam's life. He's a Grammy-winning country
singer with Kentucky roots, but also a hot motion-picture property
thanks to his work in the Oscar-winning ``Sling Blade,'' which has
led to more movie roles and the possible filming of a new Yoakam
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for a better opportunity than `Sling Blade,'''
Yoakam says of his jump-start from the Billy Bob Thornton-penned
film two years ago. In it, Yoakam played a mean drunk who was ``an
outgrowth of an all-too-common behavior in families,'' he says. He
has since played a bomb expert in ``The Newton Boys'' and just
started filming an HBO movie, ``Minus Man,'' in which he plays a
cop chasing a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   To Yoakam's credit, he has doggedly surmounted any Hollywood
stereotypes about his hillbilly roots and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hillbilly genre I was in was sometimes a hindrance,''
Yoakam admits from his Los Angeles home. ``You're characterized as
a certain type regionally and colloquially, and it's taken some
time to transcend that. It was hard for the casting people to look
beyond a low-brimmed hat and a guitar slung over my shoulders. It
took time for me to convey my sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam, of course, has conveyed his musical sincerity for years
_ ever since the smash honky-tonk album ``Guitars, Cadillacs,
Etc.'' put him on the map in 1984. He has released a potent series
of retro-rocking hillbilly discs since then, peaking commercially
with 3 million sales of ``This Time'' in 1993, which yielded the
Top Five country hits ``Ain't That Lonely Yet,'' ``A Thousand Miles
from Nowhere,'' ``Try Not to Look So Pretty,'' and ``Pocket of a
Clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam followed that with the creative, if not commercial,
brilliance of ``Gone.'' That led to his new release, ``A Long Way
Home,'' a more personal album in which he wrote all of the material
(without collaborators) for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cosmic cowboy music for the new millennium'' is how Yoakam
describes his latest album, which incorporates a timeless, Johnny
Cash-like twang with modern lyrics about relationships, both
endings and beginnings. As with previous discs, it was produced by
his longtime guitarist and musical partner, Pete Anderson. The
latter knows how to coax the best performances from Yoakam, a noted
individualist who likes to rec-ord his vocals in near-darkness in
the studio.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Standing in the dark in the studio is less distracting,''
says Yoakam. ``I like to drift away from visual distractions. And
if I'm not seeing the tile floor and the microphone stands too
clearly, I feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how busy Yoakam is these days, one would not expect him to
have written everything on the new album. But like fellow
musician/film star Harry Connick Jr., Yoakam has learned to write
during the long down times on movie sets. He wrote the new songs
while filming ``The Newton Boys'' in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film didn't have anything to do with it, but the isolation
did,'' Yoakam says of his songwriting. ``I didn't expect to be
writing an album, but it came from a natural place.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's title, ``A Long Way Home,'' and its first hit
single, ``Things Change,'' suggest the rapid transitions Yoakam has
experienced in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the midst of transitions in my life on `Gone,' and
also subsequently on `Sling Blade,' which crawled, then toddled,
then ran to the success it eventually realized,'' he says. ``And I
was being pulled by that in an auxiliary way. The music is about
how relationships changed because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam has no plans to tour to support the album this year, but
will go out next year. ``That will be a difference from the last
couple of tours, where I found myself introducing the new material
to the audience,'' he says. ``I'd like to go out next time and
share the material, rather than present it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yoakam is trying to see his screenplay (his first)
produced. It's a gothic western titled provocatively ``South of
Heaven, West of Hell.'' He's reluctant to describe it for fear of
jinxing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to do it, but you never know in Hollywood,'' he
says. ``I had a 212-page script that was cut to 193 pages to 166 to
a svelte 146. It's a lean, mean, fighting script. Today, it looks
as if (Hollywood) will let us shoot the movie. We're just waiting
to see.''

NIXON: AS TRICKY ABROAD AS AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
A TANGLED WEB 
The Making of Foreign Policy in the Nixon Presidency 
By William Bundy. Hill &AMP; Wang. 647 pp. Illustrated. $35. 
 
 
NIXON IN WINTER 
By Monica Crowley. Random House. 428 pp. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not for another 15 months would he resign the presidency, but by
May 1973 Richard Nixon realized it was only a matter of time.
``It's all over, Ron, do you know that?'' he told his press
secretary, Ron Ziegler. It was a fate that baffled him, frankly _
not so much how he had come to such a pass but why the minor
trangressions of Watergate (or so they seemed to Nixon) should
outweigh the supreme asset (or so it also seemed) he brought to the
office. ``Goddamn it,'' he complained to Ziegler, ``whatever our
weaknesses are, I know this foreign policy field.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a knowledge not even Nixon's fiercest detractors would
gainsay. No 20th-century president has entered the White House with
as much experience in foreign affairs _ and none in our history has
so single-mindedly focused on it. During his 5 1/2 years in office,
Nixon oversaw the opening to China, detente with the Soviet Union
and the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the war in
Indochina, shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, and the end of the
Bretton Woods monetary system, to name only the most significant
diplomatic events during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Even Watergate helped further Nixon's foreign policy renown:
Just as he had played the China card in dealing with the Soviet
Union, so after 1974 would he play the foreign policy card in his
20-year campaign to be remembered as world statesman rather than
unindicted coconspirator.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Tangled Web,'' his judicious and comprehensive study of
``The Making of Foreign Policy in the Nixon Presidency,'' William
Bundy concludes that the two roles were, in fact, inseparable.
(Bundy's title, which comes from Sir Walter Scott's observation
about what we weave when we begin to deceive, alludes to more than
just the complexity of Nixon's statecraft.) Though the author might
have chosen less pejorative terms _ ``secrecy'' and
``flexibility,'' say _ Nixon himself would likely not have
quarreled with Bundy's assessment that concealment and deceit were
as much a part of this president's conduct of foreign policy as
vision and boldness were. What he would have disputed, and
vehemently, is Bundy's corollary judgment: ``Most fundamentally,
(Nixon) lacked the qualities of a statesman and builder'' precisely
because of his incapacity for openness and consensus building.
</P>
<P>
   In these contrasting views, one sees the longstanding doctrinal
gulf in US foreign policy, one as old _ and still as relevant _ as
the divide between Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians. On the one hand
are the pragmatist advocates of Realpolitik, those who argue that,
in Nixon's words, ``Foreign affairs aren't about trust. They're
about interests and power.'' On the other are the idealist
upholders of what one might call Stimsonian diplomacy, after Henry
Stimson, secretary of state under Herbert Hoover and secretary of
war under Franklin Roosevelt, who when informed that the United
States had cracked the Japanese diplomatic code, declared,
``Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''
</P>
<P>
   This division is by no means as simple as it looks. Containment,
the central tenet of US Cold War foreign policy, was a masterful
utilization of Realpolitik _ and largely the handiwork of George
Kennan, than whom there is no living figure more revered by the
idealist school. Conversely, the anticommunism that did so much to
define Nixon's career _ a doctrine Bundy sees him keeping faith
with even during the headiest days of detente _ was as much driven
by ideology, and even morality, as by national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than Nixon, perhaps, Bundy demonstrates how the camps
overlap. He comes by his Stimsonianism naturally: His brother,
McGeorge, collaborated with Stimson on his autobiography before
serving as national security adviser under presidents Kennedy and
Johnson. William Bundy held high-level posts in the defense and
state departments in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and
from 1972 to 1984 edited Foreign Affairs, the bible of the foreign
policy establishment. Yet during the '50s, he served in that least
Stimsonian of public-sector enterprises, the Central Intelligence
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy's work takes its place as the most complete and balanced
account of Nixon's foreign policy. (Henry Kissinger's memoirs are
the most complete; they are not the most balanced.) This is doubly
ironic as the author was an associate of Nixon's great bane, John
F. Kennedy, and a high priest of the Eastern Establishment that
Nixon at once despised and envied. Blood does tell, and, patrician
that he is, Bundy displays no end of punctilio toward his subject.
Even so, his basic distaste isn't hard to discern. For a
Stimsonian, foreign policy is the highest expression of the
democratic ethos: open covenants, openly arrived at. For Nixon, its
greatest appeal lay in its having so little to do with democracy.
Foreign policy allowed for grand and direct action _ go to China,
bomb Cambodia, close the gold window _ without having to observe
such niceties as informing State or consulting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental dynamic of Nixon's diplomacy was individual
rather than institutional _ with Nixon and Kissinger as the
individuals in question, a pair of solo operators (unquestionably
gifted) who relentlessly schemed and meddled at the expense of the
professionals. Bundy consistently notes how much Nixon and
Kissinger's successes owed to the likes of Paul Volcker at
Treasury, U. Alexis Johnson at State, Gerard Smith at the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency, David Packard at Defense _ and how
often ignoring them worsened Nixon and Kissinger's failures. As
well as a reassessment of Nixon, ``A Tangled Web'' is a tribute to
them and their Foreign Service and sub-Cabinet brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's greatest sin, in Bundy's view, was defining every
foreign policy issue in terms of superpower relations. ``Presiding
over a time when the United States should have been moving out of
the mold of the Cold War and into the era when local and regional
crises were more important than superpower rivalry, and economic
factors more influential than geopolitics at any level, he never
made the leaps that history called for, on either front.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a strong condemnation, yet on the evidence of Monica
Crowley's ``Nixon in Winter,'' nearly half of which concerns its
subject's views on Russia and China, the superpowers remained
Nixon's near-exclusive focus in his elder-statesman phase, too.
Soon after graduating from college in 1990, Crowley joined Nixon's
staff as a foreign policy assistant. Two years ago, she published
``Nixon Off the Record,'' which recorded his comments to her on
political matters. Her new book follows the same format _ lengthy
chunks of Nixon's table talk along with even lengthier chunks of
Crowley's exposition _ this time largely on foreign affairs, along
with smaller sections on political scandal and more philosophical
reflections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon's personal and professional disclosures were made in
confidence,'' she writes, ``but with the implicit understanding
that they would eventually be recounted.'' Implicit on her part,
anyway, for as with the previous book, Nixon could have had little
desire for the public to see him as he appears in Crowley's pages.
</P>
<P>
   For all that she clearly admires Nixon (and, even more clearly,
continues to profit from her association with him), the figure who
emerges here is vain, petty, banal, and coarse. When not worrying
about his popularity _ ``Do you think the interest in me is down?''
a worried Nixon asks Crowley _ he's sounding less like a statesman
than like the Red Queen. ``Remember what they did to Khrushchev?
Made him a nonperson? That's what I'll do to CBS and the Post and
maybe even the Times,'' he announces, irked at their heavy coverage
of the 20th anniversary of the Watergate break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Far worse, Crowley makes Nixon guilty of the one offense he
never committed while alive: He's boring. As he drones on through
these pages, and then as she expatiates on what he's just droned,
it's hard to believe this is the dark star of American politics
whose negative ions irradiated public life for nearly half a
century. Twice only does she communicate some sense of the man's
acrid savor. Delighted to have won a court victory in his endless
battle to keep the White House tapes closed, he strikes up an
impromptu version of ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' (FDR's theme
song!) on the piano. And prompted by his wife, Pat, he shows off an
Ultrasuede coat she had given him for Christmas. ``You must see
this jacket,'' he proudly tells Crowley. ``Isn't it lustrous?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange state of affairs when the most edifying thing a
book has to offer is the image of Richard Nixon modeling
Ultrasuede. Still, ``Nixon in Winter,'' like Crowley's earlier
effort, does offer one valuable lesson for future presidents, even
if it arrives too late to benefit the present holder of the office:
Beware the ministrations of intimates named Monica.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Image consultant. The job description has a superficial, even
slick, ring, but the actual work is practical, and very personal.
Trust is crucial, says image consultant Ginger Burr as she works on
client Ann Paquin's makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients have to feel comfortable with me,'' says Burr, who has
been an image consultant for 11 years. ``They're not going to let
just anyone into their homes, their lives. I see them in their
underwear. I tell them: I've seen everything, you won't be
embarassed. I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr, one of several Boston-area image consultants, has worked
with hundreds of clients, most of them professional women ranging
in age from their 30s to their 60s. Her usual fee is $75 an hour.
She does color analysis, makeup, wardrobe consultation, personal
shopping, advises clients about hair, glasses, jewelry. She helps
some pack for trips, she advises others on choosing the right
outfit for an important occasion. ``Whatever it takes to make a
client look good, I'll do it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Burr's business is a bit unusual in that it includes a number of
transgender clients who have completed or who are awaiting gender
reassignment surgery. She saw her first transgender client shortly
after she launched her business, and over the years, word-of-mouth
recommendations have brought her more, for whom she does much the
same work as she does for her other clients. ``The only difference
is that usually we're starting from ground zero,'' says Burr.
</P>
<P>
   The image consulting business is growing, as more women, and men
too, realize that the way in which they present themselves can have
a make-or-break impact on their careers, to say nothing of their
personal lives. The Association of Image Consultants International
has more than 600 members worldwide, 200 of whom, Burr included,
are meeting this week in Miami at a five-day conference for, among
other events, panels titled ``Feng-Shui _ the Image Consultants'
Way,'' and ``The Psychology of Appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Image consultants advise clients on every aspect of their
personal style, from wardrobe and makeup to speech and body
language. They come from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines.
Burr's career path is typically atypical. She was a music major at
Mount Holyoke College, worked in Boston in arts administration and,
at MIT, word processing. ``I'd always had an interest in makeup and
fashion, although 15 years ago you never would have known it to
look at me,'' she says. ``And I always wanted to start my own
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr attended seminars conducted by Worldwide Images, a training
organization, and set up her business, Total Image Consultants, in
a studio in her Somerville home. Slim, fine-featured, impeccably
groomed, Burr, 42, is her own best advertisement. She likes to show
vistors a ``before'' photo of herself as she looks when she gets up
in the morning, with no makeup, her hair hanging limply, and ask
them to compare it with a glamorous ``after'' photo in which
resembles a CNN anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Richardson of Newburyport, Mass., author and business
coach, credits Burr with transforming her look, which boosted her
career. ``I did what a lot of women do, I completely underestimated
the importance of my image as a business-building strategy,''
Richardson says. ``I thought if people liked me it didn't matter
how I looked.''
</P>
<P>
   She found out how important image can be when, after Burr took
her in hand, she attended a meeting of influential business
executives whom she had tried, unsuccessfully, to impress on a
previous occasion. ``That day I had seven or eight people come up
to me, ask what I did, and give me their business cards,'' she
says. ``That one day really changed everything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr's introductory two-hour session includes color analysis,
makeup application, and instruction and advice about hairstyle.
Most clients also want a wardrobe consultation, which means that
Burr goes through their closets, helps them weed out has-beens, and
organize what's left. She also shops with or for clients. One of
her favorite haunts is the Turnabout Shop in Wellesley, a high-end
resale boutique. ``I've seen Ginger in action for four or five
years and I've learned a lot from her,'' says owner Elaine
Sugarman. ``She helps her clients learn what looks good on them and
what doesn't and gives them the confidence to make choices without
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the women she works with, Burr's transgender
clients are working professionals who want help with makeup, hair,
and wardrobe and don't have the time or the expertise to do it
themselves. Some are afraid to shop for themselves, so Burr selects
clothing for them. She also has a few cross-dressers as clients,
men who enjoy dressing as women. ``They usually want a more
flamboyant look,'' she said. ``It's fun, but not for everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, her transgender clients want more conservative
clothes that they can wear to work. Many of them have high-powered
jobs. ``I've been reborn, but I don't have the benefit of having a
girlhood,'' said one, a 52-year-old woman who heads her own
technical consulting business. ``I have all these things to learn
about hair, makeup, clothing. I felt I had to go to someone who
would give me a complete education.''
</P>
<P>
   This client, who asked that her name not be used, underwent
gender reassignment surgery just a few months ago. ``When I
transitioned I had nothing,'' she said, from her Rhode Island home.
``I had to start from scratch. I'd never worn makeup. And men's
clothing choices are so much less complicated. You don't have all
the style and color and fabric selections, the different outfits
for various occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr taught her how to apply makeup and took her shopping at
Saks and Filenes. ``Appearance is very important in my job because
I'm constantly meeting people,'' she said. ``I'm very pleased with
the results. I feel I have a long way to go, because I can't be
sure that everything I've accomplished in the past will be accepted
now that I'm a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr, she added, has been ``very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very rewarding part of my business,'' Burr says. ``I
feel I'm making a big difference in their lives. On their part, it
takes a lot of courage. You have to be so sure of who you are, who
you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr's job incorporates elements of therapy. She has to be a
good listener. ``I spend a lot of time talking with clients,'' she
says. ``I have to get a real sense of who they are and what they're
going for. It's very personal. If I take somebody shopping without
knowing about them, I don't know how to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Paquin of Boston says Burr helped her develop a casual but
businesslike look appropriate for her job as a national distributor
of Shaklee products. ``I want to look good, but I don't want to be
thinking all the time: How do I look?'' says Paquin. A longtime
client, Paquin visits Burr every so often for makeup and wardrobe
updates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Burr's clients have body image problems. One told her
that she looked in her closet every morning and cried. ``They hate
their clothes, hate how they look,'' Burr said. ``Every woman who
looks into my mirror will start tearing herself apart. Every one.
She'll notice flaws that nobody else sees, or what she considers to
be flaws. It would be wonderful if all women could accept who they
are, how they look. When was the last time you heard a man talk
about the size of his thighs?''
</P>
<P>
   Often women will tell her that they'll call for an appointment
in six months or a year, when they've lost 10 or 15 pounds. ``I
wish I could convince them to do it now,'' Burr says. ``Because if
they do, they're going to feel better about themselves, even if
they don't lose weight.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Dan Zevin is not a man to miss an opportunity
to turn his life's milestones into comic prose and potential
bestsellerdom.
</P>
<P>
   Zevin, 33, burst onto the humor scene four years ago with
``Entry Level Life,'' a tongue-in-cheek, how-to book for recent
college graduates about surviving in the real world. At the time,
he was surviving in the real world by working as ``gear editor''
for the Boston-based Walking magazine, a job that entailed ripping
running shoes apart and examining the innersoles, all the time
contemplating the depressing disparity between his job hopes and
reality.
</P>
<P>
   His book dealt with ``the things career counselors don't tell
you,'' Zevin says of ``Entry Level Life,'' which poked wicked fun
at ``What Color Is Your Parachute?'' and other solemn career
manuals. ``Like making the transition from keg party to cocktail
party and how to decorate an apartment with milk crates.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Nearly-Wed Handbook _ How to Survive the
Happiest Day of Your Life'' (Avon Books), a spoof of
wedding-planning guides that Zevin began writing just about as soon
as his honeymoon was over.
</P>
<P>
   Like his first book, ``The Nearly-Wed Handbook'' parodies an
entire genre of pretentious how-to books. In this case, he says,
``all those books with pink covers that supposedly tell you how to
have the perfect wedding but really just make you feel inadequate.
Like you don't know what you're doing _ which you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   A shrewd and witty observer of Gen-X mores, the 33-year-old
Zevin, who majored in journalism at New York University, says men
of his generation frequently don't even start thinking about
getting married ``until the day after attending the wedding of a
kid they used to baby-sit for.'' Marriage usually sneaks up on
these guys, he notes, when they aren't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the typical unmarried woman, Zevin maintains, is an inner
bride trying to get out. Women are usually aware of this at some
level, he says, but single men are utterly dumbfounded to discover
that they have an inner groom. ``One day you're sitting in front of
the TV in your underwear watching ESPN and the next thing you know
you're down on your knees proposing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He insists (with a not very straight face) that ``Stan'' and
``Peg,'' the couple whose chaotic and costly progress from live-in
companionship to wedded bliss he gleefully chronicles, are not be
confused with ``Dan'' (Daniel Zevin) and ``Meg'' (Megan Tingley),
who got married in the Berkshires a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Zevin and Tingley met while students at NYU and moved to the
Boston area in 1986. She is a children's book editor. They live in
North Cambridge in a recently purchased two-family house.``We got
married on our 10th anniversary,'' quips Zevin. ``We needed new
kitchen appliances and you don't get presents if you elope.''
</P>
<P>
   After the publication of ``Entry Level Life,'' which has sold
about 40,000 copies, Zevin quit his magazine job to become a
freelance writer. He contributes to Rolling Stone (where he
interned as a student) and other national publications. ``I just
wrote an article for U.S. News &AMP; World Report about aging
Generation Xers like me who are getting married,'' he says, ``but
they edited most of the humor out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zevin has a prose style that's a blend of Dave Barry and P.J.
O'Rourke, and, happily, the editors who worked on the ``The
Nearly-Wed Handbook'' left the laughter in. ``Getting wedded is an
exhausting experience, and I'm trying to provide some comic
relief,'' says Zevin. ``You need a sense of humor to survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Nearly-Wed Handbook,'' Zevin takes the prospective
bride and groom step by step through the wedding process _ which is
not to be confused with the marriage process. Getting married,
explains Zevin, means: ``You make the most mature adult decision of
your life.'' Getting wedded, however, means: ``You spend three
hours deciding whether to register for the sterling silver olive
pitter or the crystal margarita decanter with cactus theme swizzle
sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Useful tips for nearly wed grooms include where to get an
engagement ring. ``The best place to go shopping for a ring is the
place your fiancee has told you to go. Make sure to bring the stack
of Polaroids she has taken of the ring she has selected.'' Also,
what kind of orchestra not to hire for the reception: ``The Tony
Cheesetone All-Bald Wedding Combo.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly wed brides, Zevin provides capsule descriptions of
various kinds of ``specialty'' bridal showers, such as the
bachelorette party. ``A favorite among gals who find male stag
parties so juvenile, so vulgar, so demeaning, they are forced to
have one themselves. Party antics include dressing up in toilet
paper wedding gowns, engaging in adult-themed scavenger hunts and
stuffing dollar bills down the athletic supporters of gyrating
Chippendale dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On the wedding day, Zevin advises the modern bride to reject
the sexist practice of having her father give her away. ``Tell your
patriarchal oppressor you won't let yourself be `given away.' For a
mutually agreed upon fee, however (for example, the outstanding
balance on the florist) you'll be happy to let him walk you down
the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Stressful as the wedding ceremony may seem, Zevin says, what
follows may be equally traumatic. Such as: the receiving line, a
spotlit solo dance performance (``the dance of fear'' ),
table-hopping at the reception (Everyone asks: ``So, how does it
feel to be married?''), and the bridal bouquet toss (``The bouquet
never lands on the floor but many of the women vying to catch it
do.'')
</P>
<P>
   His own wedding was actually a pretty happy occasion, Zevin
says. ``It was a nonreligious ceremony in an old farmhouse in
Western Massachusetts that's the kind of special wedding place
nobody else is supposed to know about but you have to book a couple
of years in advance,'' he says. ``I only recognized about 15
percent of the guests, but we had a 12-piece funk band.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing freelance articles, a happily married (as
opposed to wedded) Zevin keeps busy doing an occasional commentary
for National Public Radio and hosting a weekly call-in show on
WMFO-FM, Tufts University community radio. ``The show is called
`Every Day People,''' he says, ``and I interview plumbers,
electricians, dog trainers, and people like the guy who runs my
favorite sandwich shop.''
</P>
<P>
   He also still gets invited ``by career counselors with a sense
of humor'' to lecture about life at entry level to nearly graduated
college students. Then, there's the new book he's working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about buying a first house,'' Zevin says, ``and is
tentatively titled `Surreal Estate.'''

NONESUCH LIVES UP TO ITS NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many of America's cultural institutions have decided that the
only way to survive in today's market-driven world is to follow the
lead of politicians. Instead of inviting the public in through the
force of artistic personality, the trend is to pander to public
taste. Classical labels and even a public-radio station follow this
path of least resistance.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, still cases where a cultural institution,
even a commercial one, forges such a strong personality that
audiences are drawn by the continued excellence of its output. Take
``The Connection'' on WBUR-FM in Boston or the Kendall Square
Cinema in Cambridge, Mass. Not only do they not pander; they lead
their audiences to sample subjects people might not otherwise
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Under Robert Hurwitz, Nonesuch Records has been a similar oasis
of artistic excitement, since 1984. When one picks up a Nonesuch
CD, there is the sense of occasion, the feeling that the artists in
question have been assembled not as an exercise in star power, but
as an exercise in artistic exploration. Even when the results are
disappointing, there isn't a feeling of being shortchanged, because
the label has such a strong record of paying dividends, of opening
doors onto exotic musical landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonesuch began life as a classical label in 1964, with twin
specialties in early music and contemporary composers. Joshua
Rifkin produced two '60s classics. ``The Baroque Beatles Book''
demonstrated the relationship of Beatles melodies to Bach and
Telemann, and ``Piano Rags by Scott Joplin'' sparked renewed
interest in Joplin and ragtime. William Bolcom and Joan Morris also
recorded for the label.
</P>
<P>
   Now both a profitable and prestigious arm of Time Warner,
Nonesuch's current classical roster is a who's who of minimalist
music _ Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and John Adams (though it has
been a pleasure to listen to Adams break out of that category with
his more expansive recent work, like the Violin Concerto and his
latest release, ``Gnarly Buttons''). The Kronos Quartet, which
performs only 20th-century music, records for the label; so does
Richard Goode, playing the traditional piano repertory. They would
seem to have nothing in common with each other, let alone with jazz
guitarist Bill Frisell, classical violinist Gidon Kremer, opera
singer Dawn Upshaw, and Broadway belter Mandy Patinkin.
</P>
<P>
   Or with all the artists in the world-music idiom: Cesaria
Evoria, the Buena Vista Social Club (Ry Cooder's Grammy-winning
mission to Cuba), Radio Tarifa, and one of its most recent
releases, Paolo Conte, a grizzled Italian singer who somehow merges
the sensibilities of Tom Waits, Jerry Lee Lewis, Edith Piaf, and
Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sensibility that unites them, one in which all
these musical categories dissolve not into a Pavarotti-meets-Sting
eclectic emptiness or a Sony Records all-star snooze, but into a
musical world where boundaries between genres stretch and snap.
Where a Gidon Kremer can go to new places with John Adams and then
make such a heartfelt case for tango master Astor Piazzolla as he
has on a pair of CDs. Or a Dawn Upshaw can move so effortlessly
from singing with Richard Goode to collaborating with Mandy
Patinkin.
</P>
<P>
   Hurwitz says that what unites the artists he's signed to
Nonesuch is ``their one-of-a-kindness. There was just one
Piazzolla. He was a complete original. Bill Frisell is the same
kind of an original. Steve Reich and John Adams have such a strong
identity. Those are the people who attracted me ... people like
Richard Goode and John Zorn, who have such a complete and utter
focus in what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Nonesuch releases that makes them almost leap
off the shelves is the handsome packaging. ``All of us who work at
Nonesuch take every detail very seriously,'' said Hurwitz. ``We
want the records to be memorable, that are works of art themselves
and reflect something that made the music special. And that 10
years from now will still look pretty good.'' Each of the CDs since
1995 is enclosed in a cardboard slipcover over the jewelcase, each
with striking artwork. There's Isabel Munoz's sexy
hand-on-bare-back photograph on Kremer's first Piazzolla CD, which
perfectly captures the sensuality of the music within. Roberto
Serra's photographs of Paolo Conte are so evocative you want to
find whatever club he's playing in and bum a cigarette from him.
The covers are so good they can lead you astray. Nonesuch's film
series, with photos from ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' and ``Jules and Jim,'' makes you think the music of
Leonard Rosenman, Alex North, and Georges Delerue is going to be
better than it is. The CD of Toru Takemitsu's film music is more
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Heightening the sense that each CD is an event is the fact that
there are only 20 to 25 releases a year. Each is more a project
than a product off an assembly line. Aside from the film series,
most of the projects yield remarkable results. The Buena Vista
Social Club not only won a Grammy, but anchored a trio of releases
from Cuba, including the Afro-Cuban All Stars and, best of the
three, ``Introducing ... Ruben Gonzalez,'' an 80-year-old Cuban
pianist _ imagine a Duke Ellington of danzon and guaracha making
his first recording.
</P>
<P>
   Nonesuch also has been one of the stellar labels in terms of
Broadway music, restoring George Gershwin's piano rolls and
re-recording his lesser-known musicals like ``Oh, Kay'' and
``Strike Up the Band.'' The most successful Broadway project,
though, was the label's ``Leonard Bernstein's New York'' with
Upshaw, Patinkin, Donna Murphy, Audra McDonald, Judy Blazer, and
Richard Muenz singing music from Bernstein's shows set in New York,
along with selections from his underrated score from ``On the
Waterfront.'' The ``Balcony Scene'' duet between Patinkin and
McDonald (the Tony-winning actress of ``Carousel,'' ``Master
Class,'' and ``Ragtime'' who just finished her first solo CD) is
out of this world, as is Upshaw's ``Somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the individual projects already mentioned,
Frisell's ``Nashville'' is a particularly gorgeous blend of jazz
and country music, and Upshaw's solo CDs erase any barrier between
Broadway and classical music. Patinkin's ``Oscar &AMP; Steve,'' a
salute to Oscar Hammerstein and Stephen Sondheim, as well as his
recent Yiddish CD, ``Mamaloshen,'' are never less than, well,
really something. I still can't tell whether I love or hate ``Bali
Hai,'' and you haven't heard ``White Christmas'' until you've heard
it in Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   As Hurwitz said, each of these artists has a unique voice and
each is allowed to take it, and us, to new musical places. The
dictionary defines ``nonesuch'' as a person or thing without an
equal. Under Hurwitz's direction, the label has lived up to its
name.

`IT TAKES MORE ENERGY TO HATE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If anyone has a right to hate, it's Renee Mullins.
In the early morning hours of June 7, her father, James Byrd Jr.,
was kidnapped, beaten, chained to a pickup and dragged along a
rural road in East Texas until his body disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Jasper found Byrd's remains spread over two
miles. His severed head, neck and right arm were discovered about a
mile from his battered torso. Police believe that Byrd, 49, died
for one reason: He was black.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Mullins have to say about the three whites who have
been charged with the killing? She wants us to pray for them.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins, 27, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee this
week to endorse legislation that would expand federal jurisdiction
over hate crimes. But it was her emotional plea for racial
tolerance that left her audience spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all citizens to pray for these individuals, who have
such low self-esteem and who are so full of fear and hatred that
they are cut out from the happiness of life,'' she told the Senate
panel. ``I've learned from living 27 years _ it takes more energy
to hate than to love.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw the kind of energy that some people devote to hate once
during a college hitchhiking trip from Austin to New Orleans.
Somewhere near the Louisiana border, I got picked up by a Ku Klux
Klansman and his young son. The toddler could barely speak, but his
father proudly demonstrated how the boy's limited vocabulary
included the ``N-word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we hate?'' the father asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``N__'' ... well, you know the rest. I couldn't wait to get out
of the car, but I've often wondered what happened to that kid. Is
he one of the men awaiting trial for Byrd's murder? Could he
possibly have overcome that kind of upbringing? It doesn't seem
likely.
</P>
<P>
   I've been doing a little reading on hate groups lately.
Klanwatch, an organization that monitors racist organizations,
reports that Texas has at least 18 white supremacist groups,
including chapters in Fort Worth and Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Fort Worth groups is the National Alliance, which
spells out its vision for an ``Aryan society'' on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In specific terms,'' the alliance proclaims, ``this means a
society in which young men and women gather to revel with polkas or
waltzes, reels or jigs or any other White dances, but never to
undulate or jerk to negroid jazz or rock rhythms. It means pop
music without Barry Manilow and art galleries without Marc
Chagall.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm no fan of Barry Manilow either, but I don't think Lawrence
Welk is the answer to that problem.
</P>
<P>
   As if that isn't wacky enough, a short time later I got a chance
to read David Duke's views on golfer Tiger Woods. You might
remember Duke. He's the former Klansman who cleaned up his act to
enter politics as a Republican. Neither the Republicans nor the
voters wanted much to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   Duke seems to be spending his time these days worrying about
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the emphasis many put on sports heroes, Woods'
ascendancy in the golf realm will simply add to the myth that most
Blacks are just like us,'' Duke writes in a lengthy essay. ``A
number of White men will be suckered in by a wave of admiration and
emotion for one Black golf player into believing that the Black
race can fit in and do well among the White race. That is simply
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure Mullins would also want us to pray for Duke and
the gang at the National Alliance. In any case, it's pretty clear
who is talking sense and who is talking nonsense.

</P>
<P>
   Millions of American women stepped up to the bathroom mirror
this morning to apply their eye makeup without knowing that the
cosmetics that make those baby blues (or browns or greens) look
beautiful can also do them serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   Although most makeup is completely safe, contaminated or
outdated cosmetics have been known to cause infections capable of
damaging eyesight permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The moment cosmetics are opened for the first time, bacteria
move in and start growing. Most cosmetic products have
preservatives to slow that process, but the bacteria eventually win
out, and a meeting between bacteria and the surface of the eye can
have devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is greatest with mascara, because it's worn the
closest to the eye. Fortunately, protecting yourself requires
following only a few simple precautions recommended by the American
Academy of Ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
   --First, if your eye makeup has been open more than three
months, throw it out and replace it -- especially mascara.
</P>
<P>
   --Second, never share cosmetics with anyone, because you could
be sharing an infection as well.
</P>
<P>
   --Third, opt for hypoallergenic products and disposable
applicators wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   --And fourth, if you do develop an eye infection, throw out all
your old makeup -- contaminated cosmetics could re-infect you.
</P>
<P>
   Contact lens wearers need to exercise extra care when using
cosmetics, because some products can damage eyes and lenses. Use
only water-based mascara -- avoid mascaras labeled
``lash-building'' or ``guaranteed waterproof'' because they contain
rayon or nylon fibers that can fall into the eye, slip under a
contact lens and injure the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing can happen with frosted or iridescent eye shadows
-- they contain ground oyster shells and tinsel. Avoid them, and
generally speaking, don't buy makeup that may not have been
thoroughly tested for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Your morning makeup-and-lens routine can be critical, too. Use
hair spray and other aerosols first, and wait for the mist to clear
before inserting your contacts. Put your lenses in before applying
your makeup, and take them out before removing it.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with eyeliner and don't apply it inside the lower
lashes. Apply face powder gently to keep it away from your eyes.
And throughout the process, wash your hands with a pure,
additive-free bar soap.
</P>
<P>
   One final safety tip -- don't put on your makeup in the car,
even if you're not driving. One abrupt stop or pothole could mean a
painful meeting between a mascara brush and your eye -- and a trip
to the ophthalmologist.
</P>

HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't been that long since Liza Weil was a high school
student, not unlike Anna Stockard, the character she plays in the
new film ``Whatever.'' Like Anna, who aspires to leave her New
Jersey hometown to study art in New York, Weil also had fond dreams
of an acting career in the big city, leaving behind her suburban
Pennsylvania home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to go to New York and get out of suburbia, but
I fell into that whole self-sabotage, `protect-me-from-what-I-want'
syndrome that I think all seniors in high school do,'' Weil said.
``My high school experience was similar to Anna's, so when I read
the script for the first time, I was like, `Man, I messed up for a
reason. I'm the only person who can do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' which opens Friday, is Susan Skoog's unsentimental
film about the volatile cusp between adolescence and adulthood, and
about high school, a period once described by writer Susan Sontag
as ``the most important experience of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Anna is 17 going on 18, a twitchy teenager moving
with uncertainty toward young womanhood as she discovers life's
rough edges. She has her sights set on Cooper Union, the
prestigious Greenwich Village art school, and is encourged by a
caring teacher (Frederic Forrest). But she's torn between
dedicating herself to her art and slashing and burning through her
senior year with her hell-raising best friend, Brenda (played by
Chad Morgan). At home, Anna is often at odds with her mother
(Kathryn Rossetter), a single parent who drinks a little too much,
spends time with unworthy men, but works to provide for Anna and
her younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first realistic look at what goes on with
adolescent girls in high school that I've ever seen,'' Weil said in
an interview during a publicity stop in Boston. ``There's been a
bunch of coming-of-age movies which have touched on some of these
things, but I was really impressed that an independent filmmaker
was so daring in tackling these issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for teenage girls to see these things happen to
people, and what they're going through in high school is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Skoog set her film in the early 1980s, a time when Blondie and
the Pretenders spilled from radios, a time before AIDS and crack
bum-rushed the party. Not coincidentally, those were the years when
Skoog attended high school _ Red Bank Regional High, class of '82.
The film is set in her New Jersey hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But the film also has a timeless quality as relevant today as
when Pat Benatar was considered a fashion icon. And Skoog wanted to
make a film that looked at those years with gravity and realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major porthole, it's the end of your childhood,'' Skoog
said. ``You're leaving home, you're legal. I really felt like there
hadn't been a film that accurately depicted high school, the way I
saw it. There are a lot of people who fall between the cracks. Most
of us are not prom queens. And most coming-of-age films tend to
deal with boys, and I really hadn't seen a film which accurately
dealt with girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments are shared by Weil, 21. She grew up watching
films like ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``The Breakfast Club,'' where
the greatest challenge of adolescence was usually finding a date
for the prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were good for so many reasons, but I think they cause
complexes in many teenagers. You're going through high school and
you're wondering, `Uh, when's the guy in the Corvette going to pick
me up and make me a birthday cake?''' said Weil, recalling the
fanciful coda of ``Sixteen Candles,'' where Molly Ringwald finally
bags the hunky object of her desire, Michael Schoeffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start feeling insecure and developing this whole
self-image problem, like, `How come there are no guys who look 28,
and are really articulate?''' she said. ``Teenagers really don't
talk things out in real life. You see these `Dawson's Creek'
teenagers who are so articulate, and talking about every problem
imaginable, but the truth is teenagers don't have the skills to
talk about things that upset them. I think Susan really captured
that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Skoog also captures is the rawness of adolescence, one of
the last times in our lives when we react without a moment's
thought about consequences. The teenagers in ``Whatever'' freely
engage in sexual activity, drink copious amounts of alcohol, snort
drugs, and cuss like longshoremen. Already, Skoog has heard
rumblings from those primed to condemn such portrayals of teen
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's realistic. Kids do drugs. When I was in high school,
cocaine started to come down from the city,'' she said. ``It's
naive to think this doesn't exist, and I think it's better to show
it and deal with it. The film does not glamorize drug use in any
way, and parents should see movies like this to see what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil's parents have already seen the film. Both were supportive
of their daughter's desire to act, which comes somewhat naturally,
since Weil's father was part of a comedy troupe, the Madhouse
Company of London, in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief period when Weil considered becoming an
archeologist (``In fifth grade I was really mesmerized by the
Indiana Jones movies, and the way Harrison Ford looked in his khaki
pants and his crackled skin, but now I realize that was some latent
sexual fantasy,'' she quipped), she always wanted to be an actress.
When she was in high school, her parents would allow her to miss
classes to attend acting auditions in New York _ much to the
chagrin of family friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought my parents were nuts,'' she said. ``I wasn't a
good student, and their friends were like, `I can't believe you're
letting her leave school early to go to New York for auditions.'
But (my parents) knew that that was the only thing I was good at,
and it was the only thing that made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Weil moved to New York, working odd jobs
between auditions. ``Whatever'' marks her feature debut. It's also
Skoog's directorial debut. Before turning to film, Skoog was a
writer, producer, and director for such networks as TNT, MTV, VH1,
CBS, and Turner Classic Movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to make films and ended up in TV,'' she said.
``I didn't go to film school, so that was like my film school.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Skoog's film is receiving praise for its gritty look at
high school life. Weil, who made the film when she was 19 and just
a year out of school, said: ``If I saw the film in high school I
would have done a lot of things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people relate to it. People really seem to be
affected by it and touched by it, and that's very cool. A lot of
people come up to me and say, `That's my life.'''

WHY ARE GOLF BALLS DIMPLED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do golf balls have dimples?
</P>
<P>
   B.K., Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Thank the old Featheries and Gutties for the dimples on golf
balls. Featheries were the first balls used, 500 or 600 years ago.
They were little more than a two-seamed leather sack stuffed with
feathers. Around 1870, a natural gum discovered in Malaysia was
fashioned into the first Guttie, a smooth ball that sank like a
rock compared with the old Featherie.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged duffers eventually discovered, however, that the
more nicked and scratched their Gutties got, the farther they
traveled. So manufacturers started making them with all kinds of
cuts and grooves and lumps. And then in 1908, businessman William
Taylor patented the Bramble pattern of dimples.
</P>
<P>
   Since then we've learned why the dimples work. A golf ball in
flight is doing a couple things to the air around it. It's making
air pass over and under it, but it's also creating a partial vacuum
in its wake as it displaces the air it's forcing out of its path.
And because the ball is moving so fast, the air traveling over and
under it can't immediately fill the vaccum just behind the ball.
That makes the pressure against the ball high at the front, and
lower at the back. The ball favors the path of least resistance,
which is backwards. That's called drag, and it slows the ball's
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Aoyala of the Titleist Company in Fairhaven, Mass. says
dimples stir up the air passing over the skin of the ball in
flight. That turbulence allows more air to tumble in behind the
ball, helping fill that partial vacuum and cutting the drag in
half.
</P>
<P>
   Aoyala proudly points out that the golf ball is the most highly
engineered ball in sports. Its dimple patterns include 20-faced
icosahedrons and cuboctahedrons, the shape you'd get if you cut the
corners off a cube.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the lava in lava lamps?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. All those fascinating bloops and gloops are made of wax. But
not just any wax, says Garret Kaess, chief chemist for Haggerty
Enterprises, which refers to itself as ``Lava World.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix involves chlorinated paraffins with six ingredients, but
he won't say much more, because the formula is a trade secret.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  British scientist and inventor Walter Craven developed the
formula in the early 1960s. But he didn't know Jimi Hendrix was
right around the corner, and sold it to the Haggerty family in
1965. Then along came the drug culture and Lava Lamps became a
cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the water in which the waxy blobs float around is a
special concoction as well. Chemicals called surfactants reduce
surface tension and let the blobs of melted wax break apart and
squish back together just right. They also keep the wax _ the
``lava'' _ from sticking to the sides of the bottle. Other
substances called chelating agents keep the water clear. Glycols
alter the specific gravity of the water to allow the wax to float
when it's heated by the 40-watt light bulb in the base and the
heat-transfer coil built into the bottom of the glass bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kaess says the brew is nearly identical to anti-freeze, only
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The waxy blob moves around because heating it makes it less
dense, causing it to float. As it rises, away from the heat, it
cools, condenses, and sinks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the dyes for each of the 25 colors change the specific
gravity of the lava,subtle changes have to be made to the amount of
chlorines added to the wax and to the formula of the water, so each
color blobs around just right.
</P>
<P>
   Devoted Lava Lamp lovers (or people with enough time on their
hands to spend hours watching their lamps) might wonder why the
lava seems to go from a see-through translucent to a more milky
opaque after the lamp has been on for the first couple days. The
expanding and contracting wax slowly absorbs a little water, about
half a percent, which clouds things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on trying to cure that,'' Kaess says. The
milkiness seems to dampen the experience for the most hardcore lava
lamp fans.
</P>

<P>
   Though parents often encourage their children by lauding good
grades and high test scores, such praise actually may leave
youngsters ill-equipped to deal with setbacks, new research
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 412 fifth-graders, psychologists at Columbia
University in New York found that children complimented for
intelligence rather than for effort when they performed well
academically tended to place greater importance on grades than on
learning or mastering new skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's believed that praising a child's traits _ such as
intelligence _ will create greater self-esteem and make them feel
productive and what we're showing is that [such praise] can
backfire,'' said lead study author Carol S. Dweck, a professor of
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praising children's intelligence, far from boosting their
self-esteem, encourages them to embrace self-defeating behaviors,
such as worrying about failure and avoiding risks,'' Dweck said.
</P>
<P>
   Children should be commended for hard work, which encourages
them to seek out strategies to enhance their performance, Dweck and
her colleague Claudia M. Mueller reported in the July issue of the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Children in the study were divided into groups that were given
different forms of praise. For example, after a good performance,
one group was told ``you must be really smart'' after a good grade,
while the other group was told ``you must have worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Most children who had their intelligence praised wanted to
continue looking smart and were more reluctant to take on greater
challenges, Dweck said. However, nearly all of those given
encouragement for hard work and effort were motivated to learn new
things even when the tasks were highly challenging, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, children who concentrated on grades lost enjoyment when
learning new things that could potentially make them look ``dumb.''
Such learning remained enjoyable for those who did not concentrate
on grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone cares about grades and should to some extent. But the
question remains, is that all you should care about,'' Dweck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be some risk for children if the predominant
or only form of praise is for academic accomplishments. There can
be devastating results if they experience failure,'' commented
Peter Goldenthal, a clinical and family psychologist in Wayne, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea would be to do both. Praise your child for their
accomplishments, but when you do that make them know that failure
is possible and that they should learn from it,'' Goldenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Verbal praise is very powerful and one of the implications of
the study is if it is too narrowly focused or applied, for some
children it might be upsetting if they cannot perform to the
standards of that praise,'' he said.

CABLE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO SPECIALIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: ``style.'' with lc s and . is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The cable industry has made it clear that the
future of television continues to be in specialization.
</P>
<P>
   TV critics here for the semiannual press tour ovr the weekend
were deluged with previews of new shows by everything from the
Travel Channel, Animal Planet, and the Golf Channel to the Game
Show Network, the Cartoon Network, and Home &AMP; Garden Television.
Lee Masters, the president and CEO of E! Entertainment Television,
took the weekend as an opportunity to introduce yet another new
corner of the TV universe called ``style.,'' a hip companion
network to E! that will restrict itself to fashion, dining out, and
home decorating when it launches in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of cable, what seemed like ridiculous hype
predicted that someday we would be able to choose from among a
thousand channels, each devoted to a narrowly defined subject. But
that possibility no longer seems far-fetched. And as Larry W.
Jones, general manager of Nick at Nite and TV Land, reminded
critics that Nick is strictly for classic sitcoms while TV Land
also programs old dramas like ``St. Elsewhere,'' the
thousand-channel future seemed to be waiting around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most promising cable programming due in the coming
months will be on the fast-growing VH1. The network began in 1985
as an older cousin to MTV, and by the early 1990s it was viewed as
a creative failure. But in 1994, with a savvy new president, John
Sykes, at the helm, VH1 began to find its identity as an
authoritative and yet playful channel for fans of rock 'n' roll
history. And now, with signature series like ``Behind the Music,''
``Storytellers,'' ``Pop-Up Video,'' and ``Legends,'' VH1 has
surpassed MTV as the place to look for exposure to and insight into
music culture. ``Music is really at the heart and soul of
everything that we do at VH1,'' Sykes noted, inadvertently pointing
up the problem with MTV's gimmick-heavy programming lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Forthcoming VH1 series includes a comedy called ``Vinyl
Justice,'' which follows the investigations of a pair of ``music
policemen'' who bust people _ some of them famous _ for bad taste.
Imagine an officer writing out a violation for driving under the
influence of Wham!, and you've got the picture. Another new series,
``Video Timeline,'' will illustrate music videos with archival
footage, interviews, and irreverent onscreen graphics in the manner
of ``Pop-Up Video.'' VH1 also announced the formation of a TV-movie
wing already developing a documentary by Oscar-winning director
Barbara Kopple called ``Trouble Girls: Women in Rock,'' as well as
a fictional film about an imagined meeting between Paul McCartney
and John Lennon in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In order to promote ``Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys and Their
Music,'' a two-hour special premiering on Aug. 23, VH1 brought in a
tired-looking Brian Wilson for a question-and-answer session. The
former Beach Boy, famous for his personal ups and downs, was
particularly enigmatic when asked why he has been so fragile
through the years: ``I think the Christmas carol `Joy to the World'
must have bent me out of shape a little bit,'' he said, ``and of
course my whole life was given over to God as soon as I heard that.
So in a way I can't be blamed for being a little more sensitive
than usual.'' Wilson said he ``got in contact with that Christmas
carol'' in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   HBO introduced its new movies, most notably a pair of timely
biopics. ``Winchell,'' due in November, stars Stanley Tucci as the
man many blame for the dangerous power of gossip in the media.
``The Rat Pack,'' which airs August 22, stars Ray Liotta as Frank
Sinatra, Joe Mantegna as Dean Martin, and Don Cheadle as Sammy
Davis Jr.
</P>
<P>
   While Tina Sinatra refused to authorize the project or allow use
of Sinatra's music, John Matoian, president of HBO Pictures, said,
``Hopefully when Tina sees it, I believe she'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Matoian package the movie to air on the heals of Sinatra's
death? ``I'm not that good,'' he said. ``And I'm not that bad
either!''

PATRICE O'NEAL TRIES TO MAKE IT BIG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrice O'Neal is killing. The packed house at the US Comedy
Festival in Aspen is rolling with laughter as O'Neal punctuates the
smoky air inside the Aspen Sports Club with a delivery as crisp and
clear as the Rocky Mountains just beyond the door.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 350-pound African-American is doing a routine
about an Eastern European gymnast, in which he imitates the voice
of Nadia Comaneci. It's a hilarious piece, made all the more so by
the contradiction between O'Neal's very visible physical presence
and that of the young, tiny white girl he's playing. He segues to
the false presumption among obsese people that there's some kind of
bond between them because of their weight. He closes with the
following: ``I get a lot of fat strangers coming up to me thanking
me for representing them. Like we have some sort of fat bond.
Represent who? Fat people? I don't want to lead fat people nowhere.
What are we going to do? We going to have a march? A Million Pound
March. What are we going to do? We're going to march and we're
going to rest, like I'm some sort of Malcolm XXL.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though many of his jokes are funny, it's not the joke that
makes the comedy: It's the jokester.
</P>
<P>
   Patrice O'Neal _ named after the hero of Congolese liberation,
Patrice Lumumba _ was brought up in Roxbury, was one of just a
handful of comics, and the only one from Boston, invited to perform
at this year's festival in March. This is a setting where the
stakes are as high as they get for a comic. Kelsey Grammer, Dennis
Miller, Bill Maher, John Cleese and the Python crew, and the kids
from ``South Park'' are all here, all competing for attention. And
this crowd's attention is worth getting. There's Bernie Brillstein,
partnered with Brad Grey in Brillstein-Grey, producers of ``The
Garry Shandling Show.'' A few seats over is legendary comedy-club
owner and starmaker Budd Friedman. A talent scout from HBO lingers
at the back of the room. O'Neal has about 12 minutes to prove a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   He's already proven he's funny. People are laughing. But there's
more to this game than the laughs. Funny doesn't always do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business,'' says O'Neal, 28, the next day. ``They are
businessmen looking for business. And comics are the commodities
for their business. You either fit as a commodity or you don't. And
I'm a 350-pound man in a business run by short white guys. That's
the way it is.'' O'Neal is a comedian, but he's not smiling.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, O'Neal was working as a bouncer at
Estelle's, a Boston nightclub, when he started getting into it with
a professional comic. The performer challenged O'Neal to come up
onstage if he thought he could do better. O'Neal did. He was. And
that's when the man who, by his own count, has held more than 70
different jobs found the one he seems born to.
</P>
<P>
   But as O'Neal expected, it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   O`Neal started in Boston, bouncing from club to club looking for
more than five minutes and $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got to be better, many of the Boston club owners
continued to put me in with people I didn't belong with,'' he says.
``And when I got a bit better and was bringing in some people, I
would get screwed with the money. You know, promised $1,000 and get
$900. It just (ticked) me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it also have to do with race?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal stares, suggesting only an idiot wouldn't know the
obvious answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say hello to all the black comedians in Boston,''
he responds. ``Hello, Dwayne'' _ referring to Dwayne Perkins, the
only locally based black comic of note.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying O'Neal's sense of frustration is a sense of justice
misapplied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was funny because the audience was laughing,'' he
says. ``I didn't need anybody to tell me things were going good.
But I couldn't get anywhere here. So I left. Sometimes you don't
get any respect unless you leave town and then come back.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who now lives in the New York area, is back home, with
his mother. ``Things are going along pretty much as I expected,''
says O'Neal, while sitting on his mother's couch, a few feet away
from a computer and a gold-framed copy of the lyrics to ``Amazing
Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be making more money if I wanted to play a fat guy
eating a hamburger in some commercial, or doing a sequel to `Fat
Albert' _ but what's that? Sure, I'd like the money to get my
mother some things. Move her to Arizona. But the money will come
eventually. Most of the money is in the TV and movie thing, but it
takes away from what I'm trying to do. They pimp you into what they
want you to be in movies and TV, but I'm not interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth going to Aspen, making contacts that could help?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he says. ``Everyone's always giving you
advice. The head of Fox wants this, and another guy says I swear
too much. I had TV material before I was ready for TV, and now that
I'm ready for TV, my material isn't suitable. It's too edgy. And
I'm not going to tone it down. I'm not going to pretend I'm someone
I'm not just to get on TV. Someone else says I could go further
this way or that way. If you listen to all that ... it'll drive you
nuts. What makes it even more difficult is that this is how you
have to make your money. But you have to stay focused. I could be
famous by now if I was eating hamburgers in commercials and
smiling. But the world is not a smiling world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many comics are in a hurry. They want big money and they want it
now. ``It's hard not to envy someone else when they've got $750,000
in the bank,'' says O'Neal. ``I've waited this long. If I have to,
I'll wait some more.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal pauses as his mother enters the room. He smiles. She
wants him to do the Malcolm XXL routine, but Patrice is not in the
mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about anybody can get up onstage and tell jokes,'' he
says. ``That's one thing. But I am my work. I am funny. I'm not
trying to be funny. I'm passionate about it. When I'm up there it's
my soul on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal recalls a recent show in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where only
20 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great show,'' he says. ``I did an hour and 10
minutes and I could see it in their faces. I was moving people. I
didn't need any flutes or buzzers or balloons. Just talking. I
could see it in their faces. You can't want it and you can't plan
it. You just got to do your work.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wipes the heat of the day off his forehead with a
washcloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be put in the category of funny as much as I
want to be put in the category of respect,'' he says. ``I want to
be like (George) Carlin or (Richard) Pryor. The place where you can
be an artist and maintain your love for it and still make the
money. That's where I'll be.''

   US-JAPAN _WASHINGTON _ Monday's resignation by Japanense Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, nine days before a planned state visit
to the White House, left world stock markets and the Clinton
administration scrambling to assess whether Japan's next government
would accelerate reforms needed to lift Japan's lifeless economy
and prevent it from dragging down global growth. On first blush,
the White House said it expects the next prime minister _ as yet
unamed _ to move quickly to cut taxes, shore up the country's
ailing banking system and invigorate consumer spending, measures
long resisted by Tokyo. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   IRAN-COKE _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Coca Cola might be an American icon,
symbol of what some people here still call ``Great Satan,'' but the
name has not turned them off from buying the drink _ or at least
the bottles. Despite three-year-old U.S. sanctions against trade
with Iran, Tehran is flush with Coca Cola ads and bottles. The
drink inside, however, isn't Coke. The bottles are a controversial
hold over from before the sanctions and Iranians are mixing their
own local mix. The bottles, the popular cola and the controversy
illustrate the love-hate relationship between this country an the
United States, as well as the complications that arise when
sanctions interrupt the world-wide thirst for American products.
Iranians know it's not the American drink, but they don't mind
asking for it by the brand name. ``We have been using Coke since
before the (1979) revolution,'' said restaurant owner Hassan
Alvandi, dismissing the court and political battles that have
swirled around the product. ``That's just politics. We have never
disliked it.'' Ironically, the company that brought Coke back to
Iran in the early 1990's is now in a legal battle with the cola
producer. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   SAN ANTONIO _ The world's greatest man turns 80 years old
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, it would have been deemed improbable that Nelson
Mandela would celebrate his 80th birthday while serving as the
first democratically elected president of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   His destiny, it seemed, was to die as the most famous political
prisoner in the world, a man lionized by millions worldwide who
looked to him as South Africa's messiah.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, already serving time for incitement, Mandela was
convicted of treason, a charge that England could have made against
George Washington and that any totalitarian government can level
against those attempting to overthrow it in favor of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's foe was apartheid, an instrument of hate that made
South Africa the most systematically racist country in world
history.
</P>
<P>
   Like Socrates on trial in Athens, Mandela used the courtroom as
a platform. He condemned the government of South Africa and the
immorality of apartheid while advocating justice and democracy.
Sentenced to life in prison, Mandela didn't disappear from the
conscience of his country or the world.
</P>
<P>
   As South Africa spiraled into what seemed an inevitable and
cataclysmic blood bath, three words became a mantra of hope: ``Free
Nelson Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mandela had died in prison, entombed in legend, he would have
been a tantalizing ``what if?'' to history while South Africa
consumed itself in its rage.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 11, 1990, as he left prison, Mandela walked out of
the mists of mythology and onto the stage of history. From that
point on, the greatness that had only been heard and read about
became evident.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years he was imprisoned as the most visible symbol of a
cruel and brutal regime, one that wouldn't allow him to attend the
funerals of his mother and oldest son. Yet Mandela didn't allow his
suffering to embitter him nor blur his vision for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from prison unbowed, a warrior still in possession of
his dignity and graciousness. He proved himself not to be a
fire-breathing demagogue, but a pragmatic statesman devoted to
nation-building.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel, who
also journeyed from prison to the presidency, no head of state
comes close to matching Mandela's moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the dock during his 1964 trial, Mandela concluded
his address to the court with these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in
which all persons live together in harmony and with equal
opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to
achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideals didn't die and neither has the man. Happy Birthday,
Nelson Mandela, and many more.

TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME? NOT JUST YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things are looking good for major-league baseball, the experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is improving; TV ratings are up; superstars such as
Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Juan Gonzalez are on pace to
shatter long-standing batting records. Even last week's All-Star
Game was an entertaining spectacle _ and baseball's All-Star Game
can be as boring an event as a big-league sport can inflict on its
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of great stuff happening on the field,''
broadcaster Bob Costas told USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   And off the field? Would you believe that the team owners
finally named a commissioner after nearly six years of
procrastination?
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is, the permanent commissioner is the same guy
who's been serving as interim commissioner: Milwaukee Brewers owner
Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   This is the very same Bud Selig who called off the 1994 World
Series because of the ``labor dispute'' that spurred so many fans
of the national pastime to seek out other forms of amusement. The
owners are apparently feeling so confident _ arrogant? _ that they
had no qualms about choosing as a figurehead for baseball a man who
personifies the greatest insult ever perpetrated by the game upon
its fans.
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever wonder how people this stupid got as rich as they
are?
</P>
<P>
   It was the arrogance, stupidity and greed of owners and players
alike that prompted many fans to turn their backs on baseball _
some of us going so far as to boycott the sport that we once
followed fervently. My own boycott dates back to a 1990 ``labor
dispute'' that disrupted spring training; the '94 strike merely
intensified my disgust.
</P>
<P>
   With all the exciting developments in baseball this season, I
guess it's lucky for me that I recently modified the rules of
engagement in my personal war against baseball. I still refuse to
attend games or contribute in any way to the bankrolls of owners
and players, but I now permit myself to watch baseball on
television and read about baseball in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I simply decided that avoiding baseball telecasts and news
accounts wasn't punishing anyone but me, which seemed rather
self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, now that I'm free to watch baseball, I find that
I'm not particularly interested in doing so. I've watched only two
games plus a few stray innings here and there.
</P>
<P>
   I'll probably watch more games as the season progresses and the
record-chases heat up. A Mark McGwire home run is an amazing thing
to see, no matter how fed up you might be with a sport that seems
to thrive on mistreating its devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McGwire seems like a decent guy. He's modest and
unassuming on the field _ he actually apologized to the fans for a
sub-par performance in the home-run contest held in conjunction
with the All-Star Game. Off the field, McGwire contributes
considerable time and money to the battle against child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is likewise said to be a good citizen, although the fans
had to badger him into taking part in the homer contest _ which he
won, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be booed,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Good for him. Most of these overpaid, overpraised characters
seem to go out of their way to do things that provoke booing _ and
worse _ by people whose far more natural inclination is to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of baseball are unique among sports fans in their
willingness to endure abuse and disappointment. Many remain loyal,
year and year, decade after decade, to losing teams _ even to
losing teams whose management makes no apparent effort to turn them
into winners.
</P>
<P>
   For baseball fans to abandon the sport and the teams they love,
as they have in recent years, they had to be antagonized beyond the
tolerance of the most tolerant of constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the experts say, the fans are coming back. The
excitement of the game and the appeal of positive role models such
as McGwire and Griffey are erasing the disillusionment engendered
by the '94 strike and other insults.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, well, I'm not coming back _ not yet, anyway. I can't
shake this nagging feeling that some new insult might be just
around the corner.

FORMING A DUO WITH A CHILDHOOD IDOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 30 years ago, when he was turning 8 or 9, Scott Moss
got a Peter and Gordon LP for his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who grew up in the Fort Worth area, was just another kid
smitten with the Beatles and all-things-British invasion, just
another dreamer who learned how to play an instrument (in his case,
bass) by listening to Beatles records over and over between bouts
of dad knocking on the door and telling him to turn that danged
noise down.
</P>
<P>
   Only difference is, Moss kept at it. Year after year after year
he kept on, in cover bands like the Werewolves in the '70s. And in
the '80s he was with the Slicks, who did originals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other people put their guitars and their dreams away
for good.
</P>
<P>
   And one fine day about three months ago in Los Angeles, a mutual
friend introduced him to Gordon Waller, one half of Peter and
Gordon _ and suddenly Moss found himself sitting in Waller's garage
singing with one of his idols and playing a guitar John Lennon had
once owned.
</P>
<P>
   Ironies don't get much more delicious _ not if you're still a
staunch Beatles/Brit invasion fanatic, and not if you're
determined, at age 43, to still make it in the music business.
Which Moss is.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the odds, he just might. Already he has cut a
five-song demo tape of strongly melodic pop that often compares
favorably with the Beatles, Peter and Gordon and Badfinger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he and Waller have teamed up to form Moss, which will
hit a number of Metroplex clubs in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And while they're in the area they'll go to a Dallas studio to
finish up nine more songs with an eye toward shopping the entire
14-song CD to labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, my head spins,'' says Moss, who
graduated from L.D. Bell in 1973 and whose other area bands in the
'70s and '80s included Wish, Flight and The Artist. ``It's like
getting on a train that's moving very fast. Gordon wanted to play,
and I said, `Let's go back to Texas.' We're going to do a set of my
material and a set of Peter and Gordon's hits, `A World Without
Love,' `Lady Godiva,' `I Go to Pieces,' stuff all the classic rock
stations play. He hasn't toured in 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Moss the man hasn't played live very much in a good long
while, either. By the mid-'90s, he had ``saturated the market'' in
the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd done everything I could do here,'' he says. ``It was time
to move on, but I didn't know how or where.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he met Ashlie Rhey, a model/actress and longtime Los
Angeles resident. He moved to LA to be with her three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with an acoustic guitar and 15 cassette tapes of
material,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He began to restart his career, looking for management and a
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird in LA,'' he says. ``I've played live all my life,
but here your tapes and your resume do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago he hooked up with producer Scott Mathews and began
flying back to Texas to cut songs, with help from well-known local
guitarists Andy Timmons and Johnny Red.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's old yet new _ I don't want to put a label on it,'' he
says of his music. ``I've stuck to one sound, one avenue _ hooks
and melody and a lot of harmonies, keeping it pretty simple. The
more simple it is means the easier it is for people to adjust to it
and like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, really, this stuff is pretty easy to like: Layers of
acoustic and electric guitars, bright production, sweet harmonies,
catchy choruses, and so on. One song, ``If You Don't Mind,'' is
particuarly Beatlesesque, but all five songs are impressive _
ageless-sounding, friendly and well-played. A Beatles fan looking
for something new to listen to could do a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   From here, Moss says, ``We want to finish the album and secure a
deal and go to the next phase _ take it on the road on a more
national level. I'm grateful for this _ not many people get what
they dream for. As far as stardom, that don't mean nothin' anymore.
It's about getting to do what you enjoy doing _ but this time,
getting paid for it. That's a nice change.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ It needed special permission from an Ayatollah,
overcame threats from anti-American hard-liners and faced a
three-year-old U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that icon of Americana, the Coca-Cola bottle, is a common
sight next to the kabobs and rice on Iranian dinner tables.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink inside, however, isn't Coca-Cola _ a fact that
does not bother thirsty Iranians but has officials with
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. seeking relief in Tehran's courts.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy highlights the contradictions between the two
countries' opposing governments and the personal attraction
Iranians have to American products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been using Coke since before the (1979) revolution,''
said restaurant owner Hassan Alvandi, dismissing court and
political battles that have swirled around the product. ``That's
just politics. We have never disliked it.''
</P>
<P>
   This hot Iranian summer, the conveyor belts at the immaculate
Noushab bottling plant here are running overtime to turn out nearly
50,000 cases a day filled with Coca-Cola bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Limited by small production, it's a minor share of the market.
But many prefer Noushab's product over that served up from the
quasi-government owned Parsi Cola and Zam Zam.
</P>
<P>
   Finer restaurants and groceries have trouble keeping Coca-Cola
bottles in stock, even though the bottle caps and the delivery
trucks carry different names indicating that both Noushab and
customers could care less that the cola inside is not Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The bottles _ 22 million Coke and Fanta bottles _ are left over
from Noushab's pre-embargo contract with Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Arsalan Namdar, chairman of Tehran-based Noushab, brought
Coca-Cola back to Iran in the early 1990s, after a lengthy absence
following the 1979 Islamic revolution and Iranian hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Returning such a classic western product was not easy in a
country where some officials call the United States the ``Great
Satan.'' Hard-line conservatives threatened to burn down the
bottling plant. Namdar eventually had to get special permission
from the late Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, the Noushab relationship with the Coca-Cola
Co. soured quickly in fights over management and advertising _
Namdar said he wanted a low-key debut and Coca-Cola wanted glitz.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. officials decided to isolate Iran for its support of
international terrorism in 1995, they imposed a strict trade
embargo that prohibited American companies from operating there.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola severed its relationship with Noushab, but, according
to Namdar, the companies fought over money and old promises that
had been agreed to in the contracts. Iranian courts are now looking
over Noushab's claims against Coca-Cola and the company's trademark
protest against Noushab.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, in compliance with the embargo, does not supply any
more ingredients. But Noushab still has the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Namdar said the company will eventually replace the bottles with
its own. Meanwhile, an Iranian court allowed Noushab to continue
using the Coca-Cola bottles, but required it to run a media
campaign telling consumers that the soft drink in the bottles is
not really Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign seems to have worked. Several Iranian soft drink
consumers interviewed here recently knew they were drinking an
Iranian soft drink. They said they still liked it better, in part
because the new bottling plant has kept the bottles clean and free
of the bugs and dirt found in other drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. officials in Atlanta, however, say that Noushab is
violating the soft drink maker's famous trademark. The company is
appealing the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we stand for is put at risk when you put something
other than Coca-Cola in one of our bottles,'' said Randy Donaldson,
a Coca-Cola vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He said a bad product could damage the company's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The fight has become nasty. Noushab has accused Coca-Cola of, at
one point, violating the U.S. trade embargo by shipping ingredients
to a rival bottler that had a part of the bottling contract.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denies that, alleging that Noushab is passing around a
fake Coca-Cola company document.
</P>
<P>
   Namdar complains that Coca-Cola has not been so tough on the
other bottler, called Khoshgavar, which is also using old Coca-Cola
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said company had no knowledge of Khoshgavar still
using the Coca-Cola name, and would inquire.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while the companies fight over the name, most
Iranians are not concerned. Far from their image as anti-American
zealots, they are a pragmatic people who get the U.S. products they
like, despite the embargo, through third countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care,'' 67-year-old Sadighe Karami said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the all-black cape and scarf required by Muslim
modesty laws, she was about to split four so-called Coca-Colas with
her family in a Tehran park. ``It's not a bad thing. We don't get
poisoned by it.''

DON'T GET RICH IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's Socialist-led government is extending a wealth
tax, introduced a decade ago, to include the estimated value of
individuals' art collections and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The rich also will no longer be able to write off bad loans they
or their enterprises make against their wealth-tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   The law declares that people with assets of $750,000 are
officially wealthy and those with that amount must pay yearly taxes
not only on their income but also on the capital they hold _
defined as savings, personal and real property and corporate shares
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 200,000 men and women fall into the category of the
officially rich here. So the tax of 1.5 percent doesn't bring in a
great deal of money. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said it
yielded $40 million in revenue in 1997, and there is no official
estimate of what the government will net from the extended tax.
</P>
<P>
   However, bringing in cash to the treasury is not the tax's real
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Americans, most French people don't expect to emulate the
wealthy and become successful themselves. Instead, they want those
better off than they are to be brought down a peg or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional issue,'' conservative member of parliament
Jean-Luc Vincent told the Paris newspaper Le Figaro. ``The French
are happiest when they see the rich being forced to pay stiff
taxes. Their instinctive belief is that the rich got where they are
by more or less illicit means, so they should be made to surrender
much if not all of their ill-gotten gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent noted that the 19th century French socialist
philosopher, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, argued that ``property is
theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has shown little
enthusiasm for extending the wealth tax, emphasizing that the
business community should not be frightened off at a time when
France is eagerly seeking investment to encourage economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But Jospin is in a corner. His government depends for its
majority on 40 Communist members of Parliament who demand the tax
in the name of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ```Soak the rich' has always been a left-wing battle cry here,''
historian Olivier Weiner explained. ``It has been justified to the
extent that, historically, the French capitalist class has been
extraordinarily selfish and short-sighted. The problem is that the
left regards capital as a source for the redistribution of wealth,
not as a source for creating more wealth on behalf of the nation as
a whole.''

   The current campaign to impose the wealth tax more widely began
when it was revealed that financier Francois Pinault, rated among
this country's richest people, lowered his tax bill by using a
loophole in the law. It allowed him to write off a large loan made
by his company.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Pinault owns a valuable art collection, which
will now be taxed annually as part of his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Other art collectors face similar taxation, as do owners of
antique furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably,'' Weiner said, ``a fiscal system is being built
that will make it virtually impossible for even a portion of
France's cultural heritage to survive outside of museums.''

PARK SERVICE TO GET SOME HELP IN RECONNECTING HISTORIC MISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may take an act of Congress to ease problems
plaguing a centuries-old route connecting five missions that
Franciscan priests built along the San Antonio River.
</P>
<P>
   The river was a natural thoroughfare that linked the five
shelters and their communities. But 267 years after the last
mission was built, access to the historical sites is impeded by
streets and man-made impediments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of people who get lost,'' said Steve
Whitesell, superintendent of the San Antonio Missions National
Historical Park. To help clear up the confusion, lawmakers have
slipped $2.2 million into spending bills to improve access to the
park and provide a partial face lift for some of the artifacts at
the four missions the National Park Service administers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not pork. Not even a little bit,'' Whitesell said.
``Some of the oldest historic features in the state of Texas are
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians agree. The San Antonio missions, they say, are the
essence of the region and its culturally diverse heritage.
Franciscans spent 13 years building the stone shelters to protect
early pioneers from Indian attacks. The Alamo was built in 1718,
followed by Mission San Jose in 1720 and the completion of Espada,
Concepcion and San Juan in 1731.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo, owned by the state and operated by the Daughters of
the Republic of Texas, is not part of the national park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missions are really the beginnings of San Antonio. And
they represent what endures of the Spanish empire,'' said Gerald
Poyo, an associate professor of Latin American and U.S. Latino
history at St. Mary's University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The missions were the catalyst for religious conversion to
Catholicism for regional Indians friendly to the early pioneers,
and provided shelter from hostile forces that helped nurture the
fledgling mestizo communities.
</P>
<P>
   Poyo said from the missions ``you get your first civilizations''
in southern Texas. And today, the missions serve as a history book
to explain the early origins of that civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those missions are wonderful places to take students. They get
a visual sense of how the early settlements were set up,'' Poyo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The four missions within the 850-acre national park survive as
parishes today. Nonetheless, Congress and the Interior Department
have grappled with fiscal constraints that have left the National
Park Service operating them on a bare-bones budget. Whitesell has a
staff of 41 and an annual operating budget of $2.2 million for more
than 250,000 square feet of ``masonry and historical materials.''
</P>
<P>
   To make improvements, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, tucked
$390,000 into a spending bill for the Interior Department to
``rehabilitate'' antiquities and structures at the Missions Park.
The funding wasn't included in the House version of the bill. A
House-Senate conference committee must iron out differences in the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, was instrumental in
placing $1.9 million into the federal highway bill to improve
access to the four missions. President Clinton signed that bill
into law.
</P>
<P>
   The highway funds would be spent under the direction of the
Texas Department of Transportation and would provide a continuation
of the Missions Trail and improve signage for ``one of the largest
tourist attractions in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Missions Park is the second most popular national park in Texas,
with 1.3 million visitors annually. It ranks behind Lake Meredith
with 1.7 million visitors, according to the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The missions are the largest collection of Spanish Colonial
architecture in the United States, drawing tourists and history
buffs from coast to coast and abroad. With the improvements,
Whitesell said, the number of annual visitors could increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Mission Trail would begin at the Alamo. Once known as the
San Antonio de Valero Mission, the structure later was renamed the
Alamo and became the Shrine of Texas Liberty after the 1836 battle
that saw its Texas defenders wiped out by Santa Anna's Mexican
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Although many visitors know the Alamo's significance, Poyo said,
the cultural significance of the four other missions along a
13-mile stretch of the San Antonio River often is overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical standpoint, Whitesell said, improving access to
the park and spending funds to rehabilitate structures will
``improve the quality of experience'' for visitors.

SYNDICATED TV SHOWS GET NO RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Having made it 15 minutes or so into the news
conference without shifting the conversational focus to Pamela
Anderson Lee's breasts, the creator and producer of her new
syndicated drama, ``V.I.P.,'' blew it by gleefully pointing out
that Lee possessed ``two noticeable assets'' as her bankable
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a Freudian slip or an attempt at jazzing up the
otherwise who-cares proceedings, but as the gathering of TV
critics, publicists and other hangers-on burst into laughter,
producer J.F. Lawton tried desperately to correct the mistake, only
to bury himself more deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, what can you do?'' Lee said later as she stood in a hotel
lobby trying to gather enough strength to face hungry-looking
paparazzi circling her waiting limo. ``But at some point you'd like
to think that people will start taking your acting far more serious
than your looks or, for God's sakes, what you're wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   (A yellow, short, hip-hugging skirt, painted-on yellow top,
white sandals, since she brought it up.)
</P>
<P>
   International audiences couldn't care less about acting talent _
they made ``Baywatch'' the most-watched television series on the
planet, didn't they? So it goes without saying that Lee's
``V.I.P.,'' a humorous action series about a security agency and
its figurehead chief, has a better-than-average chance of becoming
a global phenomenon this fall even if it fails at home.
</P>
<P>
   Lee already has the fame thing down pat; now she's reaching for
fortune. If ``Baywatch'' star and inspiration David Hasselhoff
handed her any advice, it was ``to own a piece of the show.'' Lee
is listed as one of the producers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the netherworld of syndication, a kind of stepchild of
network television; if this were theater, it'd be an
off-off-off-Broadway production. These shows are usually tucked
away at odd times on odd channels, and you often stumble upon them
while flipping around looking for something else. Sexy, violent and
frequently stylistically risky, syndicated dramas are often
considered ``less than,'' even compared with network programs, in
which idiocy is often a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated dramas (think ``Xena: Warrior Princess'') would never
be considered Emmy-level productions because so many are on the
``V.I.P.'' level: campy productions aimed at beer guzzlers with an
affinity for scantily clad women gripping firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that it's violent and racy and has no
substance,'' said Peter Davis, one of the producers of
``Highlander: The Raven,'' which begins Sept. 14 and picks up where
``Highlander'' left off. ``But in many ways it has far more
substance than network dramas in the sense that we have the time to
build plots and deepen characters.''
</P>
<P>
   No one understands this world better than Lorenzo Lamas. He
showed up in Army fatigues to push ``Air America,'' in which he'll
play an ex-Navy SEAL and undercover agent running a commercial
airline and saving folk along the way. It didn't take long for
Lamas to move back into syndication when ``Renegade'' petered out
after five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seem all that thrilled to be in the fatigues, though,
snapping at a reporter who asked why he showed up dressed in
character. Snarled Lamas: ``This was `their' idea,'' speaking of
his producers.
</P>
<P>
   A very lean, almost sickly looking Lamas seems to know that a
syndicated star's work is never done. ``You've got to sell it,'' he
said, shrugging. ``There's so much competition out there that you
can't just sit around and watch everyone else get the audience. But
for me, it's not the medium that's important; it's the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Polygram Television won't have to do much selling to get an
early sampling of ``The Crow: Stairway to Heaven'' with Mark
Dacascos as the beleaguered soul trapped on earth. Dark and moody,
the series, which premieres in September, will expand the Crow
legend, though executive producer Bryce Zabel says they'll stay the
course enough to keep the faithful audiences who flocked to both
``Crow'' feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Syndication is more synonymous with game shows and talk shows,
of which a few were presented here, though expectation for long
life isn't high. King World reps tried their best to talk up
``Roseanne,'' the new daytime talker from you know who, since
Roseanne failed to speak for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters expected a fiery session; the actress is known for
being feisty and intolerant of journalists. But the most noticeable
event was the bizarre seaweed sandwiches served for lunch. Roseanne
spent the entire hour with a blank look on her face, fielding every
question with vague answers. (''Can you give us an example of
topics?'' Answer: ``Things I believe in, things other people aren't
talking about.'' Question: ``Will you have sketches?'' Answer:
``Well, we might.'') She clearly wanted to be elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by her producers, Roseanne gave no indication of how her
daytime show will differ from, say, Rosie O'Donnell or Oprah
Winfrey, except that she'll cover edgy topics much like her sitcom
did.
</P>
<P>
   One breakthrough came when she admitted that the hardest part of
the job has been the actual interviews. Hey, it was something.
</P>
<P>
   The next biggest name to try syndication this fall is Whoopi
Goldberg, who, like Roseanne, seemed to see the news conference as
a waste of time. She spent her hour session snapping at questioners
who couldn't believe she had signed on as a regular on the new
``Hollywood Squares'' game show. Question: ``How long did it take
you to come to such a decision to leave your film career?'' Answer:
``About five seconds.'' Question: ``How did you happen to make this
career choice?'' Answer: ``I got a phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Whoopi mentioned that she'd been offered $5 million a year
to spew jokes as the middle square, the exchange would have been
moot.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the stage, Whoopi was overheard muttering, ``Get me
outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Maury Povich and Whoopi found one another in the hotel
bar. He, too, spent most of his session in defensive posture. And
for good reason. Critics drilled him on why he's revamping ``The
Maury Povich Show'' into ``The New Maury Povich Show,'' which he
claims will be more hard-hitting and newsy, with multiple guests
sounding off on single topics.
</P>
<P>
   But it sounds like any other talk show in which the topics
simply rotate between paternity tests and family scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Povich launched into a long-winded tirade about his wife, Connie
Chung, being network caliber and how he's hardly that kind of
goody-goody foot soldier, why their joint show wasn't bought,
(''station politics''), and how ``I don't do big-breasted women
well; Sally Jesse Raphael does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a sinking ship, Povich's producer, Tamara Haddad, jumped
in. ``We're in business,'' she said. ``And if something works, why
wouldn't you go back and do it again?''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments exactly for Donny and Marie Osmond, the epitome
of the kind of friendly, feel-good TV that appears to be overtaking
the ``Jerry Springer'' shock trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' will be a variety and chat show, bringing
together this brother-and-sister duo after some 20 years. Marie
insists that audiences shouldn't expect the sugar-coated
teeny-boppers of a decade ago, that they are different people with
different ideas, and this alone will spice up their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In front of reporters, Donny spent an hour calling his sister
``Ree,'' and she gently needled him while both broke into giggles.
It was enough to make you weak-kneed or simply want to kick them.
</P>
<P>
   Donny, clearly aging but looking no more than 30, told us that
``Donny &AMP; Marie'' will be part talk, part variety, all clean. ``But
it'll be hip,'' he promised. ``No smoke and mirrors. What you see
will be real. It will be us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, like Pamela Anderson Lee. After building a career fueled
by her sexuality (first on ``Home Improvement'' as the bouncy
``Tool Time Girl'' and later on ``Baywatch'' as the bouncy
lifeguard) she wants to reinvent herself as an actress who just
happens to be beautiful, cosmetic surgery notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   She said this while showing us clips from ``V.I.P,'' in which
she pranced around in various forms of undress, particularly from
the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   But as new talk show host Howie Mandel said, success ``is a
marathon, it's not a sprint. You have to keep picking at it,
knocking out any misconceptions people have. You won't achieve a
goal next week or two weeks from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as he explained how ``staying focused and steady'' is the
key, Lee glided by, catching Mandel's attention. Which prompted him
to end his discourse with ``and keeping your eyes to yourself won't
hurt, either.''

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NELSON MANDELA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The world's greatest man turns 80 years old
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, it would have been deemed improbable that Nelson
Mandela would celebrate his 80th birthday while serving as the
first democratically elected president of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   His destiny, it seemed, was to die as the most famous political
prisoner in the world, a man lionized by millions worldwide who
looked to him as South Africa's messiah.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, already serving time for incitement, Mandela was
convicted of treason, a charge that England could have made against
George Washington and that any totalitarian government can level
against those attempting to overthrow it in favor of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's foe was apartheid, an instrument of hate that made
South Africa the most systematically racist country in world
history.
</P>
<P>
   Like Socrates on trial in Athens, Mandela used the courtroom as
a platform. He condemned the government of South Africa and the
immorality of apartheid while advocating justice and democracy.
Sentenced to life in prison, Mandela didn't disappear from the
conscience of his country or the world.
</P>
<P>
   As South Africa spiraled into what seemed an inevitable and
cataclysmic blood bath, three words became a mantra of hope: ``Free
Nelson Mandela.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mandela had died in prison, entombed in legend, he would have
been a tantalizing ``what if?'' to history while South Africa
consumed itself in its rage.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 11, 1990, as he left prison, Mandela walked out of
the mists of mythology and onto the stage of history. From that
point on, the greatness that had only been heard and read about
became evident.
</P>
<P>
   For 27 years he was imprisoned as the most visible symbol of a
cruel and brutal regime, one that wouldn't allow him to attend the
funerals of his mother and oldest son. Yet Mandela didn't allow his
suffering to embitter him nor blur his vision for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from prison unbowed, a warrior still in possession of
his dignity and graciousness. He proved himself not to be a
fire-breathing demagogue, but a pragmatic statesman devoted to
nation-building.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel, who
also journeyed from prison to the presidency, no head of state
comes close to matching Mandela's moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the dock during his 1964 trial, Mandela concluded
his address to the court with these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in
which all persons live together in harmony and with equal
opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to
achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideals didn't die and neither has the man. Happy Birthday,
Nelson Mandela, and many more.

SAN FRANCISCO HOPES TO ADD SPIT AND POLISH TO FADING LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Its glory days, when 50 million people a year
passed through it and 170 ferries plied the Bay, are a distant
memory, but the dream of a San Francisco Ferry Building restored to
its original magnificence lives on.
</P>
<P>
   The Port of San Francisco is again trying to arrest the slide
into shabby obsolescence of one of the city's enduringly famous
landmarks, this time with a planned $70 million restoration and
redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ferry Building is one of the great icons of San Francisco,
and it would be not only exciting but a privilege to help restore
it to its original grandeur,'' said former city Supervisor Robert
Mendelson, who heads Mentmore Development Co., one of four
developers responding to the Port Commission's requests to renovate
the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project would draw strength from the qualities of the
city. It's quintessentially San Francisco,'' said David Malmuth,
senior vice president of TrizecHahn, another interested developer.
``It's an extraordinarily valuable piece of property. ... Our sense
is that it is potentially something great.''
</P>
<P>
   The city marks the centenary of the building on Tuesday. With
its 250-foot central tower and prominent location at the foot of
Market Street, the building has historically been regarded as a
home-grown San Francisco phenomenon, but the money to build it _ a
little less than $1 million _ was raised with a statewide bond
measure in 1891.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by architect Arthur Page Brown, who died before its
completion, the building received its first passengers 22 months
after construction began.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century thereafter, the Ferry Building was one
of the two or three busiest passenger terminals on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   It survived the great earthquake and fire of 1906.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those San Franciscans who looked down a devastated Market
Street throughout the first months, the Ferry Building, a splendid
survivor, stood against the skyline as a solitary promise that San
Francisco would once again come to be,'' wrote California State
Librarian Kevin Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, the biggest neon sign on the Pacific Coast, mounted
atop the Ferry Building, welcomed visitors to the great Panama
Pacific Exposition: ``California Invites the World,'' it said in
letters 8 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake struck, the
building's tower, with its clock stopped at 5:04 p.m., became an
enduring symbol of the city's resilience after a cataclysmic event.
</P>
<P>
   But the building had long since lost the utilitarian value it
had when ferries were the only means of cross-Bay travel.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Bay Bridge in 1936 and the Golden Gate Bridge
in 1937 had radically diminished its importance. Ferry service from
the building ended in 1958 when Southern Pacific's ``Eureka'' made
its final crossing to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The intervening years have been hard on the old building, which
was at its most useful and vibrant when San Francisco wasn't a
tourist town, but a busy, blue-collar seaport and financial capital
of the Far West.
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus sent out to interested developers by the Port
Commission reflects changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Just as San Francisco has evolved into a tourist town, replete
with public amenities, so the commission wants to make the Ferry
Building fit gracefully into the new mold.
</P>
<P>
   With its commanding setting and graceful lines, it should become
``the centerpiece of our waterfront development,'' said Port
Director Doug Wong.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferry Building is exceptional in that it presents a dual
challenge, ``to restore its grandeur'' and ``to give it a new
economic life,'' said Chris Meany, retail director for William
Wilson &AMP; Associates of San Mateo, which has worked on redevelopment
projects at other historic landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Commission wants a project that ``enhances the historic
qualities of the Ferry Building, while providing both a focal point
on the waterfront and an integrating link with downtown,''
according to its formal request for proposals. The Ferry Building
is a national historic landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials envision the building housing offices, retail
shops, restaurants, space for renewed ferry service and have given
the developers wide latitude to include other uses such as
entertainment, public markets, academic facilities and museums.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, residential uses, nonmaritime private clubs and
wholesale and/or trade promotion centers will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The developer also will have to seismically retrofit the
building and show that its project can continue to provide the port
with $1.4 million in annual rent.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to pick a developer sometime this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to restore the Ferry Building is the second in 20
years. The first, launched in 1980, fizzled when the commission
canceled its agreement with what it believed to be a nonperforming
developer. It was sued and settled in 1991 for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the troubled track record of restoration projects for
the building, Port Commission Chairwoman Denise McCarthy is not
committing the commission to a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has taken a long time, but with the economy like it is,
it seems like a good time to do it,'' McCarthy said. ``Certainly,
everybody would like to see it happen in our lifetime after all
these years.''

AN ACTOR OFFERS GENUINE PROMISE IN THE PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON PACIS  
 c.1998 San Franciso Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the newly elected president of the
Philippines heralded his office as ``Ang araw ng masang Pilipino''
(Day of the Filipino masses), Joseph Estrada brought a lump to the
throats of Filipinos everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   No president of the island nation has ever done this before. His
inaugural address in Tagalog struck a chord that resonated far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-turned-politician is wasting no time in setting the
tone for a country badly in need of change.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada might be the butt of jokes for mangling the English
language, but the Filipino masses love him.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he's begun to unite a country slowly shedding
its made-in-America image.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how better to talk to your countrymen than in your
own language? No gimmick, no platitudes. Just plain,
honest-to-goodness talk that's endeared Estrada to his countrymen,
especially the poor and downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder then that Filipinos, rich and poor _ ``Armani
or no money,'' as Estrada joked _ have embraced him as their new
president? True, there are skeptics, but Estrada has a chance. Six
years won't be enough, of course. Poverty and corruption are so
pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   So is the psychological trauma of centuries-old colonialism.
After all, who can undo overnight what the Spanish and Americans
did for so many years of domination?
</P>
<P>
   Not Marcos. He tried. It destroyed him. Neither could his
successors in the presidential palace, Corazon Aquino and Fidel
Ramos. It left them scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   A century earlier, the national hero Jose Rizal tried and was
executed by the Spanish. With America's Manifest Destiny lording
over its wards of ``little brown brothers,'' no one in the
handy-dandy list of Filipino heroes could.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't the Western Father, it's the Filipino with no
memory, as a Filipino novelist once said. Meaning: Foreigners have
dominated the Filipino psyche for centuries, but Filipinos don't
seem to remember. If they did, the Philippines wouldn't be in a
such a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Is it cultural amnesia, then? Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Can Estrada turn things around? Too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Estrada has rallied his people behind him.
That's what counts. Never mind the cynics who shrug off his speech
as another ``palabas'' (a grand gesture).
</P>
<P>
   It is noble. It is necessary. By speaking directly to the little
people, by speaking their language, he's cast off distrust and
suspicion. He's one of them. He's talking to them in a language
they can understand.
</P>
<P>

STOCK CAR RACING IS SPORTS JUGGERNAUT OF '90S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved July 11; a and s coding; note
time references.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ All week long, they have been gathering near the
big oval track here, the 130,000 auto racing fans who will, again
this year, help make the stock car race at the New Hampshire
International Speedway the largest paid sports event in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 (TNN, 1 p.m. EDT) is just
part of the evidence that the National Association for Stock Car
Auto Racing is now years beyond its image as a provincial, niche
sport, a descendant of the good ol' boys who ran moonshine in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of NASCAR, stock car racing has become the
sports juggernaut of the 1990s. As the organization celebrates its
50th year, observers agree that it is the model of what sports, as
a business, should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of leagues ought to take a real lesson from how they
have marketed the sport,'' said Larry Moulter, president and chief
executive of Woolf Associates in Boston. ``It is a sport that is
really smart about how it sells its story.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of stock car racing is its fans, whose intense
loyalty to their favorite drivers and to the sport is a marvel on
Gasoline Alley and Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because NASCAR wasn't on television for so many years, its
legions of fans had to go to the races in person,'' said Shaun
Assael, who spent two years on the circuit to write a book, ``Wide
Open: Days and Nights on the NASCAR Tour.'' ``What they came to
understand is that it is best experienced that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds gathered in Loudon this week, it was clear that
the experience is about camping and family, as well as racing. With
thousands of recreational vehicles and trailers, the site resembles
a family campground, without the litter, but with a race track
attached. A look at license plates suggests that all New England
states have embraced stock car racing, along with New York and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction is all about the drivers and the cars,'' said
Bruce Reed of Hinesburg, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they don't go on strike and they don't screw up,'' said
Tom Gadhue of Richford, Vt. ``And they don't charge $100 per
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what this is all about is that, I think, everyone who
has ever sat in a car wants to know how fast it will go,'' Reed
said. ``Not everyone wants to play football or basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The track in Loudon was built with private funds and is
supported, to a great extent, by the two NASCAR races there every
summer, according to Bob Bahre, chairman of the board of the
speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 83,000 ticket holders who actually get seats are offered the
first chance on renewals every October. Bahre said the renewal rate
is 96 percent, with 15,000 to 20,000 on a waiting list for tickets.
In other words, get on the waiting list now, and by 2003 you might
have a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Based on NASCAR numbers, Sunday's race and the New Hampshire 300
on Aug. 30 will generate at least $32.8 million for tickets,
lodging, food, and souvenirs alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total attendance in this decade has increased 47.4 percent at
tracks across the country, from 3.8 million to 5.6 million. It now
averages about 180,260 per event. During the same period, NBA
attendance increased by 17 percent, NFL attendance by 6 percent,
and major league baseball by 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New state-of-the-art racetracks have been built recently in
Southern California, Dallas, Miami, and Las Vegas. There are plans
for new tracks in Denver and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's television viewership is up 106 percent since 1991, and
it now beats the regular-season coverage of major league baseball
and the NBA, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of NASCAR-licensed products climbed from $60 million in
1991 to $600 million in 1996, according to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking business statistic has been gathered by
the IEG Sponsorship Report in Chicago: NASCAR alone will account
for more than 10 percent of the $4.5 billion spent this year on
sports sponsorships by US companies. While $476 million will be
spent on NASCAR, the sponsorship of the four major professional
sports _ baseball, basketball, football and hockey _ totals $457
million.
</P>
<P>
   So sophisticated is NASCAR as a business that even enterprises
far removed from the rush and rumble of 200-mile-per-hour
straightaways should heed the lessons of the descendants of
back-road rum-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera and the symphony could learn a lot from NASCAR,''
said Lesa Ukman of IEG Inc., the Chicago-based leader in analyzing
commercial sponsorships and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has really been smart with its fans, and it's made very
clear, in a very overt way, the direct links between their
sponsors' money and the benefits that the fans get,'' Ukman said.
``The fans understand that the sponsors keep ticket prices down and
pay for the new engine for their favorite driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what the opera and the symphony should learn: For
NASCAR, sponsorship is less intrusive than just a big part of the
fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, sponsorships in sports are commonplace. But when
NASCAR started linking companies such as Ford and Chevrolet to a
250-mile race on a dirt track at the Michigan State Fairgrounds in
Detroit in 1951, it blazed a trail that other sports,
entertainment, and recreational activities have followed,
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, other sports didn't think to do stuff with
commercial endorsements from companies,'' said William C. France,
the president of NASCAR and the son of its founder, William H.G.
``Big Bill'' France.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, for a while, we were ridiculed for doing that,'' France
said. ``But, you see, we didn't have television. Through the '50s
and and a lot of the '60s, it was our fans paying money at the gate
who would have been left to pay for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, a lot of other sports find themselves in a similar
position, because television is not paying for all of the big
salaries,'' he said. ``So, now, they are all doing what we did long
ago, as a matter of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The throngs who attend races and a burgeoning television
viewership is older, richer, and better-educated, and includes more
women than one might imagine. According to NASCAR marketing
studies, 82 percent of fans are 25 or older, 64 percent are
married, 38 percent are women. Almost one-third earn more than
$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between NASCAR and other sports is the amazing
loyalty of fans to sponsors, and it all proceeds from the fact that
fan and sponsor were linked from the very start. It is of little
surprise to companies such as Kellogg's, Kodak and K-Mart that
NASCAR marketing studies show that 72 percent of its fans are more
likely to buy products from NASCAR sponsors than from anyone else.
Who cares if it even costs a little bit more, if it helps pay for
your sport and your heroes?
</P>
<P>
   Such fan loyalty helps drive a massive corporate investment in
stock car racing, attracting fully one in seven Fortune 500
companies, several of whom spend $10 million annually to sponsor
NASCAR drivers, cars or events.
</P>
<P>
   While the relationship between fan and sponsor is an intrinsic
part of racing, the relationship between fan and driver is its very
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has done it from Day One, and the drivers realize from
their history that in order to survive, they had to appeal to the
fans,'' said Robert G. Hagstrom, an investment strategist and
author of the book, ``The NASCAR Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking among the RVs and family barbecues in Loudon this week,
one does not hear the complaints typical in other sports, about how
the drivers are cry-babies, increasingly separated from their fans
by fame and riches, and far less skilled and gallant than the early
heroes of the sport. Instead, one hears of a fierce loyalty to men
they can literally touch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the campers have flagpoles, and they fly, in order, the
American flag, the flag of their state, and a flag bearing their
favorite driver's number and colors. NASCAR drivers are famous for
their generosity to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty is the Babe Ruth of stock car racing, a legend as
famous for his feats on the track as he is for establishing the
sport as a fixture in American society. In 1972, Petty told Stock
Car Racing magazine: ``The people who come to see me race pay to
get in. If they didn't come, there would be no racing, and hence
there would be no Richard Petty. The very least I can do in return
is be nice and receptive to them and spend time with them, whether
they root for me or against me.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship has largely provided for NASCAR's ascendance
in an era of increasing cynicism about professional sports.

REMAKING CNN PROVING DIFFICULT
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On June 7, amid a cloudburst of promotion, CNN debuted
an ambitious program designed to usher in a proud new era at the
world's leading all-news network.
</P>
<P>
   As the cable network's first serious move into the prime-time
newsmagazine world that has produced such valuable commodities as
``60 Minutes,'' ``Dateline,'' and ``20/20,'' ``NewsStand''
represented an attempt to transform CNN's identity, to parlay its
longstanding reputation for fast, fair television news _ for being
the channel Americans turn to when a crisis erupts _ into more
stable, long-running viewership.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Shortly before the premiere of ``NewsStand,'' a program he
created, CNN/US president Richard Kaplan sat in his Atlanta office
and enthusiastically predicted that the new show ``will get us a
lot of different attention and a lot of different eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Kaplan may be pondering the wisdom of the adage: Be
careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   The very first ``NewsStand,'' with its stunning allegation that
the US military used a deadly nerve gas during a secret 1970
mission in Laos dubbed ``Operation Tailwind'', has been a fiasco
for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the night it aired, there were troubling doubts
about the Tailwind story. Less than one month later, the network
was forced to retract it, three producers were out the door, and
Peter Arnett, perhaps CNN's most famous reporter, was reprimanded
and nearly fired. Kaplan contemplated quitting. His boss, CNN News
Group chairman Tom Johnson, submitted his resignation to network
founder Ted Turner, who refused to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, Turner indicated how much damage the episode
had caused. ``Nothing has upset me more in my whole life,'' he said
at a Television Critics Association news conference. ``I feel
horrible about it. CNN has been my baby from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the Tailwind trauma simply added to the litany of
recent media disasters, including the dismissals of New Republic
writer Stephen Glass and Boston Globe columnist Patricia Smith for
fabricating material in their work and The Cincinnati Enquirer's
$10 million apology for improperly obtaining material for an expose
about the Chiquita Brands company.
</P>
<P>
   For this media outlet, though, it was a debacle with a
particularly cruel twist. Rather than savoring its most innovative
programming move in years, a shellshocked CNN was left fighting to
regain its hard-won credibility.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years, CNN had carved out an enviable reputation for
earnest journalism. It had also become America's ``hearth'' for
breaking news _ the place where people flock in times when there is
information everyone's waiting for and everyone's talking about.
That place in our national life is reflected in the huge CNN
viewership for events ranging from the Gulf War to the freeway
chase of O.J. Simpson. Yet the network has had to face another fact
about its history: In less stressful times, viewers desert in
droves. No longer satisfied to watch its audience flow in and out
like the tides, CNN executives are trying to reinvent the network
as a place where news, entertainment values, and personality mix to
create distinctive programming and attract more viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're an underachieving network,'' said Kaplan in an
interview before the debut of ``NewsStand.'' ``We're averaging
about a 0.5'' rating, less than half a million households ``and we
should be getting a lot more. ... All of a sudden, we've come to a
fork in the road and there's only one path to go. And that's up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the Tailwind story hangs like a dark cloud over
the network's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shaken by the setback, but we're moving quickly to get
over it,'' senior White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer told the
Globe last week. ``Are we over it? No. It will take some time. But
the best way to get over it is to show everybody we're going to
break stories and do in-depth journalism and regain whatever
confidence may have been lost due to this one mistake _ albeit a
big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters last week, Gerald Levin, chairman of Time
Warner, which is CNN's parent company, expressed his confidence in
the Johnson-Kaplan team.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the nerve-gas story fiasco, the big question was
whether stronger competition, embedded viewer habits, and changing
news technology would doom CNN's strategy. Now, Tailwind raises the
stakes, and a daunting question: Will CNN become a victim of its
own ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a corporate entity, the CNN News Group might be fat and
happy. It comprises 13 operations and 36 foreign and domestic
bureaus, and earns about $300 million in annual profits on total
revenues of about $1 billion, revenue split roughly 50-50 between
advertising and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The network has also amassed an impressive list of journalistic
accomplishments since its inception in 1980. It consistently tops
public opinion polls in terms of reliability and credibility. It
has become America's network of choice in moments of drama. It has
changed the way global leaders do business. And it has functioned
as a video wire service for the rest of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the public has been well served by the
presence of CNN,'' said Johnson in May, before the Tailwind story
was aired. ``I believe we have been there for them in Tiananmen
Square; ... in San Francisco'' for the 1989 ``earthquake; in
downtown Baghdad.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's problem, of course, comes during calmer moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an old story, the cyclicality of CNN's
viewership,'' said John Higgins, assistant managing editor at
Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine. ``So Kaplan is trying to organize
this into a better audience flow, particularly in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Tailwind episode could have resulted in
Kaplan's departure sent chills through the CNN boardroom. More than
any other personnel or programming change, the hiring of Kaplan _
the 6-foot-6 former executive producer of ABC's ``World News
Tonight'' and well-known friend of Bill Clinton _ is the linchpin
of the new CNN strategy. Before landing him last August, Johnson
actively pursued Kaplan, 51, for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until Rick was hired that they said they were going
to create a different sensibility, a `show' sensibility,'' said
media analyst Tom Rosenstiel. ``The only `appointment' programming
they had was `Larry King' and `Crossfire.' They never really had
anybody with that kind of network experience.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``appointment viewing'' has become the CNN mantra:
In a May interview, Johnson said ``appointment shows'' would help
mark the ``third major wave or cycle in the life of CNN.'' The term
refers to programming that viewers will make a point of watching.
NBC's ``Must-See TV'' on Thursday night is the most spectacular
current example.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects ``Seinfeld'' to be reincarnated on CNN. But there
is a heavy burden on Kaplan to juice up the prime-time lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand'' is ``akin to what CNN launched on June 1, 1980, in
terms of magnitude and in terms of significance,'' said anchor
Bernard Shaw. ``Anybody who does not realize that we are evolving
into an entirely new era is missing the basic point of our
existence.'' Even the old familiar CNN studio is in the midst of a
$7 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand,'' the most expensive startup in CNN history, was
meant to be a showcase for corporate synergy. The show is one of
three collaborations with magazines which, like the network, are
Time Warner properties: Time, Fortune, and Entertainment Weekly.
These collaborative programs air at 10 p.m., most nights after
Larry King. Each has a different niche.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the precision of a professor giving a lesson
in economics, CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer described the division
of his daily labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do a spot from the White House, it'll air on CNN,''
said Blitzer. ``Then it'll air on CNN Headline News. Then CNN
International. Then CNNfn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it'll air on CNN Radio. Then they'll give it to CNN
Newsource. Then to CNN en Espanol. Then our interactive Web will
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer paused, not dizzied at all, apparently, by the specter
of one of his stand-ups on the White House lawn undergoing such a
multiple-media metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of CNN,'' he confided, ``is that they've amortized
the news.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN programming that Americans see on their television
screens derives from CNN/US, which is but one part of the sprawling
entity that is the CNN News Group.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN News Group encompasses six cable networks (CNN/US, CNN
Headline News, CNN International, CNNfn, CNN/SI, and CNN en
Espanol), two radio networks, seven Web sites, the CNN Airport
Network, the Better Health Network, the College Television Network,
and the syndicated news service called CNN Newsource.
</P>
<P>
   It has 700 broadcast affiliates located all over the world,
enabling programming from CNN/US and CNN International to be
available in 190 million homes in nearly 220 countries and
territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is the best-known brand in the world,'' declared Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/US.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a pointed reminder that beyond the tip lies the rest of
the iceberg, Kaplan added: ``The downside is people think they know
you, and they don't.''

 ATLANTA: ... different niche.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ill-fated nerve-gas story demonstrated, the CNN/Time
program (Sundays and Mondays) is intended to be an
attention-grabbing newsmagazine. The CNN/Fortune pairing
(Wednesdays) is business-oriented, looking at subjects ranging from
the popularity of corporate jets to the rise of Michael Dell's
computer company. The CNN/Entertainment Weekly effort (Thursdays)
is a showbiz program with some newsier edges. The first episode,
for example, featured a ``Spin City'' segment on the Hollywood
hired guns who help polish the images of wayward stars who have
ended up on the police blotter.
</P>
<P>
   The next major surgery on the lineup occurred on June 22, when
CNN's nightly ``Moneyline with Lou Dobbs'' was expanded into an
hourlong ``Moneyline News Hour'' (6:30 p.m. weeknights) that is
CNN's answer to its broadcast cousins' nightly news shows. The
program makes use of CNN's reporting resources and has morphed from
a Wall Street roundup into a hybrid of business and world news
where the crisis in Nigeria gets about equal billing with a surge
in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Dobbs in a recent interview, is to broaden the
reach of his old show ``to the political economy. ... It's going to
be a very serious broadcast. ... I probably shouldn't acknowledge
this, but this is going to be very close to being news for the
know-it-all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplan strategy for CNN is to produce more provocative
programming without dumbing down the network, ``to make the
presentation worthy of the scope of the network,'' as he says. The
trick is to get viewers to think of CNN as something other than a
perpetual newscast. The blueprint calls for shedding the network's
faceless-anchor image and developing stronger personalities;
creating prime-time programming, like ``NewsStand,'' with clear
identities and themes; and pouring more energy into distinctive
long-form journalism.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaplan's prodding, CNN has produced a stream of nightly
specials on issues like campaign-finance reform and tensions with
Iraq. One day after The New York Times created a furor with its May
3 story suggesting major breakthroughs in cancer treatment, for
example, CNN was on the air with a prime-time special on the
subject. Early returns indicated that these specials were bumping
up CNN's ratings by anywhere from 50 to 200 percent for that hour.
</P>
<P>
   This past January, the network unveiled an ambitious Sunday
night documentary series, ``CNN Perspectives,'' which has tackled
such subjects as Holocaust survivors and life in war-torn Sarajevo.
Some of CNN's plans are epic in scope, including a 24-hour ``Cold
War'' series narrated by Kenneth Branagh, due to begin airing this
September.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of sprawling, cerebral programming that would
seem to present the most obvious conflict between CNN's
journalistic ambitions and its hopes for a mass audience. Still,
the bosses think the ``Cold War'' series can work on both levels.
In the most animated moment in an hourlong interview in May,
Johnson rose from his desk, clutched a handful of ``Cold War''
tapes, and announced that they contained evidence that the Cuban
missile crisis was even more dangerous than previously thought.
``In this,'' he exclaimed proudly, ``Fidel Castro makes
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   At a network where the credo was ``the news is the star'' and
anchors like Shaw and Judy Woodruff are not considered breakout
personalities, Kaplan has made headlines by actively trolling for
flashier talent. He dangled lucrative offers before CBS's Rather
and NBC's Tom Brokaw, who both turned him down. Others, however,
said yes, including ABC's Willow Bay and Judd Rose, both of whom
are now hosting ``NewsStand'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan's biggest catch so far is senior analyst and
``NewsStand'' co-host Jeff Greenfield, who built a reputation as a
brainy and provocative commentator at ABC. The Greenfield
acquisition was ``huge for me,'' said Kaplan. ``When you make him
part of the bouquet, people pay more attention to the rest of the
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield received a quick baptism of fire at CNN. &UR;  &LR; A week
after arriving in late January, he was hosting a prime-time special
_ called ``Media Madness'' _ that became an orgy of
self-flagellation over media outlets' performance covering the
Monica S. Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN said `Come here and you can stretch,''' said Greenfield in
early June. ``This was a place where I could do more.'' Greenfield
acknowledged that his CNN role is ``still evolving'' and that being
a host is an adjustment. ``All of this is a work in progress, and I
think you have to come here with that at the center of your
assumptions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield's already tricky transition has been complicated by
the Tailwind story, which he introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish it had not happened,'' he sheepishly declared on the
July 5 edition of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most visible indicator of how far CNN has come since it was
launched _ reaching a paltry 1.7 million homes, and known by the
derisive sobriquet of ``The Chicken Noodle News'' _ is the
network's headquarters near downtown Atlanta. It looks less like a
news operation than a huge theme park designed around a central
atrium that includes the set of CNN's ``Talk Back Live'' show; a
CNN studio tour; and the Turner souvenir store. Spiraling around
the atrium are the CNN offices, which house some of the 3,500 or so
full-time employees of its sprawling empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eight independent networks,'' explained Kaplan several
months ago, while citing the advantages CNN has over competitors
like Fox News Channel and MSNBC. ``We have an assignment desk that
speaks 31 languages. We're talking about spending $700 million in
news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN's power is not strictly in resources. The network has
affected _ some might say revolutionized _ the journalism business.
``In many ways, CNN has served as an electronic version of the
Associated Press,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point may have come in the first days of the Gulf
War, when Americans, awakening with dark circles under their eyes
after watching CNN into the wee hours, realized that their morning
papers contained nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   In a critical and widely quoted article on CNN for The New
Republic in 1994, media analyst Rosenstiel wrote that after the
Gulf War, ``suddenly, CNN was on in newsrooms around the country,
... changing the consciousness of the people who put out
newspapers. Editors who watched CNN all the time started to assume
that their readers were watching, too.'' That, he concluded, led to
more of the narrative and interpretive-style journalism that is in
vogue today, as newspapers seek to give readers something they have
not already gotten from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hastened the trend among news organizations toward opinion
and interpretation over hard reporting,'' Rosenstiel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Tailwind flap, some might argue that CNN had
fallen into a trap of its own making _ forsaking its immediate-news
mission for the kind of dramatic storytelling that would grab
viewers' attention for the new show.
</P>
<P>
   That is the view voiced by Nieman Foundation curator Bill
Kovach, who says of CNN: ``I don't think you can make a mistake of
this magnitude and not suffer consequences. At what point is it
going to be possible for journalists to resist the pressure ... to
compete for revenue dollars rather than focus on quality?''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that despite this misstep, CNN's best bet is on
Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a vision,'' said Blitzer, this past week. ``He needs
some time, obviously, to get it going. But I have no doubt that he
is the man who can lead us to the level of journalism we want to
get to.''

 TAKES-BOS

 By DON AUCOIN AND MARK JURKOWITZ   
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton out of town on a muggy
Monday in May, the White House was becalmed and newsless _ a
circumstance at which CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer usually would
chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blitzer wore a contented smile as he glanced at the front
page of The Washington Post, where the lead story was based on news
generated by ``Late Edition,'' his Sunday interview show. That sort
of ``pickup'' matters greatly in this political hothouse of a city,
where TV's ``Sunday talks'' are judged ruthlessly by how much news
they break.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, more direct measure of a network's impact
than scoring a Beltway bull's-eye: namely, how many viewers are
watching? On that score, CNN fell short on that day, just as the
network falls short whenever there are no bombshell stories
riveting people to their TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   No news is bad news for an all-news network, and on its slowest
days, CNN's ratings sink to the neighborhood of the Home &AMP; Garden
channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN does wonderfully when there's a major news event, but they
lose momentum any time there's no major crisis or hugely
fascinating story,'' said Lawrence K. Grossman, former president of
NBC News. ``When their audiences are small or minuscule, they have
to worry a lot about their ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, there is cause for significant worry these
days at CNN. Mark Twain once defined a classic as ``a book which
people praise and don't read.'' CNN is struggling to shake an image
as a network that people praise and don't watch.
</P>
<P>
   That is why new CNN/US president Richard Kaplan opted to
mobilize CNN behind a new ``NewsStand'' series _ the magazine show
whose debut was badly tarnished when the network had to retract the
``Tailwind'' story alleging that the US military used nerve gas in
1970 on defectors in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   That setback notwithstanding, there was a competitive impetus
for change. While CNN clung year after year to its identity as a
plain-vanilla news service, aggressive new players joined the
all-news game that CNN invented and began poaching its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, around-the-clock competition for serious news viewers
comes at CNN from all directions, ranging from splashy national
upstarts like MSNBC and the Fox News Channel to the Internet and
local outlets such as New England Cable News.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are playing for keeps, and some of them see CNN's
leap into prime-time newsmagazines as another symptom of the
network's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is, in my view, trying to save itself from terminal
boredom,'' said John Moody, vice president of news at the Fox News
Channel, an all-news cable outlet that was founded less than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've chosen an interesting route: creating huge
controversies about their reporting,'' Moody added, in a caustic
reference to Tailwind. ``It's not boring. I don't think it's what
they had in mind, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, CNN clearly had to do something. Its viewership (along with
general viewership of other networks and local stations) has
declined since the early 1990s. Just last month, a survey conducted
by the Pew Research Center found that only 23 percent of
respondents said they watched CNN regularly, down from 35 percent
in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While CNN is less financially dependent on ratings than
broadcast networks, since cable operators pay a fee to carry its
programming, its chronic ratings woes underscore the oddly
precarious position the world's leading all-news TV network finds
itself in.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its vulnerability to news slumps, CNN is battling ominous
trends. For one thing, surveys show that American viewers are
tuning out foreign affairs in huge numbers. That's dire news for a
network whose calling card for the past 18 years has been its
no-dateline-is-too-distant coverage of international news.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the news environment has changed dramatically in
the post-Cold War era. As the nuclear threat receded, Americans
have developed what Bernard Kalb, host of CNN's ``Reliable
Sources,'' has described as ``a blissful indifference to the
urgency of news.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno sees major implications
for his network. ``We have to be honest, that we are in an era of
bits-and-pieces news,'' Sesno said. ``We've got relative
prosperity, relative peace, and there's no epic story that
dominates the front page every day such as a civil rights struggle
or a recession. The news environment has changed, the interests of
our viewers have changed, and our storytelling has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as CNN tries to reinvent itself, the question arises: Has
CNN waited too long, and given its new competitors too much of a
foothold to stave its audience erosion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are three (all-news) cable networks ... and the
viewership for all of (television) journalism is in rapid
structural decline,'' said media analyst Tom Rosenstiel. In
revitalizing CNN, he added, Rick Kaplan faces ``a lot harder job''
than he would have had just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With CNN reeling from the credibility blow delivered by the
Tailwind fiasco, Kaplan's job may have just gotten harder still.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At CNN headquarters in Atlanta, not far from Kaplan's office,
hangs a telltale graph that vividly shows the 18-year history of
CNN's ratings.

   Four sharp points reach into the air like church spires,
reflecting the network's ratings spikes during the Gulf War, the
O.J. Simpson freeway chase, the verdict in Simpson's murder trial,
and the Al Gore/Ross Perot NAFTA debate. (Shortly after CNN
mesmerized sleep-deprived Americans with its nonstop coverage of
the 1991 Gulf War, CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson ran into
American tourists while hiking in Peru. ``We came down here to get
away from CNN,'' they told him.)
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ratings graph looks like a freshly mowed lawn _
reflecting CNN's flat numbers in normal, calmer times. Take May 3,
when Blitzer's ``Late Edition'' won the news race but lost the
ratings race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Edition'' drew 517,000 households for its first hour
before climbing to 708,000 households during its final half hour.
While that was a strong showing by CNN's standards, it nonetheless
represented only half as many as the number tuned into ``Fox News
Sunday,'' an interview show the Fox broadcast network launched just
two years ago. NBC's ``Meet the Press with Tim Russert'' drew 3.2
million households, ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts'' 2.6 million households, and CBS's ``Face the Nation'' 1.6
million households.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the overall ratings numbers this year encouraging for
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   From January through March, as CNN joined the media frenzy over
allegations that President Clinton had an affair with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, an average of only 507,000 households per
day were tuned in to CNN, according to Nielsen Media Research. From
April through June, as the Lewinsky story abated somewhat, CNN's
average numbers dropped still further, to just 348,000 households
per day, about as many viewers as watch Country Music Television.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 top-rated programs on basic cable in the first
quarter of 1998, CNN had two, a special on the Texas woman facing
execution and the State of the Union address.

   &UR; Ratings for the CNN news network soar during crises, scandals,
and big, breaking events. But when news becomes routine, viewership
slips sharply. Under CNN president Richard Kaplan, the network is
trying to attract more long-term viewers. In a two-part series,
Boston Globe writers Don Aucoin and Mark Jurkowitz explore the
status of America's ``hearth'' for breaking news. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TV-CNN-I-SPCL (Atlanta) -- Over 18 years, CNN has carved out a
reputation for earnest journalism, despite occasional lapses. Now
CNN executives are trying to reinvent the network as a place of
``appointment viewing'' where news, entertainment values, and
personality mix in distinctive programming. (2 takes)

<P>
   TV-CNN-GROUP-SPCL (Washington) _ The CNN programming that
Americans see derives from CNN/US, but that is only one part of the
sprawling entity that is the CNN News Group. 400 words.
</P>
<P>
   TV-CNN-II-SPCL (Washngton) -- CNN executives exult when their
programming generates headlines in the nation's newspapers and
magazines. Such pickups show the network's clout. But there is
another, more direct measure of its effectiveness: how many viewers
are watching? And on that score, CNN often falls short. (2 takes)

 WASHINGTON: ... Union address.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When news breaks, people turn to us,'' said CNN's Johnson.
``When there is a quiet environment, they go back to soap opera and
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, NBC, ABC, and CBS _ the networks that Kaplan tells
the CNN troops are the real competition _ pull in 8 million
households apiece each night for their evening newscasts, week in,
week out, without regard to public interest in a particular news
story. During prime time, the broadcast networks draw even more
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blitzer pointed out that CNN's ratings numbers do not
reflect the network's large international audience, which Nielsen
does not measure. ``We're seen in 220 countries around the world,''
said Blitzer. ``While we may have a smaller audience (in the United
States) than the broadcast networks, worldwide we're seen by many
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted, when it comes to domestic viewers, CNN
operates in the cable universe, which is smaller than the broadcast
universe of 98 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   But still, CNN's programming is distributed to 73 million US
households. It is an American network competing with other American
networks for viewers, yet the cold truth is that at any time only
around half a million Americans consider it must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest disappointments is that after the Gulf War,
we went back to our pre-Gulf War audience,'' conceded Blitzer.
``Maybe we should have done the `appointment-viewing' approach
we're doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Appointment-viewing refers to shows that viewers remember to
turn on and watch week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Moody, however, pointed to CNN's Tailwind embarrassment as
an object lesson in the risks of grafting magazine-style,
``appointment viewing'' programs onto an all-news network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reconcile the concept of appointment viewing with
a news channel, for exactly the reason that has now caught CNN by
the butt,'' said Moody. ``There's too much of a push to put on
incredible stuff _ and in this case, literally incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rivals, while stressing their respect for CNN's
journalistic caliber and pioneer status, make clear that CNN now
inhabits a brave new world where its dominance is no longer
assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is there a large enough audience to sustain
numerous 24-hour cable news operations?'' said NBC's Russert, who
besides hosting ``Meet the Press'' has an interview show on CNBC
and makes regular appearances on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that CNN had the luxury of avoiding when they
were the monopoly,'' added Russert. ``They could do the news wheel
as much as they wanted. Now, however, they realize they have to go
with programming rather than rehashing headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   John Higgins, assistant managing editor at Broadcasting &AMP; Cable
magazine, said CNN, while still dominant, is destined to weaken.
``CNN isn't quite on the defensive because of MSNBC and Fox,'' he
said. ``But the faster they get strong, the worse (CNN is) in the
long run. Eventually, (CNN) is going to get eroded by the other
cable networks.''
</P>
<P>
   While not conceding that as inevitable, especially since the
advent of its new newsmagazines, CNN staffers such as anchor Judy
Woodruff take that threat seriously. ``To survive, we've got to be
aware of who our competition is,'' said Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for CNN is that the competition today takes so many
forms. For example, MSNBC, a joint venture of NBC and Microsoft,
boasts star power CNN cannot match, since it draws heavily on such
NBC celebrities as Jane Pauley and Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Sesno says of CNN's instantaneous transmission of news that ``we
were the Internet before the Internet was cool,'' but lately the
real Internet has come on strong as yet another news competitor.
The Pew survey found the number of Americans getting news from the
Internet at least once a week has more than tripled in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power among the all-news cable networks is so
delicate, one TV analyst said, that CNN's continued dominance would
be gravely threatened if MSNBC were the network that found the next
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As competitors like MSNBC try to unseat CNN, though, they are
tackling a widely respected organization that has made news _ and
even history _ while reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters such as Blitzer and foreign correspondent Christiane
Amanpour are considered among the best in the business. CNN's
traditional reputation for trustworthiness is no myth: A May survey
by the Pew Research Center indicated that among cable and broadcast
outlets, CNN ranked highest in believability, ahead of CBS's ``60
Minutes'' and network and local news.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, the former news director at WCVB-Ch. 5 in Boston
who is now director of broadcast journalism at Boston University,
said that reputation is well earned. ``When it comes to breaking
news, they're right on top of it. They set the agenda,'' said
Thistle. ``When I deal with CNN people, they don't know the word
`can't.' The enthusiasm level is very high; they're not arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, CNN has a direct impact on events, one that is unique
among television networks.
</P>
<P>
   A study of US press coverage of the 1989 uprising in China's
Tiananmen Square, published by Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics, and Public Policy, quoted a rival reporter as
saying it was CNN's coverage of events that forced other networks
to increase their live coverage, bringing a global spotlight on the
crisis and ``setting an agenda for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of foreign leaders, from Moammar Khadafy to Saddam
Hussein, have used CNN's airwaves as a bully pulpit. Peter Arnett's
stint as the lone Western journalist in Iraq sparked a debate about
his patriotism and journalistic neutrality. In the '80s, Poland's
Communist government agreed to include a half-hour of CNN on the
nightly newscast to mollify the Solidarity trade union. After the
United States invaded Panama in 1989, the Soviets used a statement
on CNN to register their reaction. According to Eason Jordan, CNN's
president of global news gathering, the old Soviet KGB established
a unit dedicated to monitoring CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (CNN) has had a very significant impact, probably much
more outside the country than inside,'' said Barrie Dunsmore, the
former ABC News diplomatic correspondent who has written about the
impact of television on geopolitics. Leaders like Boris Yeltsin and
Hussein make judgments based on the network's coverage, Dunsmore
added. ``There really isn't an equivalence to that in previous
times. ... It's very easy to misread the reality of a situation
based on a hiccup in attention from CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan acknowledged that ``clearly, at times, our reporting and
the pictures we show have driven policy. If that results in some
policy changes, that's only a natural process.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called CNN effect on geopolitics is the subject of much
scholarly discussion and plenty of think-tank manifestoes. But the
grim reality is that news may not sell: The Pew survey indicated
that only 16 percent of respondents followed international affairs
``very closely.'' And Yeltsin and Hussein don't get counted by
Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the world have often turned to CNN in times of
international crisis. Now, recognizing that that is not enough, CNN
is striking out in a direction with no clear signposts, in hopes
that new viewers will join them along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are at a crossroads,'' acknowledged Judy Woodruff.
``We're rethinking: `What is news?'''

GOP, DEMOCRATS TO CONTEST 11 SEATS FOR CONTROL OF HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Republicans believe history is on their side.
Democrats believe the issues are on theirs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the November congressional elections,
neither side believes that many seats will change hands. Experts
say less than 1 in 6 House races are competitive, which in most
years would make the election a bit of a snoozer.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 228-to-206 margin _ the narrowest majority in nearly
a half-century _ the Republicans' grip on the House is anything but
firm: A turnaround of just 11 seats would put the Democrats back in
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very legitimate chance of taking the House back,''
said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``I think (Republicans) will be
very, very fortunate if they regain control of the House. I think
our chances are 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost is more optimistic than most nonpartisan observers, who
note that only once since the Civil War has the president's party
picked up seats in a midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, which handicaps
congressional races, said the Democrats' chances are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible, but everything has to fall perfectly into
place,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 advantage,
and the balance is unlikely to change by more than several seats.
However in the House, a shift of the same proportion could
determine whether Republican Newt Gingrich or Democrat Richard
Gephardt holds the speaker's gavel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what (former GOP chairman) Lee Atwater used to call a
`small change election.' '' said Professor Jack Pitney of the
Claremont McKenna School of Government outside Los Angeles. ``No
big deals. No big transactions. But nickels and dimes could make a
big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an intense focus on a handful of competitive races
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see their best prospects in the West and Midwest. In
California, which once looked like it might be a great opportunity
for GOP pickups, Democrats will be fortunate to not lose a seat or
two. However, they think they can pick up seats in Washington, New
Mexico and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the margin is 11 (seats), every district matters a lot,''
Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that Republican opposition to recent legislation
on tobacco, health care, campaign finance reform and the emerging
influence of religious right organizations, will alienate enough
voters in key districts to end their majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hard right turn that the Republican Party has
taken nationally in the House of Representatives is going to cause
problems for some of their more moderate candidates,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, history suggests that the Democrats face an uphill
struggle. Since World War II, the average loss for a president's
party during the sixth year of his term is 46 seats. Republicans
steadfastly maintain that they will increase the size of their
majority by at least 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the economy is booming and the nation is at
peace, incumbents are enjoying a surge in popularity. Many
Republicans appear unconcerned with the prospect of losing power
and are banking on their more ambitious accomplishments from
previous years, including legislation that overhauled the nation's
welfare system and produced the first balanced budget in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first secure Republican majority since the
1920s,'' Gingrich wrote in the Washington Post last month. ``Both
the tide of history and the currents of today's politics are on the
Republican side in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said a ``district-by-district review highlights the
negligible opportunities for Democrats to win any net House seats _
let alone a ridiculous eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton One wild card is President Clinton. Earlier this year,
Republicans said that the controversy surrounding the Monica
Lewinsky scandal could cost De &LR; mocrats dearly. Instead, Clinton's
popularity surged, and he remains the party's most prolific
fund-raiser. Clinton has already attended more than three dozen
fund-raisers this year and has pledged to raise at least $18
million for the Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's confidence is buttressed by a recent survey of 1,012
voters by the Pew Research Center. When likely voters were asked
which party they would support in their own House district, 48
percent said Republicans, while 44 percent said Democrats. The poll
showed that white women, who have voted heavily for Democrats in
recent elections, are now backing Republicans by a four-point
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans on both sides say the election is not likely to be
framed so much by broad national issues as local concerns that will
vary from district to district. Strategists have identified several
dozen swing districts which hold the key to the election.
</P>
<P>
   The two closest California contests are in districts where
Democrats are retiring. In Sacramento, Vic Fazio is leaving after
20 years in Congress, and in Los Angeles, Jane Harman chose to run
for governor instead of defending her House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are confident about picking up the Northern California
seat now held by Frank Riggs, R-Windsor, who is not seeking
re-election after a brief run for the Senate. Democratic State Sen.
Mike Thompson is the favorite in his contest with Napa County
Supervisor Mark Luce, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents look strong in most Northern California races,
although Republicans insist they will contest the Contra Costa
County seat held by Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek. Tauscher, a
freshman, stunned Republican Bill Baker in 1996. She is being
challenged by Charles Ball, an analyst at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, who has been circulating a poll that suggests
Tauscher may be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The California race likely to attract the most national
attention is in Orange County, where Rep. Loretta Sanchez,
D-Anaheim, is being challenged by Republican Bob Dornan, whom she
defeated by just 984 votes in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan, the bombastic and at times acerbic orator, accused
Sanchez of stealing the election with the help of illegal immigrant
votes. Democrats couldn't help from showing their glee when Dornan
won the June 2 primary, asserting that his presence will turn
Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the winning party is likely to hold a
narrow majority, making it difficult to pass legislation. Some
academics have even suggested that if nothing is going to be
accomplished, it might be advantageous to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frost bristles at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no,'' he said, noting that the majority party gets to
choose a speaker, name committee chairman, and bring legislation to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the expression, `I've been rich and I've been poor,
and rich is better,''' said Frost. ``Well I've been in the
majority, and I've been in the minorit &LR; y, and being in the majority
is better, under all circumstances.''

KILLER'S LAST CHANCE TO AVOID DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET CHIANG and GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Thomas Thompson's lawyers will file a final
appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court Monday in a desperate bid to
prevent the convicted killer from being executed in San Quentin's
death chamber.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high court is Thompson's only hope that his life will be
spared before he is strapped down and injected with a lethal
chemical mixture at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The condemned man's best chance of a reprieve was with the U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which blocked his execution last
August. But late Saturday, the federal appeals court refused to
stay the execution, rejecting his plea for a hearing to bring in
new evidence that he says proves his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising, lopsided 9-to-2 vote, the judges said that
Thompson, 43, had not raised ``clear and convincing'' evidence
proving that he should not be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's fate is now in the hands of the U.S Supreme Court,
which stayed his execution almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, he may not be as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   In reinstating his death sentence in April, the high court
accused the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco of committing a
``grave abuse of discretion'' in stopping the execution in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to do real well up there,'' said Frank Zimring,
a criminal law professor at the University of California's Boalt
Hall School of Law in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 43, was sentenced to die for the 1981 rape and
stabbing death of Ginger Fleischli at his Laguna Beach apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the fifth person to be executed in California since
the death penalty was reinstated in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous four inmates, Thompson had no prior criminal
record and is not a multiple murderer.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers say they have uncovered evidence that they claim was
withheld by the state proving that Thompson is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, they pleaded with the U.S. Court of Appeals for a
hearing to bring in evidence that allegedly undermines the rape
conviction. Without that conviction, Thompson would not be eligible
for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers rely on transcripts from a 1995 parole hearing, in
which Thompson's accomplice, David Leitch, testified that he saw
Thompson and Fleischli having consensual sex on the night of the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   But in an opinion issued Saturday, Chief Judge Proctor Hug
called Leitch's statements ``minimal evidence'' that does not prove
Thompson's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's attorney, Andrew Love of San Francisco, said he would
immediately file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. ``It's an
outrage that the state can withhold critical evidence of
innocence,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Mike Jacobs, the prosecutor in
Thompson's 1993 trial, denies that he withheld any information.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Leitch never said anything at the time of the trial
or at the 1995 parole board hearing that would have exonerated
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all fiction,'' the prosecutor said. ``It never happened.
Nobody who had anything to do with the case has any doubt about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Ross, a spokesman for state Attorney General Dan Lungren,
said the right man is being put to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in our minds that he is guilty of the crimes
that he has been sentenced to death for,'' he said. ``No doubt.''
While Thompson's lawyers fight to save his life, his scheduled
execution has been almost overlooked, compared to the barrage of
publicity he received last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's case is caught up in the morass of procedural rules
aimed at shortening death penalty appeals that can drag on for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The condemned man was unable to overcome a procedural hurdle
created by a 1996 federal law that limits state prisoners to one
appeal in the federal courts unless they have evidence proving
their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Love said. ``The case appears to be coming
down to procedural technicality.''
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the rules reflect the public's growing
impatience with the endless delays that prevent the death penalty
from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly chastised the federal
appeals court in San Francisco for issuing last-minute stays of
execution, leaving it up to the high court to make the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is a no-win issue for the U.S. Supreme Court,
Zimring said.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices allow a death penalty to be carried out, there's
blood on their hands, he said. If they stop an execution, the
justices are accused of delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   What the courts want is to get out of the capital punishment
business, Zimring said. ``And they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the death penalty, ``you can't have a fair and
fast system,'' Zimring said. ``You can have one that's fast or you
can have one that's fair. But you can't have them both.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Fleischli, Ginger's brother, believes that when
Thompson is executed there finally will be some sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's speculative whether it will provide relief or not, but
I'm looking forward to it immensely,'' said Fleischli, who said he
will witness the execution with his brother, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thompson has escaped justice for 18 years. If his time has
finally come, I'll be very gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischli, a former public defender, was practicing criminal law
as a private attorney when his sister was killed. He said the
incident was so traumatic that he changed professions. He has been
an actor for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischli said he still thinks constantly of his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were incredibly close,'' he said. ``When something like
this happens to a family, it's devastating, it's a day-to-day
assault, it's water torture. You wake up, and somebody in your life
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have to wait 18 years or longer for justice.''

KILLINGS OF 2 GIRLS, FATHER'S SUICIDE IN STANDOFF STUN
NORTHERN  CALIFORNIA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN FAGAN and CHRISTOPHER HEREDIA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    ANTIOCH, Calif. _ Almost everyone was sure that whatever
happened in the cordoned-off house here, the two tiny hostages
would come out alive _ but in a sudden, horrifying eruption of rage
and despair, it was over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the police SWAT team rushed into the house late Saturday
night to find 22-year-old Carlos Ramirez dead with his two mortally
shot toddler daughters in an apparent murder-suicide, one
heart-wrenching question was already forming.
</P>
<P>
   How could Ramirez's 42-hour standoff end so unthinkably, when no
one who knew him thought he would harm his own daughters?
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved those children like his own life,'' Ramirez's mother,
Elsa Ramirez, said as she gathered to grieve with relatives at her
home in the northeast San Francisco Bay community of Antioch. ``All
he said when I talked to him was that he wanted to take care of his
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the standoff, ``he was reading to the kids, changing
the littlest one's diapers and putting ointment on her for diaper
rash, feeding the kids hot dogs and Pedialyte,'' Ramirez said,
choking back a sob. ``Does this sound like a man who wanted to kill
his daughters?''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the children's mother, 25-year-old Cami Viramontes,
Ramirez's ex-girlfriend, echoed the sentiment. ``No one, not even
Cami, thought he was going to harm the kids,'' said Kevin
Viramontes, Cami's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Antioch officials say Ramirez was talking relatively calmly with
police mediators throughout the standoff until 10:53 p.m., when he
inexplicably started screaming and rambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with me? No. Oh, my God, I love you,'' Ramirez
cried out, according to police. Then came his last words: ``Five,
four, three, two ...''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators on the phone next heard what sounded like two
muffled shots, one sharp and loud shot, and then the line went
silent. They had hoped the relatives were right about his fatherly
inclination, but they never ruled out murderous possibilities,
given his violent background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attempted to re-establish contact. We couldn't. So we went
in,'' a weary Antioch police Lieutenant Rick Marchoke said early
Sunday morning. He said the SWAT team waited about an hour before
charging the house.
</P>
<P>
   The father and his daughters were found in a bedroom, each shot
with one of Ramirez's guns, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez and his younger daughter, 1-year-old Kavi, were dead,
and his other daughter, 3-year-old Kayleonna,(CQ) was clinging to
life. Kayleonna was rushed to nearby Sutter Delta Medical Center,
where she was pronounced dead on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to reveal what their actions were as they entered
the house, or exactly what happened during negotiations, saying it
was a ``tactical matter'' being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors and Ramirez's relatives said before the house was
stormed, they heard at least one blast _ sources said police tossed
in a concussion grenade designed to stun him _ as a flash lit up
the block, then several popping sounds. Some also said they thought
they heard at least one gunshot about three hours before the police
entered the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they fired no gunshots throughout the entire ordeal,
and they were prepared to wait as long as it took for a peaceful
end. But once they heard gunshots over the phone and couldn't raise
Ramirez again, there was only one choice: Go in.
</P>
<P>
   The probability that the 3-year-old lay wounded and alive in the
house for about an hour was tragic, but necessary given the
situation, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to consider the safety of all parties involved in a
situation like this,'' said Police Chief David Lewis. ``You don't
know who's dead. When you hear gunshots, it changes the dynamics of
how you make entry. You don't hear shots and barge in the door _
that could lead to a lot more fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The people most likely to shed light on Ramirez's final hours
are the negotiators, and they weren't talking Sunday. Without that
and other bits of information, Ramirez's family remained doubtful
of the official account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there were no shots when they went in, but other
people say there were,'' said Ramirez's mother. ``They're not
telling us everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, the shootings came on the fifth anniversary of a similar
tragedy in Antioch, when Joel Souza shot his two children and
himself to death after being pressured by police to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other city officials adamantly denied that there was
any relation to the way this standoff was handled and the Souza
debacle. Souza had no criminal or violence record, they said, while
Ramirez was wanted for a 1994 shooting and had a $1 million warrant
outstanding for a 1995 gang-related slaying in Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   The way the drama began Friday at 6:10 a.m. also made
negotiators unusually wary.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez broke into the house _ Cami Viramontes lives with her
children and her parents, Sam and Janice Viramontes _ through a
window, wearing camouflage clothing and face paint, and began
threatening the adults with a 9mm handgun and rifle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   He was upset over the breakup of his relationship with the
children's mother, and in the chaos that erupted he shot Sam
Viramontes, who had armed himself with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to kill all the adults, so they ran out,'' said one
source familiar with the investigation. ``Nobody dreamed he would
ever harm the children, so they decided to let the police sort it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As police surrounded the residence, Ramirez fired at least two
rounds at them, hitting nobody. By 8:30 a.m., officers were
evacuating 150 people from several blocks in the pleasant, normally
quiet Mira Vista neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said Ramirez appeared to be taking good care of the
girls as the standoff stretched on. At one point, mediators told
him that if he gave up, ``in two years you can go to Disneyland
with your kids,'' said one source.
</P>
<P>
   The comment made Ramirez angry, as did mediator suggestions that
if he gave up he could eventually get a job and reunite with
Viramontes, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Ramirez said she talked to her son by phone Saturday
between 6 and 7 p.m., ``and he kept saying, `the only thing I want
is to talk to Cami.' He kept crying, saying, `this isn't how it was
supposed to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Lewis said negotiators didn't let Viramontes talk to
Ramirez because ``the volatile relationship'' between the two might
trigger the gunman into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Viramontes said his cousin and her parents were staying
with relatives and did not want to talk. Cami Viramontes, he said,
``is holding up OK, but I think she has slept almost all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the sole motive for the siege appeared to be
Ramirez's fixation on his relationship.
</P>
<P>
   They said Ramirez had eluded officers since the 1995 homicide,
and that after fleeing to Mexico he had returned and was living
recently with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were filled with a mixture of sadness and anger Sunday
as police let them back into their homes. They were unhappy that
they had to stay with relatives, in motels or at a nearby Red Cross
shelter, but they were even more miserable that all the upheaval
had saved no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Antioch is grieving,'' said a weeping Mayor Mary Rocha,
who lives a half-block from the house and had to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all crazy,'' Ron Crivello said while he watered the
lawn he had to neglect for two days. ``People are talking about
whether the cops did this thing right or wrong, but is there really
a right or wrong in a situation like this? What else could they do
but wait, and then go in?''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of residents, many weeping, arrived throughout the day to
place flowers and toys on a makeshift memorial on the trunk of a
police car near the house. About 200 more people gathered last
night for a candlelight vigil at the nearby Calvary Open Bible
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give those girls something important,'' said
5-year-old Briana Rael,) as she dropped off two Barbie dolls and a
fistful of carnations at the memorial.

BEWARE OF PESKY 401(K) MAINTENANCE FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Are administration fees pecking away at your retirement nest egg?
Money invested in 401(k) retirement plans is being swallowed by
rising maintenance fees, according to a booklet released by the
U.S. Department of Labor this month.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the booklet, fees range from 0.2 percent of an
account balance to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fees cover day-to-day expenses like record keeping and legal
costs and to pay for investment-related services.
</P>
<P>
   The high figures cited in the booklet are comparable to what
investors pay for maintenance fees for mutual funds. The
publication notes that most workers are paying higher 401(k) fees
than they did 10 years ago because a growing number of employers
are shifting a greater share of the costs to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Plan administrators say they also have had a hard time figuring
out just what the maintainence fees are because they aren't
well-disclosed by the plans.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a copy of the free report, titled, ``A Look at
401(k) Plan Fees,'' by calling (800) 998-7542 or going to

<P>
   COLLEGE COSTS: A child born this year will need about $104,000
to cover the costs (tuition, room and board, books, etc.) of four
years at a public college, according to the College Board's latest
cost survey. That compares with an estimated $222,000 for a private
college eduction.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. has a new college expense
forecasting kit that you can use to calculate the costs in your

TEST SCORES AFFECT RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Even if you don't have kids, even if you don't care about the
future of American education, you should take a close look at your
local school test scores just released by many Bay Area districts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Chronicle reporter Lori Olszewski noted last week, home
buyers scrutinize the scores of schools and districts their
children will attend _ and that translates into higher property
values in neighborhoods that funnel children into schools of higher
perceived quality.
</P>
<P>
   That fact helps explain why the stakes are so high in reporting
the results of California's Standardized Testing and Reporting
(STAR) exam _ and why some districts with many below-average
schools, like San Francisco, have resisted releasing their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But just how big is the effect on real estate prices? Economists
have examined the issue since the mid-1970s and usually found it
large.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in 1996 by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
estimated that every 10 percent increase in a school's contribution
to sixth-grade math scores increased neighboring home prices in
North Dallas by 4 percent _ making school quality the most
important influence on residential real estate values other than
the size and age of property.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, a 4 percent boost would add nearly $12,000 to
the price of the average home.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were reported last March by Sandra Black, an
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who compared
homes in Boston on opposite sides of streets that divide elementary
school boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   She found that moving from a school ranked at the 25th
percentile to one ranked at the 75th percentile led to a 3 percent
increase in average house prices, enough to grab the attention not
only of home owners, but of city officials concerned about
maintaining their tax base.
</P>
<P>
   But should home buyers pay such premiums for higher scores? Many
experts question the popular assumption that good scores reflect
good schools. Just about every study shows that what matters most
to student achievement are family characteristics such as parental
education and income, not differences in school quality.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's hardly fair to assume that schools in Portola Valley
deserve all the credit for the high STAR scores of students there
compared with relatively low scores of poor and minority students
in East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly wrong to take an inner-city school with low test
scores and blame the teachers,'' said Julian Betts, an economist
and education researcher at the University of California at San
Diego. ``Demographics matter tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   But if peer pressures influence student performance, then
perhaps parents aren't so irrational after all in checking out a
school's average test scores when choosing where to move. The
average does tell something about the achievement of students with
whom your own kids may mix. If your kids rise (or fall) to the
level of their peers, their education could be profoundly affected,
regardless of the school's other merits.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the effects of peers on individual student
achievement is a thorny but vital task, raising significant
questions not only about school choice, but about programs to track
ability groups in classes and bus minorities to desegregate white
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to list something that was of fundamental importance
but under-researched in the economics of education, this is it,''
said Thomas Kane at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have been frustrated in trying to estimate peer
effects because cause and effect are hard to determine. If kids
were thrown together randomly in schools or neighborhoods, it would
be easy to study the effect of growing up with more affluent or
brighter peers.
</P>
<P>
   But because families choose where to live, the causality gets
murky. Parents who put special value on education, spending more
time reading to their kids and helping with their homework, may
choose to put their kids into some schools or neighborhoods and not
others. Researchers may attribute to peers or neighborhoods an
influence on education that is actually caused by differences in
parental commitment.
</P>
<P>
   One influential study, published in the Journal of Political
Economy in 1992, followed this line of argument and concluded that
peers in fact have no independent influence on student achievement.
But the bulk of evidence from other studies is that parents are
right to assume that who their kids associate with in school does
matter:
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of 7,000 school children in Montreal in the early
1970s examined achievement gains from grades one to three and found
that the average IQ of students in any given class had ``a
consistent and strong impact on the achievement of individual
students'' in the class.
</P>
<P>
   _ An unpublished study this year by Steve Raphael and Alejandro
Gaviria at the University of California at San Diego, based on a
national sample of 10th graders, shows strong effects of peers on
the likelihood that students abuse drugs, drink alcohol, smoke
cigarettes or drop out of school. Moving from a school where no one
drops out to one where half the kids drop out would increase an
individual student's chances of dropping out by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Studies of academic tracking consistently find that low-track
students do better when put into mixed classes with high-ability
students. Unfortunately, some studies also show that high-track
students do worse in mixed classes, showing they can be dragged
down by less-able peers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two University of California at Los Angeles economists
reported in January an answer to the puzzle of why Head Start, the
preschool program for disadvantaged children, doesn't pay off in
long-lasting academic gains for black students. The reason: African
American Head Start graduates disproportionately end up in schools
with sub-par test scores. Rubbing shoulders with under &QL; 
achieving peers causes them to backslide after they enter school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peer effects seem to matter a lot in college as well. Studies
show that, holding individual ability constant, students are more
likely to graduate from more-selective colleges. Students also earn
3 to 5 percent higher wages several years after graduating for
every 100 point increase in the average SAT score of their college
class.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot that researchers still don't know about peer
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has disentangled whether what's important is your
immediate group of friends or (the quality of peers in) the class
you are in, the school or the neighborhood,'' said Dominic Brewer,
an economist at Rand, a think tank in Santa Monica. ``We don't
understand how they affect how kids do'' in school or in life.
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, said that
despite all the uncertainties, there's little reason to suppose
peer effects are unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my knowledge, the average citizen who's willing to
pay a lot of money to have better peers (in their school or
neighborhood) is probably right. It's hard to believe, given
everything we know about how children develop and the time they
spend with peers, that peers won't make a difference.''

SHAREHOLDERS BEWARE _ AUTODESK BRASS LIGHTENING UP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Top executives at Autodesk have been unloading stock again, and
history tells us that it doesn't bode well for shareholders.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the biggest sellers is President Eric Herr, who has dumped
about 115,000 of his shares in the San Rafael software company.
Herr is slashing his position (including options and warrants) in
Autodesk by nearly 20 percent, according to CDA/Investnet
Technologies, an investment research firm in Rockville, Md. The
action was noted in filings between May 27 and June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are large numbers. This kind of selling doesn't tell us
that the insiders see a lot of upside in the company's shares
during the immediate term,'' says Bob Gabele, editor of Investnet's
insider newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   All told, five company insiders sold or filed to sell about
157,225 shares at around $42 to $43 a share. Autodesk closed Friday
at $35.63, down about 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, insider selling shouldn't warm the cockles of
shareholders' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk, the nation's fourth-largest seller of software for
personal computers, makes software that is used by various
industrial concerns, from heavy manufacturers to architectural
firms to video production companies.
</P>
<P>
   Its exposure to Asia's sick economies is fairly substantial.
During the company's first fiscal quarter ending April 30, Autodesk
reported that about $29 million of its revenues, or 15 percent,
came from the across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a considerable problem. And it has proven to be
troublesome for one of Autodesk's top rivals: Parametric Technology
of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric was a poster child for blown-up tech stocks earlier
this month. On July 2, Parametric plunged $8.75 in heavy trading
after it warned Wall Street that the company's third-quarter sales
and profits would be lower than expected. Parametric blamed much of
its financial woes on lost business in Asia. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Whether Asia will cause financial hiccups for Autodesk remains
to be seen. The company reports that North American and European
sales are robust. Herr, who was unavailable for comment, has said
he would be ``surprised'' if his firm would need to warn Wall
Street about missing earnings targets.
</P>
<P>
   An Autodesk spokeswoman would not speculate on Herr's motivation
for selling his shares. However, she does say the executive
exercised options to buy the shares. She notes that the options
were slated to expire last month.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that means Herr &LR;   &LR; would have needed to dip into his
personal cash to buy the shares and hold them. If he had done that,
it would have sent a more reassuring sign to shareholders than
unloading 20 percent of his position when Asia is economically
underwater.
</P>
<P>
   But would buying and holding the shares have been too much to
ask at this time?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, if you consider the precedent. This isn't the first
time Herr and compatriots have sold big chunks of stock. Last
November and December, Autodesk insiders sold about 294,000 shares
at prices ranging from around $37 to $42. That time, Herr lightened
his load by 165,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that insider sell-off, Autodesk shares plummeted
20 percent, according to CDA.
</P>
<P>
   And it looks like the same thing is happening to Autodesk shares
this time around.

FUND FOR YOUNGSTERS APPEALS TO ADULTS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
When Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham's Young Investor Fund was launched four
years ago, it was designed to appeal to kids _ with investments in
companies like Coke and Hasbro, and cartoonish quarterly reports.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But to almost everyone's surprise, the fund is increasingly
popular with adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, 100 percent of the shareholders were young
people or parents who were setting up custodials for their kids,''
said Dave Brady, senior portfolio manager with Stein Roe in
Chicago. ``Now, over 25 percent are adults who want their own
account.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Young Investor has posted some very grown-up
returns. The no-load fund has beaten the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 over
the one-year and three-year periods ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's minimum investment is low _ $100 if shareholders
agree to add $50 a month until their account reaches $1,000. That's
good for kids on allowances, but it's also ideal for adults who
can't come up with the steep minimums _ usually starting at $2,500
_ required by most funds.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which now has assets of $776 million and 135,000
shareholders, has undergone other changes that suit aggressive
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The first prospectus promised that managers would only buy
shares in companies relevant to kids.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, the fund's managers realized that they needed a
wider range of options to achieve good performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure there was some room to pick small-cap
stocks because our investor profile _ young kids with very longtime
horizons _ is very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund now aims to hold at least 60 percent kid-related
stocks. Its top-10 holdings now include companies such as Outdoor
Systems (a billboard company), Cisco Systems, Viagra-maker Pfizer
Inc. and Traveler's Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That shift in approach has won over analysts, some of whom
nicknamed Young Investor the ``High Calorie Fund'' because of its
heavy weighting in companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's and
Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its inception, people may have thought it was just a
gimmick that would die away,'' said Laura Lallos, senior analyst
with Morningstar in Los Angeles. ``But they're not letting the
marketing drive their buys.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Morningstar gives the fund its highest, five-star rating.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that the fund's stellar performance may mislead
young shareholders into thinking that 30 percent-a-year returns are
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Lallos cautioned that the fund ``has had the wind at its back''
and that kids might be getting an unrealistic impression of the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the same holds true for many other funds in this
prolonged bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will ``eventually get their lesson'' when the stock market
turns, said Lallos.
</P>
<P>
   She said the fund's newsletter does a good job of explaining
risk in words that kids understand.
</P>
<P>
   The simple language also appeals to adults, according to Brady.
``I think there are a lot of adults out there who want to
understand the market and the companies they're investing in
better. This gives them a closet way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Each quarter, the newsletter features a question and answer with
an executive at a company owned by the fund.
</P>
<P>
   In last quarter's newsletter, a 13-year-old girl from Kansas
asked McDonald's chief executive Michael Quinlan why the chain
doesn't serve veggie burgers.
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``We do serve a `veggie burger' in India, because
beef is not part of its cultural diet, and in a few other markets
outside of the United States. While we don't plan to add it to our
U.S. menu, we do offer several nonmeat items, including salads and
soups.''
</P>
<P>
   (Despite that comment, McDonald's is test-marketing veggie
burgers on the East Coast, according to Brady.)
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Horton, a 12-year-old from Rohnert Park with $6,000 in
the fund, looks forward to the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like knowing where my money's going and who the people are
running the companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew is 53 years away from retirement, but he's already
socking away most of his $7 weekly allowance.
</P>
<P>
   His early savings ethic started in 1995 when his mom, Wendy, got
Andrew and his two brothers and sister started in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   She said she wanted to encourage her children to invest early
because she wishes her parents had done the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds crazy to have a 10-year-old saving for retirement,
but that's almost what you have to do now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Horton gave each child $1,000 to start them off in the fund. She
promised that when the kids saved up $500 to invest, she and her
husband would match them dollar-for-dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy worked a little too well _ I think I owe about
$1,000 right now,'' she said.

 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
It's hard to argue with Pedro Lima.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a staff trainer at San Francisco's World Gym, Lima routinely
spends 14-hour days doling out expert advice on how to get in good
shape. He also is one of the more sculpted guinea pigs in what some
scientists call the biggest uncontrolled medical experiment in
history _ America's love affair with diet supplements.
</P>
<P>
   There's foul-tasting echinacea for colds, inexpensive St. John's
wort for depression, effervescent growth-hormone releasers for
fighting old age, and good old garlic _ now in convenient pill form
_ for just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, 30, swills power shakes spiked with muscle-fueling
creatine for breakfast. He is convinced that's one reason his
biceps seem to explode out of his tank top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works for me,'' he said. ``Good food is best. But after a
while, you reach a point where you don't go anywhere. That's why
you need the creatine.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, surveys show that about half the adult population in
the United States consumes some form of dietary supplement at least
once in a while, including vitamins, minerals, botanicals and
synthetics. About 20 to 40 percent are regular users.
</P>
<P>
   That consumption generated an estimated $11.8 billion in sales
last year, according to Nutrition Business Journal, a trade
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just blows my mind,'' said David Pearson, a nutrition
researcher at Ball State University's Human Performance Lab.
``People are always looking for the magic bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are no magic bullets despite what the marketers
_ or your next-door neighbor _ might say. Yet even some skeptics
say certain supplements can be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Leff, editor of Consumer Reports on Health, a
publication of nonprofit Consumers Union, said the key elements to
look for are documented benefits, good evidence of safety,
reasonable price and insufficient quantities in a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, ``you probably don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth is the most oft-cited source of information about
what works and what doesn't. It's also the least reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends and relatives who swear by a lot of things,''
Leff noted. ``I just nod my head and try to keep quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many so-called natural substances are at best useless, other
than as expensive placebos that work only through power of
suggestion in true believers. Worse, some supplements can be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators moved last year to restrict supplements containing
ephedrine and related alkaloids that can have effects similar to
amphetamine. Although derived from plants whose medicinal use dates
back to ancient times in China, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said ephedrine-containing supplements were linked to
hundreds of illnesses and multiple deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish claims abound on the Internet and online services.
Watch out for come-ons loaded with buzzwords like ``breakthrough''
and ``miracle cure.''
</P>
<P>
   All-capital-letters and multiple exclamation points also seem to
be standard ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   One recent example touted a combination of ground-up shellfish
skeletons and a brew of various amino acids as a ``nutritional
breakthrough program'' for losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail spam distributed by the Memphis-based marketers claimed
that users could lose up to 20 pounds per month and keep it off,
with no diet and no willpower required.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission found nothing to back up the claims
except bogus ``scientific studies'' and ``consumer'' testimonials
from people who turned out to be the product's distributors and
their spouses. A formal FTC complaint against the company led to a
recent consent-decree settlement in which the company agreed to
stop misrepresenting the health benefits of its products.
</P>
<P>
   If the enforcement action was meant to scare other supplement
peddlers, it clearly didn't work. Last week, one Web-based
supplement marketer was offering magic weight-loss pills. Another
promised stuff that it says solves impotence problems. A
Canadian-based site pushed a single cure for many scalp problems,
including hair loss, baldness, eliminating dandruff, pellagra, and
dry and greasy seborrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Finding your way through the seemingly unending hype is no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   While there are some valid claims hidden among all this, it's
really difficult for the consumer to know what to believe. ``The
vast majority are based on inadequate science, so nobody knows if
they're valid or not,'' Leff said.
</P>
<P>
   EXPLOSION OF RESEARCH
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the junk, mainstream medical practitioners say they
can no longer ignore the fact that people are going to try things
whether or not doctors think they should.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there's been an explosion of serious research on
supplements and, for the first time, some convincing evidence that
a few things just might work.
</P>
<P>
   There's growing evidence, for example, that Vitamin E and other
anti-oxidants might help protect against heart disease, though the
American Heart Association said there's insufficient data to
justify an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of conclusive proof, numerous studies suggest
benefits from anti-oxidants without hint of harm. Vitamin E also is
cheap and not readily available in a healthful diet, particularly
if you are simultaneously trying to cut down on some Vitamin E-rich
oils.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, there's little or no need to take a supplement if
you eat the right foods. Still, experts see a place for some
supplements, with Vitamin E serving as a good example.
</P>
<P>
   You can get it by eating lots of nuts and seeds, and it's also
found in plant oils and mayonnaise. It also can be found in
spinach, kale and other leafy green vegetables. Trouble is, the
amounts are so small that it just doesn't add up to the recommended
daily intake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really challenging to get that much Vitamin E on a
low-fat diet,'' said Lisa Kelly, a dietitian at the International
Food Information Council in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   STUDIES OF ST. JOHN'S WORT
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``nature's Prozac,'' St. John's wort has been found
effective in combating mild to moderate depression. But the only
studies so far have been short-term, covering a few weeks of use.
</P>
<P>
   There's still no clear evidence of its effect from months &UR;  &LR; or
years of daily dosing. The first large-scale trial in the United
States, a three-year study being overseen by the National
Institutes of Health, is just getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Another important caveat is that potency and purity can vary
widely depending on the manufacturer. Studies done so far have used
varying doses.
</P>
<P>
   The new NIH research effort ``will be the first rigorous
clinical trial of the herb that will be large enough and long
enough to fully assess whether it produces a therapeutic effect,''
said Steven Hyman, director of the National Institute of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING ECHINACEA
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody, it seems, keeps some echinacea on hand
these days when cold symptoms start to come on. ``Personally, I
think it's worthless,'' said Dr. John Renner, an Independence, Mo.,
physician and president of the National Council for Reliable Health
Information.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in echinacea may help mobilize one type of
infection-fighting white blood cell. But that's just one of 15 or
so basic parts of the immune system, and it's unclear what good it
does in reducing cold symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Many past studies showing echinacea's effectiveness have been
challenged by mainstream researchers as technically flawed. There's
still no clear evidence that the herb works, Renner noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people taking echinacea aren't doing a thing
for themselves,'' Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent study showed that zinc lozenges were useless in
warding off colds in children. Sponsored by Quigley Corp., a
Pennsylvania manufacturer of zinc lozenges, researchers enrolled
249 suburban Cleveland students in grades one through 12. Half
began taking zinc lozenges within 24 hours of developing a cold,
while half took placebos.
</P>
<P>
   Cold symptoms and duration of illness were the same in both
groups. But the lead researcher said the problem may have been that
dosages were too low, or even that the flavoring in the lozenges
somehow deactivated the zinc.
</P>
<P>
   And now the manufacturer is challenging the results, saying 83
of the youngsters should have been disqualified for various
reasons. ``The data that resulted from the study provides no
meaningful conclusion,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   THE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO
</P>
<P>
   Some supplement-backers maintain that lack of conclusive studies
is a bugaboo foisted by the medical establishment in order to keep
alternative approaches from gaining currency.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Gatos Longevity Institute, Dr. Philip Miller treats
symptoms of aging with a so-called growth-hormone releaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is that as we get older the output of growth
hormone slacks off, but it's still there. Apparently, it can be
stimulated to put out a lot more than it does,'' he said. ``The
clinical benefits are a combination of both subjective and
objective factors. Most of my patients feel better. They get an
increased sense of well-being. Many report an increase in strength
and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The supplement
product that Miller uses, called Symbiotropin, has not been linked
to safety concerns associated with direct dosing with the growth
hormone itself, but Miller conceded that he can't cite
scientifically persuasive evidence that it works.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a widespread view among practitioners of alternative
medicine, he said that's not going to stop him from doing what
works at least from his own observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things done in medicine that are not backed
up by good studies and good research, and they are done all the
time,'' he said. ``For a long time, we didn't know how aspirin
worked. You have to look at risk-benefit ratios and determine
whether the long-term benefit outweigh the risks. People want zero
risk, but that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CREATINE CRAZE
</P>
<P>
   A similar philosophy seems to be fueling the current creatine
fad sweeping the world of sports and bodybuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the muscular examples plying your local health club, some
of the biggest names in pro sports apparently agree that creatine
is as essential as weight-training.
</P>
<P>
   Although precise numbers are unknown, Sports Illustrated reports
anecdotal evidence _ including tubs of creatine powder sitting in
the locker room of the Los Angeles Lakers and personal testimonials
by the likes of St. Louis slugger Mark McGwire _ that about a
quarter of big-league basketball and baseball players swallow the
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among athletes, creatine is by far the most popular supplement
out there,'' said Heidi Skolnik, owner of Nutrition Conditioning
Inc. in New York and a nutritionist advising the New York Mets, New
York Giants and The School of American Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of professional athletes are taking it, and a lot of
people who aren't professional athletes are taking it, too,'' she
added. ``It's legal. It has not been banned. So there's no legal
reason they shouldn't be taking it. ... People are always looking
for an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally synthesized from amino acids in the liver, pancreas
and kidneys, creatine is an important nutrient found in all meat
products. It helps supply a ready source of energy to certain
muscle fibers.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Pearson linked creatine supplementation to
statistically significant gains in strength measures and lean body
mass. He compared varsity football players taking a moderate dose
of 5 milligrams of creatine daily for 10 weeks with players taking
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the most prominent skeptics say there's convincing
evidence that creatine really works. Strength gains of 5 percent or
more have been widely reported by some of the world's star
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some studies that show in a highly trained athlete,
creatine can give an extra boost for a short period of time,''
Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows what the long-term consequences of daily
creatine supplementation might be. Some doctors fear that excess
doses may damage the heart muscle over time, and there are unproven
links to muscle pulls and cramps.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the expense: A recommended regimen of creatine
may cost you $30 or more a month. That's no problem for pro
athletes, who also can afford superb medical care to make sure
nothing goes wrong, but it's a different story for those who try to
follow the examples set by the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the high school athletes who are going to have
trouble,'' Renner said, calling creatine supplementation a
potentially dangerous form of ``blood doping'' that he believes
should be banned from competitions.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary people and even weekend-warrior athletes, there's
no reason at all to use creatine, said Katharine Grunewald, a
Kansas State University professor who has studied diet supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps in generating sudden bursts of energy in
peak-performing athletes,'' she said. ``It would have no benefit to
anyone else.''

WHEN THE BOSS DOESN'T REPAY EMPLOYEE'S LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  My boss often asks me for small loans _ usually about $5 for
lunch. Although he makes considerably more money than I do, he
never pays me back. I've tried to talk to him and have even told
him I'm short on cash, but he ignores all that. He's the top dog
here, and there's no one above him that I can complain to. Do you
have any suggestions?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Your manager is way out of line here. Your job description
may include everything from typing to arranging the office flowers,
but I doubt that it says ``provide a revolving loan for the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Take another look at whether you've expressed your concerns
directly enough. You may have been so polite that your boss didn't
get the message. And believe it or not, he may be so preoccupied or
insensitive that he just doesn't realize how all those $5 lunches
are adding up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen situations like this where the managers were
actually quite embarrassed when they realized what they were
doing,'' said Michelle Burke, president of Executive Counterparts,
a San Francisco firm that coaches administrative support staff.
``They didn't realize it was $5, then $10, $20, $30 _ that it was
adding up.
</P>
<P>
   If your boss continues sponging off you, Burke suggests, keep a
written tally of the loans and submit it to him for reimbursement
every couple of weeks. Or ask your boss to set up a petty-cash
drawer for the office, so that he can borrow from that fund rather
from you.
</P>
<P>
   You also could simply try giving him a polite ``no'' when he
asks you for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she thinks her boss will be angry because she won't lend
him money,'' Burke said, ``she needs to ask herself whether this is
the kind of person she really wants to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; The president of my company has his secretary make coffee
for him. When she's not around, he asks other female administrative
staff like myself to do this. His secretary doesn't seem to mind,
but I do. It seems demeaning and unfair because he never asks the
male office staff. Can I be fired if I politely refuse to get him
his coffee?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; In the office of the '90s, it's not uncommon to see
everyone from the boss to the receptionist making their own coffee
_ or taking turns doing a Starbucks run on behalf of the whole
office.
</P>
<P>
   But many secretaries still do make coffee for their supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are happy to do it, while others find it
demeaning,'' said Lynn Taylor, director of research at Robert Half
International, a Menlo Park staffing firm. ``If someone has strong
feelings about this, they should find out what the corporate
culture is while job-seeking. When they're talking with the
company, they can ask if personal tasks are considered part of the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   In your case, you're in the job already and you want to keep it.
So see if the other secretaries share your feelings. Then approach
someone in management _ your own boss, a personnel manager or maybe
the president himself _ and politely explain why fetching coffee
bothers you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a hard worker and a valued member of the team, the
company's likely to accommodate you. After all, do they really want
to alienate a good employee simply over a cup of coffee?
</P>
<P>
   But if the firm insists that you get coffee, you do have to
comply _ or risk discipline and even firing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike providing the boss with constant $5 lunch loans, getting
coffee is a pretty reasonable request. It may not be in your job
description, but neither are a lot of other small projects that
managers ask their assistants to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Could you sue if you were fired for not fetching coffee? Maybe _
if you could prove that only the female office staff were put on
coffee duty. But it would be a pretty hard case to win, according
to Doris Ng, an attorney with Equal Rights Advocates in San
Francisco.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I'm interested in finding out about COBRA. How can I get a
copy of the law?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; COBRA is short for the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1987. That's the federal law giving most employees the right
to continue purchasing health coverage through their company's
group plan for 18 months after they leave a job.
</P>
<P>
   (It also allows an employee's dependents to continue buying
group insurance for up to 36 months if they lose their coverage for
reasons such as graduating from college or undergoing a family
divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to find out about COBRA is through your company.
Look in your benefits handbook or ask for a copy of the Summary
Plan Description for your health plan.
</P>
<P>
   You also can get a summary of COBRA from the U.S. Pension and
Welfare Benefits Administration. Visit their Web site at
www.dol.gov/dol/pwba/public/pubs/COBRA/cobra95.htm. Or call PWBA at
(800) 998-7542 or (415) 975-4600.
</P>
<P>
   If you want even more detailed information, Robert Burnett of
Buck Consultants in San Francisco suggests these sources:
</P>
<P>
   _ The COBRA law itself can be found in the section of federal
code called 29 USC 1161-1168. You can access it on the Internet at
law.house.gov/uscsrch.htm.
</P>
<P>
   _ The proposed COBRA regulations that appear in the Federal
Register aren't in electronic format. However, you can get a copy
of the Federal Register in most public libraries and look for the
section 52 FR 22716 _ June 15, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal tax code relating to COBRA is Section 4980B(f) and
can be found at www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/us tax.html.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; _ The Internal Revenue Service publishes Notice 98-12,
``Deciding Whether to Elect COBRA Health Care Continuation Coverage
after HIPAA,'' which can be viewed online at www.irs.gov.

employee? Send it to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San Francisco
Chronicle, 901 Mission Street, San Francisco 94103. Or send e-mail

   Nothing less than improving the cosmos is the aim of Weight
Watchers magazine, which advises: ``From the way you garden to the
way you order pizza over the phone, breathe radiance into this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, &UR; Nicoletta Mantovani &LR; , 27-year-old love of &UR; Luciano &LR; 
 &UR; Pavarotti &LR; , told the London Telegraph about the difficulties of her
relationship with the Italian tenor:
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment of lunch and dinner was always a nightmare for
me,'' she said. ``We had very big fights. I was taking the plate
away. Everything would go on the floor. Oh, yes, a nightmare
situation! He thought I would never dare to do something like that
in front of guests, and he took advantage of that. So I started
even doing it with other people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became more mad and it was not nice. But after a lot of
fighting he understood. Now he knows he cannot eat everything, only
one portion. There is no drink anymore, no wine. He is very good,
and I am proud of him now.'' Pavarotti has lost 42 pounds, says the
New York Post. According to Mantovani, he ``is not enormous. The
legs are quite slim.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. &UR; Joe Waldholz &LR; , who is spending 37 months in Allenwood
Federal Prison for embezzling more than $4 million from the father
of his wife, former Utah Representative  &UR; Enid &LR; , has lost almost 120
pounds in the hoosegow, reports the Washington Monthly.
</P>

   - More New Yorker editor possibilities, floated from near and
far: Knopf editor  &UR; Sonny Mehta &LR; , Salon founder  &UR; David Talbot &LR; , GQ
editor  &UR; Art Cooper &LR; , Conde Nast editorial director  &UR; James Truman &LR; 
and  &UR; Jon Carroll &LR; . Names that haven't come up yet:  &UR; Ginger Spice &LR; ,
 &UR; James Fallows &LR;  and  &UR; Dan Quayle  &LR; (who was unavailable for  &UR; Si &LR;

 &UR; Silbert &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   - Following last week's item about Web sites,  &UR; Jeff Pelline &LR; 
directed Personals' attention to www.sfchronicle.com, which an
entrepreneur _ who has nothing to do with this newspaper _ is
offering for sale, with the come-on, ``over 84,000 (unique)
visitors per year!'' And  &UR; Bob Lacey &LR;  remembers that  &UR; Will Durst &LR; 
once ``registered a Web site that's worth absolutely nothing:

<P>
   -  &UR; Bob Treuhaft &LR;  credits the U.S. embargo for the toilet paper
origami in Cuban hotels: Baby-soft American-style stuff ``would

``crinkly European style paper'' makes this art possible.
</P>
<P>
   - The Irish band Boyzone has been hired by  &UR; Mohamed Fayed &LR;  to
perform at the opening of the summer sale at Harrods, and then
outside the department store at midnight on August 31, to

</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Frank Viviano &LR; , The Chronicle's man in Paris, reports that
 &UR; Stuart Canin &LR; , former concertmaster of the San Francisco Symphony,
couldn't resist temptation when he came upon four street musicians
at the Place des Vosges. He joined in on a Beethoven string
quartet.
</P>
<P>
   - News that the French bank, Credit Foncier de France, which
indirectly is responsible for management of the Eiffel Tower, might
be sold to an American company owned by General Motors, created a
stir in Paris last week.  &UR; Philippe Domanati &LR; , a conservative city
council member, said it was ``inconceivable and unacceptable'' that
Americans have a major role in managing the tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It took a formal reassurance by the French Ministry of Finance
that the City of Paris would always retain control to undo the ado,
said British newspapers.

   ``The moment of lunch and dinner was always a nightmare for
me,'' she said. ``We had very big fights. I was taking the plate
away. Everything would go on the floor. Oh, yes, a nightmare
situation! He thought I would never dare to do something like that
in front of guests, and he took advantage of that. So I started
even doing it with other people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became more mad and it was not nice. But after a lot of
fighting he understood. Now he knows he cannot eat everything, only
one portion. There is no drink anymore, no wine. He is very good,
and I am proud of him now.'' Pavarotti has lost 42 pounds, says the
New York Post. According to Mantovani, he ``is not enormous. The
legs are quite slim.''

said British newspapers.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Cyberspace Tell-All  
   
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR; New York &QL;  &LR;
<P>
   Michael Wolff speaks softly but wields a wicked pen.
</P>
<P>
   The writer-turned-Internet entrepreneur-turned writer has just
published a scathing tell-all that chronicles the early days of the
online Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' is Wolff's biting first-person account of how his
company, New York-based Wolff New Media, landed him in the inner
circle of Net pioneers, including Wired magazine founder Louis
Rossetto and America Online Chairman Steve Case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The book rips new media, old media, Wall Street _ and Wolff
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most heinous deeds were committed by me. I was a guy in
business who would have done nearly anything to survive,'' says
Wolff, who lives in a spacious, nearly empty Upper East Side
apartment with his wife and three kids.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, he wrote that New York venture capitalist Alan
Patricof ``resembled a mental patient'' and described Case as ``an
affable, nondescript, chinos and button-down guy with a layer of
baby fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that other Wolfe _ Tom _ Michael Wolff practices ``new
journalism,'' nonfiction dressed up with quotes and color to
resemble a novel.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface, Wolff explains how he gathered his treasure
trove of trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``At conference tables, board meetings and industry gatherings,
while others were scribbling to-do lists on their legal pads, I
found myself recording observations and jotting down telltale lines
of dialogue on mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's irreverent take how companies that were losing millions
of dollars suddenly became worth billions hasn't gone unnoticed by
some executives.
</P>
<P>
   AOL executive Ted Leonsis, whom Wolff described as a ``fat man,
an ugly man, sweating like crazy,'' has blistered Wolff with
equally vitriolic e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a loser _ and you are looked at as a whiner. ... Suck
it up _ what's next for you _ a guest spot on Geraldo or Jerry
Springer?'' Leonsis wrote in a message to Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Others are also miffed &UR; .  &LR; ``I understand that ``Louis (Rossetto)
feels betrayed, (Cnet co-founder) Halsey Minor is furious and CMP
is apoplectic,'' Wolff says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Louis' case, that's unfortunate, because I think he made an
incredible accomplishment that was described in the book. But he
doesn't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys are threatening lawsuits against Wolff. And CMP Media,
a billion-dollar Long Island publisher of computer magazines,
blamed a stock dip on his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seriously, off-the-charts reaction,'' says a bemused
Wolff. ``The industry is so bloodless and one-dimensional in how it
wants to be perceived. These people are funny, but they want to be
perceived as serious people, leading the most serious industry in
the world's greatest economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' shatters that myth, in a series of caustically
comic vignettes that center around Wolff's attempts to raise money
and create a new media empire.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff New Media developed a series of best-selling books about
the Internet and operated one of the first online Web-site
directories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Burn Rate refers to the amount of money a startup spends each
month that exceeds its income.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the tens of millions of dollars that Wolff had tried
to raise didn't materialize and his company closed shop in the
spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wolff, 44, is back to writing, doing a weekly column for
the Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   His first job out of Vassar College was with the New York Times.
He has also free-lanced for Rolling Stone and Playboy and has
penned two critically acclaimed books _ ``White Kids'' and ``Where
We Stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Over pizza in an East Side restaurant, Wolff castigates AOL,
calling it ``the most dysfunctional company in America. The
underlying reason for their success is selling sex and fantasy
role-playing in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that Yahoo's ``estimated $9 billion market value doesn't
make one bit of sense to me, there is nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Most of all, Wolff is scornful of Silicon Valley, which he
describes in an interview ``as a one-company town, it's
Detroit-like. Everyone knows someone in high-tech, everyone is
working toward the same goal, they're all on the same team. They
all work and eat together. And those company cafeterias _ they make
me want to stand up and scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff says a chief complaint about his book is that it revealed
anecdotes that took place during confidential conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't believe this guy, a former journalist, was taking
notes in executive meetings. Their attitude was, `You can write
about us, but only on our terms.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The valley may hate ``Burn Rate,'' but Hollywood loves it.
According to Wolff, several film and TV studios have approached him
about bringing his book to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff calls ``Burn Rate,'' which took six months to write, a
`cathartic experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Among everything else, this is a very funny story,'' Wolff
says, ``I wanted to write a real story on the absurdity and chaos
theory that go into startups. If that means calling a buffoon a
buffoon, a cheat a cheat and a mental patient a mental patient, so
be it.`

DOW CHEMICAL NOT LIABLE IN CALIFORNIA IMPLANT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET CHIANG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
the co-owner of silicone breast implant-maker Dow Corning Corp.
cannot be sued over illnesses that women in California suffered
from the product.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said Dow Chemical is not liable for any harm
caused by the implants made by its now-bankrupt partner, Dow
Corning.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1995 as a means
of legal protection from almost 20,000 lawsuits brought by women
claiming injury from the implants.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-to-1 decision Thursday, the state Supreme Court said
Dow Chemical could not be held legally liable for its part in doing
research on silicone toxicology for Dow Corning in the 1940s and
1950s, before the silicone breast implants were produced.
</P>
<P>
   When Dow Chemical conducted and performed the research, ``any
risk of physical harm to plaintiffs from negligent performance of
that undertaking was unforeseeable,'' wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle
Werdegar in the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Corning began making breast implants in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, women began filing lawsuits against Dow Corning
claiming that leaks in the implants had caused a variety of
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1992, the breast implant cases in California were
coordinated into one legal action.
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego trial judge threw out the lawsuits in 1994, a
decision upheld by a state appeals court in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In affirming that dismissal, the high court said there was no
evidence that Dow Chemical had undertaken any duty to ensure the
safety of the implants.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical officials were delighted by the ruling, which they
said is consistent with decisions in Michigan and New York
dismissing similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``is consistent with a growing recognition in the
courts that science, the facts and the law do not support
plaintiffs' claims in implant cases,'' said John Scriven, Dow
Chemical vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the decision will help facilitate the resolution
of these claims in Dow Corning's bankruptcy process.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Thursday's ruling will have little, if any, effect
on a separate $3.2 billion agreement reached Wednesday between Dow
Corning and lawyers for tens of thousands of women across the
country.

IN MULTIPLE MEDIA, CNN SPRAWLS OVER THE WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the precision of a professor giving a lesson
in economics, CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer described the division
of his daily labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do a spot from the White House, it'll air on CNN,''
said Blitzer. ``Then it'll air on CNN Headline News. Then CNN
International. Then CNNfn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it'll air on CNN Radio. Then they'll give it to CNN
Newsource. Then to CNN en Espanol. Then our interactive Web will
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer paused, not dizzied at all, apparently, by the specter
of one of his stand-ups on the White House lawn undergoing such a
multiple-media metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of CNN,'' he confided, ``is that they've amortized
the news.''
</P>
<P>
   The CNN programming that Americans see on their television
screens derives from CNN/US, which is but one part of the sprawling
entity that is the CNN News Group.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN News Group encompasses six cable networks (CNN/US, CNN
Headline News, CNN International, CNNfn, CNN/SI, and CNN en
Espanol), two radio networks, seven Web sites, the CNN Airport
Network, the Better Health Network, the College Television Network,
and the syndicated news service called CNN Newsource.
</P>
<P>
   It has 700 broadcast affiliates located all over the world,
enabling programming from CNN/US and CNN International to be
available in 190 million homes in nearly 220 countries and
territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is the best-known brand in the world,'' declared Richard
Kaplan, president of CNN/US.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a pointed reminder that beyond the tip lies the rest of
the iceberg, Kaplan added: ``The downside is people think they know
you, and they don't.''

STUDIO SNUB NETS COPPOLA $60 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 AM-COPPOLA-PINOCCHIO-SFCHRON   By PETER STACK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola won $60 million in
punitive damages Thursday in his lawsuit accusing Warner Bros. of
thwarting his attempt to make a feature film about Pinocchio.
</P>
<P>
   That's on top of the $20 million the same Los Angeles County
Superior Court jury awarded in compensatory damages to the San
Francisco filmmaker, famous for his ``Godfather'' trilogy and
``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, who wept during the trial, said in Los Angeles after
the verdict: ``Warner Bros. has traditionally not treated its
creative people well. Hopefully, this will teach them to treat
creative people as an asset, not as serfs.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio, which the jury earlier found acted with ``fraud''
and ``malice'' in saying that it owned the screenplay Coppola
wanted to make into a movie, said through a spokeswoman that it
would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the jury in their verdict found that Warner Bros.
reasonably believed it had a contract with Mr. Coppola, there's
absolutely no basis for the jury's award of punitive damages, and
the $60 million amount is simply ludicrous,'' said Barbara
Brogliatti, senior vice president of corporate communications at
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeal is denied, Coppola could collect his award within
18 to 24 months, his attorney, Robert Chapman of Los Angeles, told
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the normal length of time, given the way the appellate
system is currently working,'' Chapman said. ``And we believe that
the jury's decision will be upheld all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, head of the American Zoetrope production company, based
in San Francisco's North Beach, filed the lawsuit in 1995. He had
asked for about $23 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Coppola said, ``I feel vindicated in
the long struggle with Warner Bros. and encouraged that the
individual can stand up against enormous corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood at his Columbus Avenue office was ``jubilant,'' said
one employee.
</P>
<P>
   The case, closely watched by writers and other artists unhappy
with some aspects of Hollywood business manners, dates to 1991. In
court, Coppola and Warner Bros. disputed a $3,100 fee he got from
the studio for ``Pinocchio.'' Coppola said in court he considered
the amount too small to bind him in any way to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The studio then threatened to sue any other studio that tried to
produce it even though it refused to pay Coppola to develop the
film. The director had previously tried to sell the project to
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Coppola film was to be a live-action version of
``Pinocchio,'' with an estimated budget of $100 million, according
to industry reports. It was to be a modern musical version set
against the story of a band of children escaping from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The major dispute in the case was whether Coppola and Warner
Bros. ever made a legitimate deal for Coppola to produce his
``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the compensatory damages award, the $20 million was based on
the fees Coppola would have collected for writing, directing and
producing. The figure included a projection of gross profits had
the film been moderately successful. The jury used the box office
earnings of his 1992 ``Bram Stoker's Dracula'' to make its
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said his client ``clearly touched the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely gratified, because he always wanted to tell
his story to a group of 12 regular people. He knew they would
understand. He was overwhelmed by the amount of the judgment, but
it is fair _ studios have to learn they are required to follow the
law and the rules just like everyone else,'' said Chapman. ``It's
an important day for artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. denied it prevented Coppola from proceeding with
his ``Pinocchio'' project at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The project was one of three Coppola negotiated with Warner
Bros. A second, ``The Secret Garden,'' was made under the Warner
banner, and the third, ``Hoover,'' is still in development,
according to the studio.

   &UR; Ratings for the CNN news network soar during crises, scandals,
and big, breaking events. But when news becomes routine, viewership
slips sharply. Under CNN president Richard Kaplan, the network is
trying to attract more long-term viewers. In a two-part series,
Boston Globe writers Don Aucoin and Mark Jurkowitz explore the
status of America's ``hearth'' for breaking news. &LR;

   &UR;  &LR; TV-CNN-I-SPCL (Atlanta) -- Over 18 years, CNN has carved out a

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton out of town on a muggy
Monday in May, the White House was becalmed and newsless _ a
circumstance at which CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer usually would
chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Blitzer wore a contented smile as he glanced at the front
page of The Washington Post, where the lead story was based on news
generated by ``Late Edition,'' his Sunday interview show. That sort
of ``pickup'' matters greatly in this political hothouse of a city,
where TV's ``Sunday talks'' are judged ruthlessly by how much news
they break.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, more direct measure of a network's impact
than scoring a Beltway bull's-eye: namely, how many viewers are
watching? On that score, CNN fell short on that day, just as the
network falls short whenever there are no bombshell stories
riveting people to their TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   No news is bad news for an all-news network, and on its slowest
days, CNN's ratings sink to the neighborhood of the Home &AMP; Garden
channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN does wonderfully when there's a major news event, but they
lose momentum any time there's no major crisis or hugely
fascinating story,'' said Lawrence K. Grossman, former president of
NBC News. ``When their audiences are small or minuscule, they have
to worry a lot about their ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, there is cause for significant worry these
days at CNN. Mark Twain once defined a classic as ``a book which
people praise and don't read.'' CNN is struggling to shake an image
as a network that people praise and don't watch.
</P>
<P>
   That is why new CNN/US president Richard Kaplan opted to
mobilize CNN behind a new ``NewsStand'' series _ the magazine show
whose debut was badly tarnished when the network had to retract the
``Tailwind'' story alleging that the US military used nerve gas in
1970 on defectors in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   That setback notwithstanding, there was a competitive impetus
for change. While CNN clung year after year to its identity as a
plain-vanilla news service, aggressive new players joined the
all-news game that CNN invented and began poaching its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, around-the-clock competition for serious news viewers
comes at CNN from all directions, ranging from splashy national
upstarts like MSNBC and the Fox News Channel to the Internet and
local outlets such as New England Cable News.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers are playing for keeps, and some of them see CNN's
leap into prime-time newsmagazines as another symptom of the
network's vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN is, in my view, trying to save itself from terminal
boredom,'' said John Moody, vice president of news at the Fox News
Channel, an all-news cable outlet that was founded less than two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've chosen an interesting route: creating huge
controversies about their reporting,'' Moody added, in a caustic
reference to Tailwind. ``It's not boring. I don't think it's what
they had in mind, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, CNN clearly had to do something. Its viewership (along with
general viewership of other networks and local stations) has
declined since the early 1990s. Just last month, a survey conducted
by the Pew Research Center found that only 23 percent of
respondents said they watched CNN regularly, down from 35 percent
in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While CNN is less financially dependent on ratings than
broadcast networks, since cable operators pay a fee to carry its
programming, its chronic ratings woes underscore the oddly
precarious position the world's leading all-news TV network finds
itself in.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its vulnerability to news slumps, CNN is battling ominous
trends. For one thing, surveys show that American viewers are
tuning out foreign affairs in huge numbers. That's dire news for a
network whose calling card for the past 18 years has been its
no-dateline-is-too-distant coverage of international news.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the news environment has changed dramatically in
the post-Cold War era. As the nuclear threat receded, Americans
have developed what Bernard Kalb, host of CNN's ``Reliable
Sources,'' has described as ``a blissful indifference to the
urgency of news.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno sees major implications
for his network. ``We have to be honest, that we are in an era of
bits-and-pieces news,'' Sesno said. ``We've got relative
prosperity, relative peace, and there's no epic story that
dominates the front page every day such as a civil rights struggle
or a recession. The news environment has changed, the interests of
our viewers have changed, and our storytelling has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as CNN tries to reinvent itself, the question arises: Has
CNN waited too long, and given its new competitors too much of a
foothold to stave its audience erosion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are three (all-news) cable networks ... and the
viewership for all of (television) journalism is in rapid
structural decline,'' said media analyst Tom Rosenstiel. In
revitalizing CNN, he added, Rick Kaplan faces ``a lot harder job''
than he would have had just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With CNN reeling from the credibility blow delivered by the
Tailwind fiasco, Kaplan's job may have just gotten harder still.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At CNN headquarters in Atlanta, not far from Kaplan's office,
hangs a telltale graph that vividly shows the 18-year history of
CNN's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Four sharp points reach into the air like church spires,
reflecting the network's ratings spikes during the Gulf War, the
O.J. Simpson freeway chase, the verdict in Simpson's murder trial,
and the Al Gore/Ross Perot NAFTA debate. (Shortly after CNN
mesmerized sleep-deprived Americans with its nonstop coverage of
the 1991 Gulf War, CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson ran into
American tourists while hiking in Peru. ``We came down here to get
away from CNN,'' they told him.)
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ratings graph looks like a freshly mowed lawn _
reflecting CNN's flat numbers in normal, calmer times. Take May 3,
when Blitzer's ``Late Edition'' won the news race but lost the
ratings race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Edition'' drew 517,000 households for its first hour
before climbing to 708,000 households during its final half hour.
While that was a strong showing by CNN's standards, it nonetheless
represented only half as many as the number tuned into ``Fox News
Sunday,'' an interview show the Fox broadcast network launched just
two years ago. NBC's ``Meet the Press with Tim Russert'' drew 3.2
million households, ABC's ``This Week with Sam Donaldson and Cokie
Roberts'' 2.6 million households, and CBS's ``Face the Nation'' 1.6
million households.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the overall ratings numbers this year encouraging for
CNN.
</P>
<P>
   From January through March, as CNN joined the media frenzy over
allegations that President Clinton had an affair with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, an average of only 507,000 households per
day were tuned in to CNN, according to Nielsen Media Research. From
April through June, as the Lewinsky story abated somewhat, CNN's
average numbers dropped still further, to just 348,000 households
per day, about as many viewers as watch Country Music Television.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 top-rated programs on basic cable in the first
quarter of 1998, CNN had two, a special on the Texas woman facing
execution and the State of the Union address.

YOUNG AUTHOR TAKES A `SPIN' IN CALIFORNIA'S POLITICAL CIRCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Republicans have sex for fun. At
least that is what the author of a new novel, ``Spin,'' would have
you believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spin'' is billed as a trashy morality tale set amid the
``glamour, excess and power of California GOP politics,'' featuring
an Armani-clad Machiavelli with goals that reach far beyond
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In this political potboiler, the likes of Michael Huffington and
former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle _ both former bosses of author
Tom Lowe _ are not-so-subtly turned into fully functional sex and
scandal machines named ``Edward Winston'' and ``Brett Alexander.''
</P>
<P>
   Published by Pocket Books, ``Spin'' has gotten attention from
U.S. News &AMP; World Report and George magazine, which declared it:
``Sex Conservative Style: Republicans take cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Some California Republicans aren't taking ``Spin'' (304 pages,
$23) too seriously. ``It's so outrageous. It's a joke,'' said
longtime GOP consultant Jim Camp. ``People are just laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, 26, was a low-ranking campaign operative for Huffington,
an unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidate, and a former press aide to
Pringle. He insists he only borrowed backdrops from recent
California history for ``Spin,'' which went on sale last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I had a lot of good material for a novel,'' Lowe
said. ``What was important to me was to have a plot. A book like
`Primary Colors' (about President Clinton's 1992 campaign) doesn't
really have a plot because you basically know what happened.
Clinton got elected. I knew I couldn't count on Curt Pringle or
Michael Huffington to make this thing a best-seller. I knew I had
to have a really compelling story, a moral story.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot lines to ``Spin'' aren't just backdrops. Lowe has
lifted the entire tumultuous history of the Republican fight in
1995 to replace former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, not the mayor
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The fictionalized account is told by Jim Asher, speechwriter to
the eventual GOP speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The novel includes an episode in the beginning that Lowe insists
is true: A drunken Asher has carnal relations with two women on the
speaker's desk, breaking a framed picture of the speaker's son. It
was never reported because most of the police officers who guard
the Capitol are ``good Republicans,'' according to the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The Asher character later convinces another woman that he
doesn't need to wear a condom, even though she's worried. She
doesn't even know his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Jim. And don't worry _ I'm a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the real world, the clubby GOP political scene has
pretty much ostracized Lowe _ while feigning indifference to the
novel. They were particularly upset after reading an article he
wrote last summer for the alternative newspaper, OC Weekly. Lowe
says he regrets some of the things he wrote in ``I Was a Gigolo for
the GOP,'' which was billed as nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me,'' Lowe said, ``is that some of the smaller
people in that article, the girls for example ... they would be
recognizable to the small group of people I was hanging out with. I
hurt some people's feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, Asher works to recall GOP Assembly Speaker ``Bryan
Gentry'' after Gentry works a deal with former Speaker Willie
Black. Asher sets up a decoy Democrat to split the vote and gets
his guy, Brent Alexander, elected and eventually elevated to
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, in real life, Republican Doris Allen was elected
speaker with the help of Brown. Allen was eventually recalled, and
replaced with another GOP turncoat, Brian Setencich. Several
Republicans were accused of recruiting a decoy Democrat to split
the vote in Allen's recall race in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, political consultant Bud Raper calls himself ``a
bar-brawling, cigar-stomping political gunslinger.'' GOP political
consultant Ed Rollins worked for Huffington and looks and acts a
lot like the Raper character.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe referred to Tolstoy and Hemingway in an interview. Jim
Asher read and absorbed Edmund Burke, Madison, Bloom, Strauss,
Plato and Olasky with ``astonishing greed and clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to imagine Tolstoy writing this: ``I understood
how to play the game. That's why I now lived my life as an Alpha
male. I ate Alpha food _ filet mignon. I drove an Alpha male car _
the Hummer. I had an Alpha male physique _ muscular and athletic.
Whenever I had time to think over decisions in my life, I always
asked myself: What would an Alpha male do?''
</P>
<P>
   He'd write a book. Get an agent. Hang out in Tahoe. Wait for the
movie deal.

 WASHINGTON: ... Union address.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When news breaks, people turn to us,'' said CNN's Johnson.
``When there is a quiet environment, they go back to soap opera and
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, NBC, ABC, and CBS _ the networks that Kaplan tells
the CNN troops are the real competition _ pull in 8 million
households apiece each night for their evening newscasts, week in,
week out, without regard to public interest in a particular news
story. During prime time, the broadcast networks draw even more
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blitzer pointed out that CNN's ratings numbers do not
reflect the network's large international audience, which Nielsen
does not measure. ``We're seen in 220 countries around the world,''
said Blitzer. ``While we may have a smaller audience (in the United
States) than the broadcast networks, worldwide we're seen by many
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he noted, when it comes to domestic viewers, CNN
operates in the cable universe, which is smaller than the broadcast
universe of 98 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   But still, CNN's programming is distributed to 73 million US
households. It is an American network competing with other American
networks for viewers, yet the cold truth is that at any time only
around half a million Americans consider it must-see TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest disappointments is that after the Gulf War,
we went back to our pre-Gulf War audience,'' conceded Blitzer.
``Maybe we should have done the `appointment-viewing' approach
we're doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Appointment-viewing refers to shows that viewers remember to
turn on and watch week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Moody, however, pointed to CNN's Tailwind embarrassment as
an object lesson in the risks of grafting magazine-style,
``appointment viewing'' programs onto an all-news network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reconcile the concept of appointment viewing with
a news channel, for exactly the reason that has now caught CNN by
the butt,'' said Moody. ``There's too much of a push to put on
incredible stuff _ and in this case, literally incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rivals, while stressing their respect for CNN's
journalistic caliber and pioneer status, make clear that CNN now
inhabits a brave new world where its dominance is no longer
assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is there a large enough audience to sustain
numerous 24-hour cable news operations?'' said NBC's Russert, who
besides hosting ``Meet the Press'' has an interview show on CNBC
and makes regular appearances on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that CNN had the luxury of avoiding when they
were the monopoly,'' added Russert. ``They could do the news wheel
as much as they wanted. Now, however, they realize they have to go
with programming rather than rehashing headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   John Higgins, assistant managing editor at Broadcasting &AMP; Cable
magazine, said CNN, while still dominant, is destined to weaken.
``CNN isn't quite on the defensive because of MSNBC and Fox,'' he
said. ``But the faster they get strong, the worse (CNN is) in the
long run. Eventually, (CNN) is going to get eroded by the other
cable networks.''
</P>
<P>
   While not conceding that as inevitable, especially since the
advent of its new newsmagazines, CNN staffers such as anchor Judy
Woodruff take that threat seriously. ``To survive, we've got to be
aware of who our competition is,'' said Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for CNN is that the competition today takes so many
forms. For example, MSNBC, a joint venture of NBC and Microsoft,
boasts star power CNN cannot match, since it draws heavily on such
NBC celebrities as Jane Pauley and Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Sesno says of CNN's instantaneous transmission of news that ``we
were the Internet before the Internet was cool,'' but lately the
real Internet has come on strong as yet another news competitor.
The Pew survey found the number of Americans getting news from the
Internet at least once a week has more than tripled in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power among the all-news cable networks is so
delicate, one TV analyst said, that CNN's continued dominance would
be gravely threatened if MSNBC were the network that found the next
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As competitors like MSNBC try to unseat CNN, though, they are
tackling a widely respected organization that has made news _ and
even history _ while reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters such as Blitzer and foreign correspondent Christiane
Amanpour are considered among the best in the business. CNN's
traditional reputation for trustworthiness is no myth: A May survey
by the Pew Research Center indicated that among cable and broadcast
outlets, CNN ranked highest in believability, ahead of CBS's ``60
Minutes'' and network and local news.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, the former news director at WCVB-Ch. 5 in Boston
who is now director of broadcast journalism at Boston University,
said that reputation is well earned. ``When it comes to breaking
news, they're right on top of it. They set the agenda,'' said
Thistle. ``When I deal with CNN people, they don't know the word
`can't.' The enthusiasm level is very high; they're not arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, CNN has a direct impact on events, one that is unique
among television networks.
</P>
<P>
   A study of US press coverage of the 1989 uprising in China's
Tiananmen Square, published by Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics, and Public Policy, quoted a rival reporter as
saying it was CNN's coverage of events that forced other networks
to increase their live coverage, bringing a global spotlight on the
crisis and ``setting an agenda for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of foreign leaders, from Moammar Khadafy to Saddam
Hussein, have used CNN's airwaves as a bully pulpit. Peter Arnett's
stint as the lone Western journalist in Iraq sparked a debate about
his patriotism and journalistic neutrality. In the '80s, Poland's
Communist government agreed to include a half-hour of CNN on the
nightly newscast to mollify the Solidarity trade union. After the
United States invaded Panama in 1989, the Soviets used a statement
on CNN to register their reaction. According to Eason Jordan, CNN's
president of global news gathering, the old Soviet KGB established
a unit dedicated to monitoring CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (CNN) has had a very significant impact, probably much
more outside the country than inside,'' said Barrie Dunsmore, the
former ABC News diplomatic correspondent who has written about the
impact of television on geopolitics. Leaders like Boris Yeltsin and
Hussein make judgments based on the network's coverage, Dunsmore
added. ``There really isn't an equivalence to that in previous
times. ... It's very easy to misread the reality of a situation
based on a hiccup in attention from CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan acknowledged that ``clearly, at times, our reporting and
the pictures we show have driven policy. If that results in some
policy changes, that's only a natural process.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called CNN effect on geopolitics is the subject of much
scholarly discussion and plenty of think-tank manifestoes. But the
grim reality is that news may not sell: The Pew survey indicated
that only 16 percent of respondents followed international affairs
``very closely.'' And Yeltsin and Hussein don't get counted by
Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of the world have often turned to CNN in times of
international crisis. Now, recognizing that that is not enough, CNN
is striking out in a direction with no clear signposts, in hopes
that new viewers will join them along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are at a crossroads,'' acknowledged Judy Woodruff.
``We're rethinking: `What is news?'''

 (a and e coding)  
 ATLANTA: ... different niche.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the ill-fated nerve-gas story demonstrated, the CNN/Time
program (Sundays and Mondays) is intended to be an
attention-grabbing newsmagazine. The CNN/Fortune pairing
(Wednesdays) is business-oriented, looking at subjects ranging from
the popularity of corporate jets to the rise of Michael Dell's
computer company. The CNN/Entertainment Weekly effort (Thursdays)
is a showbiz program with some newsier edges. The first episode,
for example, featured a ``Spin City'' segment on the Hollywood
hired guns who help polish the images of wayward stars who have
ended up on the police blotter.
</P>
<P>
   The next major surgery on the lineup occurred on June 22, when
CNN's nightly ``Moneyline with Lou Dobbs'' was expanded into an
hourlong ``Moneyline News Hour'' (6:30 p.m. weeknights) that is
CNN's answer to its broadcast cousins' nightly news shows. The
program makes use of CNN's reporting resources and has morphed from
a Wall Street roundup into a hybrid of business and world news
where the crisis in Nigeria gets about equal billing with a surge
in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Dobbs in a recent interview, is to broaden the
reach of his old show ``to the political economy. ... It's going to
be a very serious broadcast. ... I probably shouldn't acknowledge
this, but this is going to be very close to being news for the
know-it-all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kaplan strategy for CNN is to produce more provocative
programming without dumbing down the network, ``to make the
presentation worthy of the scope of the network,'' as he says. The
trick is to get viewers to think of CNN as something other than a
perpetual newscast. The blueprint calls for shedding the network's
faceless-anchor image and developing stronger personalities;
creating prime-time programming, like ``NewsStand,'' with clear
identities and themes; and pouring more energy into distinctive
long-form journalism.
</P>
<P>
   At Kaplan's prodding, CNN has produced a stream of nightly
specials on issues like campaign-finance reform and tensions with
Iraq. One day after The New York Times created a furor with its May
3 story suggesting major breakthroughs in cancer treatment, for
example, CNN was on the air with a prime-time special on the
subject. Early returns indicated that these specials were bumping
up CNN's ratings by anywhere from 50 to 200 percent for that hour.
</P>
<P>
   This past January, the network unveiled an ambitious Sunday
night documentary series, ``CNN Perspectives,'' which has tackled
such subjects as Holocaust survivors and life in war-torn Sarajevo.
Some of CNN's plans are epic in scope, including a 24-hour ``Cold
War'' series narrated by Kenneth Branagh, due to begin airing this
September.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of sprawling, cerebral programming that would
seem to present the most obvious conflict between CNN's
journalistic ambitions and its hopes for a mass audience. Still,
the bosses think the ``Cold War'' series can work on both levels.
In the most animated moment in an hourlong interview in May,
Johnson rose from his desk, clutched a handful of ``Cold War''
tapes, and announced that they contained evidence that the Cuban
missile crisis was even more dangerous than previously thought.
``In this,'' he exclaimed proudly, ``Fidel Castro makes
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   At a network where the credo was ``the news is the star'' and
anchors like Shaw and Judy Woodruff are not considered breakout
personalities, Kaplan has made headlines by actively trolling for
flashier talent. He dangled lucrative offers before CBS's Rather
and NBC's Tom Brokaw, who both turned him down. Others, however,
said yes, including ABC's Willow Bay and Judd Rose, both of whom
are now hosting ``NewsStand'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan's biggest catch so far is senior analyst and
``NewsStand'' co-host Jeff Greenfield, who built a reputation as a
brainy and provocative commentator at ABC. The Greenfield
acquisition was ``huge for me,'' said Kaplan. ``When you make him
part of the bouquet, people pay more attention to the rest of the
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield received a quick baptism of fire at CNN. &UR;  &LR; A week
after arriving in late January, he was hosting a prime-time special
_ called ``Media Madness'' _ that became an orgy of
self-flagellation over media outlets' performance covering the
Monica S. Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN said `Come here and you can stretch,''' said Greenfield in
early June. ``This was a place where I could do more.'' Greenfield
acknowledged that his CNN role is ``still evolving'' and that being
a host is an adjustment. ``All of this is a work in progress, and I
think you have to come here with that at the center of your
assumptions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield's already tricky transition has been complicated by
the Tailwind story, which he introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish it had not happened,'' he sheepishly declared on the
July 5 edition of ``NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most visible indicator of how far CNN has come since it was
launched _ reaching a paltry 1.7 million homes, and known by the
derisive sobriquet of ``The Chicken Noodle News'' _ is the
network's headquarters near downtown Atlanta. It looks less like a
news operation than a huge theme park designed around a central
atrium that includes the set of CNN's ``Talk Back Live'' show; a
CNN studio tour; and the Turner souvenir store. Spiraling around
the atrium are the CNN offices, which house some of the 3,500 or so
full-time employees of its sprawling empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eight independent networks,'' explained Kaplan several
months ago, while citing the advantages CNN has over competitors
like Fox News Channel and MSNBC. ``We have an assignment desk that
speaks 31 languages. We're talking about spending $700 million in
news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN's power is not strictly in resources. The network has
affected _ some might say revolutionized _ the journalism business.
``In many ways, CNN has served as an electronic version of the
Associated Press,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point may have come in the first days of the Gulf
War, when Americans, awakening with dark circles under their eyes
after watching CNN into the wee hours, realized that their morning
papers contained nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   In a critical and widely quoted article on CNN for The New
Republic in 1994, media analyst Rosenstiel wrote that after the
Gulf War, ``suddenly, CNN was on in newsrooms around the country,
... changing the consciousness of the people who put out
newspapers. Editors who watched CNN all the time started to assume
that their readers were watching, too.'' That, he concluded, led to
more of the narrative and interpretive-style journalism that is in
vogue today, as newspapers seek to give readers something they have
not already gotten from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hastened the trend among news organizations toward opinion
and interpretation over hard reporting,'' Rosenstiel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Tailwind flap, some might argue that CNN had
fallen into a trap of its own making _ forsaking its immediate-news
mission for the kind of dramatic storytelling that would grab
viewers' attention for the new show.
</P>
<P>
   That is the view voiced by Nieman Foundation curator Bill
Kovach, who says of CNN: ``I don't think you can make a mistake of
this magnitude and not suffer consequences. At what point is it
going to be possible for journalists to resist the pressure ... to
compete for revenue dollars rather than focus on quality?''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that despite this misstep, CNN's best bet is on
Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a vision,'' said Blitzer, this past week. ``He needs
some time, obviously, to get it going. But I have no doubt that he
is the man who can lead us to the level of journalism we want to
get to.''

   SCI-HYPERTENSION (Undated) _ When the National High Blood
Pressure Education Program was established in 1972, its message was
simple and compelling: Treating high blood pressure would save
lives. It was right. The program has been credited with
substantially lowering death rates from stroke and heart disease.
Since 1993, though, the news has been less encouraging. The stroke
rate has been creeping up again; the decline in heart disease is
leveling off; and kidney disease and congestive heart failure, both
linked to hypertension, are on the rise. Researchers are trying to
find out why. (3000 words) By Denise Grady.

<P>
   SCI-HYPERTENSION-DIET (Undated) _ For people with high blood
pressure who hate to take pills, recent studies have offered good
news: changes in daily routine can lower blood pressure enough to
let some people with mild hypertension postpone the need for
medicine or avoid it altogether. New experiments also suggest that
people who can lose excess weight, exercise regularly and limit
alcohol to a drink or two a day can sometimes lower their readings
enough to stay off drugs. By Denise Grady.

<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HYPERTENSION-FDR (Undated) _ Hypertension has played a
noteworthy role in the course of human events, especially the case
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt learned late in his
third term that he had dangerously high blood pressure but made
enormous efforts to conceal his illness, according to a new book,
``The Dying President.'' By his final months, Roosevelt could work
no more than four hours a day, the author says. (350 words) By

   SCI-PROTON-DECAY (Undated) _ Some physicists are eagerly hoping
to see some tiny blue flashes streak through a cathedral-size water
tank buried under a mountain: a signal that an inexorable process
of annihilation is gnawing away at the universe. The universal rot,
if it is real, will take untold eons to complete, but it will be
thorough, leaving no stars, no people, no monuments, no cinders, no
sonnets, no atoms, no memories. It's part of the search for the
Grand Unified Theory. (1660 words) By Malcolm Browne.

Lederman, 76, is known for his detection of the muon neutrino, the

physicist extant. Since he retired from Fermilab, he has been

REMAKING CNN PROVING DIFFICULT
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and e coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ AND DON AUCOIN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On June 7, amid a cloudburst of promotion, CNN debuted
an ambitious program designed to usher in a proud new era at the
world's leading all-news network.
</P>
<P>
   As the cable network's first serious move into the prime-time
newsmagazine world that has produced such valuable commodities as
``60 Minutes,'' ``Dateline,'' and ``20/20,'' ``NewsStand''
represented an attempt to transform CNN's identity, to parlay its
longstanding reputation for fast, fair television news _ for being
the channel Americans turn to when a crisis erupts _ into more
stable, long-running viewership.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Shortly before the premiere of ``NewsStand,'' a program he
created, CNN/US president Richard Kaplan sat in his Atlanta office
and enthusiastically predicted that the new show ``will get us a
lot of different attention and a lot of different eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Kaplan may be pondering the wisdom of the adage: Be
careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   The very first ``NewsStand,'' with its stunning allegation that
the US military used a deadly nerve gas during a secret 1970
mission in Laos dubbed ``Operation Tailwind'', has been a fiasco
for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the night it aired, there were troubling doubts
about the Tailwind story. Less than one month later, the network
was forced to retract it, three producers were out the door, and
Peter Arnett, perhaps CNN's most famous reporter, was reprimanded
and nearly fired. Kaplan contemplated quitting. His boss, CNN News
Group chairman Tom Johnson, submitted his resignation to network
founder Ted Turner, who refused to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   But late last week, Turner indicated how much damage the episode
had caused. ``Nothing has upset me more in my whole life,'' he said
at a Television Critics Association news conference. ``I feel
horrible about it. CNN has been my baby from the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the Tailwind trauma simply added to the litany of
recent media disasters, including the dismissals of New Republic
writer Stephen Glass and Boston Globe columnist Patricia Smith for
fabricating material in their work and The Cincinnati Enquirer's
$10 million apology for improperly obtaining material for an expose
about the Chiquita Brands company.
</P>
<P>
   For this media outlet, though, it was a debacle with a
particularly cruel twist. Rather than savoring its most innovative
programming move in years, a shellshocked CNN was left fighting to
regain its hard-won credibility.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years, CNN had carved out an enviable reputation for
earnest journalism. It had also become America's ``hearth'' for
breaking news _ the place where people flock in times when there is
information everyone's waiting for and everyone's talking about.
That place in our national life is reflected in the huge CNN
viewership for events ranging from the Gulf War to the freeway
chase of O.J. Simpson. Yet the network has had to face another fact
about its history: In less stressful times, viewers desert in
droves. No longer satisfied to watch its audience flow in and out
like the tides, CNN executives are trying to reinvent the network
as a place where news, entertainment values, and personality mix to
create distinctive programming and attract more viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're an underachieving network,'' said Kaplan in an
interview before the debut of ``NewsStand.'' ``We're averaging
about a 0.5'' rating, less than half a million households ``and we
should be getting a lot more. ... All of a sudden, we've come to a
fork in the road and there's only one path to go. And that's up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the Tailwind story hangs like a dark cloud over
the network's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shaken by the setback, but we're moving quickly to get
over it,'' senior White House correspondent Wolf Blitzer told the
Globe last week. ``Are we over it? No. It will take some time. But
the best way to get over it is to show everybody we're going to
break stories and do in-depth journalism and regain whatever
confidence may have been lost due to this one mistake _ albeit a
big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters last week, Gerald Levin, chairman of Time
Warner, which is CNN's parent company, expressed his confidence in
the Johnson-Kaplan team.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the nerve-gas story fiasco, the big question was
whether stronger competition, embedded viewer habits, and changing
news technology would doom CNN's strategy. Now, Tailwind raises the
stakes, and a daunting question: Will CNN become a victim of its
own ambitions?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a corporate entity, the CNN News Group might be fat and
happy. It comprises 13 operations and 36 foreign and domestic
bureaus, and earns about $300 million in annual profits on total
revenues of about $1 billion, revenue split roughly 50-50 between
advertising and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The network has also amassed an impressive list of journalistic
accomplishments since its inception in 1980. It consistently tops
public opinion polls in terms of reliability and credibility. It
has become America's network of choice in moments of drama. It has
changed the way global leaders do business. And it has functioned
as a video wire service for the rest of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe the public has been well served by the
presence of CNN,'' said Johnson in May, before the Tailwind story
was aired. ``I believe we have been there for them in Tiananmen
Square; ... in San Francisco'' for the 1989 ``earthquake; in
downtown Baghdad.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's problem, of course, comes during calmer moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an old story, the cyclicality of CNN's
viewership,'' said John Higgins, assistant managing editor at
Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine. ``So Kaplan is trying to organize
this into a better audience flow, particularly in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the Tailwind episode could have resulted in
Kaplan's departure sent chills through the CNN boardroom. More than
any other personnel or programming change, the hiring of Kaplan _
the 6-foot-6 former executive producer of ABC's ``World News
Tonight'' and well-known friend of Bill Clinton _ is the linchpin
of the new CNN strategy. Before landing him last August, Johnson
actively pursued Kaplan, 51, for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until Rick was hired that they said they were going
to create a different sensibility, a `show' sensibility,'' said
media analyst Tom Rosenstiel. ``The only `appointment' programming
they had was `Larry King' and `Crossfire.' They never really had
anybody with that kind of network experience.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``appointment viewing'' has become the CNN mantra:
In a May interview, Johnson said ``appointment shows'' would help
mark the ``third major wave or cycle in the life of CNN.'' The term
refers to programming that viewers will make a point of watching.
NBC's ``Must-See TV'' on Thursday night is the most spectacular
current example.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects ``Seinfeld'' to be reincarnated on CNN. But there
is a heavy burden on Kaplan to juice up the prime-time lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand'' is ``akin to what CNN launched on June 1, 1980, in
terms of magnitude and in terms of significance,'' said anchor
Bernard Shaw. ``Anybody who does not realize that we are evolving
into an entirely new era is missing the basic point of our
existence.'' Even the old familiar CNN studio is in the midst of a
$7 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsStand,'' the most expensive startup in CNN history, was
meant to be a showcase for corporate synergy. The show is one of
three collaborations with magazines which, like the network, are
Time Warner properties: Time, Fortune, and Entertainment Weekly.
These collaborative programs air at 10 p.m., most nights after
Larry King. Each has a different niche.

STOCK CAR RACING IS SPORTS JUGGERNAUT OF '90S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing; moved July 11; a and s coding; note
time references.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ All week long, they have been gathering near the
big oval track here, the 130,000 auto racing fans who will, again
this year, help make the stock car race at the New Hampshire
International Speedway the largest paid sports event in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 (TNN, 1 p.m. EDT) is just
part of the evidence that the National Association for Stock Car
Auto Racing is now years beyond its image as a provincial, niche
sport, a descendant of the good ol' boys who ran moonshine in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of NASCAR, stock car racing has become the
sports juggernaut of the 1990s. As the organization celebrates its
50th year, observers agree that it is the model of what sports, as
a business, should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of leagues ought to take a real lesson from how they
have marketed the sport,'' said Larry Moulter, president and chief
executive of Woolf Associates in Boston. ``It is a sport that is
really smart about how it sells its story.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of stock car racing is its fans, whose intense
loyalty to their favorite drivers and to the sport is a marvel on
Gasoline Alley and Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because NASCAR wasn't on television for so many years, its
legions of fans had to go to the races in person,'' said Shaun
Assael, who spent two years on the circuit to write a book, ``Wide
Open: Days and Nights on the NASCAR Tour.'' ``What they came to
understand is that it is best experienced that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds gathered in Loudon this week, it was clear that
the experience is about camping and family, as well as racing. With
thousands of recreational vehicles and trailers, the site resembles
a family campground, without the litter, but with a race track
attached. A look at license plates suggests that all New England
states have embraced stock car racing, along with New York and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction is all about the drivers and the cars,'' said
Bruce Reed of Hinesburg, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they don't go on strike and they don't screw up,'' said
Tom Gadhue of Richford, Vt. ``And they don't charge $100 per
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what this is all about is that, I think, everyone who
has ever sat in a car wants to know how fast it will go,'' Reed
said. ``Not everyone wants to play football or basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The track in Loudon was built with private funds and is
supported, to a great extent, by the two NASCAR races there every
summer, according to Bob Bahre, chairman of the board of the
speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The 83,000 ticket holders who actually get seats are offered the
first chance on renewals every October. Bahre said the renewal rate
is 96 percent, with 15,000 to 20,000 on a waiting list for tickets.
In other words, get on the waiting list now, and by 2003 you might
have a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Based on NASCAR numbers, Sunday's race and the New Hampshire 300
on Aug. 30 will generate at least $32.8 million for tickets,
lodging, food, and souvenirs alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total attendance in this decade has increased 47.4 percent at
tracks across the country, from 3.8 million to 5.6 million. It now
averages about 180,260 per event. During the same period, NBA
attendance increased by 17 percent, NFL attendance by 6 percent,
and major league baseball by 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New state-of-the-art racetracks have been built recently in
Southern California, Dallas, Miami, and Las Vegas. There are plans
for new tracks in Denver and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's television viewership is up 106 percent since 1991, and
it now beats the regular-season coverage of major league baseball
and the NBA, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of NASCAR-licensed products climbed from $60 million in
1991 to $600 million in 1996, according to NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking business statistic has been gathered by
the IEG Sponsorship Report in Chicago: NASCAR alone will account
for more than 10 percent of the $4.5 billion spent this year on
sports sponsorships by US companies. While $476 million will be
spent on NASCAR, the sponsorship of the four major professional
sports _ baseball, basketball, football and hockey _ totals $457
million.
</P>
<P>
   So sophisticated is NASCAR as a business that even enterprises
far removed from the rush and rumble of 200-mile-per-hour
straightaways should heed the lessons of the descendants of
back-road rum-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opera and the symphony could learn a lot from NASCAR,''
said Lesa Ukman of IEG Inc., the Chicago-based leader in analyzing
commercial sponsorships and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has really been smart with its fans, and it's made very
clear, in a very overt way, the direct links between their
sponsors' money and the benefits that the fans get,'' Ukman said.
``The fans understand that the sponsors keep ticket prices down and
pay for the new engine for their favorite driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what the opera and the symphony should learn: For
NASCAR, sponsorship is less intrusive than just a big part of the
fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, sponsorships in sports are commonplace. But when
NASCAR started linking companies such as Ford and Chevrolet to a
250-mile race on a dirt track at the Michigan State Fairgrounds in
Detroit in 1951, it blazed a trail that other sports,
entertainment, and recreational activities have followed,
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, other sports didn't think to do stuff with
commercial endorsements from companies,'' said William C. France,
the president of NASCAR and the son of its founder, William H.G.
``Big Bill'' France.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, for a while, we were ridiculed for doing that,'' France
said. ``But, you see, we didn't have television. Through the '50s
and and a lot of the '60s, it was our fans paying money at the gate
who would have been left to pay for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, a lot of other sports find themselves in a similar
position, because television is not paying for all of the big
salaries,'' he said. ``So, now, they are all doing what we did long
ago, as a matter of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   The throngs who attend races and a burgeoning television
viewership is older, richer, and better-educated, and includes more
women than one might imagine. According to NASCAR marketing
studies, 82 percent of fans are 25 or older, 64 percent are
married, 38 percent are women. Almost one-third earn more than
$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between NASCAR and other sports is the amazing
loyalty of fans to sponsors, and it all proceeds from the fact that
fan and sponsor were linked from the very start. It is of little
surprise to companies such as Kellogg's, Kodak and K-Mart that
NASCAR marketing studies show that 72 percent of its fans are more
likely to buy products from NASCAR sponsors than from anyone else.
Who cares if it even costs a little bit more, if it helps pay for
your sport and your heroes?
</P>
<P>
   Such fan loyalty helps drive a massive corporate investment in
stock car racing, attracting fully one in seven Fortune 500
companies, several of whom spend $10 million annually to sponsor
NASCAR drivers, cars or events.
</P>
<P>
   While the relationship between fan and sponsor is an intrinsic
part of racing, the relationship between fan and driver is its very
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has done it from Day One, and the drivers realize from
their history that in order to survive, they had to appeal to the
fans,'' said Robert G. Hagstrom, an investment strategist and
author of the book, ``The NASCAR Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking among the RVs and family barbecues in Loudon this week,
one does not hear the complaints typical in other sports, about how
the drivers are cry-babies, increasingly separated from their fans
by fame and riches, and far less skilled and gallant than the early
heroes of the sport. Instead, one hears of a fierce loyalty to men
they can literally touch.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the campers have flagpoles, and they fly, in order, the
American flag, the flag of their state, and a flag bearing their
favorite driver's number and colors. NASCAR drivers are famous for
their generosity to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty is the Babe Ruth of stock car racing, a legend as
famous for his feats on the track as he is for establishing the
sport as a fixture in American society. In 1972, Petty told Stock
Car Racing magazine: ``The people who come to see me race pay to
get in. If they didn't come, there would be no racing, and hence
there would be no Richard Petty. The very least I can do in return
is be nice and receptive to them and spend time with them, whether
they root for me or against me.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship has largely provided for NASCAR's ascendance
in an era of increasing cynicism about professional sports.

TED TURNED ON BY SAGA OF THE COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ CNN founder Ted Turner, mortified by the
network's embarrassment over its report on the alleged use of sarin
gas by U.S. operatives in Vietnam, is delighted if anyone changes
the subject, even if it's to discuss the possibility of nuclear
holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Turner decided CNN should do the definitive
piece on the half-century after World War II to show how close the
world came to total meltdown. The result is ``Cold War,'' a 24-hour
series that Turner, in his own humble way, calls ``one of the most
important television projects of the last several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who said he is sometimes ashamed to be in the TV
business, promised TV critics in Pasadena that ``Cold War'' will
not be a waste of people's time. It premieres in September and will
run in weekly installments into April.
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the happy topic of global annihilation, let us
not forget ``Planet of the Apes,'' that classic 1968 polemic on
what might have happened if humans had gotten too frisky.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, American Movie Classics won't let us forget. The
film that spawned four sequels and two TV series between 1968 and
1975 returns in September when AMC presents all five ``Apes''
movies and a new two-hour special, ``Behind the Planet of the
Apes,'' to mark the 30th anniversary of the first movie. It
explores how producer Arthur Jacobs put the project together after
many rejections, and how it came to be a marketing phenomenon that
broke ground for dozens of science fiction/adventure films that
followed.

<P>
   Action figure Charlton Heston, who appeared almost naked in the
first two ``Apes'' films, cloaked himself in nostalgia over the
weekend. Meeting with critics via satellite, Heston said he thinks
interest in the ``Apes'' oeuvre continues because the original was
a fine movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of created a genre of the space opera, which still
thrives,'' Heston said. Even the current escape-from-doomsday film
``Armageddon'' fits the category, he said, ``except it doesn't have
any dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Liotta twice turned down an opportunity to play Frank
Sinatra in a TV movie _ once on CBS, once on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   HBO persisted, and Liotta finally gave in. ``I realized I'm
getting to play a guy who sings `One for My Baby,' sleeps with Ava
Gardner and goes sailing with JFK,'' he said. ``That's a great
part.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his qualifications for playing the chairman of the board,
Liotta joked: ``I'm from Jersey, I've got blue eyes. Close
enough.''

and Don Cheadle as Sammy Davis Jr.) premieres Aug. 22.

   Annie Potts still steams over ABC's treatment of ``Dangerous
Minds,'' canceled last year after 17 episodes. This fall, Potts
stars with Lorraine Toussaint in another drama about race
relations, ``Any Day Now,'' on the Lifetime channel, and is more
hopeful about the show's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare when (network) shows are given a chance to dig their
roots in,'' she said. ``With Lifetime, we have a more secure
place.''

KIDS ARE DANCING THE JITTERBUG AND THE LINDY HOP OF YORE

<P>
   DALLAS _ In a Deep Ellum parking lot on a Wednesday night, a
couple is dancing hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   They are serious. They are sweating. They are perfecting their
Lindy Hop.
</P>
<P>
   Backs hunched, knees bent, eyes locked, they begin: swivel hips,
step-ball-change, turn around and start again.
</P>
<P>
   A horn section bellows from the bar next door, summoning the
faithful to the dance floor. A guy in a fedora keeps the beat,
singing 'bout a girl with two left feet.
</P>
<P>
   It's swing, man. A blast from the past. Get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kids these days: They're more and more like kids 50 years ago,
actually. At least in the way they're starting to dress, in the
styles they're beginning to emulate, in the bands they're making
popular.
</P>
<P>
   And in the way they're dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Swing music is back, albeit with a few '90s twists like tattoos
and Web sites. An ever-increasing community of kids under 40 is
resurrecting the big-band sound, the jump-blues of Louis Jordan,
zoot suits and saddle shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It's been happening for years in less geographically insulated
parts of the country _ San Francisco and LA spawned the movement _
but the Dallas scene has attracted national attention, and evenFort Worth is part of the cultural stampede.
</P>
<P>
   In April and May, swing surfaced at several unlikely Fort Worth
joints: the Aardvark, the Wreck Room, the 8.0, attracting kids as
young as 16. Before closing in January, the Split Atom Cafe had
drawn crowds with weekly swing lessons and bands like Mr. Pink.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, the swing scene consists of a few hundred dedicated
dancers and lifestyle adherents, not to mention an increasing
number of venues, say Mitch Baranowski and Elaine Hewlett. ``Mitch
and Elaine'' teach East Coast swing to the mobs packing the
highest-profile swing event around _ Thursday nights at the Red
Jacket, where Fort Worth's Johnny Reno and his Lounge Kings hold
court.
</P>
<P>
   The swing circuit includes about a dozen bars and clubs in the
Metroplex, and almost an equal number of bands, including imports
from Austin. On May 8, the first ``all swing, all the time'' club,
the Sand Castle Swing Lounge and Casino, opened its doors on
Northwest Highway in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we started playing the music,'' the kids started
showing up, says co-owner Craig Thompson. ``They're like rats. They
smell the music.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Lounge _ the Deep Ellum club where the aforementioned
couple was Lindy Hopping in the parking lot _ the Lakewood Rats'
four-man horn section whips up a melodic tsunami. Guys in gabardine
shirts and suspenders toss gals in vintage '40s dresses over their
heads and throw them through their legs. Garter belts are a-flyin'.
(For swing girls, panties are as public as purses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an ability in swing to be kind of campy and have fun
and make it more than just the tunes,'' says Lakewood Rats founder
and frontman Brian Hurley, 31. ``You don't have to be chock-full of
integrity like all these angst-ridden bands. People are sick of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream popularity has brought a bit of a swing backlash:
Some of the original converts in San Francisco apparently have
moved on (to what, we won't know for another five years). And with
1,000 people passing through Red Jacket on a recent Thursday, a few
regulars have decided to take a break from the club until the
curiosity-seekers fade out.
</P>
<P>
   But the hardcore swing kids contend the movement is no fad for
them. It's an aesthetic and a lifestyle defined by simplicity, an
``anti-mini mall mentality,'' and a desire to celebrate one of the
few truly American art forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swing is an alternative to the alternative,'' says Hewlett,
28, who drives a '66 Thunderbird, has dressed vintage all her life
and recently quit her day job to teach swing full time. ``It's a
way to look, a way to feel. It ties everybody together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good clean fun.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Originally, ``swing'' was a verb, not a noun. As the jazz
fathers of the 1920s knew, any music can swing: a waltz can swing,
Pearl Jam can swing. It's a matter of attitude and musical energy.
But nobody has ever really pinned down what swing is, not even the
great band leader Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think swing is a matter of some good things put
together that you can really pat your foot by,'' he once said. ``I
can't define it beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   The swing music of the '90s is an amalgamation of big band, jump
blues, rockabilly and western swing. Old recordings have definitely
energized the movement, but of the new swing bands very few
actually qualify as big bands, which traditionally had 14 to 16
players. And very few sound as symphonic. Instead, they've
introduced a more aggressive jump style than their earlier
counterparts. Think Dean Martin with a dash of Green Day played on
78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   It's a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, horn-driven sound with
lyrics that still rely heavily on humor, kitsch and romance. The
old songs have titles like ``Knock Me a Kiss'' and ``I've Got a Gal
in Kalamazoo.'' The new songs go by names like ``Hell'' and ``Big
Tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend encompasses the Charleston ('20s), two-tone shoes
('40s) and rat-pack chic, a la martinis and cigars ('50s, early
'60s).
</P>
<P>
   But its boldest manifestation is dance: variations on the
jitterbug, or the Lindy Hop (the dance they're doing in that Gap
khakis commercial).
</P>
<P>
   The Lindy came out of Harlem, so the story goes, where
African-American musicians were writing big-band jazz arrangements
as early as the 1920s. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew his plane
from New York to Paris, prompting headlines like, ``Lindbergh Hops
the Atlantic.'' Dancers in Harlem took to calling their eight-count
jitterbug after the aviator.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade passed before big bands became universally
popular. When Benny Goodman toured in 1935, reception to his
swinging arrangements (many bought from black musician Fletcher
Henderson) was cool to downright hostile. The country was barely
out of the Depression, and the working man wanted music to soothe
his weary soul.
</P>
<P>
   But the kids were a different story. When Goodman's band reached
Oakland, Calif., that summer, the line to get into the gig
stretched around the block. For the next 10 years, the nation would
be heady about big bands.
</P>
<P>
   There was more to this revolution than musicians looking for a
new groove and kids searching for an alternative to the fox trot.
Jazz, an African-American art form at its roots, would become the
first frontier on which blacks and whites broke the color barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1939, bands with both black and white musicians were
still unacceptable, in some cases illegal. Club owners stretched
rope down dance floors to separate black and white patrons, or
restricted blacks to the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   But a few influential jazz figures pressed for integration _
including band leader Artie Shaw, who hired Billie Holiday in 1938.
By 1940, Goodman's band included African-American musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the '30s, there was a search for an American culture,''
says Lewis Erenberg, a professor of history at Loyola University
Chicago and author of ``Swingin' the Dream: Big Band Jazz and the
Rebirth of American Culture.'' ``I see swing as not only the
commercialization of jazz, but also a rediscovery of American
tradition, and, in this case, African-American traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Inherent in swing was a broader definition of ``American'': The
band leaders and musicians, pop-culture icons of the time, were not
only black, but also Jewish, Italian, Irish, etc. Plus, with
Prohibition over and the Depression waning, Erenberg says, swing
expressed the nation's youthful energy, its power to heal itself.
</P>
<P>
   So why in the world is it back?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the swing rebirth has the punk movement to
thank. Punk rockers _ weary of cacophony, androgyny and a generally
bleak lifestyle _ grew up, says V. Vale, the San Francisco-based
editor and publisher of the book ``Swing! The New Retro
Renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can transfer the same driving energy from punk to
swing,'' says 29-year-old Baranowski. ``There's that gangster-bop
appeal, zoot suits, wild plaids and pinstripes. And it's just more
challenging musically.''
</P>
<P>
   Vale traces swing's rebirth to two key events in 1989: the Los
Angeles formation of the band Royal Crown Revue, and the opening of
the Deluxe, an Art Deco-style bar in San Francisco conceived as ``a
refuge from rock music.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Reno stumbled onto Royal Crown Revue while touring with
Chris Isaak in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into (premier Los Angeles swing club) the Derby on a
Thursday and I just went, `Wow.' Here's a club full of 21-year-old
kids dressed to the nines, and this band on stage is wailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like lots of early swing disciples, Reno, a saxophone player and
stalwart on the local music scene, grew up listening to big band
and crooners. By the time Red Jacket owner John Kenyon opened the
club in 1996, Reno had already recorded a portion of his first
album of swing tunes (aptly named ``Swingin' and Singin.'''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   He convinced the club to turn Thursdays over to his new band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the deal,'' Reno recalls saying. ``You've got to do it
every week and for at least a year. We'll start out taking
practically no money, and let's see if we can develop a scene.''
(Besides Red Jacket, Sons of Hermann Hall and the now-closed Lava
Lounge were also early supporters of swing in Dallas.)
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, kids familiar with the California bands
started showing up. When Reno recruited Hewlett and Baranowski to
teach dance lessons, the crowds shot up to 150 each week. When the
indy film ``Swingers'' found an audience, the Red Jacket numbers
doubled, Reno says. ``And the whole thing has kind of taken off
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to socialize and meet people,'' Reno adds.
``And that's a whole new experience for your under-30 crowd. You
can ask some girl to dance, and if you're reasonably courteous and
friendly, you can have a great time. And I think that really
appeals to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the bands Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo
Daddy, featured on the ``Swingers'' soundtrack, have won
major-label deals. And the rest of the music industry is scrambling
to catch up. ``Just about every A&AMP;R guy in every town is out there
looking for bands right now,'' Reno says.
</P>
<P>
   Is our hometown boy next? Reno will neither confirm nor deny:
``There are some great possibilities in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The twist put partner dancing on the back burner in the early
'60s, and rock 'n' roll, disco and grunge kept it there. If kids
were dancing at all, they were dancing by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, social movements arise out of needs,'' says
publisher Vale. Mainstream music no longer satisfies the desires of
a growing number of young people, he believes, especially the
longing for community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It translates to all sorts of levels,'' Vale says of the swing
attitude. ``Like getting to know the name of your grocer down the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Romance, courting, manners, dapper duds: The swing lifestyle
emphasizes a sort of old-fashioned simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting to the point where they want something more
engaging in a club atmosphere,'' says Matthew ``Taps'' Edwards, 24,
the host of KAAM/620 AM's ``Swing Shift'' show (6-8 p.m. Fridays)
and a swing teacher at the Sand Castle. ``It doesn't just have to
be a meat market.''
</P>
<P>
   Among swingers, drugs are passe and even drinking is considered
an inconvenience; ice water is the beverage of choice. ``Serious
swingers won't drink alcohol because you do those aerials _ it's
dangerous,'' says Edwards, who came to the swing scene 10 months
ago after a visit to the Red Jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in and they were playing `Sing, Sing, Sing' from the
soundtrack of `Swing Kids,' which I owned, and never thought
anybody would do that kind of dancing again,'' he says. ``And I
absolutely fell on my knees thinking, `I have found my home.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at the Sand Castle, Edwards is teaching 25 beginner
couples the Lindy Hop, outfitted in a double-breasted zoot coat and
wide-brim fedora. ``I've always dressed the part,'' he confesses.
``I had the nickname Ducky in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Valentine's Day dance, Edwards met his future swing partner
and girlfriend, Mandy Hofer, who demonstrates the women's part of
the Lindy wearing a floral dress and ankle-strap heels. She ends up
icing down her left foot at the end of the lesson. ``Someone with
very large heels got me,'' Hofer explains, wincing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards plans to open the first all-swing store in the Metroplex
in the coming months, complete with music and clothing. And when he
isn't at the radio station or the club, he's giving private lessons
in the roomy foyer of his parents' Plano home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of us,'' Edwards says, ``it's just a way to live
again.''

   SCI-HYPERTENSION (Undated) _ When the National High Blood
Pressure Education Program was established in 1972, its message was
simple and compelling: Treating high blood pressure would save
lives. It was right. The program has been credited with
substantially lowering death rates from stroke and heart disease.
Since 1993, though, the news has been less encouraging. The stroke
rate has been creeping up again; the decline in heart disease is
leveling off; and kidney disease and congestive heart failure, both
linked to hypertension, are on the rise. Researchers are trying to
find out why. (3000 words) By Denise Grady.

<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HYPERTENSION-DIET (Undated) _ For people with high blood
pressure who hate to take pills, recent studies have offered good
news: changes in daily routine can lower blood pressure enough to
let some people with mild hypertension postpone the need for
medicine or avoid it altogether. New experiments also suggest that
people who can lose excess weight, exercise regularly and limit
alcohol to a drink or two a day can sometimes lower their readings
enough to stay off drugs. By Denise Grady.

<P>
   And
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HYPERTENSION-FDR (Undated) _ Hypertension has played a
noteworthy role in the course of human events, especially the case
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt learned late in his
third term that he had dangerously high blood pressure but made
enormous efforts to conceal his illness, according to a new book,
``The Dying President.'' By his final months, Roosevelt could work
no more than four hours a day, the author says. (350 words) By
Laura Chang.

<P>
   SCI-PROTON-DECAY (Undated) _ Some physicists are eagerly hoping
to see some tiny blue flashes streak through a cathedral-size water
tank buried under a mountain: a signal that an inexorable process
of annihilation is gnawing away at the universe. The universal rot,
if it is real, will take untold eons to complete, but it will be
thorough, leaving no stars, no people, no monuments, no cinders, no
sonnets, no atoms, no memories. It's part of the search for the
Grand Unified Theory. (1660 words) By Malcolm Browne.

Lederman, 76, is known for his detection of the muon neutrino, the
subatomic particle that is one of the essential building blocks of
matter, and for the fact that he may be the wittiest particle
physicist extant. Since he retired from Fermilab, he has been

assuredly, endearing themselves to the people of Gotham.

smaller exhibit booths at last week's Macworld trade show in New

SUNSCREENS MAY NOT BLOCK WORST SKIN CANCERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when dermatologists and cancer specialists had Americans
convinced that sunscreens could protect them from skin cancer and
wrinkles, a scientist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York concluded after a review of available research that
sunscreens might not prevent melanoma, the deadliest form of skin
cancer, at least not the way products were formulated and used in
the 1980s. This news is particularly significant given the rising
rates of melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Dr. Marianne Berwick, even suggested that an
overdependence on sunscreens might actually increase the risk of
melanoma in susceptible people because sunscreens prevent sunburn
well enough to allow users to spend more time in the sun than they
otherwise might, without providing adequate protection against skin
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The report, presented in February to the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, set back decades of public health
education and left many wondering if medical science would ever get
it right.
</P>
<P>
   But before you leap to the unwarranted conclusion that you have
been duped once again by the health police, a closer look at the
effects of sunlight on skin and the effectiveness and proper use of
sunscreens is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Ultraviolet B, or UVB, radiation is the principal cause of
sunburn. The sun protection factor, or SPF, stated on sunscreen
products refers primarily to their capacity to block UVB radiation;
the higher the SPF rating, the longer a user can remain in sunlight
without burning.
</P>
<P>
   Most sunscreen products have little or no protection against
Ultraviolet A, or UVA, the principal form of radiation emitted in
tanning booths, which causes premature aging of the skin _ the
wrinkled, leathery skin common among sun worshipers over 50 years
of age. UVA radiation is also considered the primary rays involved
in skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While not minimizing the dangers of UVA, new research points to
the hazards of UVB rays. A study published in June by Dr. Ercem
Atillasoy, a dermatologist affiliated with the Wistar Institute and
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, demonstrated for the
first time that UVB radiation can also cause two of the deadliest
but least common forms of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and
melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   After testing the effects of UVB on human skin transplanted onto
immune-deficient mice, however, Atillasoy was surprised to find
that the most common form of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, did
not develop. He suspects that this cancer, which most often occurs
on the face, ears and other sun-exposed parts of the body and is
diagnosed in more than a million Americans each year, must be
caused by UVA radiation. He plans to examine this hypothesis with
similar mice with transplanted human skin.
</P>
<P>
   Before Atillasoy's study, there were no good animal models in
which to study human melanoma, in which other factors besides
sunlight play a role. Genetics, for example, is an important
factor. Fair-skinned people who do not tan easily, those with lots
of moles and those with a family history of skin cancer are more
likely than dark-skinned people to develop all forms of skin
cancer, including melanoma. And about 5 percent of melanomas occur
on the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and in the mouth and
sinuses, areas that are not exposed to sunlight, said Dr. Allan
Halpern, chief of dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that in about 95 percent of cases of melanoma, sun
exposure plays a role, directly or indirectly,'' Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific data, although imperfect, are still very strong
that there is a link between UV and melanoma,'' he added. ``We
still need to work out the details _ the specific wavelengths, the
doses and the timing _ but there is good evidence to suggest that
both UVB and UVA are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the unknowns is the importance of sun exposure in
childhood. Some research suggests that severe sunburns in childhood
set the stage for later development of melanoma. Childhood sun
exposure may be the initiating event that plants the seeds of a
cancer, but repeated sun exposure in adult life may be what
promotes the full-scale growth of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Also uncertain is the effect of the intensity and frequency of
sun exposure. People like farmers and fishermen who are always in
the sun get lots of basal cell carcinomas but have no greater risk
of melanoma than others less intensely exposed to sunlight. Halpern
said that repeated ``bursts'' of sunlight may be worse for
developing melanoma than continuous exposure, which would bode ill
for indoor workers who spend their leisure hours in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Berwick said she did not intend to discourage people from
using sunscreens, but rather wanted to emphasize that these
products were perhaps the least important step in preventing
melanoma and other skin cancers. First and foremost, she and others
insist, is to stay out of the sun as much as possible, especially
when it is most directly overhead _ from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in
the summer and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the winter. Keep in mind that
cloud cover provides little protection against UV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2 is to keep covered up when outdoors and not in the shade
by wearing a wide-brimmed hat, long sleeves and long pants, as well
as UV-blocking sunglasses to protect the eyes. However, few experts
have great hopes that Americans will heed such clothing advice when
temperatures rise above 80 degrees or before the problem of ``hat
hair'' is solved.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3 is to use a lip balm with an SPF rating of 15 and
liberally apply sunscreen with an SPF rating of 15 or higher on all
sun-exposed parts of the body every time you are outdoors. If you
are wearing a bathing suit, use at least one ounce of sunscreen to
cover exposed skin. Apply it at least half an hour before going out
and reapply it every few hours, even if the product is said to be
``water resistant'' or to provide ``all day'' protection.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer products, called sun blocks, protect against
UVA as well as UVB radiation. But all sun blocks are not equally
effective. Avobenzone (also called Parsol 1789) and oxybenzone do
not screen out as much UVA as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Zinc
oxide, the white paste that lifeguards often use on their noses and
lips, is the most effective sun block.
</P>
<P>
   A new micronized, transparent form of zinc oxide has been
developed by Dr. Mark Mitchnick, a pediatrician who is the medical
director of Sunsmart, a New York company that makes micronized zinc
oxide (sold as Z-Cote). That product has been incorporated into
some sun protection products, including the sunscreens Iguana, Key
West Aloe Sunsorb and the Body Shop SPF 30 stick and SPF 6 spray.
It is also in Skinceuticals' moisturizers with sunscreen, Daily Sun
Defense and Ultimate UV Defense, and will be introduced this year
into the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s Oil of Olay, the nation's leading
moisturizer with sunscreen. Zinc oxide's physical protection may be
preferred by people sensitive to chemical sun blocks.

BOND FUNDS REQUIRE SCRUTINY BEFORE JUMPING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Fort Worth and all needing; moved July 10 in advance
for July 12.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 35 years old, and I have $55,000 in stock mutual funds
with Vanguard, Janus, and Legg Mason (of which $17,000 is an IRA
account), $10,000 in U.S. Savings Bonds, $6,000 in an annuity, and
$10,000 in cash. I also have a $32,000 IRA invested in a CD which
matures soon. I'd like to invest the CD money somewhere with good
returns but relatively low market risk. A friend suggested a bond
fund. What do you think of this advice? Any ideas about a good bond
fund?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A.F., Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there are a lot of good bond funds out there, but I
won't tell you any names until I deliver a little lecture about
time and risk. At age 35, you will probably have this money working
for you for between 20 and 30 years. That's a long time. It's
certainly true that if you put your money in a good bond fund for
about 25 years, you will see a few bumpy seasons, but the general
trend will be relatively smooth. In my computer I have a program
tracking our investments, and an 18-month chart showing net asset
value (but not total returns) for one of our funds, Vanguard GNMA,
is nearly as flat as a table. The same is true if you look at the
longer records in the Morningstar Mutual Funds pages -- the net
asset value was $10.05 at the end of 1986; it's $10.44 as this is
written. Its 10-year record shows 9.26 percent average annual total
returns. If such a pace were sustained for 25 years, that would
turn your $32,000 into $294,890.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that when you're talking about two or three
decades, the odds are almost overwhelming that stock funds will
outpace bond funds. If you were to select a stock fund instead, and
if you achieved just one percentage point better returns than we
cited for the GNMA fund, the difference in returns over 25 years
would be $75,409. I suspect you're about as spooked with the
current market as I am, so I suggest a cowardly approach. Begin my
moving $31,000 of your IRA to Vanguard Prime Money Market fund,
putting the final $1,000 in Vanguard Index Value fund. Then
instruct Vanguard to move $925 from the money market to Index Value
every month. This will spread your investment period out over about
36 months (presuming average 5 percent returns from the money
fund). This is an investment discipline called dollar cost
averaging. If the market takes a substantial dip during the
investment period, you will be buying subsequent shares at lower
prices, reducing your average cost per share.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, suppose you're still hell-bent for bonds. My suggestion
then is this: build a portfolio of three bond funds, running most
of the risk spectrum. You might, for example, put a third each into
Vanguard Short-Term Bond, Vanguard GNMA, and Vanguard High- Yield
Corporate Bond funds. From this, you might expect a portfolio
average yield of about 7.1 percent, nbased on current levels. But I
still think you'd be better off adding that IRA account to your
list of stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're talking about Vanguard, here's an incidental note
for H.S. of East Falmouth: You can reach Vanguard by calling
800-662-6273.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Shortly I expect to receive $400,000 from the sale of my
home. From this amount, I must be able to pay for my rental
obligation. I'll need returns of 6 percent to 7 percent --
preferably 7 percent. My other living expenses are covered by
Social Security and CDs. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   H.S., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you might consider the bond portfolio I suggested for
A.F. in the question above, which would generate a 7.1 percent
yield at current rates.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that is that the most aggressive leg of
that portfolio -- the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund -- is
a member of the fund class that's usually called ``junk bonds.''
You'll have to decide whether you are comfortable with the risks
these bring. Junk bond funds typically invest in portfolios of
bonds graded BBB, BB, B and lower. Because of their relatively low
credit quality, these funds can experience two kinds of volatility
-- the interest-rate volatility that affects all bond funds, and
credit volatility. The latter situation makes these funds subject
to market pressure when the economy weakens and investors worry
that some of these lower-rated companies might not be able to meet
their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, though, is that Vanguard's junk bond fund is a
very conservative entrant relative to its peers. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds' last report, it held 5 percent of assets
in AAA-rated issues, 38 percent in BB-rated bonds, and the
remaining 57 percent in B-rated holdings. The average effective
maturity of the portfolio is 8.2 years, and the current yield is
8.4 percent. Morningstar reports a 10.25 percent average annual
total return over the last 10 years, and accords the fund a top,
five-star rating. (For the record, I own shares in this fund.) If
this makes you uncomfortable, you might decide to divide the
portfolio evenly between Vanguard Short-Term Bond and Vanguard
GNMA, a move which would bring the current portfolio yield to 6.5
percent, but which should give you a lower level of volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, because bond markets can be quite volatile, it's always
nice to withdraw a little less than the total yield if you can
afford it. For example, if you were to invest in the portfolio that
includes the junk bond fund, but to take distributions that
represent only 6.5 percent of your initial investment, the effect
would be that you would be reinvesting a little money each month --
probably enough to insulate your principal from market shocks over
the long haul, and eventually even to allow a little growth in
principal. If you were to follow such a course, withdrawing
$2,166.66 a month, and if rates held steady, you might expect that
over the course of a decade (which would of course see market bumps
of various proportions) your principal might have grown to
$421,659.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been out of college for about three years, and after
much soul-searching I've decided to enter the Peace Corps. After
paying all my debts, I have $7,500 in savings. My commitment will
be for 27 months service in a foreign country. Where would the best
place be to invest my savings over that period, providing little
risk and the ability to take out the money once I return?
</P>
<P>
   G.M., Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you are indeed looking for little risk, the menu of
options is pretty limited and boring. You might, for example, shop
around for the best two-year CD rate and then instruct the bank
that the funds should be automatically moved into a 90-day CD at
the prevailing rate when it matures. Thus your money would be
available to you precisely after 27 months, and you would know at
the outset what your earnings will be for the lion's share of the
time. Suppose you get 5.5 percent on the initial CD and that the
rate falls to 5 percent after the first 24 months; the result would
be that you'd have $8,570 upon your return.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be a fund money market fund from a mutual
fund company. Such funds provide an only minuscule level of risk
(but, unlike CDs, they are not insured by the government) and the
interest rate varies daily. As a general rule, if interest rates
tend to rise during those 27 months, you would be best off with a
money market fund; if rates tend to fall during the period, you'd
be best off if you locked in your interest rate through a CD.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be more venturesome, you might look at
conservative bond funds. For example, just looking at offerings
within the Fidelity family, the 30-day yield on June 30 for
Fidelity Cash Reserves -- its largest money market fund -- was 5.25
percent. If you went with Fidelity Short-Term Bond, the yield would
step up to only 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Imagining that such returns were constant over 27 months, that
would translate to a difference of only $52 in total returns for
the period -- not, in my opinion, enough to warrant changing from
the ultra-low risk money fund to the riskier short-term fund. In
fact, the only bond funds that seem to me to offer a significant
difference in total returns, given the relatively short period of
time involved, would be the junk bond funds. But these cannot truly
be considered offerings with ``little risk,'' so they probably
don't fit the bill.

STAYING ON ROAD TO PEACE REQUIRES MOVING BEYOND THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It came to me in Philadelphia last weekend that the greatest
achievement of any culture may be in coming to terms peacefully
with its own past. To make history our friend, we must learn to
avoid repeating its mistakes and to forgive them, since it's too
late to amend them.
</P>
<P>
   That's sound doctrine for nations as well as individuals. Parks
surrounding the natal shrines of our Declaration of Independence
and our Constitution were awash with celebrating crowds on July
Fourth. Mayor Edward Rendell presented the Philadelphia annual
Liberty Medal to former Sen. George Mitchell for his tireless
efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. That evening, the
70-year-old Japanese-American Citizenship League held its 35th
biennial convention nearby. It was the 10th anniversary of
Congress' belated recognition that American citizens of Japanese
ancestry should not have been dispossessed and incarcerated during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's patient accomplishment in reaching a settlement
between Roman Catholics and Protestants drew applause from 2,000
people assembled outside Independence Hall. ``I believe with all my
heart and soul that there is no such thing as a conflict that can't
be ended,'' insisted the former Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Eight political parties, leaders of both religious factions, and
the governments of Ireland and Britain joined in the peace accord
on Good Friday, agreeing to settle all future differences by the
political process rather than violence. A few die-hard extremists
on both sides are still noisily protesting.
</P>
<P>
   If that compact holds, it will mean the end of 30 years of
sporadic street clashes, retaliatory explosions, random slayings
and intermittent terrorism that have claimed thousands of lives
while repeatedly shattering the peace of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult challenge in bringing closure to both sides'
demands for vengeful retribution, said Mitchell, was in getting
both to ``move past'' all the outrageous history of atrocities and
grievances that can never be corrected. Historian John Dombrowski
of Catholic University said that ``the past is something that has
to be overcome, because it cannot be made right.'' The hardest
thing for peace negotiators like Mitchell is that each side insists
on one more ounce of revenge to redeem some past wrong and to
justify its own continuing mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often,'' Dombrowski said, ``the past and fear are
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   One group that seems to have mastered this lesson is the
Japanese-Americans. That evening, I talked with many who'd
experienced the humiliating blow of being imprisoned in camps for
three years during World War II and treated as treason suspects
solely because of their ancestry. They've come to terms with this
bitter period of their lives without allowing it to embitter them,
they assured me. They use it to teach their children tolerance and
a profound respect for others' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans can only imagine what it's like to be deprived of
liberty or to be presumed guilty of crimes against our country
because of things over which we have no more control than who our
ancestors were. But to those who've lived through such experiences,
the healing begins, I am told, by recognizing that we can't change
the past and by forgiving it.
</P>
<P>
   Without this, there's never closure.
</P>
<P>
   But equally important is the mastering of history's lessons so
as to avoid repeating its errors.
</P>
<P>
   I remember those times in 1942-44. At 20 and 21 years old, I was
flying combat missions in the South Pacific against the Japanese.
Even then, I felt that it violated the constitutional rights of
American citizens to be arrested without probable cause, removed
from their homes and herded into camps. The Army general who
directed the relocation refused to differentiate between citizens
and non-citizens. ``A Jap is a Jap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those permitted to prove their devotion to our country did so
admirably. The history of American heroism contains no more
splendid examples of valor than those of the 442nd Regimental
Combat Team, World War II's most decorated unit, composed solely of
Japanese-Americans, that fought through enemy lines to rescue the
surrounded lost battalion of the 36th division. In America, we've
been able to accommodate diversity within a peaceful social order
committed, at least in principle, to equality. Our ancestors came
from different places, but they sought the same things. They wanted
freedom, opportunity and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Because these principles have been enshrined in the
Constitution, it is difficult for most Americans to identify with
the deep-seated suspicions that underlie ancient ethnic and
religious hostilities in places like Northern Ireland, the Middle
East and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a youth, it was popular to speak of America as a
``melting pot.'' It isn't exactly that. We're not a common
distillery of ores from which emerges a single stream of sameness.
We're not identical, not impersonal creations of a computer
printout or a cookie cutter. Thank God! How dull we'd be.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, we actually celebrate our diversity. We make a
virtue of our differences. Our country is stronger because of the
different ores in our amalgam, our national tapestry more beautiful
for threads of different colors.
</P>
<P>
   An ability to acknowledge our own imperfections and close the
book on sordid chapters without assuming God-like properties of
vengeance has kept us afloat.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad we can admit we were wrong to imprison loyal Americans
of Asian origin. I'm proud, too, when somebody like George
Mitchell, steeped in our tradition of equality in diversity, can
help others find the way to peace.

FOR LEGENDARY FEDERAL JUDGE, RETIREMENT MEANS NEW QUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News service clients) 
By LINDA P. CAMPBELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When about 40 former law clerks met recently to
roast and toast veteran U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice,
they surprised him with a gift of flowing optimism: a new black
robe.
</P>
<P>
   He can use it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the 78-year-old Justice took senior status this
month after 30 years on the bench, the retirement system for
federal judges allows him to keep hearing as many cases as he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are delighted that Justice's judicial career
continues, even though he has left his Tyler, Texas, courthouse
seat to a new appointee. He will hear cases for the Del Rio federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   His critics, however, would just as soon he swap opinion writing
for gardening or golfing.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Justice has ordered schools desegregated, public
housing integrated, immigrant children educated and the state
prison system revamped, all to correct constitutional violations.
</P>
<P>
   He also sat on a three-judge panel that in the 1970s ordered
single-member voting districts for Tarrant and other counties,
forcing the Legislature to revamp its districting plan for the
statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   For his work, Justice has been lauded and lambasted, revered and
reviled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a very nice guy who did a lot of courageous things
in a pretty hostile environment over a long period of time,'' said
lawyer David Richards of New Mexico, a former Texas lawyer who has
tried voting rights cases before Justice.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, state Rep. John Culberson, a Houston Republican who
is trying to end the judge's continuing oversight of the prison
case, accused the judge of having ``a sort of instinctive
willingness ... to substitute his personal authority for the will
of the voters on many occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   To Justice, the criticism and kudos are all in a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control the way people feel about me,'' Justice said
last week in an interview at his tidy new Austin office, where
he'll share the courtroom used by judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to follow the law as I find it. If there's a gap in the
law, I'll make up my own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, he said, ``is supposed to be fair, just and decent. If
it's not, I'm always disappointed, but I follow the law, whatever
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tooling around in his sporty black 1991 Mitsubishi 3000, Justice
said he enjoys his virtual anonymity in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He has wanted to return to the capital since his law school days
at the University of Texas, but especially now, so he can see more
of his daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter. Justice said his
wife, Sue, is handling the house hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has many good friends in Tyler, Justice said he was
also aware of significant hostility in a small city where he
reshaped many ingrained habits. He received hate mail and ugly
calls over the years, although no one ever threatened him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Frank Kemerer wrote about the time that several
workers remodeling Justice's house walked off the job in the
aftermath of his school desegregation order in the early 1970s.
Kemerer also wrote about a petition signed by thousands of people
who supported the judge's impeachment after the school decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, James Brady, who owns a coffee shop near the
federal courthouse in Tyler, said the judge's fans tried to get a
petition to prevent his leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't like him,'' Brady said. ``I respect him
immensely because he did his job. He was doing what he thought the
Constitution said to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lore about Justice, ``the thing that probably gets lost
is, he is really a fun person,'' said Tyler lawyer Andy Tindel, a
family friend who has won and lost cases before Justice.
</P>
<P>
   A large photo of Sue Justice sits on the judge's desk.
Autographed pictures of the late Justice William Brennan and the
late U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough occupy nearby shelves, along with
an orange-and-white football inscribed ``To Coach Judge Justice.
1972. Texas 27, TCU 0.''
</P>
<P>
   Former clerk Amy Johnson, who practices environmental law in
Austin, called Justice ``the most kind person I've ever met for
anybody in power.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   He's respectful in the courtroom and expects lawyers to rise
when they speak. He doesn't want flowery writing drawing undue
attention to his opinions. But because he is a lover of words,
always searching for just the right one, he keeps a thesaurus, or a
book of synonyms, and a Bible near his computer.
</P>
<P>
   He attracts clerks from some of the nation's top law schools,
including Yale, Harvard and Stanford. They remain loyal to him, as
witnessed by high attendance at periodic reunions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Justice flew to Wyoming to perform a ceremony at the
marriage of former clerk David Weiser, an Austin lawyer, and his
wife, Assistant Attorney General Mary Crouter. Because he doesn't
have jurisdiction in Wyoming, he advised the couple to have their
marriage formalized by a local official first. Justice, who loves
to dance, recalled that the reception featured a great band.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling like he's part of your family,'' said
Johnson, the former clerk. ``How many bosses would you travel
across the country to see? He really is a hero to a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A native of Athens in East Texas, Justice grew up in the heart
of the conservative region that he would later shake up with many
of his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, whom Justice described as ``a very gentle woman,
very principled,'' was active in the Baptist church and took her
son to Sunday school at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a lawyer, was ``a populist. He loved people and
always tried to help them out'' if he could.
</P>
<P>
   Justice toyed with becoming a journalist or an engineer, but his
career seemed preordained. When he was just 7, his name was
alongside his father's on the Justice law firm shingle.
</P>
<P>
   His name also seemed so fitting: In law school at the University
of Texas, Justice and classmate Tom Law toyed with the idea of
partnering in a firm of Law &AMP; Justice. When Justice went to work
with his father after a stint in the Army, the firm, Justice, Moore
&AMP; Justice, was jokingly called ``Justice and More Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy nominated Justice as U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Texas in 1961, and President Lyndon Johnson
named him to the federal bench in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He donned his black robe during a nationwide wave of change,
when federal judges were being called on to enforce desegregation
rulings in recalcitrant communities and to provide the backbone for
other civil rights protections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 and 1971, Justice issued desegregation orders that
affected school districts across the state. And his decisions on
single-member voting districts led to the election of black
officials in various East Texas communities.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys familiar with Justice's work say that although he was
a major player in institutional reform, he was not out of step with
other courageous federal judges in Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were breaking new ground culturally or socially, but we
were not breaking new ground legally,'' said Richards, the civil
rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Justice's rulings riled ordinary people as well as
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   As he was then, the judge remains unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regard my so-called activism as anything other than a
response to the needs of a particular case,'' Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has said the extent of relief to be granted
is measured by the extent of the violation of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where he ordered extensive remedies, he said, ``the
violations of the Constitution have been egregious and required
detailed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you couch your decree or judgment in vague terms, there'll
always be a plea that they didn't understand what was there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case Justice calls his favorite, he struck down a Texas law
that let public school districts charge tuition for undocumented
immigrant children.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the ruling, 5-4, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely no case law on it. I found no case, no
statute that covered the point of law that I had to decide. So I
guess I made my own little contribution,'' Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   No case in Justice's court has generated more attention or drawn
more fiery political rhetoric than Ruiz vs. Estelle, the prison
reform case.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1972 as a complaint over prison conditions, the Ruiz
suit led Justice to conclude that the prison system routinely
violated inmates' constitutional rights against cruel and unusual
punishment. In 1980 and 1981, he issued comprehensive orders
requiring widespread changes to relieve overcrowding; improve
security, health care and sanitation; revamp disciplinary
procedures; and give prisoners better access to legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary results was a boom in prison construction to
ease overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   He later found the state in contempt for not living up to its
obligations, and he threatened stiff fines in a case that was
already costing the state millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1987, at the request of Gov. William P. Clements,
Justice met at the Tyler courthouse with the governor, Attorney
General Jim Mattox, plaintiffs' attorneys and other prominent
players in the Ruiz case.
</P>
<P>
   Weiser, a clerk at the time, recalled that coffee was served on
Sue Justice's fine china, and that the meeting was cordial and
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, Judge Justice was simply as gracious and well-mannered
as he would be to any visitor,'' said Weiser, who suggested that
Justice's good nature may have impressed state officials and ``kept
them from demonizing him so much in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the parties eventually worked toward settling
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clements and a prison official who subsequently spoke at local
business gatherings acknowledged that Justice had prompted
corrections that Texas prisons needed, according to lawyers who
were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a very sincere person. I have no doubt that he
personally felt very keenly about the problems he saw in that
prison system and some of the things the prisoners were being
subjected to,'' said law school classmate Law, now a Fort Worth
attorney and, like Justice, a member of the Philosophical Society
of Texas. Organized by Sam Houston and others, the society brings
together judges, college presidents and other state leaders once a
year for a weekend of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to go down in history as a villain at all. He
will be recognized as a very sincere visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice signed a final judgment in the Ruiz litigation
in 1992, he didn't bring an end to his jurisdiction over the case.
In May, Attorney General Dan Morales asked the judge to formally
end his supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson and state Sen. Buster Brown, R-Lake Jackson, are also
seeking 5th Circuit permission to intervene and press for an end to
Justice's control of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased he is in Austin, where he can witness firsthand
how capable the people of Texas are through the Legislature of
governing the prisons ... without him in his ivory tower,''
Culberson said.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Justice in the Capitol galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the separation of powers,'' he said. ``I will not
be over there superintending their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Justice will handle two-thirds of the docket
for the Del Rio federal court, a heavy load of cases involving
illicit drugs and undocumented immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have watched Justice in court said he gives criminal
defendants a fair trial, listening carefully to the evidence. But
once a guilty verdict is returned, he's known for tough sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the first Justice sentencing she witnessed involved
a defendant convicted of defrauding a bank. The man ``had a teacher
wife and a 6-year-old kid, and the wife was crying in the audience,
and he put him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Justice said he believes that the proliferation of
drug cases in the courts has squeezed criminal defendants' rights
under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable
searches, and the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are tolerating searches and seizures now that they
would not have prior to the surge in drug usage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each Friday, he plans to hold sentencing hearings by video
conference, a practice already being used in Del Rio. He'll travel
the 200-plus miles to the border city the last week of every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given me more than a full caseload,'' Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to enjoy this. It's a new challenge. ... I'm
stimulated by it.''

BLACK, WHITE ALL LOST IN `JIM CROW' ERA, AUTHOR SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  ``Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow''; by
Leon F. Litwack; (Knopf, $35.) 
 
By CELIA MORRIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon F. Litwack, of all people, will appreciate the irony of a
spiffed-up ``Gone With the Wind's'' reissue some two months after
his magisterial ``Trouble in Mind'' arrived to haunt the nation's
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the period Litwack covers here, roughly 1890 to
1920, is rather later than the time in this old warhorse of a movie
_ perhaps the most famous ever made. For the book is a sequel to
his ``Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery,'' which
won both the Pulitzer and the Parkman prizes and focused precisely
on those years when Scarlett was conniving never to be hungry again
and the glamorous Rhett Butler was amassing his fortune. But ``Gone
With the Wind'' may have done more than any other text to exalt and
preserve the myth of the glorious Old South _ a ``land of Cotton
and Cavaliers ... of Knights and his fair lady'' _ a myth Litwack
shows to have been a fantasy and a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling task Litwack set himself was to examine exactly
what white Southerners who considered themselves superior to blacks
did in the name of civilization to other human beings _ and how the
people they despised then managed, when they did manage, to resist
and ultimately to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Not that blacks were merely victims or whites merely
victimizers. ``But the extent and quality of the violence unleashed
on black men and women in the name of enforcing black deference and
subordination cannot be avoided or minimized,'' Litwack writes.
``The details make for unpleasant reading, sometimes stretching our
credulity, numbing the mind to the full extent of the horror, but
they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and
women could live with, participate in, defend, even reinterpret
such atrocities, so they would not see themselves or be perceived
as less than civilized.''
</P>
<P>
   As a white woman, I read ``Trouble in Mind'' not only as an
exhaustive catalog of unspeakable cruelties inflicted on black
people but as a withering testimonial to the way whites crippled
themselves in the doomed attempt to demonstrate their innate
``superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Litwack's major themes, in fact, is that it was not the
scum of the white South that behaved so barbarously but indeed the
``best'' people among them. Similarly, it was not the scum among
the blacks who truly frightened the powers-that-be but instead
those men and women who were the most intelligent, hard-working and
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   For the surrender at Appomatox did not compel white Southerners
to rethink the assumptions of racial superiority that led to such a
disastrous end; it merely strengthened their defiance. They went on
to twist their minds and spirits, canker their hearts and squander
their worldly goods in ultimately futile attempts to assert their
own power and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   From the first ship captains who delivered slaves to the
overwhelming majority of leading citizens for the next 250 years,
nobody seems to have thought beyond what they conceived to be their
own self-interest. No one adequately calculated the resources that
would be required to subjugate an entire race _ resources
financial, managerial, social, intellectual and spiritual. ``We're
bound to keep the nigger down,'' said a North Carolina registrar.
``It's all that saves us.'' But the cost proved astronomical and
bankrupted the region for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jim Crow'' era is that period in the South from the 1890s
on when blacks were separated and subordinated according to code,
custom and habit _ some of which we live with still.
</P>
<P>
   Though Litwack often draws on the work of distinguished black
writers like Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston
who grew up in the South, ``Trouble in Mind'' is primarily an
account of ordinary black people and ``the story of what they
confronted, how they struggled, worked, tried to educate
themselves, and found ways to temper their accommodation to the new
racial order.'' Packing his book not only with facts and figures
but also with luminous stories, Litwack writes about virtually
everything that affected them.
</P>
<P>
   The Morrison Professor of American History at the University of
California at Berkeley, Litwack methodically investigates an
economy based on share-cropping _ a system that caught blacks in a
tangle of financial indebtedness that in effect substituted peonage
for slavery _ and a convict labor system that trapped and exploited
black men jailed for the merest infraction of law and not
infrequently for nothing at all. (Employers who leased convicts
often worked them to death, but they were easily replaced. In 1870,
for instance, 41 percent of Alabama's convicts died.)
</P>
<P>
   He documents conditions of black children's schooling so
pathetic that they made a mockery of education as well as the
American credo that anyone who works hard and perseveres will
succeed. He describes not only the daily indignities black people
faced but also a reign of terror that culminated in lynchings as
barbaric as anything in the Roman Colosseum when Christians were
fed to lions. (``Justified'' commonly by the need to protect ``the
chastity of white women'' from black men who might rape them,
lynching became so prevalent that between 1890 and 1917, according
to a conservative estimate, ``some two to three black Southerners
were hanged, burned at the stake or quietly murdered every week.'')
</P>
<P>
   Writing of jazz and the blues as authentic expressions of a
despised people and a land where ``the betrayal of expectations
became a way of life,'' he evokes the blight of hunger and the
feeling of helplessness.
</P>
<P>
   Read properly, ``Trouble in Mind'' is a profoundly humbling
experience. Despite the fact that it is numbingly repetitive, I
wager no one can take it up with an open mind and put it down
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The even tone contributes to its cumulative power, for Litwack
rejects rhetoric in favor of quiet proof. A Jew who doesn't scant
the evidence of black anti-Semitism, he triumphs over the brutality
of his material by the courage and integrity with which he
confronts it.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he implicitly honors Richard Wright for his
``conviction that the meaning of living came only when one was
struggling to wring a meaning out of meaningless suffering.'' And
along the way, he indirectly teaches the rest of us something about
how to live.

LONG `CIDER' MAY BE YOUR CUP OF TEA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; John Irving's novel ``The Cider House Rules'' is
high-cholesterol literature, a big, thick slab of marbled fiction
chock full of wacky characters, bizarro Dickensian subplots and
protein-enriched themes.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an epic-size slice of theater _ six hours' worth, plus
a dinner break _ in its current state at the Mark Taper Forum,
where it's running in two parts through Sept. 27. If theatergoing
were bodybuilding, the Taper would be this summer's answer to
Muscle Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lovingly adapted by New York playwright Peter Parnell and
directed with maximum enthusiasm by Tom Hulce and Jane Jones, ``The
Cider House Rules'' employs 22 versatile actors portraying 120
characters. With more passion than economy, it recounts Irving's
popular, picaresque tale of a principled Maine country doctor,
Wilbur Larch (Michael Winters), his beloved protege, Homer Wells
(Josh Hamilton), and the moral quandary over abortion that
threatens to come between them.
</P>
<P>
   It's a massively eager-to-please show, and through its first
three or four hours, it keeps the audience rooting for the heroic
Wilbur and Homer as if they were Dickens' own David Copperfield (to
whom Homer is repeatedly compared).
</P>
<P>
   But although the production has slimmed down from its original
eight-hour Seattle debut, it still becomes something of an
endurance test as it winds into its final 1{ hours. The dialogue,
an otherwise effective blend of first-person character-speak and
third-person Irving-speak, begins to repeat itself. Some episodes
wander down narrative cul-de-sacs. A couple of tertiary characters
make token appearances, then virtually drop out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Most crucially, the play _ like the book _ can't disguise the
reality that what Irving has to say about abortion, medical ethics
and other highfalutin themes is ultimately far less interesting and
complex than what he has to say about family ties, fatherly love,
adolescent lust (an Irving specialty) and the orphaned Homer's
obsessive desire ``to be of use.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the adapters and the large ensemble remind us
that the novel's claim on our attention isn't its impressive
command of gynecological procedures, nor its characters' earnest
deliberation on when a fetus acquires a soul.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the novel's appeal lies in Irving's eye for the pathos
and slapstick of everyday life and in his knowing evocation of the
rugged Maine lifestyle, circa 1920-1960, and the flinty New England
moral temperament personified by Winters' noble, irascible Dr.
Larch.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Irving's story involves Homer's understated love
for Dr. Larch (and vice versa), his quest for identity outside the
desolate Maine orphanage where he's raised, and the near-tragic
menage a trois he enters into in Part 2 with apple-orchard heir
Wally Worthington (Patrick Wilson) and Wally's salt-of-the-earth
fiancee, Candy (Myra Platt). The play loses steam whenever it
deserts these points and starts to sermonize, as it does in a
Brechtian aside on how to use a condom.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``The Cider House Rules'' succeeds on a number of
fronts, perhaps most in conveying its affection for Irving's book
and in its passionate conviction that rich, voluble novels and live
theater can enlarge the imagination like no other art forms.
</P>
<P>
   This is made clear from the opening scene in which a
dazed-looking Hamilton pops out from between a woman's parted legs
and launches into his moving portrayal of the young Homer Wells.
Adult actors playing newborn babes? Wait _ you ain't seen nothing
yet. In this energetic ensemble, men play little girls and a nurse
doubles as a prostitute. When the wind whips up outside the old
orphanage, the effect is supplied by heavy-breathing actors. When
snow is required, a cast member sprinkles down a handful from on
high. These poetic effects _ occasionally strained but mostly not _
enhance the production's considerable charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine landscape is beautifully rendered here by James F.
Ingalls rustic lighting and John Arnone's no-nonsense set, an
abstract cutaway of a Victorian orphanage that becomes a loggers'
bunkroom, a whorehouse or an apple orchard with the addition or
subtraction of a few benches and chairs. Dan Wheetman's bluegrassy
original music, performed by cast members, adds a lyrical layer to
Parnell's adaptation, which is sturdy and elegant when it isn't
preaching.
</P>
<P>
   The large cast is skillful and effective, particularly Winters,
Brenda Wehle and Jane Carr as Dr. Larch's steadfast nurses and
Jillian Armenante as Melony, the butch female orphan who introduces
Homer to the parallel worlds of lust and deception.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes the play a grandly engaging tour of its
novelistic namesake. Does that make it worth giving up a summer's
afternoon of waxing your surfboard?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is probably yes, especially if you're still undecided
whether abortion is a painful necessity or an abomination _ ``God's
work'' or ``the devil's work.'' ``The Cider House Rules'' spins a
terrific yarn around that terrifying question. But it also leaves
you wondering whether even Charles Dickens would need six hours to
untangle Irving's unsurprising answer.

NEW SPIN ON THE 'NET: USER-FRIENDLY WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: See optional trim; with WEBTIPS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just a few short years ago, many corporate Web
sites were merely on-line business cards that posted an address,
phone number and company facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first effort was a marketing effort,'' said Susan
Weinstein, vice president of the on-line financial services group
for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. ``It was designed on the
brochure model because nobody knew any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed in the past few years. Now businesses have
souped up their sites to include hundreds, and often thousands, of
intricately designed, interactive Web pages full of information
about a company's products, services and subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But more information can make Web sites overwhelming and
unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Snyder of User Interface Engineering, a company that
tests Web sites for ease of use, said businesses often make the
mistake of setting up Web sites before determining what they want
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies fall into the trap of developing a Web site around
their organizational chart,'' said Snyder, a principal at the North
Andover, Mass., firm, which also tests software usability. ``So
they're designed from the company looking out. A lot of companies
don't ask themselves what's in it for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also said companies erroneously think their Web sites are
extensions of their marketing and advertising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is different from advertising, which controls
everything the user sees and in what order,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen was in charge of Web site testing at Palo Alto,
Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. and has written two books on Web
sites. He said Internet users don't want to be entertained on the
Web: They want solid information, and they want it fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is about, `Get in, get out quick,''' Nielsen said.
``People will invest just a few seconds in glancing at your stuff
to see if it's useful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has not fallen on deaf ears at corporations. Most have
revamped their Web sites at least once, making them easier and
faster to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   They have accomplished this by making graphics less elaborate,
developing hyperlink labeling that clearly states what the user
will get once he or she clicks on the link, and developing
personalized Web pages that act like bookmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gold Rush is over to get on the Internet,'' said Mark
Crumpacker, chief executive of San Francisco-based Studio Archetype
Inc., which has designed sites for United Parcel Service Inc.,
BankAmerica Corp. and 3Com Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people want objective reasons to have a Web site,'' he
added. ``A lot of them want to quantify the net effect it's having
on their brand. They're adding a ton more functionality when they
come back a second time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wells Fargo's Web site (www.wellsfargo.com) began as an
on-line business card in 1995, its pages have been revamped
continually since then. Weinstein said the bank has followed three
basic guidelines: Get rid of clutter, keep the message simple and
don't bury information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things used to be buried seven layers down,'' she said. ``The
goal is to get (information) to a higher level so customers can get
things with fewer clicks.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Customized pages are another trend in Web site redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Chicago-based United Airlines created a page
called ``Personalize'' that bookmarks other pages on the company's
site (www.ual.com), such as the airline's frequent flier or
reservation pages.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Tony Molinaro said the new ``Personalize'' page
allows customers to instantly call up the pages they use the most
and eliminate the laborious process of clicking through several
screens to get to information.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's ``Personalize'' page was created in response to
customer feedback, Molinaro added. ``Everybody said, `I don't want
to wade through the same screens over and over again,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Flanders, co-author of ``Web Pages That Suck,'' a guide
to developing attractive, user-friendly Internet sites, said Web
sites shouldn't pose obstacles to getting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond four clicks is bad,'' Flanders said. He likened the
experience to shopping. ``When you go to Wal-Mart, you don't find
barbed wire fences'' around the store.
</P>
<P>
   United hopes the easier access will help the Web site account
for more of the airline's total ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Molinaro said, United expects to sell about $200
million worth of tickets through its Internet site. That's twice as
much as last year, and about 2 percent of United's total ticket
sales, Molinaro added. ``Our goal is to get to 10 percent of total
sales over the next five years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many companies are finding more ways to cut costs by
selling their products over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   AMP Inc., a Harrisburg, Pa., company that sells electrical
equipment to the computer, telecommunications and automotive
industries, put its catalog on line in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company said it now spends half as much _ $8
million _ producing traditional paper catalogs, because more
customers are buying AMP's products through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our electronic catalog today is one of the best reaches to our
customers in getting them updated information instantly,'' said
Jerry Kopenhaver, marketing manager of AMP's Web site catalog.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. estimates that the number of Internet
users in the United States will increase from about 30 million in
1997 to nearly 102 million by 2002. And the percentage of users who
buy on line will grow from 36 percent to about 50 percent. In
addition, IDC estimated that total dollars spent on Internet
transactions will grow from $4.3 billion in 1997 to more than $54
billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports of cost savings from doing business on the Web,
the jury's still out on whether companies are getting good returns
on what they spend to develop their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Business Marketing, a trade magazine in Chicago, estimated that
Web site development costs for small businesses are averaging about
$44,500. Medium and large businesses are paying on average $99,750
and $302,975, respectively, for their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Maddox, editor of trade magazine Interactive Media &AMP;
Marketing, said it's too difficult to figure out whether companies
are getting a good return on their investment because using the Web
as a business tool is such a new concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, nobody really knows what the return is,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies aren't making money. Most are barely breaking
even after having a Web site for a couple of years.''

<P>
   Here's a snapshot of the most common Web site management and
development mistakes, according to Jakob Nielsen, who was in charge
of Web site testing at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems
Inc. and has written two books on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not knowing why you are creating a Web site in the first
place: Most companies should start their Web design project by
finding out ways in which they can provide true customer value on
their site. Give users benefits from spending time on your site,
allow them to do business with you, and their money will follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Designing for your own bosses: Internally-focused sites cause
companies to end up with home pages full of mission statements,
photos of the chief executive, and corporate history _ all of which
can fit on a single ``about this company'' page. The average
Internet user doesn't care about these things.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not getting your Web site tested to make sure it is
user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making the Web an extension of the company's marketing and
advertising program: The Web is a new new medium. Marketing and
advertising drive the viewer or reader's experience. But the viewer
drives his or her experience on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   _ Long download times: About 15 seconds is an acceptable period
of time to wait for a page to download on a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Excessive animation: Too many moving objects on the screen
make it difficult for users to read text on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Complex Web site addresses: Avoiding these minimizes the risk
of typographical errors, which keep users from downloading the
site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asking users to scroll down a page: Only 10 percent of users
scroll beyond the information that is visible on the screen. All
critical content and navigating options should be on the top part
of the page.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forgetting to budget for Web site maintenance: As a rule of
thumb, the annual cost to maintain a site should be at least half
of what the company spent on developing the site.

 &HT;    IMF, RUSSIA AGREE ON $17.1 BILLION BAILOUT
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Facing the prospects of financial disaster, Russia
obtained a crucial agreement Monday for a new $17.1 billion bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to
bolster its frail economy.
</P>
<P>
   The loan assurances over the next 18 months should allow
President Boris Yeltsin and his government to make payments on the
country's foreign debts and avert a potentially calamitous
devaluation of Russia's currency, the ruble, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The financing package, larger even than Russian officials had
hoped, also should restore investors' confidence in the fledgling
market economy, reeling from massive losses in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lead negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, said the package
``signifies a restoration of faith in Russia's ability to overcome
its difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia already has existing loan agreements with the IMF and
others totaling $5.5 billion this year and next, bringing the sum
of the international bailout to $22.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has linked the support to Russia's pledge that it will
enact long-overdue reforms to improve tax collections and lower its
budget deficit -- a huge task given the problem-plagued economy and
a Communist-dominated parliament which has balked at government
proposals to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement the IMF will provide an additional $11.6
billion, the World Bank will give $4 billion and Japan will put up
$1.5 billion -- for a total of $17.1 billion over the remainder of
this year and 1999, Chubais said. Russia could receive the first
installment, $5.6 billion, after the expected approval of the deal
by the IMF board on Monday (July 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the new economic program, Russia's fiscal position is
being strengthened markedly,'' IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the relief will forestall a financial crisis only for
several more months unless Russia fixes once and for all the
country's deep economic problems, warned a leading member of the
Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zhukov, chairman of the tax and finance committee in
the Duma, said: ``If we do not do anything radical, this money will
quickly run out and we will have to borrow again.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of grinding negotiations, the IMF announcement
clearly demonstrated the willingness of the United States and other
major donor nations to continue backing Yeltsin, despite Russia's
lagging market reforms seven years after the fall of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the package shows strong confidence in Russia's
reform commitments and reflects strong support from the world
community,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Russian stocks and bonds climbed Monday on rumors of the
announcement, which came as trading ended. The Russian stock index
gained 9.2 percent, its biggest one-day gain since June 2. Russia's
Eurobond posted its biggest one-day gain since it debuted in
November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy began to dive last fall following onset of the
Asian financial crisis. It faced further pressure this year as
world prices for the country's main export, petroleum, fell and its
own tax collections were dismally short of what was needed to fully
finance the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Russian workers have not been paid for months. In
Moscow and throughout the country, protesters have shut down mines
and blocked the Trans-Siberian railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the scare, most ordinary Russians have been
largely immune from the tumult as the ruble has remained stable in
relation to the dollar and consumer prices have remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a currency devaluation, which would drive prices up
and threaten Yeltsin's push for economic reforms, Russia's Central
Bank has been spending its hard-currency reserves to support the
ruble, which is trading at about 6.2 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result, investor confidence in the Russian market
plummeted and the stock market has lost more than half its value
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have withdrawn about $8 billion from the Russian
equities market and about another $10 billion from government
securities since October 1997, Mikhail Alekseyev, deputy executive
chairman of Unexim Bank, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a gloomy assessment, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko warned
parliament on Friday that social tensions were rising in Russia and
financial markets had ``practically ceased to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko traveled to Tokyo on Monday for talks in Japan on its
efforts to ease Russia's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian analysts had predicted that a protracted fiscal
crisis would force Yeltsin from office and create political chaos.
On Friday, Yeltsin enigmatically warned of extremists trying to
overthrow him. He telephoned President Clinton and other Western
leaders to ask for their help in supporting a favorable bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the IMF agreement were Russian assurances that the
Communist-controlled lower house of parliament, the Duma, would
approve the bulk of government-proposed measures to improve tax
collection and narrow the budget deficit, said John Odling-Smee,
the IMF's chief negotiator in the Russia talks.
</P>
<P>
   Odling-Smee said the IMF board would be unlikely to give its
approval to the package unless the Russian legislature supports the
reforms. The Duma, which already has passed some of the
government's legislation but has resisted other reforms, is
scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday and Thursday to consider the
remainder of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as it is impossible to get out of the financial crisis
without a loan,'' said Zhukov, the tax and budget chairman, ``so it
is impossible to solve all the problems with the help of the
loan.''

   MOSCOW _ Facing the prospects of financial disaster, Russia
obtained a crucial agreement Monday for a new $17.1 billion bailout
package from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to
bolster its frail economy.
</P>
<P>
   The loan assurances over the next 18 months should allow
President Boris Yeltsin and his government to make payments on the
country's foreign debts and avert a potentially calamitous
devaluation of Russia's currency, the ruble, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The financing package, larger even than Russian officials had
hoped, also should restore investors' confidence in the fledgling
market economy, reeling from massive losses in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's lead negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, said the package
``signifies a restoration of faith in Russia's ability to overcome
its difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia already has existing loan agreements with the IMF and
others totaling $5.5 billion this year and next, bringing the sum
of the international bailout to $22.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has linked the support to Russia's pledge that it will
enact long-overdue reforms to improve tax collections and lower its
budget deficit -- a huge task given the problem-plagued economy and
a Communist-dominated parliament which has balked at government
proposals to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement the IMF will provide an additional $11.6
billion, the World Bank will give $4 billion and Japan will put up
$1.5 billion -- for a total of $17.1 billion over the remainder of
this year and 1999, Chubais said. Russia could receive the first
installment, $5.6 billion, after the expected approval of the deal
by the IMF board on Monday (July 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the new economic program, Russia's fiscal position is
being strengthened markedly,'' IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the relief will forestall a financial crisis only for
several more months unless Russia fixes once and for all the
country's deep economic problems, warned a leading member of the
Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zhukov, chairman of the tax and finance committee in
the Duma, said: ``If we do not do anything radical, this money will
quickly run out and we will have to borrow again.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of grinding negotiations, the IMF announcement
clearly demonstrated the willingness of the United States and other
major donor nations to continue backing Yeltsin, despite Russia's
lagging market reforms seven years after the fall of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size of the package shows strong confidence in Russia's
reform commitments and reflects strong support from the world
community,'' White House spokesman Michael McCurry said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Russian stocks and bonds climbed Monday on rumors of the
announcement, which came as trading ended. The Russian stock index
gained 9.2 percent, its biggest one-day gain since June 2. Russia's
Eurobond posted its biggest one-day gain since it debuted in
November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy began to dive last fall following onset of the
Asian financial crisis. It faced further pressure this year as
world prices for the country's main export, petroleum, fell and its
own tax collections were dismally short of what was needed to fully
finance the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Russian workers have not been paid for months. In
Moscow and throughout the country, protesters have shut down mines
and blocked the Trans-Siberian railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout the scare, most ordinary Russians have been
largely immune from the tumult as the ruble has remained stable in
relation to the dollar and consumer prices have remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a currency devaluation, which would drive prices up
and threaten Yeltsin's push for economic reforms, Russia's Central
Bank has been spending its hard-currency reserves to support the
ruble, which is trading at about 6.2 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result, investor confidence in the Russian market
plummeted and the stock market has lost more than half its value
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have withdrawn about $8 billion from the Russian
equities market and about another $10 billion from government
securities since October 1997, Mikhail Alekseyev, deputy executive
chairman of Unexim Bank, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a gloomy assessment, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko warned
parliament on Friday that social tensions were rising in Russia and
financial markets had ``practically ceased to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko traveled to Tokyo on Monday for talks in Japan on its
efforts to ease Russia's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian analysts had predicted that a protracted fiscal
crisis would force Yeltsin from office and create political chaos.
On Friday, Yeltsin enigmatically warned of extremists trying to
overthrow him. He telephoned President Clinton and other Western
leaders to ask for their help in supporting a favorable bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the IMF agreement were Russian assurances that the
Communist-controlled lower house of parliament, the Duma, would
approve the bulk of government-proposed measures to improve tax
collection and narrow the budget deficit, said John Odling-Smee,
the IMF's chief negotiator in the Russia talks.
</P>
<P>
   Odling-Smee said the IMF board would be unlikely to give its
approval to the package unless the Russian legislature supports the
reforms. The Duma, which already has passed some of the
government's legislation but has resisted other reforms, is
scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday and Thursday to consider the
remainder of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as it is impossible to get out of the financial crisis
without a loan,'' said Zhukov, the tax and budget chairman, ``so it
is impossible to solve all the problems with the help of the
loan.''

DRUCKENMILLER LIKES RIDING ON THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 49ers' coaching staff put together a special
calendar for Jim Druckenmiller. They color-coded it for film study,
physical drills and weightlifting. They kept track of his every
footfall.
</P>
<P>
   The young quarterback showed up at team headquarters on weekday
mornings at 7:30, just as it said on the calendar. He went home to
visit his parents in Pennsylvania. The trip was on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller may or may not be the centerpiece of the San
Francisco team's future, but he was absolutely the focus of the
offseason. His intensive extracurriculars, combined with the
signing of Ty Detmer as Steve Young's immediate backup, can be
interpreted a number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   In the eternally peptic guts of 49ers fans, Druckenmiller's
private boot camp is likely to register as remedial training and,
therefore, a sign of the franchise's imminent demise. In the more
generous view of offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg,
Druckenmiller has refined himself in the last few months, possibly
into the best quarterback prospect in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Mornhinweg recently received a ballot from the magazine Pro
Football Weekly, asking him to rank the youngsters. The candidates
included Ryan Leaf, Peyton Manning, Steve McNair and Jake Plummer.
Mornhinweg, guaranteed anonymity in the poll, could have safely
raved about someone else's quarterback. He wrote in Druckenmiller's
name and rated him No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come a long way,'' Mornhinweg said. ``He's quickened his
release up, and he's more consistent with his accuracy when he
throws the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also packed away his Harley-Davidson motorcycle,
foresworn further appearances on the Howard Stern show and vowed
never again to miss a team flight. At times during his rookie
season, the first-round draft pick behaved like a stray puppy let
loose in the 49ers' locker room, oblivious to the protocol of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit nuts,'' Druckenmiller said. ``I think we
all realized Jim was being young and stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   He was on his cellular phone when he said that, taking a trip to
the beach with a friend in Florida. His coaches had let him go
until the start of training camp. He laughed a lot as he talked and
seemed to be having fun. Then again, Druckenmiller always seems to
be having fun. That quality cost him a lot of money in fines last
year, but it could also be an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he irritated his coaches last year, he made them
laugh. They couldn't help it. He was so brazenly goofy. He was
never self-conscious or timid. He rode the Harley right onto the
set of a local sports television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing that was conduct detrimental to the team,''
coach Steve Mariucci said. ``And he was always working hard. I
don't want people to think he was a party animal. But you want to
nip these things in the bud. I was kind of happy that when he was
late for that flight, because he was out getting a pizza (on orders
from Steve Young and Jeff Brohm), that we just left without him. We
didn't wait one second.''
</P>
<P>
   Mornhinweg points out that he and Mariucci worked with Brett
Favre and Jim McMahon in Green Bay. They are accustomed to
quarterbacks with wild streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller said he gorged on the freedom that came with being
a professional. He was accustomed to round-the-clock monitoring at
Virginia Tech, where players lived together, ate together, rode
buses to every destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, in the NFL, the attitude is: `You've got a mind,
you've got to use it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At times last year, he couldn't do that. His mind had barely
been introduced to the 49ers' offense. During the St. Louis game,
which he won as an emergency starter, he threw some routes he had
never attempted in practice. The offseason training allowed him to
absorb more of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I think I'm more attuned, and I think I look more
comfortable because of that,'' he said. ``Physically, I loosened
up. Before, I was a little tight. I think I was more robotic.''
</P>
<P>
   If he interpreted the Detmer signing as a slight, Druckenmiller
hides it well. Either he had learned advanced diplomacy in a hurry
or he really doesn't feel threatened. He talks about how much he
can learn from the new backup, a former Mariucci protege. In
minicamp, Young and Detmer were both allowed to leave early, but
Detmer kept coming to practices anyway, in street clothes, to watch
and advise Druckenmiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty's one of the smartest quarterbacks in the NFL,''
Druckenmiller said. ``Everybody says that.''
</P>
<P>
   The offseason training didn't faze him, either. He is not, he
said, easily frustrated. He expects his job to be difficult. It
always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to prep school for a year before college,'' he
said. ``Virginia Tech was the only college that offered me a
scholarship. When I got there, there were 11 quarterbacks on the
team. ... I'm used to adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The prep school that took Druckenmiller was Fork Union Military
Academy, hardly the kind of place that breeds Harley-riding guest
stars for Howard Stern. Druckenmiller hated the place, the
saluting, the uniforms. They took his civilian clothes and locked
them up for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I cried myself to sleep every night until
Thanksgiving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 49ers' calendar probably seemed comforting. He
felt a little isolated at times, working only with Mornhinweg or
assistant coach Greg Knapp, without teammates around him. He took
endless grief from the other players for missing the flight to New
Orleans, but he also leaned on certain veterans. On the flights he
did make, Druckenmiller always made a point to sit near linebacker
Ken Norton Jr., a valued mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Left with the coaches, Druckenmiller managed to have a little
fun. In the spring, he told them that his girlfriend, a model, had
helped set him up with agents who wanted him to appear in a Calvin
Klein underwear ad. He said the billboards would go up in San
Francisco about the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller winked at Mornhinweg as he told the tale, but he
let Mariucci believe that his second-year quarterback, with one
just win on his resume, had Broadway Joe on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just put his head in his hands,'' Druckenmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a great moment for him. It proved that he didn't have
to be tame to be in control.

THE MAN WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN KING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: What we do know about Moshood Abiola is that he
was a self-made millionaire and an amazingly talented politician.
What we will never know, in the wake of his death, is whether he
could have been Nigeria's Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Lagos airport was eerily efficient that February morning in 1993
when I returned to Africa after an eight-year absence. Customs and
immigration were a snap, and my party of three was ushered through
so quickly that a promised ride hadn't shown up.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, while standing on an outside curb, we were swept up in
an impromptu demonstration of people shouting, ``A-bee-oh-la!
A-bee-oh-la!'' And somehow we met the object of the chants: a
short, stout man with a wide grin who breezily shook our hands and
asked the reason for our trip. When told we were spending a month
giving seminars to working journalists around the country, he said,
``I'm president of the publishers' association, and I must give a
banquet in your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   That was our introduction to Moshood Abiola, a self-made
millionaire who was soon to be a presidential candidate. He kept
his promise and threw a luncheon for us; later, he took me on a
breathless, 19-hour tour of the country where, between audiences
with feudal nobles and soccer players, we talked at length about
his life.
</P>
<P>
   His remarkable journey ended this past week when Abiola, after
four years of confinement, died of what was described as a heart
attack while meeting with senior American diplomats. He was 60.
With his death, many analysts agreed, Nigeria lost a leader who had
the rare ability to appeal to all quarters of a land divided by
religious, ethnic and north-south rivalries. A Muslim from the
southeastern Yoruba tribe in a nation traditionally ruled by Muslim
northerners, his dynamic personality and decades of public
philanthropy won him support from all regions.
</P>
<P>
   In Zaria, a northern city where an emir still wields influence,
I watched Abiola pay his respects to the traditional Muslim elite
and to the turbanned horseman who succeeded to an old hereditary
title. He pointedly reminded northerners that he owns thousands of
acres of farmland in the region and therefore shares their
interests and concerns. On a continent rife with linguistic and
tribal antagonisms, Abiola sought to persuade them to see him for
what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought 10,000 hectares here. I have given scholarships all
over the north,'' Abiola, up since 6 a.m., said at a stop shortly
before midnight. ``I have helped bury your dead, sang when you were
happy. I expect to be welcomed in every village in Nigeria. I am
one of you, isn't that right?''
</P>
<P>
   At another stop, I watched as he met members of his tribe
resettled in the north. After exhorting them to become active in
their adopted communities, Abiola led them in the Fatiyah, a Muslim
prayer, although many were Christian. Then, without missing a beat,
he led all in the Lord's Prayer. In my four years in Africa, I had
never seen a politician so adroitly ecumenical and charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from politics, Abiola had struck a chord across the
continent and many parts of the African diaspora by leading an
international campaign for reparations from former slave-owning and
trading nations, as well as for an apology from the United Nations
for centuries of bondage. In Nigeria, he had practically invented
large-scale philanthropy, underwriting schools, scholarships and
soccer organizations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of American had known nothing of this man whose name
has been flashed on the TV screens, a man who has been compared to
South Africa's Nelson Mandela but never got the opportunity to
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Abiola had meant nothing to me before I landed that
day in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola was the 23rd child born to a
produce buyer who had lost most of his offspring in infancy. This
led his father to name him ``Kashimawo,'' Yoruba for ``Let us see
if this one survives.'' Abiola worked his way through the Baptist
Boys School by selling firewood and leading a dance band in which
he played banjo and talking drums. Graduation required writing a
Baptist hymn. The Muslim youth not only wrote one but also penned
others for Christian classmates _ for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   An academic standout, he went on to Scotland to study. ``I
wanted accounting _ the science of moneymaking,'' Abiola joked
between renditions of Elvis songs and, incongruously or not, gospel
tunes. ``If you are a poor man's son, you want to identify the
jingling sound of money. From the age of 9, I've been working.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying as a chartered accountant, equivalent to a certified
public accountant in the United States, he worked for a hospital
and a drug firm. In 1967 he joined ITT, working his way up the
corporate ladder to vice president, responsible for Africa and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind his meteoric rise is that after collecting a
long-standing debt from the Nigerian army's signal corps, he
telephoned his foreign bosses with the good news. Back at the
office, he was shocked to find them partying to the point of being
hog-whimpering drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a picture of everyone drunk and sent it to ITT
headquarters,'' he told me. The snapshot went off with a memo: As a
devout Muslim, how could he work with such men?
</P>
<P>
   Abiola then set up his own electronics business, signing big
contracts with the military, until ITT accepted his terms _ putting
him in charge in Nigeria and selling him a hefty stake in the local
subsidiary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's how I became the first African managing director of
a multinational corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   From ITT Nigeria, he went on to become a major shareholder in
Volkswagen Nigeria; an oil-production firm; a large baking concern;
a mammoth corn and sorghum farm; an airline; and a publishing
house, which included newspapers, magazines and a chain of
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, he was hardly considered a critic of the
military. In 1992, he made a bended-knee apology to the ruling
general after the regime closed Abiola's news weekly, African
Concord, for saying that the military was badly managing the
economy, which was largely true. A crew of editors protested the
apology by quitting and then started a competing magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some questioned the sources of his wealth. Apart from his
military links, Abiola's various other dealings have raised
concerns, said diplomats in West Africa. But compared with many in
Nigeria's civilian and military governments, Abiola was seen as a
``clean'' politician by ordinary Nigerians whom I randomly
interviewed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During his presidential race, he campaigned on an
anti-corruption theme, saying that because he was already rich, he
needed no favors, bribes or even the ``gift'' of a jetliner. He
flew in a craft built for Queen Elizabeth II that was considered
too big for the monarch. ``I don't owe any man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Abiola the apparent winner of the 1993 poll, the military
regime annulled the election result. He was arrested after
declaring himself president and had been kept for most of the past
four years in solitary confinement at a government guest house near
the capital of Abuja. His family says he was not given adequate
medical care for his high blood pressure. After one of his wives
publicly protested the conditions, she was assassinated on a Lagos
street.
</P>
<P>
   Born into poverty, Abiola acquired 140 honorary titles during
his 60 years, including field marshal of Ibadanland, a main Yoruba
area. He amassed a fortune and, according to a Who's Who of
Nigeria, fathered ``many children.'' But his empire had withered
during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   And now we will never know how well Abiola might have led his
fractious but potentially rich nation.

 &HT;    US, BRITAIN SIGN DRUG INTERDICTION AGREEMENT FOR CARIBBEAN
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Britain signed an agreement
Monday allowing the U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Navy to
permanently collaborate on drug interdiction efforts in national
and international waters in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will allow U.S. Coast Guard and Royal Navy
personnel to serve aboard both country's ships for counter-drug
operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Once only a temporary arrangement between the two countries, the
agreement means drug traffickers will not be able to escape pursuit
by U.S. or British vessels by crossing into the territorial waters
of the other country.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony was held in the ornate Treaty Room of the
U.S. State Department. Baroness Symons, parliamentary
undersecretary at the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said
that as the mother of a teenage son, she knows the dangers of drugs
and sees the agreement as a way of helping to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Anthony Tangeman of the U.S. Coast Guard said he viewed
the agreement as ``another step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, under the temporary arrangement between the two

WORLD CUP UNDERLINES SUCCESS OF DIVERSITY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As if on cue, a soaking rain gave way to breezy sunshine
Monday as the victorious French soccer team paraded down the
Champs-Elysees in an open-air bus, carrying the World Cup
championship trophy and the well wishes of an entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's celebration, which followed wild jubilation after
Sunday's 3-0 victory over Brazil, was further confirmation of just
how completely a diffident country had become smitten with its
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   When the tournament began on June 10, there was more than
big-city indifference in Paris. There was hostile anti-soccer
feeling in some quarters. Bartok, a bar in the Bastille section,
began the World Cup with a party to puncture soccer balls. Women
were said to be largely disinterested. But, by Sunday night, France
had become so consumed that the celebrations on the Champs-Elysees
were being compared to the liberation of Paris during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As the French players, black and white, natives and immigrants,
celebrated a victory symbolizing France's ethnic diversity, U.S.
soccer officials should have gotten the message that America will
never reach soccer's upper reaches until it creates interest in the
game beyond the nation's affluent suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's championship and Monday's victory parade must have
provided an poignant moment for David Regis, a defender who became
a U.S. citizen in May after declining earlier to compete for a spot
with his native France. While France finished first, his adopted
team finished dead last.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, along with Spain, were the biggest
disappointments of this month-long 32-team tournament. Coach Steve
Sampson lost his job and American players such as Tab Ramos, Eric
Wynalda and Alexi Lalas lost any sense of professionalism, blaming
Sampson for the collapse without assuming any personal
responsibility. It was the failure of experienced players, not
Sampson's dereliction, that contributed most significantly to the
American embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the 1998 World Cup was a qualified success. The matches
were largely competitive and entertaining _ every game between the
first round and the final was decided by one goal or penalty kicks
_ and scoring was up over the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
The weather was cooler, and because there was no dominant nation,
more teams thought they had a chance to win and were willing to
take increased chances in attack.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Owen, the English teenager who played with stunning
directness and speed, confirmed that a new generation of stars is
blossoming and will be in full bloom in the next World Cup. Exposed
was Italy, which played not to lose, instead of to win. The
tournament's leading scorer turned out to be Davor Suker of tiny
Croatia, which shocked Germany in the quarterfinals and finished
third ahead of Holland in its first World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always the big guys who win,'' Suker said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup also had its moments of endearing goofiness. Glenn
Hoddle, the British coach, hired a faith healer. The Romanian
players dyed their hair gold. Miroslav Blazevic, the eccentric
Croatian coach, got through the tournament on cigarettes,
chocolates and faxes from his astrologer. French policemen and
policewomen painted their faces red, white and blue Sunday night,
while others painted their hair and even their roosters in the
colors of the French flag.
</P>
<P>
   The week of the U.S.-Iran match, sports played a broader
political role as President Clinton called for steps toward a
reconciliation between the two countries that have experienced two
decades of enmity. During the match, thousands of Iranian
spectators displayed T-shirts honoring exiled leaders in a protest
that had to embarrass the Islamic regime in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But the stereotype of the match, with its Great Satan and
Death-to-America hyperbole, was severely undercut when it turned
out that the Iranian coach, Jalil Talebi, had lived for 17 years in
northern California and had been affiliated with the same junior
college as Sampson, the American coach.
</P>
<P>
   In several areas, this World Cup got completely out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's celebration was marred when a car swerved into
revelers on the Champs-Elysees and injured about 60 persons.
English and German hooligans blighted an otherwise friendly,
well-behaved tournament. The ticket scandal affecting tens of
thousands of spectators was an embarrassment that neither FIFA,
soccer's world governing body, nor French organizers went about
trying to correct with the proper urgency. According to Brazilian
reporters, as many as 10,000 Brazilian fans were left ticketless
for Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the quality of refereeing was interfered with by a
misguided directive issued in the middle of the tournament by Sepp
Blatter, the newly-elected president of FIFA, and Michel Platini,
the chief French organizer. They called for more players to be
penalized for tackling from behind, and in one day alone, five red
cards were handed out. This confusion and erratic refereeing was
inevitable when an attempt was made to change the rules after the
competition was underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the low point of the World Cup,'' said Pele, the former
Brazilian star.
</P>
<P>
   And now FIFA is faced with the unwieldy attempt in 2002 to
organize a World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The
logistics would be challenging enough under normal circumstances,
but both nations are attempting to build and refurbish stadiums
while suffering from the Asian financial downturn. And there is the
unresolved question about whether North Korea will also host
matches. While Blatter gave no indication that FIFA would move the
World Cup elsewhere, he is sending a fact-finding team to both
countries in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governments and football authorities must guarantee to
FIFA the stadiums, infrastructure, technical resources and other
logistics, including hotels,'' Blatter said at a recent news
conference. ``So far, none of these areas have become a problem.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is important to pause sometimes in the midst of
the political wars and scandals to look past individual furies and
remember who we are as a nation.
</P>
<P>
   There was such a moment in the sunshine on the White House south
lawn last weekend. Traditional American music from George Gershwin
to John Philip Sousa filled the air as the U.S. Marine Band
performed with its usual precision to mark its 200th anniversary of
serving presidents and the country.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur saxophone player who occupies the White House tapped
his toes and nodded his head slightly in rhythm but resisted
joining in with a tootle on the horn.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to upstage President Clinton, but he was not the
star of this show. That honor belonged to the 143 red-coated men
and women who musically represent the nation around the world with
dignity, pride and talent.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Clinton, opening the concert, revealed that
the president would ``love to trade places'' with a Marine
saxophonist. According to the first lady, the U.S. Marine Band has
actually allowed Clinton to sit in with its players on occasion _
and remained discreetly mum afterward about his skill as a
performer.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``The President's Own'' by Thomas Jefferson, a violinist,
the band is the oldest continuously active, professional musical
organization in the nation. It has become an integral part of
American ceremonial life, a grand tradition that transcends time,
partisanship and political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Traditions do matter. Symbolic of continuity and community, they
are the historical glue that holds a nation together. In
particular, the flag and the music of the union are the stuff of
patriotism and honor.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines played for John Adams' New Year's Day party in 1798
near the end of his first year in the White House. They played for
Jefferson's inaugural in 1801 and have done so at every other one
since. They announced John Tyler's official entrances with ``Hail
to the Chief'' in the early 1840s and have done so for every
president since.
</P>
<P>
   They were at Abraham Lincoln's side when he delivered the
Gettysburg Address. They played for Grover Cleveland's wedding.
They played in the rain in 1943 as Franklin Roosevelt and Winston
Churchill sat on the White House lawn damply singing ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic.'' They led the funeral procession mourning
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And they work like dogs. They perform more than 700 times a year
_ more than 200 at the White House, which scarcely holds an event
without them, from state dinners to the Easter Egg Roll.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, believing that our new democracy should have pomp
and circumstance equal to that of the royal European courts, signed
a congressional bill creating the U.S. Marine Band on July 11,
1798. Its military status, signifying national might, substituted
for the imprimatur of a monarch that gave the royal European bands
their cachet.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marine Band originally consisted of a drum major, fife
major and 32 drums and fifes. Its legendary conductor John Philip
Sousa, who directed from 1889 to 1892, composed 135 marches,
including ``Stars and Stripes Forever'' and ``The Washington Post
March.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the military overtone of the band, led by Lt.
Col. Timothy Foley, has faded, except for the uniforms, and the
band does more than march. It has talented singers like Master
Gunnery Sgt. Michael Ryan, whose name may not be familiar to many
Americans but whose voice at endless ceremonies surely is. It has
solo pianists and harpists, a chamber orchestra, string ensembles,
a dance band and a Dixieland band.
</P>
<P>
   Members do have to be Marines. But the most arduous physical
training requirements are waived for their special category. They
are, after all, musicians rather than soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing at the White House on a regular basis, the band has an
intimacy with presidents that all involved are careful to guard.
Since their interaction takes place in public, however, it is
unlikely any band member has any secret that would benefit
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's probe of the Monica Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few known anecdotes reflects presidential
miscommunication and comes from the band's recently retired
longtime conductor, Col. John Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon Johnson loved to dance and once promised
several female members of the press he would give each of them a
twirl after a state dinner. Soon after he stepped onto the dance
floor with the first partner, he swung past the band and murmured
to Bourgeois, ``Faster.'' So Bourgeois stepped up the pace. The
same thing happened with the second and third partners. The
president murmured ``faster,'' and Bourgeois pushed the beat as
fast as he could. Eventually the music was wildly frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning a presidential aide called Bourgeois to
complain and ask politely if he had lost his mind, to say nothing
of his musical sense. The conductor said he was merely following
the president's orders to keep speeding up. The aide exclaimed:
``He wanted you to change the numbers faster (not speed up the
tempo), so that he could change partners faster!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For people with high blood pressure who hate to take pills,
recent studies have offered good news: changes in daily routine can
lower blood pressure enough to let some people with mild
hypertension postpone the need for medicine or avoid it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering previous research, new experiments suggest that
people who can lose excess weight, exercise regularly and limit
alcohol to a drink or two a day can sometimes lower their readings
enough to stay off drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting salt may also help some patients. Blacks and older
people seem to be most sensitive to salt, but there is no simple
test to tell who benefits from abstaining. Most salt in the
American diet comes from bread and processed foods, and many
doctors advise patients to cut back and see whether it helps.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines issued in November by the National High Blood
Pressure Education Program, part of the National Institutes of
Health, said people with mild hypertension should try life style
changes for six to 12 months and resort to drugs only if the
changes do not work.
</P>
<P>
   Research since then has supported that recommendation, at least
in the elderly, more than two-thirds of whom are afflicted by
hypertension. In a study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association in March, some people age 60-80 got off blood
pressure medication by losing 8 to 10 pounds and limiting their
salt intake to 1,800 milligrams of sodium a day, instead of the
4,000 milligrams that most Americans eat (sodium is the ingredient
in table salt that is linked to higher blood pressure).
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half years, the study found, those who changed
their habits were 53 percent less likely to have high blood
pressure or need medicine than those who did not change. The people
who made changes also had fewer heart attacks and strokes. People
who either lost weight or reduced salt, but did not do both, were
30 percent less likely to need medicine. About 30 percent of those
who changed their habits were able to stay off medication after the
study ended.
</P>
<P>
   The study's director, Dr. Paul Whelton, dean of the school of
public health and tropical medicine at Tulane University, in New
Orleans, said the study's high rate of success was at least partly
linked to the age of the participants and their desire to avoid
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were older people, 60-80, and at that age range you're
seeing illness around you,'' Whelton said. ``They're well-motivated
to maintain sodium restriction and weight loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors wonder whether the findings can be applied to
real life, because people in the study received a good deal of help
from exercise and nutrition counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life style modification doesn't work for most people,'' said
Dr. Michael Alderman, professor of medicine and epidemiology at
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nasty little secret,'' he added. ``Either they can't
do it, or they do it, and it doesn't work. You spend six months
beating them on the head, and it makes them feel that if they
either tried harder or were better human beings it would have
worked.'' Some patients get so discouraged that they quit treatment
altogether; others wind up needing medication anyway, Alderman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers to start patients on medication right away, he said,
and if they want to avoid the pills and try lifestyle changes
first, he tries to talk them out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But even doctors who scoff at life style change seem willing to
give points to a plan known as Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension, the first diet to be recommended by the National High
Blood Pressure Education Program.
</P>
<P>
   The diet does not require people to lose weight, avoid salt or
liquor or count cholesterol. It adds foods instead of taking them
away. Specifically, it requires eating eight to 10 servings a day
(about 5 cups) of fruits and vegetables and 3 cups of low-fat dairy
foods, about twice what most Americans consume. But the diet has
less fat than the usual American diet: 26 percent of its calories
come from fat, rather than the usual 37 percent, and all the
reduction is in artery-clotting saturated fat. It is the same sort
of diet that some experts believe helps prevent cancer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Alderman calls the diet doable but says it has not been around
long enough for researchers to determine whether it can prevent
heart attacks and strokes over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The regimen was tested last year for eight weeks in 459 adults,
including 133 with mild hypertension. Researchers provided all
meals to make sure that everyone ate the correct diet. People with
normal blood pressure experienced a slight drop from the diet, but
those with hypertension had bigger drops, an average of 11.5/5.5
millimeters _ as much as treatment with a single drug usually
achieves. Results among blacks were better than those among whites.
</P>
<P>
   People with very high blood pressure who try the diet would
almost certainly still need medicines, but the diet could help
drugs work better and may allow doses to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the diet work? Dr. Frank Sacks, a professor of
nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health who helped set up
the study, said: ``I think the high potassium content of the diet
pretty much explains why it lowers blood pressure. It's half or
more of the effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcium and magnesium also probably play a role, but potassium
seems especially important, Sacks said. Fruits, vegetables and milk
are all rich in potassium, and the diet provides 4,400 milligrams
of the mineral a day, about the amount in 11 bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say they believe that potassium lowers blood pressure by
relaxing the arteries and by countering the effects of salt. And,
surveys show that blacks, who tend to have more blood pressure
problems than whites, consume less potassium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potassium might foster sodium excretion from the body,'' Sacks
said, adding that it also lowers blood pressure within the kidney.
In addition, some studies have shown that people who eat
high-potassium diets have fewer strokes than those who do not,
although people with kidney failure and those taking certain drugs
must avoid potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Whelton said, ``Potassium seems much more effective in people
who have more sodium in their diet. In people who have trouble
following sodium reduction, potassium gives you some backup.'' It
seems to help the body rid itself of excess water and salt, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For patients who will not eat vegetables, Sacks said, doctors
should consider potassium supplements. Yet few doctors prescribe
potassium to treat hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason,'' Sacks said, ``is that the science hasn't been so
firmly established until the last several years, and also not so
widely publicized.''
</P>
<P>
   A new study of the diet is trying to determine whether a
low-sodium version yields any added benefit. Because of their
higher sensitivity to salt, blacks will make up half the study's
participants. Results are expected in two years.

DISNEY'S MULAN GAME HAS 'EM CLICKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As sure as that big avalanche swept away the Huns
in ``Mulan,'' Disney has come up with a computer program based on
the hit animated film that should carry away your kids.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other major animated film Disney has released in
recent years, the company has come out with an ``animated
storybook'' for ``Mulan.'' And like many of those previous efforts,
it's well-done and should find favor throughout the 5- to
9-year-old set it's targeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' is based on a Chinese fable about a girl who disguises
herself as a warrior to replace her ailing father when a Hun
invasion forces the Chinese government to conscript soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The game centers around Mushu, the goofy supernatural dragon in
the film voiced by Eddie Murphy, as he tries to retrieve a series
of magic scrolls that he's accidentally dropped throughout the
film's main sites.
</P>
<P>
   The storybook tells Mulan's tale well enough, with lots of
small, interactive moments for children to play as they go.
</P>
<P>
   But probably the greater strength of the program, what allows
children such as my 6- and 7-year-old to keep playing and playing
are several other nifty features.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dress-up room where Mulan can try clothing,
hairstyles, shoes and accessories from various Chinese dynasties. A
click of a button allows children to print out clothing that can be
colored and used on two included paper dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The storybook also includes three playable videos of musical
scenes from the movie and displays the lyrics karaoke-style as they
play. For my children, that was big fun as they used the videos to
rehearse their own personal performances.
</P>
<P>
   And the storybook includes several games, including a matching
game using mah-jongg tiles similar to the longtime shareware
program Shanghai. Another game requires players to trace a route
across a mountainside, picking up gear before a length of rope runs
out.
</P>
<P>
   My children and a younger playmate gave the storybook two
decided thumbs up, and repeatedly asked to play it over several
days _ always a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   The game runs on both Macs and PCs and proved a breeze to set up
on either kind of machine.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. IN A BOX?: Care to monopolize the time of friends and
out-of-town visitors, and do it in an L.A. way that doesn't include
talking about how your latest script is in turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   Try Los Angeles in a Box, a Monopoly-based game from Late for
the Sky Production Co. in Cincinnati. If you know the old stalwart,
you basically know Los Angeles in a Box, though there are plenty of
cute, localized changes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Community Chest and Chance, the game has Big Fun! and
Contingency cards. Instead of Jail, it has a traffic-jam corner.
And instead of houses and apartments, it has Skyline sections and
Keys to the City. And instead of railroads and utilities, it sells
major thoroughfares such as Sunset Boulevard and vital
accouterments such as sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   In true Los Angeles-sprawl fashion, the game lets you plant
high-rises all over town as you acquire property. And the city of
Los Angeles is defined loosely, here including such regional
attractions as the Santa Monica Pier, Pasadena's Rose Bowl and
Inglewood's Great Western Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and for conspiracy-minded San Fernando Valley secessionists,
there's more reason for outrage at the downtown hegemonists: ``The
Valley,'' all of it, costs just $90 to buy. Spago, meanwhile, goes
for $190, and Hollywood, in all its faded, tinseled deterioration,
for $375.
</P>
<P>
   At least the La Brea Tar Pits go for less.

MRS. CLINTON TOURS HISTORICAL SITES TO PROMOTE PRESERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, starting a four-day tour to
promote historical preservation, announced Monday that designer
Ralph Lauren's company has donated $10 million to restore the Star
Spangled Banner, the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The gift from Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. is the largest corporate
donation ever received by the Smithsonian Institution, which owns
the National Museum of American History where the flag is on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, chairman of the corporation, added $3 million of his own
money to help pay for education programs for Mrs. Clinton's ``Save
America's Treasures'' initiative that seeks to preserve American
history and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said Lauren gave the money in response to President
Clinton's 1998 State of the Union address asking for help in
restoring American historical artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In thanking Lauren, the First Lady said: ``People say something
is very `Ralph Lauren' if it has a certain American style or
design. Perhaps after today, it will also come to symbolize ...
good citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   The president joined his wife at the history museum, the first
stop of her 10-site tour that is billed as a drive to restore
historical artifacts, buildings and monuments around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the planned repair of the historic flag and
offered his encouragement to preservation efforts around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every community in this country has a piece of itself that
must endure,'' he added. ``Americans need to know the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-by-34-foot flag was made of wool bunting in 1813 by Mary
Pickersgill of Baltimore and was flown over Fort McHenry in
Baltimore, Md., on Sept. 13-14, 1814, during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   During the British bombardment on the morning of Sept. 14, Key,
a lawyer, had gone out to the British fleet to obtain the release
of a prisoner but was prevented from returning to shore. At
approximately 7 a.m., he saw the flag flying from the fort and was
inspired to scribble the words to the poem that he would later set
to music. This song became the official national anthem in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   The flag will undergo repairs for the next three years at a
conservation laboratory in the museum at a cost of about $18
million to fix the damage from light, pollution and oxygen. The
restoration work will be visible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia announced a $5 million
gift for the project in February. Gifts from the John S. and James.
L. Knight Foundation and the Veterans of Foreign War will also
assist in the conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Describing her four-day tour of threatened historical sites,
Mrs. Clinton said: ``We are the caretaker's of our past. We have a
responsibility to future generations to be good ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement ceremony at the Smithsonian, Mrs. Clinton
traveled to Baltimore where she announced a project to repair
outdoor monuments in Baltimore, including the Francis Scott Key
monument.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rest of her schedule:
</P>
<P>
   _ TUESDAY: 9 a.m. Thomas Edison National Historic Site/Invention
Factory, West Orange, N.J. The site needs funds to preserve
artifacts and notes from Edison's laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. George Washington's Revolutionary War Headquarters,
Newburgh, N.Y. Washington stayed here for over 16 months during the
war. The site needs extensive repair.
</P>
<P>
   4:30 p.m. The Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Mass. Once the
host to famous entertainers including Sara Bernhardt, John Philip
Sousa and Rachmaninoff, the theater, built in 1903, is currently a
paint store. The theater is in need of refurbishment so it can be
used as a performance space once again.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEDNESDAY: 9:30 a.m. Kate Mullany House, Troy, N.Y. Mullany
was one of the earliest leaders of the women's movement in the
United States; she organized an all-female union in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   1:50 p.m. Harriet Tubman's house in Auburn, N.Y., where Tubman
assisted runaway slaves in the Underground Railroad movement.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. McClintock House in Waterloo, N.Y. Mrs. Clinton will
visit the Women's Rights National Historical Park which contains
several houses important to the fight for women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ THURSDAY: Seneca Falls, N.Y. Mrs. Clinton will end her tour on
Thursday with a speech in Seneca, where women gathered in 1848 in
the Women's Rights Convention to proclaim their equality with men
in the treatise, ``The Declaration of Sentiments.''

OUT OF THE WHOLE CLOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 19.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a young journalist embarrassed The New Republic and other
publications by fabricating articles, the columnist Richard Cohen
wrote that the young man should seek another line of work after
having filed articles `` &UR; made up out of whole cloth &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the independent counsel Kenneth Starr made
a speech about the tendency of government lawyers to seek excuses
like ``executive privilege'' or ``protective privilege'' to prevent
witnesses from testifying. ``The courts cannot be in the business
of creating new privileges,'' Starr said, `` &UR; from whole cloth &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This usage puzzles Elizabeth Hopkins in the editorial department
of The International Herald Tribune. She writes that she has not
been able to find the origin of  &UR; made up out of whole cloth &LR; .
Although the meaning is clear _ ``a story invented with no basis in
fact; a complete fiction'' _ the metaphoric origin is obscure. Just
what is the  &UR; whole cloth &LR; ? And what has any cloth to do with lying?
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; whole cloth &LR; , or  &UR; broadcloth &LR; , is material of the full size
as originally manufactured _ not the end bit or remnant or piece
cut out of the whole for reuse in a quilt or smaller-size garment.
Like a sense of the  &UR; whole person &LR;  _ well balanced, ``together'' _
 &UR; whole cloth &LR;  has integrity, akin to ``all wool and a yard wide.''
Then, early in the 19th century, the phrase's meaning flipped. In
1840, the Canadian novelist Thomas Haliburton, in his dialect-rich
``The Clockmaker,'' had his Yankee character named Sam Slick say:
``All that talk about her timper was  &UR; made out of whole cloth &LR; , and
got up a-purpose. ... What a fib! ... It's all  &UR; made out of whole
cloth &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1972 ``Hog on Ice,'' Charles Funk speculated that tailors
were suspected of being deceptive: ``Instead of using whole
material, as they advertised, they were really using patched or
pieced goods, or, it might be, cloth which had been falsely
stretched to appear to be of full width.'' The material presented
as being of  &UR; whole cloth &LR; , on that theory, had become suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Come at  &UR; cloth &LR;  another way, through its synonym  &UR; fabric &LR; , from
the Latin  &UR; fabrica &LR; , ``workshop,'' a place or structure where
things like clothing are made.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fabricate &LR;  means ``to construct, manufacture, frame''; in the
18th century, it took on a sinister sense of ``to make up a story,
to invent a lie, to forge a document.'' In 1805, President Thomas
Jefferson was accused of having cravenly fled from the state
capital, Richmond, during the Revolution, when he was governor of
Virginia. In helping his longtime aide, William Burwell, prepare
his defense against accusations of cowardice, Jefferson wrote,
``This  &UR; fabricated &LR;  flight from Richmond was not among the
charges.'' That sense of ``cooked up, untrue'' continues.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Patricia Smith, a talented young columnist for The
Boston Globe, was discovered by her editors to have made up
quotations. In her departing column, the sadder and wiser
journalist apologized to readers for committing ``one of the
cardinal sins of journalism: Thou shalt not  &UR; fabricate &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Today,  &UR; fabrication &LR;  is most often used when lie seems too
harsh. It's not too great a stretch to think of the  &UR; fabric &LR;  as
 &UR; cloth &LR;  deceptively made up of patches and remnants to appear as
 &UR; made of whole cloth &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fabricated &LR;  material is not always considered sinister: a
clergyman's distinctive garment has given it a good connotation in
a  &UR; man of the cloth &LR; . But six centuries ago,  &UR; cloth &LR;  was sometimes
spelled  &UR; clout &LR; , and in underworld slang, the original spelling has
been preserved in its meaning of ``cotton handkerchief.'' A thief
in London in the 19th century would blow his nose in a  &UR; clout &LR; .
Then _ perhaps because tossing a  &UR; clout &LR;  over a piece of jewelry
was a way of stealing it _ it became a verb for ``to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Partridge noted that  &UR; to clout heaps &LR;  was 20th-century
underworld lingo for ``to steal cars.'' From this slender thread I
weave a speculation that  &UR; cloth &LR; , or  &UR; clout &LR; , has a history of
nefariousness that may have influenced the whole phrase's semantic
shift from positive to negative. Mine is a shaky theory, but at
least it's made up of the partial cloth.
</P>
<P>
   BARRY'S GHOST
</P>
<P>
   ``William F. Buckley Jr. tells us,'' writes Jackson Williams of
Austin, Texas, ``that Brent Bozell was the ghostwriter of Barry
Goldwater's 1960 book, `The Conscience of a Conservative.' The very
next day, William Safire flatly credits Stephen Shadegg. ... One of
them might actually be right. I wonder which one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's righter than Buckley. Shadegg (whose son John now
serves in the House) wrote many of Goldwater's speeches in the late
'50s, but Bill Buckley, who was inside that conservative circle,
informs me thatBrent wrote the entire thing  &UR; ex nihilo &LR;  (from
nothing). He had been writing speeches for Barry for a couple of
years, but the book we're talking about, which I saw  &UR; pre partum &LR; ,
 &UR; in partu &LR;  and  &UR; post partum &LR;  (before, during and after birth) was
Brent's. (The parenthetical translations from Buckley's Latin are
mine; I presume  &UR; ante partum &LR;  would have spoiled the alliteration.)
</P>
<P>
   But what of the most memorable line Goldwater spoke? At the
Republican convention of 1964, as Rockefeller-Scranton forces were
calling themselves ``moderates'' and calling the Goldwater
supporters ``extremists,'' the victorious candidate intoned the
words that split and sank the party: ``I would remind you that
extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and let me remind
you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   I credited that to Karl Hess. This is disputed by Seth Leibshohn
of Washington, who holds that``the author of that speech was a
then-professor of political science at the University of Ohio and
now at Claremont, Henry Jaffa.''
</P>
<P>
   As best I can reconstruct it, the inflammatory speech was
largely written by Hess, with a quotation _ of Marcus Tullius
Cicero defying the conspiratorial Catiline _ contributed by Jaffa;
Goldwater (or one of his acknowledged ghosts) wrote later that ``I
had heard it earlier from the writer Taylor Caldwell.''
</P>
<P>
   Cicero, criticized for his hasty execution of five of Catiline's
supporters, said,``I must remind you, lords, senators, that extreme
patriotism in the defense of freedom is no crime and let me
respectfully remind you that pusillanimity in the pursuit of
justice is no virtue in a Roman.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have worked oratorically for Cicero, but backfired when
used by Goldwater.

SUN SHINES ON FRANCE'S NATIONAL HEROES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It rained here on Monday morning, and after France's
convincing 3-0 victory in the World Cup final the previous evening,
it was not surprising that some discouraged Brazilian fans
maintained that the precipitation in Paris was the tears of their
people falling from above.
</P>
<P>
   But by early afternoon the sky had cleared, and the members of
the French team, who had played with such precision and speed on
the field, took a more leisurely journey in an open bus up the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd estimated at 500,000 pressed as close to the vehicle as
police would allow as it crawled toward the Place de l'Etoile, and
on this joyous day it was difficult not to notice that the Arc de
Triomphe bore a certain resemblance to a soccer goal as it lay in
wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our biggest source of pride is to have created a sense
of communion with the French people,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet. ``I think they identified with this team. We put France in
the street and for a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than a million people in the streets of Paris on
Sunday night and millions more engaging in public displays of joy
and affection elsewhere in France, this was the biggest spontaneous
celebration in this nation of 58 million since Liberation in 1944.
There is no debating the relative importance of the two events, but
there is no question that the traditional Bastille Day celebrations
on Tuesday will seem like an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   France, no traditional sports power, now is in temporary
possession of the most prestigious trophy in sport. They won the
16th World Cup by outscoring the opposition 15 goals to two and, in
keeping with a competition that had no defining moment or player,
they relied on a different hero in nearly every match.
</P>
<P>
   France is the first host nation to win the Cup since Argentina
in 1978, but if it benefited from the snowballing support of its
usually reticent populace it did not benefit from favoritism from
the referees. Zinedine Zidane, who scored two goals against Brazil,
had to miss two games after receiving a red card for stepping on a
Saudi Arabian player. Star defender Laurent Blanc had to miss the
final after receiving a red card for a foul that Croatian defender
and part-time thespian Slaven Bilic made look like a crime against
humanity. Another vital French defender, Marcel Desailly, had to
miss the last 22 minutes of the final after being sent off with a
second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
   The referees in this World Cup often ruled with a heavy hand,
sending mixed signals but often deciding outcomes. New FIFA
president Sepp Blatter has made it clear that he wants to improve
their efficiency by making them professionals and using only the
best referees, regardless of nationality, in future World Cups. But
Desailly's departure on Sunday would not change the outcome of the
most lopsided World Cup final since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has stood in a line in France recently can confirm
that individualism still has a pride of place in this society, but
in the sporting arena the French clearly have learned to work well
together. The inferiority complex that used to afflict French
athletes with regularity on the biggest stages is becoming part of
the past along with the beret and bidet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being content to have surprised their nation by
reaching the first World Cup final in French history, Jacquet's
team played with enough energy and sang-froid to make it seem as if
they not the disoriented Brazilians were the perennial soccer
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it all felt very normal,'' said French
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. ``On the morning of the match, we really
believed that nothing bad could happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That state of mind is a tribute to the fact that the top French
players, unlike some French companies, have thoroughly embraced
open markets, leaving home for better salaries to test themselves
against the best competition available in the Italian, Spanish,
English and German leagues. It is also a tribute to Jacquet and his
steady, consistently communicative leadership style. Jacquet was
widely criticized in France for his defensive mindset and lack of
charisma, but the man known as ``Meme'' ended up making nearly
everyone happy in France, even his least favorite newspaper
L'Equipe, with which he has clashed frequently but which had one of
its best-selling days in history the morning after the French
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde, in a front-page editorial on Monday, wondered whether
Jacquet and his emphasis on virtues such as inclusion,
industriousness and collectivism could serve as ``a parable'' for a
country reputed to be ``tired and sclerotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Reforming mentalities in France is certainly a bigger job than
leading 22 players, but Jacquet confirmed on Monday that he will
resign his post because he and his team had accomplished what they
had set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he showed all along the way that he made the right
decisions,'' said defender Bixente Lizarazu.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was to emphasize loyalty. Lizarazu missed much of
last season with a leg injury after transferring to Bayern Munich
in Germany, but Jacquet told him that if he could get back into the
Munich lineup, he would still have his place with the national
team. Lizarazu did so this spring, and was excellent in France this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Christophe Dugarry struggled for the last two seasons
after leaving Bordeaux for AC Milan and then FC Barcelona, but he
kept Jacquet's faith and in spite of considerable criticism at
home, Jacquet included him on the team. Dugarry responded by
scoring the first French goal of the World Cup against South
Africa. Midfielder Christian Karembeu was out of action for nearly
all of last year because of a transfer dispute with his Italian
club Sampdoria, but after Karembeu finally managed to make his way
to Real Madrid in late December, Jacquet reinserted the fleet and
aggressive player in his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Karembeu already had helped set one massive celebration in
motion in May after Real Madrid won the Champions' League title. On
Sunday, Karembeu helped ignite another popular explosion of joy,
but the place that probably took the most delight in his
performance was his home of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. The
age of traditional colonialism is over, but the sun did not set
easily on the French victory celebrations on Sunday. Along with New
Caledonia, there was Thuram's native Guadeloupe; Desailly's native
Ghana; and Zidane's humble community of La Castellane in the
northern reaches of Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Clairefontaine, the French national team
headquarters south of Paris where the players returned at 3 a.m. on
Monday morning. They celebrated in private, but even those without
invitations who were standing outside the gates could see the
fireworks display the team had planned in case of victory. The 16th
World Cup was over, but the communion was not.

FIVE KEY ISSUES HEADING INTO 49ERS CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Six months after falling to the Green Bay
Packers in last season's NFC Championship Game, the 49ers face this
question as this season approaches: What's it going to take to
improve?
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had established almost everything possible going into
their final game of the 1997 season _ home-field advantage, a
healthy Steve Young, a hungry veteran team. The only thing they
were missing was injured star receiver Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   However, even his presence probably wouldn't have prevented
Green Bay's victory that day. The 49ers vanished from the Super
Bowl picture for the third consecutive year, and left knowing
something had to change. What they had clearly wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The offseason, as a result, featured a flurry of changes. Key
veterans from last year's team (Gary Plummer, Brent Jones, William
Floyd) are gone. Younger established players arrived through free
agency while unproven ones will have their chances to contribute
more often this season.
</P>
<P>
   The faces have changed some on the 49ers. What hasn't been
altered is their attitude. They finished 13-3 in head coach Steve
Mariucci's first season, but what they remember most is how the
Packers knocked them around Candlestick Park in January.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons to expect the 49ers to contend for a
Super Bowl spot again this season. But when they open their new
training camp in Stockton on Friday, the Niners will understand the
issues that must be resolved for them to maintain their place among
the NFL's best. These are the five biggest:
</P>
<P>
   KNEES: Until they play in a game, there will be endless
questions about the health of Rice, offensive lineman Harris Barton
and defensive end Gabe Wilkins, each of whom underwent knee
operations in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has said he'll be ready for this season, and his doctors
agree. If Barton, an 11-year veteran who missed all of 1997, can
return, he will add much needed experience and versatility to the
offensive line. Wilkins signed a $20 million free-agent deal in
February but his knee problem, which is similar to Barton's in
complexity, already has forced the team to keep Chris Doleman _ the
man Wilkins was supposed to succeed. The 49ers hope Wilkins will be
at full strength by the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE: The inside is solid here, with center Chris
Dalman flanked by Ray Brown and Pro Bowl selection Kevin Gogan at
guards. It's at tackle where the stability must be settled. With
the retirement of Kirk Scrafford, Derrick Deese moves from left to
right tackle. The team acquired Jamie Brown, a reserve in Denver
last season, and gave him Deese's old job. There isn't much proven
depth after the starting five, which is why quarterback Young said
he'll monitor this group's development.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE: Dana Stubblefield took his 15 sacks and inside
dominance to Washington in February, leaving Junior Bryant, who
rotated with Stubblefield and Bryant Young last season, as the man
on the spot. He's about 15 pounds lighter than Stubblefield, but
he's also a fine fundamental player. The 49ers hope to find a solid
third tackle to take Bryant's old position. Wilkins' injury has
given Doleman a chance to keep his job, one he handled well last
season (12 sacks).
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING GAME: Garrison Hearst enjoyed his best year last season,
running for 1,019 yards and balancing out the offense. But there
will be more pressure on him this year. Terry Kirby is gone, and
there's no legitimate backup. Fullback is more of a question. The
team didn't re-sign Floyd, who moved on to Carolina, and Marc
Edwards is entering his second year. Mariucci already has indicated
one-back formations will be utilized more often this season.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FACES: For a team that didn't have much salary-cap room
entering the free-agent market, the 49ers operated like an
organization that missed the playoffs by one game instead of the
Super Bowl. They signed linebacker Winfred Tubbs from New Orleans
to replace Plummer. Wilkins came a few days later, around the same
time as another former Saint, tight end Irv Smith, who will try to
make people forget Jones' consistency. Add in cornerback Antonio
Langham, who takes over for Rod Woodson on the left side, and the
team has turned much younger in each of those positions. All they
have to do now is prove that youth translates into improvement.

WONDERING HOW THE WORLD WILL END? SOME MORDANT THOUGHTS FROM
PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In contrast with the malevolent scientists of horror movies,
most physicists are well-adjusted, friendly, attractive people
whose conspicuous brain power is generally mixed with the milk of
human kindness.
</P>
<P>
   It might therefore seem a little uncharacteristic that some
physicists are eagerly hoping to see some tiny blue flashes streak
through a cathedral-size water tank buried under a mountain: a
signal that an inexorable process of annihilation is gnawing away
at the universe. The universal rot, if it is real, will take untold
eons to complete, but it will be thorough, leaving no stars, no
people, no monuments, no cinders, no sonnets, no atoms, no
memories.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a faint and ever fading glow, the corpse of our
universe would cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a harbinger of this dismal future would be welcomed by
many theorists.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 20th century, physicists have tried to construct
a theory that would mathematically bring three of the four known
forces of nature _ the electromagnetic force and the weak and
strong nuclear forces _ into consonance. (A theoretical
assimilation of the fourth force, gravity, poses many more
formidable problems for theorists.)
</P>
<P>
   There are various candidates for the title Grand Unified Theory,
but none has been validated by experiment or observation, and all
of them seem to embody a disquieting requirement: the eventual
death of every proton in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in nearly two decades of searching, no experiment has
produced convincing evidence of the decay of even one proton, much
less an appreciable fraction of the 10 to the 79th power protons
the universe is estimated to contain. (That number is mathematical
notation for the numeral one followed by 79 zeros.)
</P>
<P>
   This hasn't stopped scientists from continuing the search; in
fact, there are hopes that the mighty Super-Kamiokande detector
under a mountain near Kamioka, Japan, which contains 50,000 tons of
water, will soon see the telltale flash signaling the death of a
proton. This minuscule event, the theorists predict, would yield
some decay products. In one possible decay route, the products
would be an anti-electron and a pi meson, which would almost
instantly decay into two gamma-ray photons. In another proton decay
mode, the debris would include a K meson with a specific energy
associated with proton decay, and a virtually undetectable
neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of a proton (or better, of several protons) would
make it easier for theorists to build a Grand Unified Theory that
would actually work. Frustrated scientists therefore feel a certain
urgency in the quest for deceased protons. During a physics
conference in Japan last month, Dr. Frank Wilczek of the Institute
of Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J., told an audience that ``if
we don't see proton decay pretty soon, we'll be in serious
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if scientists do detect a proton decay, the whole
universe, not just theorists, will be in serious trouble. The death
of just one proton would herald the eventual end of everything; if
one proton can decay, all protons will decay, and without protons
there can be no atoms, molecules, DNA, mountains, roses or
concertos.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, even if a protonic funeral should occur in the
coming months, the demise of the universe would not be imminent. In
exquisitely sensitive experiments in Japan and elsewhere,
physicists have determined that if protons decay at all, it must
take them more than 2.5 times 10 to the 32nd power years to die, on
average. That's about 10 quintillion times the present age of the
universe, which is believed to be about 14 billion years. (Although
the average lifespan of a proton must be phenomenally long, a
handful of them could be expected to have short lifetimes, some
ending now rather than in the remote future. This is why the
current search for proton decay is practical.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, inhabitants of the surface of our terrestrial ball of
iron and stone have many more immediate worries than proton decay,
astrophysicists tell us. The devastating impact of a large comet or
asteroid, for example, has furnished profitable grist for movie
makers, and there are lots of other celestial catastrophes the
entertainment industry has yet to mine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The nearby explosion of a supernova is one. There is no telling
when or where a supernova will explode, but a few known candidates
are uncomfortably close. The red supergiant star Betelgeuse, a mere
430 light years from the Earth, might be about ready to pop.
Betelgeuse, a bright star at the shoulder of the constellation
Orion, is close enough to us that its explosion could conceivably
shower the Earth with potentially harmful radiation and disrupt the
protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   Another nasty possibility came to light during the past year _
roasting by a nearby gamma-ray burster.
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of orbiting gamma ray telescopes in recent
years, astrophysicists have been puzzled by gamma ray bursters _
spots in the sky that emit intense gamma-ray radiation for a few
seconds or hours and then fade away without a trace, never to
recur.
</P>
<P>
   But observations by a new gamma-ray satellite named BeppoSAX,
built by Italy and the Netherlands, are so fast and so accurate
that they can be used by optical, infrared and X-ray observatories
to hunt for faint objects created by or left over from the fleeting
gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Such objects have been found, and their distances from the Earth
measured. This led to a sensational surprise last year: some gamma
ray bursters appear to be vastly farther away than had been
believed. To produce gamma rays of the intensity recorded from the
vicinity of the Earth, these mysterious objects must be almost
inconceivably powerful. One of them seems to have produced more
energy in a few seconds than an entire galaxy generates during a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists surmise that such ``hypernovas'' may result from the
violent merger of pairs of black holes or black holes with neutron
stars. But no one knows how these great bombs are distributed
throughout the universe; if one happened to go off relatively near
the Earth, there could be dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Among the outlandish doomsday scenarios dreamed up by some
scientists is the possibility that the energy density of ``empty''
space in our part of the universe represents a ``false vacuum''_ an
emptiness pervaded by a certain amount of hidden energy. The menace
is that there might be another vacuum with a lower energy level
into which our part of the universe might tumble, losing all its
protons and thereby obliterating our neck of the universal woods,
ourselves included.
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested by some non-physicists, led by Paul Dixon,
a psychologist at the University of Hawaii, that the powerful
Tevatron particle accelerator at Fermilab in Illinois (which
collides particles together at a combined energy of 2 trillion
electronvolts) might pack so much punch it could start a tear in
our friendly space-time along with its false vacuum. Such a
catastrophe, it is surmised, would propagate at the speed of light,
plunging Batavia, Ill., the site of Fermilab, and the rest of the
universe into non-existence.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists scoff at this notion, saying that the Earth is
continuously peppered by cosmic rays that have energies up to 10 to
the 19th power electronvolts _ about 10 million times more energy
than the most potent accelerator collisions _ and yet our universe
survives.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Fermilab is pestered often enough by doom-saying
demonstrators that the editors of the laboratory's news letter
devoted two pages last month to debunking the torn space-time
threat.
</P>
<P>
   This seems to be the season for contemplating decay and doom,
not only in movies but in such serious publications as Sky &AMP;
Telescope magazine. The August issue features an article entitled
``Future of the Universe,'' which paints a somber process of
universal aging and decay, with the last stars winking out about
100 trillion years from now, and even the most massive black holes
evaporating in around 10 to the hundredth power years.
</P>
<P>
   But although the long-term prognosis for our ``region'' of the
universe is grim, physics offers some possibilities that could save
us from the awful all-becoming nothing, to borrow a phrase from
Asian philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
whose revolutionary conjectures have strongly influenced
cosmological thinking during the last two decades, envisions an
eternal process, in which our stable region of the universe must
run down to cold, dark death, but other unstable regions of the
universe might undergo the same instantaneous process of
``inflation'' that our own region supposedly once underwent long
ago. Inflation, in the cosmological sense, means not only
instantaneous expansion of space-time, but the spontaneous creation
of energy to fill the new space-time, providing the raw stuff of a
new universe.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of observatories and experiments now on the
drawing board may provide some answers to human's most deep-seated
questions about the texture and fate of universal existence. In any
case, the quest will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the Sky &AMP; Telescope article, Dr. Fred Adams of
the University of Michigan and Dr. Gregory Laughlin of the
University of California at Berkeley, put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether life can exist indefinitely, or whether the universe
is structured to guarantee the final annihilation of all
consciousness, purpose and meaning _ including any record that such
things ever existed _ holds an inordinate fascination.''

ONCE ALMOST EXTINCT, FALCONS AGAIN FLY OVER NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Md., Wash., Mass., Ill., Ont.)  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the canyons of Wall Street to the city's great
bridges, from the steeple of Riverside Church to one of the city's
most prestigious medical complexes, peregrine falcons, once near
extinction, are nesting, breeding and, most assuredly, endearing
themselves to Gotham residents.
</P>
<P>
   New York's 12 pairs of breeding falcons number more than any
other city's, and there appear to be at least three other pairs
that did not breed this spring. About 24 chicks were born this
year, 20 of which survive. They inhabit at least four buildings and
eight bridges.
</P>
<P>
   To say the least, New Yorkers are charmed. ``You hear these
truly joyful breeding sounds,'' said Adele A. Lerner, archivist at
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where a ledge between the
24th and 25th floors of the main building has been home to breeding
falcons since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The city's peregrine falcons are one of the nation's happiest
environmental success stories, so successful that Washington plans
to remove the species from the endangered list. The pesticide DDT
and related compounds that were first used after World War II
altered the birds' calcium metabolism, making their eggshells
perilously thin. Other effects of these compounds were even more
sinister: in some cases, falcons ate their young.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1972, DDT was banned, and in the 1980s Cornell University
began the chancy process of reintroducing the species. Scientists
collected specimens from falconers and successfully experimented
with artificial insemination. They put up nesting boxes, first on
bridges, then buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a perfect environment. The falcons, which
once lived on cliffs, adapted easily to man-made aeries. They loved
the open rivers as highways to glide at speeds clocked at more than
200 miles an hour. The former predators of the extinct passenger
pigeon acquired a taste for street pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   And they almost gleefully demonstrated their bloodthirsty
habits, particularly in mating competition among males, which are a
third smaller than the 20-inch-long females. ``We see a lot of
battling out there,'' said Christopher A. Nadareski, a biologist
with the city Department of Environmental Affairs who has studied
the species. ``Sometimes the birds will kill each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction was replicated in other cities, including
Baltimore, Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Toronto. And the peregrine
falcons were only one of a number of raptor species to reappear in
the wake of the DDT dread. On one day last fall, a New York Parks
Department team counted 1,184 hawks, 54 osprey and 4 bald eagles.
The migrating hawks passed at the rate of 15 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the peregrines are year-round residents. They are returning
to a place that was the home for some as recently as the 1950s.
Nadareski said that, in addition to the damage done by DDT, they
were depleted by falconers and collectors of their rust-colored
eggs. Though he acknowledged that removing the birds from the
endangered _ and even threatened _ species lists demonstrates
success, he worries these behaviors could recur.
</P>
<P>
   ``They exist only at the will of humans,'' he said.

   Before a trip, or during one if you travel with a computer,
check one or both of these sites to find an ATM for when you run
short of cash. Each can be searched by region or airport. The
Mastercard site also has what it describes as a map for finding
ATM's in the United States. (I found three in my hometown, but
never saw a map.)
</P>
<P>
   The ATM's are regular ones that accept Mastercard or Visa;
whatever other services are available depends on the bank or
country. The Web sites are full of guides to shopping at places
that, of course, accept one of the cards. An index in the
Mastercard site, for instance, lists places to buy books, music and
jewelry, and how to assemble travel packages. The Visa site can be
switched to the native languages of China (including Hong Kong and

   Travelers can book domestic and international flights with
convenience (and probably savings) at the Web site of STA Travel,
set up in Australia in the 1970s primarily for students and others
under the age of 26. You don't have to be either to get a ticket at
a good price _ although it may not be as good a price as a student
would receive. The fares are the ones currently being offered to
students by the airlines, and they vary from time to time, but
tickets obtained through STA Travel have fewer restrictions, with
one-way fares, no advance purchase requirements, and refunds on
unused tickets. The site is so colorful it verges on illegible, at
least to these over-26 eyes, but it is worth a bit of squinting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can now enter when and where you want to travel and get
back our latest air fare price,'' STA Travel promises. ``If you
like what you see, hold your seats and purchase your tickets, all
on-line, while you sit at home in your pajamas.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, but I did carry out most of
the steps to reserve a seat from Newark to Copenhagen Aug. 5,
returning on Aug. 19. I was asked whether I was a student and, if
so, at what school, my nationality and birth date. Posing as a
20-year-old student at Rutgers, I was quickly presented with a
choice of flights. On neither the first, on SAS for $732, nor the
second, Lufthansa for $841, was a seat available, at least for a
student. But KLM had seats on Aug. 5 and 6 for $844. A quick check
with a travel agent found that a regular ticket, on British
Airways, was $959.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from booking flights, which must originate in the United
States, you can get Eurail Passes, travel insurance and an
International Student Identity Card, which you must have to
complete the booking (I didn't have one, of course). There are also
sections helpful in planning trips and exchanging information about
them. The Show and Tell section featured nine forums when I checked
it: destinations, travel tips, hot places to go, great places to
stay, site feedback, jobs, backpackers international, help and
around-the-world travel. There were no hot places to go, as it
turned out, but there were seven great places to stay.  &QL;

   US-JAPAN _WASHINGTON _ Monday's resignation by Japanense Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, nine days before a planned state visit
to the White House, left world stock markets and the Clinton
administration scrambling to assess whether Japan's next government
would accelerate reforms needed to lift Japan's lifeless economy
and prevent it from dragging down global growth. On first blush,
the White House said it expects the next prime minister _ as yet

ailing banking system and invigorate consumer spending, measures
long resisted by Tokyo. (Deans, Cox News Service).

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1972, when the National High Blood Pressure Education
Program was established, its public health message was simple and
compelling: Treating high blood pressure would save lives. It was
right. The program has been credited with substantially lowering
death rates from stroke and coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, though, the news has been less encouraging. The
stroke rate has been creeping up again, and not just because
Americans are aging. The decline in heart disease, never as great
as experts had expected, seems to be leveling off, and kidney
disease and congestive heart failure, both linked to hypertension,
are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed, scientists have begun to re-examine the treatment of
high blood pressure, asking how much of the ominous trend can be
blamed on lackadaisical doctors and patients who do not take
hypertension seriously enough, and how much on the limitations of
treatment itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are struggling now with the concept that we are not doing a
good job,'' said Dr. Franz Messerli of the hypertension department
at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans. ``We know we can reduce blood
pressure, we know it's beneficial to do so, and still it's not
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that of the 50 million Americans
estimated to have high blood pressure, only 34 million know it.
Just 27 million seek treatment, and only half of them get their
blood pressure under control, which is defined as below 140/90
millimeters of mercury. Those figures, from a survey taken from
1991-94, show people to be worse off than three years before, when
awareness, treatment and control were all slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We home in on the public and say they're not taking their
pills,'' said Dr. Marvin Moser, clinical professor of Medicine at
Yale University Medical School. ``But I think we should be paying
more attention to the problem of adherence to treatment guidelines
by the doctor.'' Many doctors, he said, are not following those
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And that means many patients are not getting the best treatment
for their high blood pressure and its complications, other
researchers agreed. But experts also admit that their research has
not given doctors all the information they need to make the best
decisions about treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Two important issues have not been resolved. First, it is not
known whether all drugs that lower blood pressure also protect
against heart attack and stroke. Second, more studies are needed to
compare different drugs and determine whether some work better than
others in particular types of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood as it pushes out
against the walls of the arteries. When pressure surges too high,
it can damage the vessels and lead to arteriosclerosis, heart
disease, stroke and kidney failure. Doctors define optimal blood
pressure, associated with the lowest cardiovascular risk, as below
120/80 millimeters of mercury. The first number, the systolic
pressure, is measured while the heart is contracting, and the
second, the diastolic reading, is taken while the heart is relaxing
between beats.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pressure climbs past 120/80, the risk of cardiovascular
disease begins to rise. But the condition is not called
hypertension until the pressure exceeds 140/90, and then the goal
of treatment is just to get it below that cut-off number. Few
patients ever make it back into the charmed zone below 120/80.
</P>
<P>
   People with mild hypertension and no other risk factors are
often advised to try lowering it through exercise and diet for six
to 12 months. Others are given medicine. The first choice for most
patients, according to the national guidelines, should be diuretics
and beta blockers, though doctors can use other classes of drugs if
the first try does not work.
</P>
<P>
   But basing treatment decisions solely on the numbers read off a
sphygmomanometer, the familiar cuff used to measure blood pressure,
can be a mistake. Two people may have the same high blood pressure
reading for different reasons, and their odds of developing heart
disease may also differ, depending on other risk factors like
smoking, age, obesity, race, high cholesterol and triglycerides,
abnormal glucose metabolism, kidney problems and enlargement of the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who focus on blood pressure alone may neglect other
conditions that still pose risks for heart disease, said Dr.
Michael Alderman, professor of medicine and epidemiology at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He labeled that approach
simplistic and said therapy should be tailored to individual needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more complicated than just measuring the blood
pressure and giving people pills,'' Alderman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most recent guidelines from the national program
recommend certain types of drugs specifically for people with
problems like diabetes, Alderman said more research is needed to
fine-tune such advice.

   CHOOSING TREATMENT: STUDY FINDS MERITS IN INTENSIVE THERAPY
</P>
<P>
   There are doctors who specialize in hypertension, and
enterprising patients who seek them out, but most people depend on
internists and family practitioners, who may or may not be well
versed in the 65 different drugs and 29 combination pills used to
treat high blood pressure. Hypertension is not an officially
recognized medical specialty, but those who devote their careers to
it think it should be, and their professional group, the American
Society of Hypertension, based in New York, announced plans in May
to try to make it one.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting research to address basic questions that remain
unanswered is among the group's goals. For instance, doctors have
debated about how far it is necessary and safe to go in lowering a
patient's blood pressure. Although readings below 140/90 are the
accepted goal of treatment, studies show that any reading above
120/80 increases the risk of stroke and heart attack. But studies
have not shown whether using drugs to get closer to 120/80 can
provide any added benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A new study suggests that more intensive treatment is
worthwhile. The study included almost 19,000 people in 26 countries
who started out with a diastolic blood pressure, represented by the
second number, between 100 and 115. The patients were divided into
three groups with different targets for diastolic pressure: 80 or
less, 85 or less and 90 or less. People with diabetes who reached a
pressure of 80 or less benefited most: They had 50 percent fewer
heart attacks than those whose readings were between 80 and 90. For
others, the study suggested that pressure should be reduced to
138/83 or lower because patients who met that target had the fewest
deaths from cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the June 13 issue of the journal Lancet,
provides evidence that doctors should be more aggressive in
treating hypertension, said Messerli, who was not involved in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences of opinion over the best way to lower
blood pressure. Moser, for instance, said he has been trying for
years to convince his colleagues that diuretics should be used more
often, alone or combined with other drugs. Also known as water
pills, diuretics reduce blood volume and lower blood pressure by
increasing the excretion of water and salt through the kidneys.
They also relax blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the June 10 issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association, Moser noted that the use of diuretics
has gone down in the past 15 years, despite the national
guidelines. Some doctors avoid prescribing diuretics, Moser said,
because of exaggerated concerns about side effects like elevated
blood sugar and cholesterol. With small doses, those effects are
usually small, he said, adding that doctors can monitor for them
and change therapy if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Moser traces the decline in diuretic use in part to the
pharmaceutical industry, which he said influences medical practice
by advertising newer, more expensive drugs, promoting them at
medical meetings, handing out free samples and paying doctors to
give promotional talks under the guise of lectures at medical
conferences. The net effect, he said, has been to draw doctors away
from diuretics, which have been proven to prevent heart attacks and
strokes, and toward newer, more costly medications like calcium
blockers and ACE inhibitors, whose long-term effects are less well
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these other drugs came out and doctors stopped using
diuretics, we started getting a lot of resistant patients,'' Moser
said in a telephone interview, referring to people whose blood
pressure escaped control even though they were taking two or three
different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of them at Yale became responders when a little
bit of diuretic was added and the other drug was reduced. The other
drugs are good, and thank goodness we have them, but if we used
more diuretics we'd have fewer resistant patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Messerli also said diuretics were underused, especially in
people over age 60. He recently reviewed 10 published studies
involving a total of more than 16,000 patients, and concluded that
many of the 6 million older people now taking drugs known as beta
blockers _ a practice in keeping with current treatment guidelines
_ would be better off taking diuretics, which have been proven to
reduce the risk of heart attack. His findings were published in the
June 17 Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although beta blockers work well in young and
middle-aged patients, in older people the drugs do not prevent
heart attacks, do not even lower blood pressure effectively and too
often cause side effects, including fatigue, depression and loss of
sexual function.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are so many older patients given beta blockers?
Messerli speculated that doctors are confused, because there is one
group of elderly patients in whom the drugs are essential: those
who have already had a heart attack. Even in patients who do not
have high blood pressure, beta blockers help prevent additional
heart attacks. It might seem reasonable to assume that if the drugs
can prevent second heart attacks, they can prevent first ones, too.
But there is no evidence that they can.

<P>
   COMPARING THE DRUGS: MONEY FOR RESEARCH IS SLOW IN COMING
</P>
<P>
   The information that doctors and patients want most _ data on
which drug really is best for which patient _ has been slow in
coming. Until recent years, relatively few studies were done to
compare drugs, largely because the pharmaceutical industry, which
finances much of the research on hypertension drugs, was not eager
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were manufacturing a drug and it was selling like hot
cakes, why would you risk a study comparing it to other drugs?''
asked Moser. Drug companies sold about $9 billion in blood pressure
medications in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they're doing the studies because there's pressure to do
them,'' Moser said, noting that about 30 comparative trials are
under way, with results expected in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Alderman cited a study published in March in The New England
Journal of Medicine as an example of what comparative studies can
reveal. In that study, 470 patients with Type 2 diabetes, the more
common, adult-onset form of the disease, were divided into two
groups, with 235 taking a calcium blocker and 235 a type of drug
known as an ACE (or angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs lowered blood pressure equally well, but after five
years, an alarming difference showed up between the two groups:
there were 25 heart attacks in the calcium blocker group, but only
five in the ACE inhibitor group. The study, being conducted at the
University of Colorado, was halted early to give the people on
calcium blockers a chance to switch to an ACE inhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, said Alderman, who was not involved in the study, is
that just lowering blood pressure does not wipe out all risk. ``How
you lower the pressure may make a difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study said their findings needed to be
verified by larger studies. But in the meantime, many doctors are
taking the results seriously and steering people with diabetes
towards ACE inhibitors, which had already been recommended for
diabetics, because the inhibitors also seem to slow the progression
of kidney disease and some heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Future studies are also expected to help determine whether the
difference in heart attacks occurred because calcium blockers
actually harm the heart in diabetics, or because ACE inhibitors are
better at protecting the heart. Dr. Curt Furberg, professor and
chairman of the department of public health sciences at Wake Forest
University of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said he
thought calcium blockers would be proved harmful to diabetics,
because diabetes changes cell structure so that calcium blockers
bind to the cells more strongly. ``So you get a magnified effect,
sort of like having too high a dose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Alderman, the Colorado study was a reminder that blood
pressure is only part of a person's medical picture, and that
relying too much on the numbers can lead to false reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that we're shifting away from the notion
that it's all about blood pressure to the fact that there's a
vascular disease out there for which high blood pressure is a
marker,'' he said. ``High blood pressure is a physical sign that
tells us about a system gone awry, but it doesn't tell us the
cause. Blood pressure is part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   FINDING THE CAUSE: WHY SYSTEM FAILS REMAINS A MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
   People with high blood pressure who wonder ``why me?'' rarely
get the satisfaction of an answer. About 90 percent of cases are
labeled ``essential'' hypertension, and no reason is pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate causes are the same ones that would boost the
pressure in any plumbing system. They include excess fluid in the
circulatory system, pushing too hard on blood vessels. Vessels may
also have constricted or become stiff. Or the heart may beat too
hard, pumping out extra blood with each beat.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying causes are harder to sort out. The sympathetic
nervous system, agent of the ``fight-or-flight'' response to a
threat, can drive blood pressure up or down by sending alarm calls
to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. In some people, blood
pressure rises because the kidneys make too much of an enzyme
called renin, which leads to production of the hormones angiotensin
II and angiotensin III. Those hormones can make arteries constrict
and also stimulate the release of another hormone, aldosterone,
which makes the kidney retain salt and excrete potassium. The salt
(sodium) draws in water, expanding the volume of blood in the
circulatory system, increasing the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Why the systems that regulate blood pressure go awry in the
first place is not fully understood. Hypertension runs in some
families, probably the result of multiple genes. But the genes may
be just a predisposing factor, waiting for an environmental trigger
to set them off. In some people, gaining weight does it. Some,
especially blacks and the elderly, seem especially sensitive to
salt in the diet. Smoking, lack of exercise and drinking a lot of
alcohol can also contribute. But thin people who do not smoke or
drink sometimes become hypertensive, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, researchers in California have been
studying about 200 people with family histories of high blood
pressure, who are thought to have an inherited disorder called the
hypertension syndrome. They are probably a minority of all
hypertension patients, but their evolving medical histories may
shed light on the course of high blood pressure in other people as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being led by Dr. Joel Neutel, director of research
at the Orange County Heart Institute and chief of hypertension and
clinical pharmacology at the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Long Beach. He and his colleagues have selected people, many in
their mid-20s, who do not have hypertension but have at least one
parent with it.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have found that many of these people already
have disorders often associated with hypertension, even though
their blood pressure is still normal: high cholesterol, high renin
levels and abnormally high levels of the hormone insulin, which
their bodies do not use efficiently to metabolize glucose. The
raised insulin levels may be brought on by excess weight, which is
a problem for many of the subjects. Excess insulin and renin can
cause stiffening of the arteries and enlargement of the main
pumping chamber of the heart, which have also been found in the
subjects. Heart enlargement can lead to dangerous rhythm
abnormalities and heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the things causing cardiovascular disease in these
patients may be there before the onset of hypertension, and may
cause hypertension,'' Neutel said. Stiffening of the arteries, for
instance, seems to occur several years before hypertension sets in.
</P>
<P>
   By the time blood pressure goes up, vascular damage may have
already begun, Neutel said, and hypertension may accelerate it. The
best way to help the patients will probably be to try to identify
and treat them early. Doctors suspect that ACE inhibitors may be
useful, but studies have not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Neutel said, ``the best thing we can advise them is to
be very diligent about diet and exercise.''

<P>
   As the century began, optimists could easily have convinced
themselves that by the time 2000 rolled around there would be
nothing left for scientists and theologians to argue about. Each
would have long since agreed on how to divvy up the intellectual
terrain. Science would continue its inevitable march toward a grand
explanation of how the material world works, leaving to religion
the endless arguments over why the universe came to be and how
people ought to behave in it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wished could continue to believe in higher, spiritual
forces, whose existence was safely beyond the scrutiny of
experiment. But almost everyone, believer and nonbeliever alike,
would slowly come to embrace a compelling new picture of creation
woven from the interplay between reason and observation.
</P>
<P>
   With this tacit understanding in place, the age-old conflict
between religion and science _ the truths of God versus the truths
of man _ would fade away.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened that way. No Giordano Brunos are being burned
at the stake for challenging church doctrine, and there are no
Galileos under house arrest. But the skirmishes between science and
religion still flare, with neither content to stay on its side of
the frontier. In the late 20th century's intellectual free-for-all,
it's sometimes hard to tell the players apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sociobiology, repackaged with the fancy new name ``evolutionary
psychology,'' continues to outrage the faithful by trying to
explain away religious belief and moral behavior as outgrowths of
competing snippets of DNA. Cosmologists and physicists sound like
theologians as they proclaim that the purpose of their quest is, as
Stephen Hawking put it, to ``know the mind of God.''
</P>
<P>
   When the physicist George Smoot announced, several years ago,
the discovery of faint wrinkles in the cosmic background radiation
_ long-sought data needed to explain the unfolding of the cosmos _
he said it was like ``looking at God.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk is often more metaphorical than reverential,
but Einstein wasn't kidding when he started the trend with his
oft-quoted musings about a God who is ``subtle but not malicious''
and who does not play with quantum dice. Then as now, these kinds
of pronouncements reveal the depth of the ambitions behind the
cosmological endeavor: final answers to the ultimate mysteries. The
implication is that religion should step aside and leave it all to
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two ways to play this game. Religious believers
seem more eager than ever to step over the line, trying to
interpret scientific data to support the revealed truths of their
own theology. The creationists are old hands at this, with their
arguments that radioactive dating, properly massaged, actually
supports an Earth just thousands of years old and a universe
created in seven days. Nearly 150 years after the publication of
Darwin's ``On the Origin of Species,'' biologists and geologists
are still defending their craft before state legislators who want
schools to teach that evolution is ``just a theory'' _ something
that could also be said for the hypothesis that the Earth orbits
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   This marshaling of scientific data in the name of religion
reached strange new heights four years ago with a popular book
called ``The Physics of Immortality'' (Doubleday), in which
cosmologist Frank Tipler drew on quantum physics, computer science,
sociobiology and game theory to try to prove mathematically the
existence of an eternal afterlife. The entertaining result made
both scientists and theologians cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Less audacious books trying to find connections between science
and religion have appeared sporadically throughout the century. But
the recent surge has been remarkable, with titles like ``The
Science of God: The Convergence of Scientific and Biblical
Wisdom,'' by Gerald L. Schroeder (The Free Press, 1997), and
``Skeptics and True Believers: The Exhilarating Connection Between
Science and Religion,'' by Chet Raymo (Walker, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   With the border between science and religion threatening to
erode, there is even talk of trying to reconcile them, as though
they were just two different denominations at the same ecumenical
gathering. If Lutherans and Catholics can unsplit a few hairs and
agree on some points of belief, as happened last month, then why
not scientists and theologians?
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled John Templeton Foundation has embarked on a plan
to establish science-and-religion programs at universities
throughout the world. Last month, it underwrote a multimillion
dollar conference at Berkeley called ``Science and the Spiritual
Quest,'' seeking to find common ground.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a change from the days when a bold new theory
could land a scientist before an ecclesiastical tribunal. Even the
most devout know that science is here to stay. Any religion that
outrightly rejects science's most powerful theories _ like
evolution and the big bang _ will find itself relegated to
society's fringes. For the churches, part of the motivation for
``dialogue,'' as they like to call it, is purely strategic:
religion needs to secure a niche for itself in an increasingly
scientific world.
</P>
<P>
   And some theologians may feel that science, for all its
confident airs, has fallen into an uncharacteristically vulnerable
position, with more of its practitioners willing to admit that
their picture of the universe is far from complete, and probably
never will be. In counterpoint to the heady declarations about
physicists finding God is a quieter chorus of scientists agonizing
over how little of the infinite cosmos puny human brains may ever
really understand.
</P>
<P>
   The philanthropic Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has even launched a
program to plumb the limits of science _ ``unknowability,'' as the
effort is sometimes called. If some scientists are admitting that
they can't find all the answers, then maybe it is time to talk.

</P>
<P>
   Lingering in the background of some of this soul-searching is
postmodern philosophy, with its message that all belief systems,
scientific and religious, are just human constructions. This kind
of thinking has recently been making inroads in some theological
schools and seminaries, as it has in university English
departments. Through this lens, science is just one more religion;
the Periodic Table of the Elements and the Apostle's Creed are just
two more texts to deconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   Most religious leaders reject postmodern relativism as a
dangerous threat to moral certainty, and scientists find it as
obnoxious as biblical creationism and the repackaged medieval
sorcery hawked by the New Age prophets of Sedona and Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, very few scientists, even those with strong
religious beliefs, have jumped on the reconciliation bandwagon. In
the labs and the lecture halls they still diligently uphold the
strict quarantine between the tentative truths derived through
hypothesis and experiment and the unshakable convictions that
spring from faith. What business do scientists have in trying to
shore up religion's received wisdom? And is any church going to
abandon a doctrine because it doesn't stand up to experiment? Push
science and religion too close enough together and they repel as
surely as oil and water.
</P>
<P>
   Why then do they keep making forays into each other's
hinterlands? And why do some people feel the need not just to cross
over the border but to tear it down?
</P>
<P>
   Some of these yearnings surely spring from the human compulsion
to build all-embracing explanations. It's hard to abandon the hope
for a system that accounts for everything, from why there is
something instead of nothing to how snowflakes form. If one is true
to this belief, then science must ultimately subsume religion or
vice versa _ at least in one's own mind. The truce, dividing up the
spoils, would be just temporary and tactical, a holding action in
the march to tell the ultimate story.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to finding final answers, seekers _ religious
and scientific _ know deep down that there are weaknesses in both
their approaches. The teachings of any religion ultimately come
from ancient revelations by people who said they were prophets and
heard the voice of God. These truths can be embraced as absolute
and timeless, but they are necessarily based on a leap of faith _
the very source of religion's strength. What if the prophets turn
out to be wrong? Or nonexistent?
</P>
<P>
   As with religion, science's weakness is also its strength: its
knowledge is, by definition, forever tentative, subject to constant
revision. No matter how compelling a theory seems, there is always
the possibility of a new finding that will shake and even overturn
what seemed like solid ground. The burden of faith is lighter and
the path to understanding surer, but the journey can never end.
</P>
<P>
   Given the trade-offs of both approaches, it's no wonder that
each side is sometimes a little envious of the other. It's all part
of the curse of never really knowing anything for sure.

   The beginning of a coast-to-coast heat wave will become more
evident Tuesday. High pressure moving off the Middle Atlantic coast
will merge with the Bermuda high and this will circulate hot and
humid air from the western Gulf states northward through the Plains
and then eastward across the Great Lakes and into New England.
Readings should reach 90 degrees for the first time this season in
sections of southern New England.
</P>
<P>
   A second center of high pressure will develop over the Four
Corners region and this fair weather system will transport desert
heat from the Southwest into the central and eastern Rockies. The
hot weather will advance into Idaho and Montana under mainly sunny
skies. However, the Northwest coast will be dull with a few
showers.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thundershowers will dampen most of the Tennessee
Valley and parts of the Southeast. A large but weak disturbance at
15,000 feet over Arkansas will draw tropical air into the Gulf
States. The boundary between this tropical air and a rather warm,
but noticeably less humid, air mass over the Carolinas will be the
mechanism for triggering some large thunderstorms. Florida will
continue to see beneficial rains as thunderstorms form Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms are likely in the eastern Dakotas as
torrid air moves farther north. A cluster of storms will dissipate
in Wisconsin by afternoon. Several thundershowers will develop in
the Appalachians as sultry air rises over the mountains. The
Northeast coast will be hazy, but mostly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Famine to Feast
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms that signaled danger due to lightning strikes that
triggered brush fires along Florida's northeast coast have turned
more friendly. Melbourne, which had measured less than a half inch
of rain from mid-May through early July, received a daily record of
1.41 inches on Sunday. A slow-moving storm drenched Brevard county
and helped to douse remnant fires. In Melbourne, nearly six inches
of rain has fallen since last Tuesday. A weak disturbance will
settle over the Southeast the next few days, perhaps causing more
rain than is needed along the central coast of Florida.

   Though wholly without glamour, hypertension has played a
noteworthy role in the course of human events, rarely more than in
the case of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt learned late in his third term that he had serious
hypertension but made enormous efforts to conceal his illness,
according to a new book by Robert H. Ferrell, a history professor
emeritus at Indiana University. By his final months, Roosevelt
could work no more than four hours a day, Ferrell says in ``The
Dying President'' (University of Missouri Press).
</P>
<P>
   Unable to concentrate for long periods, the president delayed
important decisions and was ``in no condition to govern the
republic,'' Ferrell writes. But he hid his illness even from his
family and Vice President Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   The sporadic data available from Roosevelt's early terms
indicate that his blood pressure was normal when he entered the
White House. But in late 1943, after returning from Tehran to
confer on war plans with the Allies, Roosevelt could not shake his
fatigue and fell victim to headaches, bronchitis and flu. His
daughter, Anna, insisted that a specialist be consulted, and on
March 28, 1944, Dr. Howard G. Bruenn, a cardiologist and lieutenant
commander in the Navy, made his first thorough examination.
</P>
<P>
   The president, Bruenn was shocked to find, was in an advanced
stage of cardiovascular disease, with an enlarged and weakened
heart. His blood pressure was 180/90.
</P>
<P>
   No beta-blockers or sophisticated diuretics existed then, and
Bruenn used the limited therapy available at the time. He gave the
president digitalis to stimulate his heart and ordered changes in
his diet.
</P>
<P>
   Though the President improved for a time, his hypertension never
disappeared. Roosevelt died from a massive brain hemorrhage on
April 12, 1945.

 &HT;    Barr takes stand on idea of national ID cardsBy Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Conservative Republicans, the Christian Coalition and
the American Civil Liberties Union are opposing a proposed federal
rule that they say would result in a national ID card.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposed rule represents a major threat to the privacy of
individuals in America,'' said Congressman Bob Barr (R-Marietta).
''Practically every privacy rights and civil liberties group in the
country is opposed to it. Additionally, it imposes a huge financial
burden on individual states.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who hosted a press conference Monday at the State Capitol,
said he will introduce legislation today aimed at blocking the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the rule would simply offer employers a better
way to do background checks on prospective employees and provide
immigration authorities with an effective means of identifying
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The national ID card, Barr said, would result from a rule
proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that
would require states to link driver's licenses with Social Security
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation passed by the Georgia General Assembly last year
allows state drivers to use their Social Security numbers on
driver's licenses but does not require them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Nelson, the executive director of the ACLU of Georgia,
said efforts to push a national ID card measure through Congress
several years ago failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quick fix,'' Nelson said. ``We believe that not only
would it violate privacy rights but it wouldn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the rule proposed by the NHTSA a ``back-door try'' by
the government, adding: ``They want to get the states to do their
work for them.'' Both Barr and Nelson said they believe the
proposal will draw broad bipartisan opposition.

 &HT;    Mfume names names on politicians with unfavorable voting records
 &HT;    By Christy Oglesby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He made it plain, leaving the soldiers no room to
misinterpret the battle plan: Demand. Boycott. Oust. Work.
</P>
<P>
   In a tell-the-truth-shame-the-devil call to action, NAACP
president Kweisi Mfume pointed fingers and boldly named names in a
speech Monday designed to set the course for the organization's
members when they leave the annual convention being held here this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Before hundreds of delegates participating in the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People convention, Mfume
gave instructions on handling politicians who voted unfavorably on
civil rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Call them in to a chapter-sponsored forum and tell them to ``sit
in a chair and explain how they did so poorly,'' he demanded. ``And
if they don't show up, put an empty chair there with their name on
it. ... And let them know we will do what we did in 1914 and throw
the rascals out!''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to economic empowerment within the black community,
Mfume told delegates to make use of the NAACP's report cards that
rate how well businesses provide opportunities to black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't spend your money where you can't work,'' he said.
``Don't spend your dollars where you can't get a promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels where black people can only carry bags, make beds and
empty trash need to know they don't deserve black people's
patronage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, we are prepared, in a disciplined way,
to spend our dollars with those who have a sense of reciprocity,''
Mfume said. ``... Boycott those who boycott you!''
</P>
<P>
   Lest delegates forget who some of those companies are, Mfume,
without hesitation, cited Denny's, an event sponsor, and Texaco, an
exhibitor at the NAACP convention as perpetrators of recent racist
acts and reasons for continuing affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But the specifics didn't stop there. Referring to the paltry
presence of black law clerks employed by the nation's highest
court, Mfume declared the U.S. Supreme Court a hypocrite and
singled out one justice in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice (Antonin) Scalia,'' Mfume yelled addressing the
justice as if he were present, ``you have never found it in you to
employ one black law clerk since you have been there (on the
Supreme Court since 1986), so we know why you make the decisions
that you do!''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said Monday ``...no one is
going to have a response to that comment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the motivating speech that brought hundreds of delegates to
their feet and left them talking on the street afterwards, Mfume
stressed that the NAACP must do its own work and serve its own
people.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he mentioned having attended a funeral for a
13-year-old black male who was killed by another black male in a
drive-by shooting and waiting in a hospital emergency room with an
elderly black woman who had been attacked by a black person.
</P>
<P>
   It is the NAACP's responsibility to address the pathology within
the black community that leads its members to shoot one another and
assault its elderly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to fix it. We are going to clean up our act,''
he promised.

COACH, PLAYER ABANDONED THE GAME PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Despite their best efforts and intentions, birth
coaches are _ let's face it _ like appendixes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they're nice to have, but they don't really do anything.
</P>
<P>
   In my experience, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   You know the adage about how a coach can only teach his players,
that he can't get out there on the field and play for them?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to birth coaching. The difference is that you can't
teach your wife what to do. She knows what to do.
</P>
<P>
   She's doing it, right there in front of your disbelieving eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Quite the transformation for your wife, labor. Like when Linda
Blair says, ``The sow is mine,'' in ``The Exorcist.'' One minute
you're watching an episode of ``ER,'' the next minute you're in
one.
</P>
<P>
   The calm, cool, collected woman you married, who earlier in the
evening casually mentioned a little grumbling in her stomach, now
has both feet planted on the dashboard of your car, pushing herself
so far into the seat you're afraid she's going to pop herself into
the trunk, all the while insisting in no uncertain terms that the
car CAN TOO go faster than this.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky part is that, what with all the excitement and
everything, you'd like to scream, too. But it seems somehow
inappropriate at a time like this. Sort of like complaining about a
bad case of jock itch while visiting a leper colony. Probably best
not to mention it.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't get the wrong impression. I heartily recommend that
all expectant fathers take birthing classes. Read everything you
can on the subject. Pay careful attention. Take copious notes. Ask
lots of questions.
</P>
<P>
   That way, when the professionals move you out of the way to get
down to business, you'll at least have an idea why.
</P>
<P>
   My experience as a coach began in earnest when, as I drove my
wife to the hospital, I encouraged her to ``breathe,'' breathe
right through those contractions. Recalling some snippet of
information I'd read somewhere, I breathed myself, loudly, to give
her an example to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The contraction subsided, and I was feeling pretty good about
things. This is going to be easy, I thought. Nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looked at me with calm eyes. I was ready for a little
appreciation, a quick thank-you for my efforts. She spoke in even,
measured tones:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't
 &UR; ever breathe for me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived at the hospital after hours, so we had to be buzzed
in by security. Not a big deal, except that when I hurried ahead
and opened the door, I looked for my wife and . . . there she was,
still shut inside the car. Her feet were on the dash again, and her
face was contorted in such a way that I was thankful it was a cool
night and the windows were shut. &QL; 
Remember the promo line for ``Alien,'' ``In space, no one can hear
you scream?'' Turns out the same is true in hospital parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   From there, things went predictably. I rubbed her back; she
asked me not to, in a way that made it sound as if I were wearing
gloves made from sandpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, no breathing, no back rubs. Unless I missed something
critical in birthing classes, this pretty much exhausted the extent
of my participation.
</P>
<P>
   For the remainder of the process, I mostly stood around and
offered the occasional ``good job'' or ``nice work.'' (I also
pulled one of her legs back during the ``pushing'' part, but I'll
spare you the details. Believe me, you'll be glad I did.)
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? Everything worked out just fine anyway.
Performing what by anyone's standard is the toughest physical work
there is, my wife actually ``apologized'' for not being more
``coachable.'' Latrell Sprewell, she's not.
</P>
<P>
   I laughed. She had the important job, after all, and she carried
it off beautifully. She produced, in my humble opinion, the cutest
baby ever born. (I know, everyone says that, but I have a mountain
of pictures to prove it.)
</P>
<P>
   The entire event reminded me of what broadcasters say when
they're talking about a player with particularly good innate
skills:
</P>
<P>
   Some things, you just can't coach. &QL;

BASEBALL COMMISH'S DAUGHTER TO DAD: BUD OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When Bud Selig was elected permanent commissioner in
an owners' meeting in Chicago, the duties of running the Milwaukee
Brewers were handed to his daughter. With Cincinnati's Marge Schott
still under suspension, Wendy Selig-Prieb became the lone woman
running a major-league club.
</P>
<P>
   Selig and Selig-Prieb have a close relationship, but the
daughter had one message for the father: Bud out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have no involvement,'' said Selig-Prieb, shooting
down obvious conflict-of-interest fears. ``Like everyone else,
he'll have to read it in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers aren't about to undergo wholesale changes, it
appears. General manager Sal Bando and manager Phil Garner are
safe, and the payroll won't take a sudden reduction. As Selig-Prieb
said, ``I can tell you I'm not going to do anything different. ...
We're very fortunate to have Sal Bando as our general manager. In
my view, he's among the best when you look at what he's been able
to accomplish with a very restrictive budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers are a nice story. As the first team this century to
switch leagues, the Brewers started quickly before leveling off.
They entered the All-Star break with a winning record for the first
time since 1992, and they still think they're in the playoff hunt,
at least as a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to think the Brewers' front office will change
much. Selig had always set the payroll and left the personnel moves
to Bando, and he gave most of the day-to-day operations to his
daughter after becoming interim commissioner in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Selig-Prieb, 38, attended ownership meetings and represented the
Brewers during the labor war and revenue-sharing debates. She was
handling most of the day-to-day chores until taking a recent leave
of absence after giving birth to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Selig had to resign as Brewers chief executive, and Selig-Prieb
is expected to be appointed his successor Aug. 1. Selig will move
his office from County Stadium to downtown Milwaukee, mostly to
avoid charges of conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can speak with him about issues any other club can talk to
him about,'' Selig-Prieb said. ``As far as club-specific issues, he
would avoid it and I would avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows he's the heart and soul of the franchise.
Nothing has meant more to him than the Brewers. If he felt we
weren't on the right track, it would have weighed heavily in his
decision.''

PURSUING THEIR DREAMS IN A BIG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEESUN WEE 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Summer can be a bummer for 12-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Driving is several years away, bicycling around town gets old
and television isn't always stimulating.
</P>
<P>
   But Kristin Sanchez, now all of 14, didn't succumb to boredom
that fateful summer. The self-proclaimed girl-on-the-go turned to
an old passion to pass the time _ baking.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperature rose in the Valley, so did the heat in her
family's Chatsworth kitchen as she prodded ingredients into tasty
cookies, cakes, breads and cinnamon rolls. Little did she know she
was on her way to starting her first business as a baker.
</P>
<P>
   Since that portentous summer, Sanchez has posted a total profit
of several hundred dollars from Cinnamon Cat's Baked Goods. She has
used the money to splurge on occasional treats such as clothes, but
more often than not, she has reinvested her earnings in more
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costco seems to be my good friend lately,'' said Sanchez,
already sounding a bit like a weary veteran of the business ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Who said summers are boring and uneventful?
</P>
<P>
   While young entrepreneurs are nothing new, more teen-agers and
young adults are turning toward business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes magazine, 80 percent of an estimated 7
million Americans currently trying to start their own businesses
are age 34 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, resources for the swelling ranks of young
entrepreneurs are growing more sophisticated. We're talking
Internet-based virtual stock market simulation games for teen-agers
and summer camps that teach youngsters everything from how to write
a business plan to analyzing no-load mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But not all young entrepreneurs have the luxury of outside
resources before setting up shop. Others rely instead on the
expertise _ and loans _ of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's what brothers Desi and Robert Kepe of Burbank did in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, then 18 and a high school senior, and Robert, then 21
and a junior college student, decided to try their hand at owning
and running their own sandwich shop. Armed with more than $200,000
in loans from their parents and an uncle, they opened Togo's
Woodland Hills on Victory Boulevard in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robert Kepe, now 20, decided to pass on the college
experience, he said pursuing a paycheck vs. a diploma wasn't too
difficult a decision to make. ``Go to school for six years or make
money now? I'm a little impatient that way,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Although getting support from family members was challenging,
convincing the Togo's franchise to hand a store over to two very
young adults was even harder. ``But we were real persistent. We
argued out the point not to hold something against somebody because
of their age,'' Robert Kepe said.
</P>
<P>
   It worked _ and they made a bit of history along the way. The
Kepe brothers are the youngest Togo's owners in the company's
two-decade history, Robert Kepe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, people don't believe I'm the owner,'' added
Robert Kepe with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kepe brothers don't fuss too much about their age _
Robert is now 20, Desi, 23. They're too busy running the business
that includes supervising a staff of 22 employees, ordering meats
and making sandwiches during the weekday lunch crush when
professionals often twice their age order turkey-and-avocado or hot
pastrami sandwiches. Although they're still in the red, business is
good and the loan is getting paid off, Robert Kepe said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers credit their business savvy to their parents,
immigrants from Slovenia who raised their sons in an
entrepreneur-friendly household. Both parents own real estate.
Their father also owns a construction business. The common question
around the dinner table was, ``So how's the business going?''
</P>
<P>
   While the Kepe brothers attribute part of their business
interest to their upbringing, some experts believe more young
people are turning to entrepreneurship specifically because their
parents rode the ups and downs of America's corporate boom and bust
in the 1980s _ and then made personal vows not to follow in their
parental footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people interpreted the decade as: ``Don't go to work
for corporate America. There's no loyalty. We can't trust anyone
but ourselves,'' said Jennifer Kushell, president and founder of
the Young Entrepreneurs Network, a Boston-based international
support group and resource center for young business people.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to avoid their parents' work experiences, they instead
are embracing the charmed success tales of business rebels who
decided to boldly go it alone _ among them technology giants Bill
Gates and Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   And that independent business philosophy coupled with the
home-office trend is making it possible for more young people to
transform business plans into profit-making realities.
</P>
<P>
   Kushell herself is a part of this latest generation of young
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up in Encino, she began selling painted T-shirts
when she was 13. By age 15, she had moved on to gift baskets. At
17, she organized safety and self-defense seminars for women.
</P>
<P>
   Kushell's entrepreneurial drive continued when she entered
college. She tried marketing video tours of colleges. That didn't
pan out either.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, the now 25-year-old finally hit pay dirt when
she funneled her experience as a young entrepreneur into a book
about that very same topic, ``No Experience Necessary: The Young
Entrepreneur's Guide to Starting a Business'' (Random
House/Princeton Review Books; $12).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kushell's multiple business ventures are not unique. A
1997 study conducted by the Young Entrepreneurs Network found many
entrepreneurs are veterans of several start-ups by their 30s _
about 2.3 businesses, defined as any registered or
income-generating enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And more business ventures by young people means more acceptance
of green entrepreneurs. ``When people know about Bill Gates, they
don't laugh about a kid and a computer,'' Kushell said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Liebeskind, 21, of Calabasas also is a young
entrepreneur based in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Liebeskind, who graduated from college this past spring with a
degree in acting and directing, began her cosmetics line just after
her first year there. She hopes her own business will allow her to
accommodate acting auditions.
</P>
<P>
   The business began with a simple observation: car-less college
students in need of fun yet practical and affordable makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Already having done makeovers for many girlfriends, Liebeskind
dipped into her $15,000 inheritance and began Dramatic Designs.
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one. The Network study also found that 66
percent of the 200 entrepreneurs surveyed between ages 18 and 35
emptied savings to start their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Liebeskind, a sorority member, advertised her new business in
the campus sorority-fraternity directory. A few makeovers later,
her customers multiplied via word-of-mouth referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Now back at home in Calabasas, she continues to primarily target
young women who come to her home-office for beauty sessions and
products that feature sheer, luminescent colors. Popular products
include Shadow Shifter and Lip Lacquer that can be worn over other
eye shadows and lipsticks, giving old colors a fresh look.
</P>
<P>
   Liebeskind said she's slowly recording a profit. Through a
network of family and friends and referrals, she's accumulating new
fans in the Los Angeles area, including high school and college
students.
</P>
<P>
   While making money and being your own boss are good things,
being a young business go-getter does have its drawbacks. Aside
from the mountain of paperwork, including acquiring business
licenses, that come with being an entrepreneur, teens who choose
this route often run into one common problem: No one takes you
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought it was a hobby of mine. ... They thought it was
cute,'' said Kushell of her work. But she deftly responded: ``This
is a job. I work for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebeskind agreed. ``I felt like I had to prove something, let
everyone know I was no joke,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for Sanchez either. Some of her peers
taunted her when, with the administration's permission, she first
brought her baked goods to Chaminade Middle School in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're going to be a world-famous baker? How much
money do you think you can make?'' they asked. But a taste usually
was all it took to convert critics into customers.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly developed a loyal clientele of teachers, staff and
students. They're so hooked on her sweet treats that during summer
vacation, customers pick up their orders at Sanchez's home.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Sanchez may be young, she already has some business
advice to pass along.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a dream, I say go for it. Take risks, even if you
have doubts. Ignore (the naysayers) and go for what you want,'' she
says. ``If you want something bad enough, you can get it.''

GETTING OF THE GROUND

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; No matter what the age of the entrepreneur,
common factors play a role in tipping a new venture toward success.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Kushell, founder and president of the Boston-based
Young Entrepreneurs Network, cautioned beginners from jumping into
already saturated markets. In the technology industry, for example,
it's common to stumble across several Web site development
companies in the same neighborhood. And too many vendors offering
the same services can mean a tougher, more competitive battle for
profits and overall success.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Ferretti, 17, of Glendale offered this bit of advice:
Don't underestimate the importance of a clear business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ferretti knows first-hand what needs to happen after that
brilliant idea hits _ a big investment of time and work. Her
efforts this year toward a business plan for a child-care referral
service paid off when she won a national business plan competition
sponsored by An Income of Her Own, a national, nonprofit
organization based in Burbank that's devoted to teaching
entrepreneurial skills to teen-age girls and young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disadvantage is it may take time away from school or other
extracurricular interests. The advantage is helping people out and
making money, and learning to work with people and children,'' said
Ferretti, who is hoping to get the business off the ground in about
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Young entrepreneurs have lots of resources to lend them a hand:
</P>
<P>
   The Young Entrepreneurs Network can be reached at (617)
867-4690. Their Web site at www.yenetwork.com.

AT MACWORLD, APPLE TURNS OUT NEW PRODUCTS AND PLENTY OF PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
 700&AMP;ADD -NYT (The Science Times) 
(js) 
By PETER H. LEWIS  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The relatively sparse crowds and smaller exhibit
booths at last week's Macworld trade show in New York were tangible
evidence of the decline of Apple Computer in recent years. Visitors
to the show typically found that promises almost outnumbered actual
products. But while dazzling new products were scarce at Macworld,
no doubt many people were just as happy to take home some optimism
about the future of Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the show was an aqua and white beach ball of
a computer called the iMac. The iMac, which is the computer
equivalent of a new Volkswagen Beetle, was announced more than two
months ago and will not reach stores for another month.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 prototypes of the iMac (the ``I'' stands for
Internet) were dispersed around the show floor, where one of the
machine's admirers was Apple's former chief executive, John
Sculley. Wearing baggy corduroys and carrying a backpack, Sculley
was able to stroll largely unnoticed through the exhibits on the
show floor.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sculley who orchestrated the dismissal of Apple's
co-founder, Steve Jobs, more than a decade ago, and who was in turn
dismissed in what became a revolving door for Apple bosses that
ultimately revolved back to Jobs, who now holds the title interim
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the only real surprise of the conference, Jobs made an
unexpected appearance at Macworld to deliver the keynote address.
During his two-hour presentation, he noted that it was almost
exactly a year ago that he rejoined the company. ``When I came a
year ago, all I heard was that Apple was dying,'' Jobs said. ``A
lot of people thought Apple was in a death spiral, which I think
there was some truth to.''
</P>
<P>
   Few experts expect Apple to climb back to its old heights, but
at least it has a chance now to stanch the 10 percent annual
defection rate from its current base of Macintosh users. Jobs
conceded that Apple had ignored its individual and educational
customers for several years, but now, based on hopes for the new
consumer-friendly iMac computer, Jobs said: ``We expect to see some
growth in the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Apple is also developing a less expensive Powerbook for
consumers and students, but it will not be ready until sometime
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the computing world's attention has been on
Windows 98, but Apple's operating system is also scheduled for an
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 8.5, code-named Allegro and due this September, was given
a brief and limited demonstration at the show. Jobs and his
marketing chief, Phil Schiller, described Allegro as the most
significant upgrade to the Macintosh operating system in years,
even more significant than the jump from System 7 to System 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their enthusiasm for Mac OS 8.5 is evidently based on more than
just the two new features they selected to show to the audience: an
impressive new engine for finding information on the computer's
hard disk and on the Internet, and a feature that allows rapid
transfers of large multimedia files over computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The file transfer demonstration, involving a 150-megabyte Adobe
Photoshop file, was a dud. In a staged demonstration, an Apple
computer running Mac OS 8.5 froze as it attempted to pass the file
to another Apple computer, while a Compaq computer running Windows
NT 4.0 easily transferred the same file to a Dell machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the second try, the Apple computers beat the Windows NT
machines by about four seconds. (As one might expect, there were no
oohs and aahs from the audience.)
</P>
<P>
   Far more impressive was the demonstration of Mac OS 8.5's
information searching feature, called Sherlock, which replaces the
feeble file-finding utility in the current Mac operating system.
Instead of searching for file names, Sherlock allows users to
search for content inside documents, using natural-language
queries. Files meeting the search criteria are then ranked by
relevance _ and here's the cool part that sets it apart from even
the best Web search engines _ the computer will analyze the
document and create a brief synopsis of the file's contents, not
just the first few lines of text. The new search engine can also
scan the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least a year before Apple's next major operating
system version (Mac OS X) is made available to the public, Schiller
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, Macintosh users were accustomed to having new
features and technologies well ahead of their Windows counterparts.
But at this year's show, Mac users seemed pleased with promises for
a broad array of products that showed up first in Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the products and programs coming to the Mac in months
ahead are the popular ``Tomb Raider'' games that star the virtual
celebrity Lara Croft, coming in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The disk-based version of the Encyclopedia Britannica will soon
be ready for the Mac from Broderbund. Disney Online was given an
unusually large part of the keynote to demonstrate a Macintosh
prototype of its popular Blast web site for children
(www.disneyblast.com/mac) Peripheral products based on the
Universal Serial Bus connection scheme will soon be appearing for
Macintosh computers. Windows-based PC's have been equipped with USB
ports for more than a year, but in this case the Mac has not been
at a disadvantage because so few USB peripherals have reached the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest was demonstrating a prototype of its one-megabyte Sparq
removable cartridge drive for Macintoshes, which has been popular
on Windows machines. The Palm Computing division of the 3COM Corp.
promised to deliver better versions of its Palm III organizer for
the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Microsoft's Macintosh development group vowed that
never again will Microsoft treat the Macintosh as a second-class
citizen by simply retooling Windows programs to run on the Mac OS.
Instead, he said, the group will have a battle cry of ``first and
only on the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of all these promises is yet to be seen. But compared
to where the Mac was a year ago, promises are encouraging.

 &HT;    FIGHT BIGOTRY AT THE BALLOT BOX, CORETTA KING TELLS LAWYERS
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Coretta Scott King urged a lawyers' group Monday to
help use the 1998 elections to bring to office ``more men and,
especially, more women ... who will serve as champions of
diversity, affirmative action and other measures to promote
equality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal killing of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, provides a
tragic reminder that we still have a serious problem with hate
groups in America,'' said King, the widow of civil rights leader
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ``We've also got to deal with the more
subtle and sophisticated forms of racism and bigotry. The best
place to begin is at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   King was the keynote speaker at the awards luncheon of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the national organization
of plaintiffs' lawyers whose six-day convention ends here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Honored on Monday were lawyers who have given the maximum $5,000
each to the trial lawyers' political action committee, which has
contributed $1.3 million to congressional members and candidates in
the last 18 months. Almost 90 percent of the campaign contributions
went to Democrats, but the trial lawyers are making a concerted
effort to reach Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional political activism of trial lawyers showed in
their applause Monday when King declared that ``We need a Congress
that legislates more and investigates less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is supposed to be about serving the people, not the
partisan agendas of the power-hungry careerists who turn their
backs on working people, the poor and the disadvantaged,'' King
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let 1998 be the year that we get commitments from candidates
to do something meaningful to fulfill the dream. And let 1998 also
be the year in which the American people turn out in massive
numbers to say no to the politics of polarization, no to the
politics of intimidation, gossip and vilification,'' she said.

   The small loquacious man lighting into a slice of rhubarb pie at
a South Loop restaurant on a recent Chicago evening is Dr. Leon M.
Lederman, 76, City College of New York class of 1943, director
emeritus of the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, the
author of ``The God Particle,'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1993) and the
winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of science, Lederman is known for his detection of
the muon neutrino, the subatomic particle that is one of the
essential building blocks of matter, and for the fact that he may
be the wittiest particle physicist extant.
</P>
<P>
   Since his retirement from Fermilab in Illinois, Lederman has
become an advocate for improved science education. He is the
chairman of the board of the Teachers Academy for Mathematics and
Science, an organization that shows primary school teachers how to
teach modern mathematics and science.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've been called ``the Mel Brooks of the physics world.''
Brooks' humor is rooted in fear _ fear of poverty, fear of the
Holocaust. Where does yours come from?
</P>
<P>
   A. It comes from a terror of taking myself seriously. ... It
also puts me into a comfortable relationship with other people.
It's human to want to make people laugh. It's part of teaching.
Teaching is show business. Once, I gave a talk before the New York
Science Teachers Association and we met at the Stardust Room at the
Nevele Hotel (in the Catskills). And I knew all about that place
from my childhood, from listening to the great comics like Zero
Mostel who broadcast from there. And I was so thrilled to be there
that I actually took the microphone off the stand and started
telling jokes: ``The teacher says to the student, `Hey, wake up
that kid sleeping next to you,' and the student says, `Why should
I? You put him to sleep!'''
</P>
<P>
   Q. You worry about students falling asleep in science
classrooms. In fact, you are a major advocate of reforming science
education. What have you learned from your efforts to change the
way science is taught in our public schools?
</P>
<P>
   A. That resistance to change is awesome. I believe we're
teaching high school science in the wrong order _ biology,
chemistry, and then for 20 percent of the students, eventually
physics. In this sequence, the subjects are unrelated, to be
learned and forgotten _ in the order taken. It would be much
smarter to teach physics in the ninth grade, which would teach
atomic structure to provide an understanding of how atoms combine,
the essence of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Modern biology, which should be taught last, is molecular based.
I once suggested this to a group of high school physics teachers
and thought they'd applaud wildly. They were ice cold. Then, it
came out: ``You want us to teach freshmen? We don't do freshmen _
we do seniors!'' Tells you a lot, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Q. In Einstein's time, physicists were celebrities. Do you wish
that were true today?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really _ though I sometimes tire of being introduced as
the ``1988 Nobel Prize winner for physics,'' and though I do
believe science needs a better press.
</P>
<P>
   Towards that end, I've been trying to sell a TV series, which we
call ``L.A. Science.'' We'd have the usual sex and drama and car
chases, but the hero would be a scientist, and every segment would
teach some real thing about science.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Tisch, the former owner of CBS, advised us on how to
draft the proposal _ to write up something that those guys call a
bible, which includes sample story ideas, characters, etc. We saw,
Steve Bochco (producer of ``NYPD Blue,'' among others). His
reaction was more or less, ``Gee, this is really good, but I don't
do scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   We tried Chris Carter, (``The X-Files'') who said something
like, ``I have my own ideas.'' In fact, he didn't want to be
burdened by having every scientific point be plausible. All things
being equal, he went for the magic and the surreal and what we call
junk science. We tried Michael Crichton (``ER''), who quickly
dismissed us because he's anti-science. But we knew that from
seeing ``Jurassic Park.'' We're still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You won the Nobel Prize in Physics for your discovery of the
muon neutrino. What was your reaction to the news last month that a
group of Japanese scientists have shown that neutrinos have mass?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was pleased because it was really an elegant piece of work.
The significance depends on knowing more than we now know about the
numbers. What's nice is that this result energizes the many
neutrino experiments under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the neutrino has zero charge, zero radius, zero strong
coupling ... having a mass raises it to the level of significance.
The new question now appears: What is the origin of this mass? In
the spooky world of the quantum, the neutrino mass may be an
indication of ``presences'' which are not in our inventory. ...
Just as the presence of a magnet seems to alter the properties of a
nail, the existence of an unknown field could influence the
neutrino's mass.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you're investigating the micro-mysteries of the
universe, how much does thinking about God and creation come into
play with your work? I ask because you titled your last book, ``The
God Particle.''
</P>
<P>
   A. It comes into play. It doesn't have to. But it does. People
ask you about it. There's always a place at the edge of our
knowledge, where what's beyond is unimaginable, and that edge, of
course, moves. ... We've gotten closer and closer to some ultimate
question. We now know that the universe was created some 13 billion
years ago, and we will get that number more precisely, in some kind
of fiery explosion called, the Big Bang. The question is: Is that
creation?
</P>
<P>
   And then, ``What was there, before?'' A possibly defensible
answer is: the laws of physics. They dictated there should be this
event. Then, if you want to go in that direction, some will ask,
``Well, how did the laws of physics get there?'' And then, you're
stuck. I usually say, ``Go across the street to the theology
school, and ask those guys, because I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What I believe is that the laws of physics got there, I don't
know how, and they determine the future course of the universe. The
sequence is: the Big Bang, expansion and cooling, the formation of
complex objects _ eventually atoms and the atoms formed molecules,
and the molecules formed things that crawled out of the ocean. And
here we are, worrying about the whole thing!

</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1980s, you were the prime mover behind getting the
U.S. government to start building the world's largest
superconducting supercollider in Texas. This would have been used
for the most advanced of particle physics investigations. Then, in
1993, after spending $2 billion on the project, Congress canceled
it. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was politics and policy. ... The scientific community,
underestimated, I think, the difficulty of starting a brand new
laboratory. ... The lab and its supporters were not politically
astute enough. Defense industries, desperate for new sources of
business, swarmed on this young laboratory, with their own ethic _
which is very different from that which had marked scientific
constructions before. In industry, they work with underbidding and
finally getting their money back with supplemental requests for
funds _ and (that ethic resulted in a) conflict between them and
the scientist-managers at the lab. And then, deficit reduction
became a large congressional concern. Congress knew there were
conflicts, and the whole project was expensive. The lab became a
juicy target. I still think we should have built this machine. It
was designed to do a certain job, and it was 20 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What became of the $2 billion invested in the supercollider?
</P>
<P>
   A. It went into a hole in the ground. There's a big hole in
Texas, probably filling with water. We probably recovered about a
half a billion dollars worth of stuff that could be used elsewhere
and unknown value for the information that has been published. We
learned a lot. But most of it, was lost. ... One of the things we
learned about this is that when you're trying to probe the subtle
ingredients that make the universe, it's expensive. You'd better
start building these things internationally, from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you miss the Cold War, at least as a funding wedge?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) I guess. It's a good question because here we always
thought, naively, that here we are working in abstract, absolutely
useless research and once the Cold War ended, we wouldn't have to
fight for resources. Instead, we found, we were the Cold War. We'd
been getting all this money for quark research because our leaders
decided that science, even useless science, was a component of the
Cold War. As soon as it was over, they didn't need science. We're
fighting that presumption now. It's a tough job. You have to
educate. That's one reason we wanted a television show.

LET CAUTION BE YOUR GUIDE ON WHITEWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Toll-free information number is CQ.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hey, now I admit it: I was scared to death.
</P>
<P>
   Petrified actually, heart thumping in my chest, short of breath,
eyes about to pop out of my head, and suddenly converted to prayer.
</P>
<P>
   I was paddling an inflatable kayak, pointed downstream, about to
enter this sharp right turn with a high, granite wall along the
left side, sparkling with whitewater from a Class IV rapid. Right
at the turn, there was a big boulder at mid-current, so there was
no way to cheat the rapid on the inside of the current line. I had
to go through.
</P>
<P>
   Was I really ready for this? That is the exact question
thousands of vacationers ask themselves every year as they embark
on outdoors adventures. In the case of rafting, that question is
coming up a lot more this year, with high water from the meltoff of
the big El Nino snowpack and a few highly celebrated accidents, far
more than reported in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The snowmelt has peaked, according to the Department of Water
Resources, and a recent aerial survey showed that most of the snow
had melted off in the north Sierra. The snow line is roughly 6,500
to 7,500 feet in Yosemite, and 9,500 feet in the south Sierra near
Mount Whitney, with the deepest pockets of snow remaining in the
highest terrain in the Trinity Alps, localized vicinity of Shasta
and Lassen peaks, and the central Sierra along the crest.
</P>
<P>
   That means two things:
</P>
<P>
   1. Conditions are now about perfect for whitewater rafting, with
good stream flows from snowmelt, yet hot summer temperatures in the
Sierra foothills. This should continue on most streams well into
August, and some rivers through September.
</P>
<P>
   2. At some point, you will likely say to yourself, ``Am I really
ready for this?''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among an organization of 50 outfitters called
California Outdoors is that the danger level of whitewater trips is
elevated by inexperienced individuals trying the sport without
guides, or when rogue guides without permits try daredevil runs on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best rafting in 15 years and we encourage the
public to enjoy their trips with well-trained professionals rather
than on your own in private parties,'' said Diane Strachan of
California Outdoors. ``Many private rafting parties do not have the
river experience and skills to safely enjoy this El Nino summer
season.''
</P>
<P>
   She said professional outfitters take roughly 335,000 people
rafting each summer in California, while another 165,000 try on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting danger has made the news this year because there have
been 13 deaths in California attributed to high water. However, 11
of those were on non-guided trips. In a typical year, such as 1996,
there were three fatal accidents on rivers, all non-guided trips;
in comparison, there were 17 fatal boating accidents on lakes in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many whitewater experts who can make safe trips
without guides, I've personally seen some near tragedies by those
trying the do-it-yourself method, from expert kayakers to kids on
inner tubes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Smith River, I watched a team of 10 expert kayakers
plundering down the South Fork at high water, coming around a bend,
one after another. Everything was perfect until the last kayak
arrived around the bend: It was floating down the river upside
down. All the others in the group were looking downstream, unaware
that the poor guy behind them was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As fortune would have it, the force of the river spun him into
calm water by an eddy, where he managed an Eskimo roll to right
himself, then grabbed on to a rock, and stayed there for 15
minutes, trying to catch his breath. That was a close one.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, on the Sacramento River in Red Bluff, where the
flows are benign but cold, a group of youngsters was spending a day
rolling down the river on inner tubes. One problem: No life
jackets. They started horsing around, and a teen-age girl fell off
her tube and into the cold water; she started splashing about,
shocked by the temperature, and became separated from her tube.
From shore, it looked like a disaster about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the current swept her to a support piling for a bridge,
and she was able to grab ahold of it and scramble out of the river.
But she was still stuck. An hour later, a rescue team got her to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   To keep whitewater trips exciting but safe, Strachan suggests
matching up the age and experience level with the difficulty of the
trips, interviewing outfitters, and if any doubts linger, asking
for references.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 20 excellent river trips in California,'' she
said. ``What makes it work is matching up with the one that is
perfect for you.''

<P>
   On my inflatable kayak trip, looking at that Class IV right turn
and granite wall, I had scarcely asked, ``Am I ready for this?'' _
when suddenly, my boat was surging right toward the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, I was in a vortex of whitewater, plunging forward,
the boat full of water. I leaned left, toward the wall, and paddled
hard on the left side, just as guide Steve Lentz had told me to,
and the boat shot into the main current. But a cross-current hit
me, and in a split second, I flipped and dumped, and the cold shock
of water enveloped me.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, I popped up in quiet water, downstream of the
rapid, and Lentz was nearby in his raft, smiling. Later he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never let people get into something they can't get out of,''
he said. ``In 20 years, I've never had a client have a serious
water accident. Rafting is exhilarating, thrilling, and it can get
all your senses on fire, but there's no reason it has to be
dangerous. There should always be a way out.''

SCIENCE WATCH: ADVICE FOR 1-DAY NONSMOKERS; RECIPE FOR QUICKIE
DIAMONDS; LIVING FOR NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Natural experiments are those in which nature designs the test
of some hypothesis and the only effort required of the scientist is
to figure out what experiment is being conducted in nature's
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known example comes from the practice of English
congregations of praying every Sunday for the long life of the
monarch; the geneticist Francis Galton reasoned that the power of
prayer would be proved if indeed English monarchs tended to live
longer than average, an eventuality which he determined was, alas,
not the case.
</P>
<P>
   Not Smoking Proves Point
</P>
<P>
   English public life has afforded another natural experiment, and
one that regrettably is also subversive of public virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the second Wednesday of every March has been
designated No Smoking Day. Some 2 million British smokers, whether
impelled by guilt or the opprobrium of their peers, give up the
noxious weed, or gasp in less of it, for at least one day.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that in laboratory tests, when smokers suddenly
abstain from nicotine, for a few hours afterward their mental
performance falls and their bad humor rises.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Waters, of the Institute of Psychiatry in London,
realized that No Smoking Day provided the perfect opportunity to
test whether this was true in the real world, too.
</P>
<P>
   It was. Significantly more workplace accidents occur on No
Smoking Day than on the Wednesday before or the Wednesday after,
according to statistics collected by the British government agency
that monitors workplace safety.
</P>
<P>
   In noting this finding in the current Nature, Waters and
colleagues say they do not want anyone to infer that No Smoking Day
is a bad idea, but that maybe those one-day quitters should take
some nicotine substitutes instead of going cold turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds in the Rough
</P>
<P>
   On the avarice front, a simple recipe for cooking up diamonds
has been devised by Dr. Yadong Li and colleagues at the University
of Science and Technology of China.
</P>
<P>
   Take a spoonful of the solvent and former dry cleaning agent
carbon tetrachloride, add an ounce of sodium metal and a pinch of
nickel-cobalt catalyst, and cook in an oven at 700 degrees Celsius
for two days. The result is a lot of table salt (sodium chloride)
and a 2 percent yield of diamond, Li and colleagues report in
Science. The diamonds are not of gem quality. You need a microscope
to see them, but Li is working to improve the process.
</P>
<P>
   Live by Numbers
</P>
<P>
   To hear it for virtue, consider the Hungarian mathematician Paul
Erdos (pronounced AIR-dosh). To devote his life as purely as
possible to pure mathematics, Erdos forsook all other distractions,
including family, home and money. He lived out of two battered
suitcases, traveling from one mathematician's house to another. He
would show up on the friend's doorstep, announcing, ``My brain is
open.'' They would work together for a day or two, then Erdos would
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos had a special vocabulary. He loved epsilons, his word for
children, after the Greek letter used in mathematics to denote a
small number. He endured much bureaucratic foolishness at the hands
of Joe (the Soviet Union) and Sam (the United States). He referred
to international news as the Sam and Joe show. When he said someone
had died, he meant that the person had left mathematics. When he
said they had left, they had died.
</P>
<P>
   Erdos left in 1996. Two biographies are about to appear. ``The
Man Who Loved Only Numbers,'' by Paul Hoffman, is published this
week by Hyperion of New York. In September, Houghton-Mifflin
publishes ``My Brain Is Open,'' by Bruce Schechter.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Grandma was talking about her red-headed,
17-year-old granddaughter _ Erin Wiedemann _ one of the best
teen-age softball players in town.

   ``She's an all-around good girl,'' Alice Caldwell said Friday at
her Willamet Road home in Kettering. ``She would never even think
of doing something out of the question. She's wonderful, beautiful
_ quite a little athlete. She's the kind of girl everyone would
love to have as a daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Every parent, that is, but her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad? I think he might be somewhere in Florida. I really
don't know him,'' Erin said. ``He's a guy who never lived up to his
responsibilities. He left when I was just a couple of months old. I
know he has no idea who I am or what I've become.''
</P>
<P>
   And mom?
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in Dayton somewhere. She was young when she had me.
She had a lot of problems _ still does I guess _ and it just didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was five months, Erin _ known in the family as Boo
because she was born on Halloween _ came to live with her
grandparents. So did her brother, Todd, who was 3.
</P>
<P>
   After raising six kids of her own, Alice suddenly had two more
under her wing: ``A couple of mine fell by the wayside and I wanted
to get involved so it didn't happen to Todd and Erin. They needed
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin's dad had battled drugs and ended up in prison. Her mom had
similar problems. And if that wasn't enough, in June of 1992, Todd,
then 14, was hit and killed by a teen-age driver while
roller-blading on Grange Hall Road.
</P>
<P>
   With all of her immediate family gone, Erin could rely only on
her grandparents _ and herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since she was a little child, she's had all kinds of goals for
herself,'' Alice said. ``She got involved in the D.A.R.E. program
at school. I think underneath it was about wanting to be so
different than her parents. She wanted to make something of
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into her senior year at Fairmont High, Erin said she has a
3.5 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   Athletically, she's won six letters in soccer, basketball and
especially softball, where last season she won first-team All
Western Ohio League honors and was named to the second team
All-State. She led the Miami Valley in triples, runs scored and
stolen bases and was sixth in batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the jobs she works. She's a resident caregiver at
a nursing home on Lamme Road. During the school year, she served as
an ice guard at the Kettering Recreation Center skating rink.
Weekends she worked 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. Friday and Saturday and all
day Sunday, too.
</P>
<P>
   She's trying to save money to buy a car and take care of other
needs. ``Both my grandparents are retired and have health
problems,'' she said. ``I don't want to make it any tougher on them
by asking for things, so I try to do as much as I can for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Erin Wiedemann can't do it all. She wants to go to college
_ specifically the University of Dayton _ and she needs help. ``I
want to stay around this area to take care of my grandparents, ``
Erin said. ``My grandmother has arthritis real bad. She just had a
knee replaced and needs the other one fixed. My grandfather has
emphysema. They did so much for me, it's my turn for them. I know
they'd try to help me get to college, but there's no way. Without a
scholarship, I won't be going to a four-year school.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the Miami Valley Sports Foundation _ which
sponsored The King and His Court in a celebrity softball game at
Welcome Stadium _ comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation is a local group made up of professional and
blue-collar men and women who four years ago set their sights on
bringing a minor-league baseball team to Dayton. Along the way,
they scrapped that idea, but kept their organization together and
decided to gear their efforts to helping some of the Miami Valley's
best athletes achieve excellence in sports and in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation is in the process of converting an old K-Mart
store in Centerville, Ohio into a sporting facility that will offer
specific workout areas for several Olympic sports _ from softball,
baseball and basketball to the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Centerville attorney Richard Duncan, Foundation
president, there will be instructors, sports-medicine and fitness
programs, and a concentration on academics _ from preparing
athletes for SAT tests to helping them land a scholarship by
sending out resumes and videos and providing showcase athletic
events for the teenagers to be seen by college coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation currently has five softball and three baseball
teams competing in the area, including the Miami Valley Express _
for which Erin plays second base _ in the Greater Cincinnati
Fast-pitch League.
</P>
<P>
   Besides league play, the Express _ which includes girls from 10
area high schools _ plays weekend tournaments around the state.
Recently it was in Akron. And the GCFL will hold its All-Star game
to which, Duncan said, 68 college coaches have been invited:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do whatever we can to get these kids in school, so they
can go after their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   For Erin _ who idolizes Dr. Dot Richardson, the Olympic softball
player who is an orthopedic surgeon _ that means some kind of
medical studies: ``I'd like to be a CareFlight nurse, maybe even an
emergency-room doctor. When somebody's really in need, they need to
know someone is there who really cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, that's just what the Miami Valley Sports Foundation
will end up being for athletes like Erin.

 &HT;    Perez handles difficulty with class
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Az _ That afternoon, Eduardo Perez cleaned out his
locker in Cinergy Field _ lock, stock and baseball spikes.
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon, Perez was sitting in front of his locker in
Bank One Ballpark, still wearing his Cincinnati Reds uniform.
</P>
<P>
   How bizarre, how bizarre, how bizarre. With the Cincinnati Reds,
things continue to get curiouser and curiouser and curiouser.
</P>
<P>
   True, curiouser is not a word but what is happening with the
Reds these days defies normal description.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday July 9, Perez thought his time with the Reds was up.
He was put on waivers and he cleared _ nobody claimed him. Perez
expected to be designated for assignment, meaning the Reds had to
trade him, release him or offer him free agency.
</P>
<P>
   So he cleaned out his locker.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. The Reds kept him on the roster, even though
he is No. 4 on the first-base depth chart behind Sean Casey, Paul
Konerko and Dmitri Young.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Perez won't be traded. If a deal can be made,
it'll be made. If not, he may be released.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Perez wore his normal ultra-bright, ultra-wide
smile Friday afternoon as he slipped into his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand. . .you can see what they're doing,'' Perez said.
``They're building toward a winner by 2002 or whenever the new
stadium is built and going with young guys who will be in their
first or second year of arbitration eligibility. Hopefully, the
Reds will have the funds to pay these guys as they build from the
bottom up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was one of the guys who stepped forward last season after
Ray Knight was fired and Jack McKeon was hired. McKeon gave Perez a
chance and he hooked it. So he began this season as the regular
first baseman, but quickly found himself on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   And to his credit, he didn't squawk, kick or fuss. He did what
was asked of him and did it with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 33 years old in 2002 and I certainly wouldn't fit,''
Perez said. ``Baseball is a business and everybody has to realize
it and I realize I'm a victim of the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told they're looking to see if I fit with another
organization and I respect (general manager) Jim Bowden for doing
that,'' Perez added. ``We talked about that Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a Red and enjoy being a Red and I was
always proud to wear this uniform,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to
be a professional about it, not be a bad apple. I've kept my smiles
up and kept some of the young guys who struggled loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is so tough _ because I love this team so much _ to see
stuff going on with Barry Larkin, who has played for nobody but the
Reds, and to see Lenny Harris and Jeff Shaw and Dave Burba get sent
away,'' Perez said. ``But like I have to keep telling myself,
that's the business part of baseball. But it's a big family and
it's a family that is being broken up and everybody is going their
own way. It's sad. It's tough to deal with the realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be here to see it or feel it, but the key
word for Cincinnati fans right now is, 'patience,' and that's with
a capital P.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was speaking softly now and he laced on his red shoes,
perhaps for one of the last times. His name was not on the lineup
card, it seldom is these days. Nevertheless, they can rip the
uniform off his back, but they can't tear it out of his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but what can I do? Nothing. I can't beg to stay
here,'' he said. ``I can't cry. I have to keep my chin up, as tough
as that is. I realize I am a good ballplayer and I have to continue
to believe in myself. Given an opportunity, I'll produce. That's
all I can ask. If they want me to stay here and be a stunt man
(extra player), as Lenny Harris called it, I'll do that. Lenny
thought that, too. And he's gone.''

   AUSTIN _ Q: Couldn't we save trouble and time by endorsing
checks on the front, lower left? This would make it easier to
compare the information with the signatures. It would also save the
great difficulty in copying the back side, which could be used as a
deposit slip, saving tons paper and storage space.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think? _Harold B.
</P>
<P>
   A: A provocative idea but the
</P>
<P>
   endorsement on the back of a check is a processing requirement
from the American National Standards Institute, adopted by the
American Bankers Association, says the ABA's John Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by the payee is just the beginning of the
information that will grace the back of the check _ other payees
and several banking institutions will also use the back (and that's
just if the check does not bounce!). In addition, the magnetic
encoding on the front of a check is adversely affected by ink.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an antique oak mirror that belonged to my great aunt.
The glass has become spotted and discolored in places over time and
I am thinking of having it reglazed. Whom would you recommend?
_Michael Grable
</P>
<P>
   A: Maxey Glass, 305 E. Fifth St., has been resilvering mirrors
for more than 40 years. The process removes the old silver, which
has been damaged by moisture, insects and chemicals. A new silver
layer, a new copper layer and sealer will be applied to the mirror.
The glass remains the same, so remember some scratches may be more
visible after the resilvering than before!
</P>
<P>
   Call ahead for price estimation. Resilvering is good economic
sense for beveled, etched or patterned mirrors. If the antique had
just a plain mirror, buy a new one. The job can be done in 14-20
working days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a money belt. It looks like a regular belt
but has a zipper on its back. I wonder if anyone in Austin sells
them or is there a place I could order one?
</P>
<P>
   I am going to Vegas soon and need one to take money. Probably
won't need one for the return trip. _B.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: A web money belt is available in three colors at REI, 9901
Loop 360, for a mere $12. But for the look of Charles Grodin in
``Midnight Run,'' call TravelSmith at (800) 995-7010. They have a
few leather belts (the end of stock so they may go quickly!) with
the inside back zipper for $29.50 May Sky Masterson be with you!

 JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The prune cheesecake at the Magnolia Grill in
Durham, N.C., wasn't selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be (that) anytime you put the word `prune' on the
menu, people would get to that point and they'd just look at each
other and laugh!'' admits pastry chef Karen Barker.
</P>
<P>
   So, using a bit of what chef Ben Barker refers to as
`menuspeak,' he renamed the dessert sun-dried plum cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, instead, we get all these people telling us how much they
enjoy those sun-dried plums!'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Barkers, one of a handful of high-profile husband-and-wife
chef teams working in cities across the country, were in Kansas
City recently to teach a cooking class at the American Restaurant,
which also features its own husband-and-wife chef team in Michael
Smith and Debbie Gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Barkers have appeared in Food &AMP; Wine's Who's Who of Southern
Cooking, have been named rising stars in Esquire and have been
James Beard nominees. Yet the culinary accolades sometimes leave
them wondering if disguising the prune's wrinkles from diners is
always such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that if you win that award (the James Beard Award),
then people come into your restaurant looking for something
different, looking for something other than what we are and what
we've done for the last 10 years,'' Ben says.
</P>
<P>
   What the Barkers have been doing for the last decade is turning
out rustic Southern fare _ with notable refinements. For instance,
Karen's silky, pecan-infused custard has a long history in Southern
cooking, dating to early English settlers. Meanwhile Ben's savory
short ribs served with grits has found a resurgence among a
fine-dining audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time we couldn't serve braised food, which is one
of the hardest foods to do. And, because of their inherent
rusticity _ read brownness! _ they don't photograph well, but they
sure taste good!''
</P>
<P>
   Ben grew up in the South. His paternal grandmother and a great
aunt were farm-raised cooks who served fresh bread, home-preserved
condiments and a variety of vegetables dishes with each meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern table was generally presented to us without much
fanfare,'' he says. ``It often wasn't so much specifically what was
on it, as the fact that you were there at the table with your
family or your friends. It was a moment for storytelling and
regaining the relationship that we don't get in our daily lives
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Although Karen's desserts display a fondness for the South, she
grew up in Brooklyn and comes from a Jewish family. She laughs as
she recalls a recent Passover celebration where Ben reigned in any
tendencies to create ``New Age'' gefilte fish. Instead, he played
it straight, and her family nodded its approval by taking home the
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us came from a family where the table was really
important,'' Ben says.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met on the first day of classes at the Culinary
Institute of America. They opened their restaurant in a converted
health food grocery in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many fine-dining restaurants, the Magnolia Grill does not
have a dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we fine dining? Yes. There are tablecloths. We have
professional, although not stuffy, service,'' Karen says. ``It has
all the components of fine dining, but it's not so upscale that you
can't walk in there in a pair of jeans and have the most expensive
bottle of wine and foie gras.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Ben says he is complimented by those serious diners
who dutifully analyze a dish's flavors before passing it to the
left, but he prefers a more relaxed approach to his food.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important to me is people sit at a table and have
a glass of wine and enjoy the sociability of it,'' Ben says.
``That's really why we went into (the restaurant business) in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't often sit down with your family for dinner anymore.
Often the restaurant venue is one of those rare and infrequent
opportunities to recapture that thing that you don't have at
home.''

I MADE ALL OF IT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday July 15)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a bad time for magazine writers and newspaper columnists,
some of whom have recently been fired for making up quotes or
inventing sources.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe columnist who was fired for making stuff up wrote
a final column explaining her actions and apologizing to her
readers, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a matter of time before management discovers that my
column has been an unbroken string of lies, fabrications and
blatant exaggerations since its debut in 1984 (Or was it 1983? Ah,
who cares.) I figure I may as well write my apology now in case my
heave-ho is too sudden to allow for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, I would like to apologize for an April 24, 1984,
column in which I suggested that rubbing Spam all over yourself
makes a terrific shark repellent. There is absolutely no scientific
basis for that statement, and it was also brought to my attention
that that would be a cruel and unusual thing to do to sharks, many
of which have felt unloved and insecure ever since the release of
the movie ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, I would like to grovel in as obsequious a manner as
possible for a Nov. 20, 1986, column in which I suggested that you
cook your Thanksgiving turkey with the plastic wrapper still on as
that not only gives the turkey that traditional
dragged-through-the-refinery petrochemical aroma, but also
dramatically increases the chances that your oven will catch fire
and/or your smoke alarm will go off, thereby hastening the
departure of your guests. Many cooks and fire safety officials
vehemently disagreed with my advice, though they all advised
staying as far away from giblets as possible.
</P>
<P>
   I also wish to distance myself as far as possible, preferably
upwind, from a March 15, 1988, column, in which I compared the
Easter bunny to Godzilla, only with poorer personal hygiene.
Contrary to what was printed in the paper, I have never,
personally, seen a 20-foot-tall Easter bunny lumbering through my,
or any other, neighborhood late at night. I have no supporting
evidence that the Easter bunny's eyes are bloodshot and big as
dinner plates, nor can I honestly claim that its ``cavernous jaws
and cruel yellow fangs'' make the lawyer-gulping dinosaur in
``Jurassic Park'' look about as lethal as a baby duck.
</P>
<P>
   I sincerely regret any misunderstanding or lifelong psychotic
episodes this may have caused.
</P>
<P>
   It is also quite possible that I was asleep or not even in the
building at the time when I wrote a Nov. 4, 1990, column suggested
that Snooty the manatee would be a better choice for vice president
than Dan Quayle. Although Snooty may be a better speller than
Quayle, he does not play golf very well, if at all, and doesn't
have anywhere near the magnificent head of hair that Quayle does.
Quayle has the kind of good looks that movie stars are made of,
while Snooty has all the sex appeal of an Idaho potato (potatoe?),
only with more gas. Snooty also likes to roll over on his back to
have his stomach scratched, which is probably not a good quality
for a vice president to have in light of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   I would also (almost) be willing to crawl on my hands and knees
and lick the bacteria-infested shoes of any New Yorkers who took
umbrage with my Aug. 10, 1992, characterization of their native
cockroaches as ``weenies'' compared to Florida cockroaches.
Independent testing _ which I conveniently chose to disregard _ has
proven time and again that New York cockroaches are every bit as
big and fiesty as Florida cockroaches, even though Florida
cockroaches _ the ones that live in Sarasota, at least _ have
better manners and are more stylish dressers than their northern
counterparts.

<P>
   ``Barbecue. It's not just for breakfast anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Kansas City Barbeque Society's motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that smell?'' you ask as your cornflakes and milk turn
to mush. Why it's a whiff of KC barbecue on the ``Today Show.''
Co-host Matt Laurer will interview local 'que aficionados Carolyn
Wells, executive director of the KCBS, and Paul Kirk, the
award-winning Baron of Barbecue and cookbook author, for a segment
on regional barbecue styles. It's scheduled to air Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most wonderful opportunity to showcase barbecue _ and
particularly Kansas City barbecue _ for the rest of the world,''
Wells says.
</P>
<P>
   The call from NBC came shortly after Wells played host for the
KC leg of a BBC TV crew's series on American barbecue. Last spring
Wells and Kirk also were invited to cook for a Julia Child benefit
held in Portland, Ore., which was attended by the renowned cooking
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all this interest in barbecue is just too cool,''
Wells says.
</P>
<P>
   For their ``Today'' show appearance, Wells and Kirk will rise
with the roosters and head for the NBC studios where they will
explain how to prepare ``wet'' ribs, burnt ends, lamb chops and
brisket.
</P>
<P>
   The duo is scheduled to appear midway through the four-part
segment. Other guests will include John Willingham of Memphis; Jeff
Shivers of Arlington, Texas; and Jim Tabb of Tyron, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   After the live show the newscasters and crew will chow down on,
you guessed it, barbecue, that other breakfast of champions.
</P>
<P>
   Soggy cereal
</P>
<P>
   And it's back to that rather unappetizing bowl of soggy cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody's pet peeve, but nobody ever does anything
about it,'' says Kevin Shamy, the father of four and food broker
who lives and works in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of dumping his kids' half-eaten bowls of cereal down the
drain, Shamy has taken it upon himself to rid the world of limp,
milk-soaked mush by creating a slanted cereal bowl that allows
gravity to feed dry cereal into the milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple solution, but it really works,'' Shamy says.
``Besides, just about everybody eats cereal, and the cereal
companies spend a lot of money promoting crisp-this and Cap'n
Crunch-that, so obviously there's a market.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard plastic bowls retail for $14.95 for a set of three.
Shamy claims they can pay for themselves in 30 days and save up to
$300 a year in soggy cereal. They're available by calling
1-888-550-2695 or on the Internet at NewAngle.com.

`SPLIT: A COUNTERCULTURE CHILDHOOD': COMING TO TERMS WITH PROTEST
AND DIVORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., production notes are at the end of the review) 
 (HLW)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a college student at UCLA in the 1980s, Lisa Michaels recalls
in her affecting new memoir, she sported a tiny red and gold
Chairman Mao pin on her duffel bag. It was less a political
statement than an act of nostalgia, a tiny nod to her childhood as
the daughter of a radical activist.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 3, Ms. Michaels was photographed for Life
magazine, waving a Vietcong flag. By 8, she was playing at protest,
marching about the backyard with a bedsheet and broomstick flag,
shouting ``Ethiopia!'' Her father would have her evaluate her
summertime visits with him, applying a little of Mao's ``criticism,
self-criticism'' to the domestic sphere, while her stepmother
inscribed one of her birthday presents, a book on Chinese
revolutionary youth, with the exhortation ``Dare to struggle, dare
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it would be easy to caricature her '60s childhood or turn
her parents into cartoon radicals, Lisa Michaels, a contributing
editor at The Threepenny Review, does a beautifully nuanced job of
conjuring up her youth in both its anomalous and ordinary detail.
Her memoir, ``Split,'' is distinguished by its snapshots of
counterculture life (the author describes life on the road in a
mail van, and her visits to communes, labor meetings and protest
rallies) and by its sensitive evocation of her conflicted, loving
and sometimes tortured efforts to come to terms with her parents _
not just with their unorthodox life style, but also with their
divorce, their remarriages and their idealism and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Although her mother's laissez-faire, hippie-style parenting left
the young Ms. Michaels as ``wild as a baby goat'' _ as a baby, she
recalls, she ``ate whole sticks of butter, bit anyone who crossed
me'' _ she longed for a more conventional upbringing. She remembers
asking her mother and stepfather to teach her table manners, and
later coaxing her mother to wear more makeup so she would look more
like her schoolmates' mothers, ``ranchers' wives who leaned toward
peroxide and blue eyeshadow.'' In college, when other students were
protesting the university's ownership of South African stocks, she
recalls, she remained ``more worried about my grade point average
than the school's investment portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Ms. Michaels' ambivalence toward politics stemmed in
part from the realization that her father's activism was
responsible for his absence from her early life. Her parents split
up when she was four months old, and her father began spending less
and less time with her, after he joined the Weathermen, a splinter
group of Students for a Democratic Society, in 1969. Later that
year, he was arrested during an antiwar protest and began serving a
two-year prison term for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   Though the teen-age Ms. Michaels would spend considerable time
with her father, he remained for many years ``a ghost presence'' in
her life, kept alive by the stories about him that she would tell
her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Ms. Michaels writes, when she confronted her father
about his decision to put politics before family, he replied, ``I
felt terrible to leave you, but it was a very important moment in
history, and there was so much at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tried to be conscious of you,'' he went on, ``but
I've been on my own trip, and I don't think that's a bad thing _ I
don't think the only positive value I can have as a parent is to
keep everything safe and stable. We're living in a very dangerous
time, families are falling apart under the strain, and I'm trying
to do something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Ms. Michaels' affection for her parents _ and
her earnest, scrupulously fair-minded account _ that her father
does not emerge from this book as a self-absorbed scoundrel, but as
a passionate, if often misguided, man, who loved her despite his
preoccupation with politics. Yet at the same time, Ms. Michaels
makes palpable the emotional fallout of growing up with his
ferocious convictions: constant feelings of guilt about the modest
comforts of her life (``I did nothing to deserve them; I had come
to them by chance, and chance might take them away'') and a deep
longing to be more like others (``I wanted to slip into the bland
flow of passers-by; I wanted to live a life that aroused no
suspicion or trouble'').
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Michaels found herself internalizing her father's
paranoia and all his talk about wiretaps and the police. ``More
than my father ever did, I believed in a faceless governmental
will,'' she writes. ``His fears were concrete. He feared phone
taps; he feared inflated charges and prison, no doubt, having faced
them before. My fears were more vague than that, more high-flown
and Orwellian, though I hadn't read Orwell yet. I was a
pure-blooded conspiracy theorist at 12, the product of bad nerves
and little information.''

<P>
   Though ``Split'' grows somewhat fuzzy when it gets to the
author's college years _ too many pages spent chronicling the usual
adolescent problems about what to wear, whom to date, what to major
in _ it remains, for the most part, a lucidly written, highly
evocative memoir, a memoir that ratifies Ms. Michaels' observation
that she watched her parents ``far more closely'' than she listened
to them. It also demonstrates her eloquence as a witness to all
their lives.

HYPE OR SHAVE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now here's something different: a new razor that promises
(gasp!) THE CLOSEST, SMOOTHEST, SAFEST, MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED GEE-GOLLY UNBELIEVABLE SHAVE ON THE PLANET!
</P>
<P>
   Honest. Would Madison Avenue lie to you?
</P>
<P>
   Ho, ho! Don't make us laugh.
</P>
<P>
   So pay attention, America. Here come the ads. Here comes the
hype. Here comes the only $750 million, computer designed,
``revolutionary'' triple bladed ``shaving system'' the world has
ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes (drum roll, please) The Gillette Mach3!
</P>
<P>
   Hailed in no less than The New Yorker as ``the billion dollar
blade,'' and a product that ``may make five-o'clock shadow a thing
of the past,'' the Mach3 is simply the most extensively (and
expensively) researched razor in the history of shaving. It was
developed over the last seven years with cutting-edge metallurgy
and computer imaging technology by shaving scientists at the Los
Alamos of razor research, a large Gillette lab near Reading,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard of the Mach3?
</P>
<P>
   You will. Over the next few months Gillette plans a $300 million
marketing blitzkrieg, the largest in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' said Stephen East, a business analyst at A.G.
Edwards in St. Louis. Gillette is ``betting the farm on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for a neat publicity stunt? When the razor was
shipped to stores late last month, Gillette chairman Alfred Zein
announced its availability at the New York Stock Exchange. Standing
beside him was exchange president William R. Johnston, who appeared
for the first time in 17 years without his beard. He had shaved it
moments earlier with _ you guessed it _ the Mach3.
</P>
<P>
   So what's so ``revolutionary'' about the Mach3?
</P>
<P>
   According to Gillette, it's not just the world's first
triple-bladed razor. It has the thinnest blade edges Gillette has
ever made, and its open-backed (for easier cleaning) cartridge lies
flat to the face and pivots in ways other razors can't.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ which Gillette says can be demonstrated by 3-D
computer images that provide 40 times normal magnification _ is a
closer shave with fewer strokes and less irritation.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. Haven't we heard this before? Doesn't
virtually every razor on the market say it offers the closest
shave, too? And just how close can a razor get, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to see how the Mach3 rated, we gave it to five
barbers and stylists in the Kansas City area to see what they
thought.
</P>
<P>
   - Damian Becerra, a stylist at Alfredo's Hair Design on the
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shaver was sweet,'' he said. ``I shave almost every day.
(Currently) I use a Gillette Sensor Excel. But this one was better
because I just shave down, and when I brush my fingers up against
the way the hair grows it's not as rough. And I liked the way it
pivoted, like when it came down around my cheekbone the top of it
bent a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   - Darren W. Cole, barber at the Ivy League Barber Shop, 4438
Prospect Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET WITHOUT ACTUALLY USING A
STRAIGHT RAZOR,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best he's used so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said. ``It would run me away from my Bic
or any other kind of safety razor easily. It was comfortable. It
was just the glide. It moved right along my face. It was very
smooth. No irritation at all. I liked it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   - Tom Alexander, a barber at the Grand Avenue Barbershop, 1817A
Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's closer (than a straight razor) and your face feels
better,'' he said. ``If a man hadn't shaved for a week it might be
a different story. But I tell you, you couldn't even feel the cut.
That's about as good a razor as I ever shaved with.''
</P>
<P>
   - Leslie Cavallaro, barber//stylist at the Plaza Executive
Barber Shop, 328 W. 47th St.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was very unusual and hard to get used to because
it has a flatter head to it. Then I noticed that by using that
flatter head it seemed to go over the skin a lot better. ... I
don't know if it's going to work with guys who have cleft chins or
a little sharper jaws if it would nick or cut easier. But I have a
little rounder face and it seemed to move real easy across my face.
I don't think it was the best shave I ever had ... but I guarantee
you it's a very comfortable shave.''
</P>
<P>
   - Sonny Noland, barber at the Brookside Barber Shop, 308 W. 63rd
St.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shaved without softening my beard up first, and it did a
great job. The only problem I had was the sideburns. Where to hit
them, because it was so big with the three blades that I didn't
know where to put it. But it worked out OK. I think it's great. It
sold me.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone. East, the analyst, said the Mach3 irritated
his heavily stubbled face.
</P>
<P>
   How do competitors view the Mach3?
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ford, a spokesman for Schick razors, said Schick won't
wilt under the Mach3's onslaught. After all, he said, that
company's been scoring well with its newest razor, the Protector.
That razor features a lubricating ``comfort strip'' and blades
wrapped in micro-fine safety wires to prevent nicks and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Protector, Schick's second-quarter profits rose 31
percent to $32 million, Ford said. And recently, an author
reviewing Gillette's new entry pronounced Schick's razor decidedly
less irritating than the Mach3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hype about the (Mach3), but the bottom line
is does it give you a good shave?'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Ritchie Lowry, a professor of sociology at
Boston College, who just doesn't care. With all the other things to
worry about, he said, the idea of spending a billion dollars on a
closer shave is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just waste,'' he said. ``They have to tell you not to use
your old razor _ in many cases the same razor they told you just
last year was fantastic! _ because it's no longer good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the dilemmas of a capitalist society: You keep
needing more and more markets. But when it comes to a razor, how
close of a shave do you really need?''
</P>

WHAT'S MAGIC TO DO? 
</HEADLINE>

 AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a new TV show gets off to a less-than-auspicious start,
it's customary for the producers to tell the on-camera talent to
``ignore the critics'' and ``just go out and do a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Earvin Johnson, erstwhile basketballer and now host of a
late-night talk show, found himself unable to do either on the
night of July 2, when Howard Stern was his guest.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson's ``The Magic Hour'' signed on in early June,
Stern has made a morning ritual out of roasting the previous
night's broadcast on his nationally syndicated radio show. Yet
Johnson and his producers hatched the nutty idea that it would be
great TV to have Stern on the show.
</P>
<P>
   They should've known better. As a guest, Stern is a handful even
for David Letterman _ and Letterman's a control freak. Three years
ago ``The Tonight Show'' got out of hand when Stern brought two
bikini-clad women onto Jay Leno's stage and had them perform TV's
``first lesbian kiss'' as the host squirmed in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Magic Hour'' Stern may have done something worse.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the broadcast produced great ratings _ for one night.
``The Magic Hour'' doubled its normal audience that night, only to
fall back to its usual low levels the next. But Stern's appearance
exposed key reasons why the show must not go on:
</P>
<P>
   - Johnson has no control over his program. When Stern brought up
the firing of the show's unfunny house comedian, Craig Shoemaker,
the host should've deflected the subject. Instead, Johnson
confessed that he and Shoemaker ``weren't clicking.'' Yeah, that's
the kind of information I'd share on my program.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for appearing on ``The Magic Hour,'' Stern
actually demanded that his band be allowed to perform a flatulent
version of ``Wipe Out.'' And Johnson's producers said yes! When it
was over, they had no one but themselves to blame for the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   - The show's bandleader, Sheila E., can't ad lib musically or
verbally. She played ``You Light Up My Life'' when Stern first
walked on but let the tune drag on one or two bars longer than
necessary. Then as the show went to commercials, she played the
song again. And every time Stern tried pushing her buttons
(suggesting at one point that more lesbianism on her part would
spice up the show), Sheila E. just stood and grinned, not daring to
say a word.
</P>
<P>
   - Above all, Stern correctly identified the central problem with
``The Magic Hour'': its pathetic desire to be all things to all
people. Johnson should be building a loyal core audience _ namely
black viewers who are already comfortable with him _ and then try
to increase the show's reach from there.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago the ``black demographic'' was being touted as the
most highly sought-after crowd in late night. Black viewers weren't
being served by Letterman, Leno or other white-bread performers, we
were told. Well, they aren't being served now, either. With the
exception of cable's ``BET Tonight,'' no late-night program books
the rap performers, the gospel artists or the African-American
luminaries that once graced the couches of Arsenio, Keenen and
Sinbad.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who declared himself to be ``more black'' than Johnson
because Stern grew up in a mostly minority area of Long Island,
urged the host to fire his diction coach and speak in a more
comfortable dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are anti-Ebonics,'' he told the host. ``I'm
pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to deflect the criticism jovially, but the studio
audience (admittedly a pro-Stern faction) cheered it wildly.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the host and producers of ``The Magic Hour'' failed
to weigh the ratings and publicity boost they might have gotten
from Stern against the embarrassment of having Johnson's harshest
critic on national TV, cutting the show to bits.
</P>
<P>
   Damage control was attempted a few days later when the Rev.
Jesse Jackson was booked. Jackson and Johnson staged a bit in which
the guest upbraided the host for having Stern on the show. But it
was too late. The time to undo the damage was before the broadcast
with Stern ever aired.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now Stern's hijacking of ``The Magic Hour'' will be
recalled as one of the infamous moments of late night, right up
there with ``Tonight Show'' producer Helen Kushnick's canceling of
a broadcast less than an hour before airtime in 1992 and the
spectacular opening crash of ``The Chevy Chase Show'' in 1993. It
was great PR for Stern, who is about to launch alate-night program
of his own in August.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, however, it may have been the beginning of the end.

Q&AMP;A: EXPLODING ELEVATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is grain dust in elevators explosive?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Just about any organic material will explode if it is in
fine enough form, dry enough, in suspension in air and confined,''
said Ralph Regan, safety director of the Grain Inspection Service
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All it takes is the fuel,
oxygen and a spark, he and other experts suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, coal dust, wood dust, walnut hulls, the ingredients of
children's modeling dough and some medications have also been
involved in recent dust explosions, Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   Organic particles vary in flammability, and wheat and corn
starch are more explosive than other kinds, said Robert Schoeff,
professor emeritus of grain science at Kansas State University and
a consultant on grain safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary explosion shakes the building, dislodging more
dust, which ignites in turn, and there is also a pressure wave
ahead of the flame front,'' which shakes loose still more dust,
Schoeff said.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger the elevator the greater the danger, he said,
because ``a stronger container lets pressure build up so when it is
released it does so with greater force.''
</P>
<P>
   One important safety measure is venting the elevator to release
pressure. Others are cleaning grain of foreign material and broken
kernels before storage, spraying edible mineral oil on conveying
equipment to control dust and installing pneumatic dust-collection
systems using bag filters. ``The dust is pulled into the filter by
suction and removed for use in animal feed,'' Schoeff said.
</P>

CEMENT SHORTAGES PREDICTED TO STALL BUILDING PROJECTS 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SHORTAGE 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ... The cement industry is made up primarily of large companies
such as Holnam Inc., Lafarge Corp., Lone Star Industries and Ash
Grove Cement that own plants around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cement makers sell primarily to concrete makers, generally known
as ready-mix companies. Some of the concrete companies are owned by
the large cement manufacturers, while others are locally based
independent companies.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for why there is a tight cement market can easily be
found in the numbers, according to Bill Toal, an economist with the
Portland Cement Association, a trade association in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. used 93 million metric tons of cement last year, up
from 73.4 million metric tons in 1992. That is a 21 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available,
the U.S. produced 76 million metric tons of cement, up from about
75 million metric tons in 1992, a 1.3 percent increase and about
the same amount the U.S. produced in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of cement have nearly tripled since 1992, reaching 17.6
million metric tons in 1997. Imports have some domino affect on the
Midwest market, but because they are expensive to ship, they mostly
fill needs on the coast, according to Toal and others.
</P>
<P>
   Cement is made in kilns, or furnaces, that operate at about
2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Turning them on and off is not cost
effective so they generally operate year-round, 24 hours a day. As
a result, the industry almost always runs at full capacity. It
requires new plants to add capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some plants are operating at over 100 percent of capacity
because they are not allowing for down days for maintenance,'' Toal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cement plants are expensive to build, costing up to $200
million. They take years to get up and running, mainly because of
the process of obtaining air and water discharge permits. There are
118 cement plants in the U.S., down from 127 in 1988 and 163 in
1978. No new plants have been built for years because many cement
makers weren't making much money until the recent economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Improving market conditions have prompted some companies to plan
expansions but none of those have come online yet, Toal said.
Besides Ash Grove Cement's proposed new plant, Lafarge Corp., based
in Reston, Va., is expanding the only cement plant now operating in
the Kansas City area. It is adding 350,000 tons of capacity to its
plant in Sugar Creek.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino, of course, had to play a part in the shortage. Cement
makers usually build enough supplies in the winter to carry through
the construction season. With a mild winter, there were days in
December, January and February when concrete was poured, siphoning
off cement supplies, explained Ron Deleenheer, vice president of
marking for Ash Grove Cement.
</P>
<P>
   The wet summer has allowed cement makers to rebuild supplies but
it will compress the construction season, Deleenheer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into 1998 with thin inventories,'' Deleenheer said.
``We are getting delayed now because of weather but we may not be
able to get enough product through the shipping points to meet
demand. Some projects may just have to go into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright with Heartland Cement said cement takes a back seat to
perishable products during this season, meaning rail delays of
product. Cement makers are also being asked to cut back on their
production to conserve electricity during the summertime heat. His
company's plant in Independence, Kan., cut its third shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cement production demands tremendous energy. Cutting one shift
stymies our production by up to 30 percent.'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people shouldn't panic if their home or project is two or
three weeks late. It will get finished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people relax and not drive the ready-mix people crazy, they
will get their concrete,'' Wright said. ``Chewing them out with
four-letter words is not going to help.''

</HEADLINE>
 _ SHORTAGE 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tight supplies of concrete could slow the breakneck pace of home
building and commercial construction in some parts of the country,
and suppliers in the Kansas City area say spot shortages are
expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   That means some consumers building homes and contractors on
small commercial jobs may see delays of days or weeks as bigger
customers get top priority. Homeowners who want a single load for a
dog pen or patio project may be unable even to get supplies this
construction season.
</P>
<P>
   Tight supplies have pushed up concrete prices for several years
and have added several hundred dollars to the cost of an average
home and thousands to the cost of bigger building projects.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic yet. While there will be delays, concrete and cement
executives say consumers will eventually get their supplies.
There's even some disagreement in the building industry about
whether there is a real shortage of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The wet summer has kept the problem from becoming more
pronounced among consumers and builders, but concrete manufacturers
say shortages could begin showing up soon and continue into the
winter. If the economy continues to expand, the tight market could
last for several years until new cement plants come on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be days when home builders or some of the smaller
guys down the line might not get the concrete they need. All the
cement plants in this area are at near capacity and there is still
not enough cement to meet the total demand,'' said Kent Sunderland,
vice president of Ash Grove Cement in Overland Park, the country's
fourth-largest cement maker.
</P>
<P>
   Ash Grove in June announced it will build a 1-million-metric-ton
capacity plant in the Kansas City area or expand a plant in
Chanute, Kan. The $150 million to $200 million plant won't be ready
until about 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Actually it is cement, the main ingredient in concrete, that is
in short supply. Cement is to concrete what flour is to bread.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of factors _ both short and long term _ have contributed
to a tight cement market nationally and a shortage of cement in the
Midwest. The simplest explanation, however, is that since 1994 the
U.S. has used record amounts of cement while cement production has
remained stagnant and actually declined from 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, building construction has been on the rise thanks
to seven years of economic expansion. Moreover, Kansas and Missouri
have undertaken concrete-heavy road and bridge projects such as
Bruce R. Watkins freeway in Kansas City and interchanges on
Interstate 435 in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   Some area home builders and heavy constructors say they have yet
to feel the pinch and not everyone is convinced there is a real
shortage. Some area home builders said talk of shortages always
precedes price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard this with all kinds of building materials,''
said Darryl Rodrock of Rodrock Development, one of the area's
largest home builders. ``They jump prices 20 percent and there will
be plenty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concrete prices have gone to about $75 a cubic yard, up from
about $55 several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage, however, is no joke, said Bill Geiger, of Geiger
Ready-Mix. His cement supplier put him on an allocation budget that
is 10 percent less than what he sold last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we are playing games but this is not a game,''
Geiger said. ``Right now Kansas City is just moving so fast, we are
going to get caught short.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NASCAR race track planned for Wyandotte County, rapid
home building and new federal transportation money coming down the
chute, concrete supplies will be tight for several years, Geiger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are positive things but the effect will be like going to
the grocery store and not being able to buy pop and bread. Cement
is a basic commodity. We are doing everything we can to get more
cement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Wright, a sales representative with Heartland Cement in
Gardner, cautions builders and consumers not to panic. They will
get what they need, although not necessarily on the day or hour
they might want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our opinion that it will be a temporary problem, off and
on all this year, anyway,'' Wright said.

 &HT;    Diapers scant protection against fouling pool water
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the advent of disposable swimming diapers this season,
taking babies to the swimming pool has gotten easier than ever. But
many pediatricians think it's a lousy idea _ risking the health of
other swimmers and the babies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the hype around special swimming gear for infants,
nothing can guarantee that fecal matter won't get into the water,
manufacturers say. ``Rubber pants, swimsuit, diapers, if the child
has any of these on (and has an accident) there's going to be
leakage,'' acknowledged Wendi Strong, spokeswoman for
Kimberly-Clark, maker of the Huggies diaper Little Swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   And that means those sharing the pool could be exposed to such
organisms as E. coli, as in the case of 25 children who became ill
after swimming in June at White Water park in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more commonly, swimmers could become infected with
intestinal parasites such as Giardia lamblia, which attaches itself
to the lining of small intestines, causing nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Giardia can survive what's considered a safe concentration of
chlorine and can live for more than two months in cold water. The
Food and Drug Administration estimates that 2 percent of the U.S.
population has the parasite, with young children seen as the main
culprits for transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I see toddlers in diapers swimming in the same public pool
I'm in, I get out,'' said Dr. Neil Izenberg, a pediatrician at the
Dupont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., and editor in
chief of the e-zine KidsHealth
</P>
<P>
   .org. ``We have said for years that if a child does not have
bowel control, they should not be allowed in public swimming
pools.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing similar concerns, both the American Academy of Pediatrics
and the Canadian Paediatric Society have recommended that children
in diapers not be allowed in swimming or wading pools.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most community pools _ including White Water _ allow
babies in if they are wearing gear deemed appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   At the Metro Atlanta YMCA _ a chain of 15 centers _ more than
250 babies are enrolled in the infant swim classes. Such classes
are important because they give parents and infants one-on-one time
and teach the basics of pool safety, says Marcia Humphrey, director
of the aquatics program at the Gwinnett YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Those benefits, she says, outweigh the risks of contracting
diseases. At the YMCA, swim pants with elastic waists and legs are
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think babies should be kept out of the pool,'' said
Sabrina Morgan, a Garden Hills mother. ``A pool is a place for a
family and babies are a part of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 packages of swim diapers have been sold each
weekend this summer at the Babies R Us in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   And Little Swimmers - the newest Huggies _ was developed
precisely because there was such a consumer demand, Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this, diapers were made with gel so absorbent they
swell, they become huge _ many times their size _ and can explode
and clog the pool drain,'' she said. In contrast, Little Swimmers
are a one-piece disposable pants built with an absorbent liner that
does not swell in water.
</P>
<P>
   But like other swim gear, they do not provide 100 percent
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're designed to prevent urine and bowel movement leakage
before the child goes in the water, and they can help prevent
leakage of solid bowel movement once the child is in the water,''
Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to precisely assess the risk from diapers in the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 14
states had 26 waterborne-disease outbreaks associated with
recreational water in 1993 and 1994, the most recent years it
surveyed. More than 1,700 people were affected by the outbreaks,
and of those cases, half involved swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   The White Water outbreak is only the second time the CDC ever
has seen E. coli transmission through a chlorinated public pool.
The first time was also in Georgia, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the grand scheme of things, I think the risks of acquiring
infectious diseases from public pool facilities is just low,
period,'' said Dr. Harry Keyserling, an Emory University
pediatrician specializing in infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, Keyserling did add a caveat: Chlorine levels have to be
maintained at a proper level. That's one of the factors being
examined in the E. coli outbreak at White Water. Pools need a
chlorine level of at least 1.5 parts per million to be considered
safe, and it's not clear whether the pool where the infection took
place was properly chlorinated at the time of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the case against infant swimming is the general
agreement that chlorine is not a complete shield against infection.
If a large dose of fecal germs are introduced, some may survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of overwhelms the chlorination,'' said Peter Lee,
spokesman for the state Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, pool managers will ``shock'' their pools with high
levels of chlorine when a bowel movement is discovered, but people
are exposed in the time it takes to clear the area, Lee says.
``Shocking the pool is done too late, because you have to wait till
there's no one in the pool,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Izenberg, the Delaware pediatrician, brings up one other problem
about children and public pools. If someone does get sick, folks
are likely to blame the foods _ not the pools _ of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the other public health dangers, I don't think
this ranks very high,'' he said. ``But that might be because the
problems are going unnoticed _ not that they're not occurring. So,
it's probably far more widespread than we think.''

<P>
   Musically, things have gone well for Monica. Since releasing her
first album ``Miss Thang'' three years ago at the age of 14, the
College Park, Ga. resident born Monica Arnold has sold over a
million copies of her debut album. She's also become the the
youngest artist ever to have two consecutive No. 1 singles (``Don't
Take It Personal _ Just One of Dem Days,'' ``Before You Walk Out of
My Life'').
</P>
<P>
   But talk of Monica has rarely, solely, been about her music.
Even as a young teen, journalists asked her if she had lost her
virginity. And she and her family continue to hear rumors that she
was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 2 1/2 years people are still asking me about my baby,''
says the 17-year-old singer, who doesn't have any children, in a
recent interview at the Atlanta office of her label, Arista
Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just had too much to deal with other than my music,''
adds Monica, whose new album ``The Boy Is Mine,'' goes on sale
today. . ``And not only has it been unfair to me, but people don't
understand how unfair it is to my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has been trying from the start,'' adds her mother
Marilyn Best, who works in consumer affairs for Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Thang'' came out 10 months after fellow teen vocalist
Brandy's debut. And while Brandy sang well about typical teen
topics - ``I Wanna Be Down,'' `` `Baby, Baby, Baby', don't your
know that you're so fine'' _ Monica wore the brashness of
adolescence on her sleeve, shouted it in her CD title, and sang it
with a spunk that drew instant and persistent comparisons with
Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the ``good'' girl versus ``bad'' girl thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandy and I have talked about situations where people have
told her mother things that weren't true as well,'' says Monica,
effectively negating the rumor that the two singers who share the
country's No. 1 pop single for the past six weeks, ``The Boy Is
Mine,'' don't speak to each other. (The song is also on Brandy's CD
``Never Say Never.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, I can't tell the people fast enough to mind their
business. Sweep around their own front doors. Maintain their own
households. And be adults. My 18th birthday is still not here and I
think my brain is so much further along than a lot of people who
are 30 and 40 years-old who work with my stepfather and work around
people in my family who call and make up these lies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monica deals with it. ``Incredibly well,'' noted Vibe
magazine president Keith Clinkscales. ``I think the words `old
soul' are used to describe her quite often. But they're
appropriate. Her voice and spirit has a knowingness well beyond her
years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because her father abandoned her mother when
Monica was just 4 years old. ``And to lose somebody you either lose
yourself or you gain a lot of knowledge as you deal with losing
them,'' explains Monica, speaking with an evenness that doesn't
waver as she recalls this turning point. ``We gained from the
experience. I saw (my mother) be strong. I saw her take care of me
and my brother (Montez, 14) . I saw her continue her life. I saw
her work extra hours and not eat for trying to do things to feed
us. And that's what made me so strong as a female.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the producer who Monica calls her father, Dallas Austin,
came along when she was 11. ``I thought I was getting a singer, but
I gained a daughter and what I could see, even then, was going to
be an incredible woman,'' says Austin. ``I don't know exactly what
made her this way. But people know it when they hear it.'' It's
that strength, that emotion crawling up your spine when you listen
to Monica hit the higher registers on ``For You I Will,'' or its
equal on her new CD, ``Inside.'' It's the kind of reserve you must
have at that age to deliver Dorothy Moore's classic ``Misty Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent newspaper article touted Monica as a Whitney
Houston-in-the-making. ``And I can see that in a way because
Whitney had a great voice when she was young, and so does Monica,''
said Atlanta's Daryl Simmons, who produced Monica's ``Why I Love
You So Much,'' and ``I Keep It To Myself'' on the new CD. ``But she
connects to audiences in a different way than Whitney did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself hanging out with Monica,'' says 18-year-old
Tasha Moreland of College Park, one of Monica's fans. ``Whitney
seems too distant, too put together. She can sing and everything.
But she doesn't seem real. I think Monica is the same person on
record as she is out here on Old National Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I give people all that I am, especially on this
record,'' affirms Monica, who actually considers Houston and rapper
Mia X ``my two real friends in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm glad people, in the end, have been feeling and
understanding what they hear on my records and not in the street.''

 &HT;    Nancy Reagan might have had more influence in the White House
than Hillary Clinton does
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what some Republicans think of Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Nancy Reagan actually may have been the most influential first lady
in the past four decades, according to many top-ranking officials.
In Part 2 of Vanity Fair's 25,000-word chronicle of the Reagans,
correspondent Bob Colacello says, ``Mrs. Reagan never tried to make
policy. But she had a tremendous influence.'' Colacello reports
that Mrs. Reagan worked behind the scenes in the White House to
pave the way for the four summits held with Mikhail Gorbachev. ``I
protect Ronnie from himself,'' she once told one head of state.
Today, as Reagan's primary caregiver, she protects him from the
world.

   NET PROFITS: Suburban malls revolutionized the way we shopped in
the 1970s and '80s. Now, says Time correspondent Michael Krantz,
the Internet has become a shopper's paradise. According to one
study, online consumer sales will reach $20 billion by 2000, an
increase of 233 percent over this year's estimated $6.1 billion.
Still, some skeptics doubt that virtual shopping will ever take the
place of hands-on browsing. Economist Stephen Roach notes that
e-commerce represents no more than 1 percent of the U.S.'s $8.5
trillion economy.

   HERE'S THE BEEF: The New Yorker ($3) features a fascinating
article by Lawrence Wright on the strange alliance between Clyde
Lott, a Pentecostal cattle breeder in Mississippi, and Chaim
Richman, an Orthodox rabbi in Israel. This December, 500 pregnant
Red Angus cows will be exported from Mississippi to Israel _ not
just for beef, but to fulfill a scriptural prophecy. The Jews
believe the advent of the ``red heifer'' means the Messiah may be
near; Christians believe it means the beginning of the end of the
world. The red heifer is also the key to the rebuilding of the
Temple destroyed by Romans in 70 A.D. Before it can be rebuilt,
Jews must be purified with the ashes of ``a red heifer without
spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came a yoke.''
Rabbi Richman has found such a heifer: a cow named Dixie.

   SCIENCE AND GOD: Scientists and theologians often have been at
odds, but that is changing, reports Newsweek ($2.95) in its cover
story. ``Science and spirituality have a common quest, which is a
quest for truth,'' says Sister Mary White of the Benedictine
Meditation Center in St. Paul, Minn. Meanwhile, U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($2.95) looks at our universe and ponders what came before
creation. Allen Sandage, one of the world's leading astronomers,
says that contemplating the majesty of the big bang helped make him
a believer in God, willing to accept that creation could only be
explained as a ``miracle.''

 &HT;    Muzak teams up with others to bring a new kind of music
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As unlikely as it seems, elevator-music kingpin Muzak,
Footaction USA, Arista and Puff Daddy are pooling resources to
market ``Nothin' But the Hotness in '98,'' a compilation album.
It's a consortium that is on the leading edge of a trend uniting
retailers, record labels and artists, and one expected to be
particularly effective in the hip-hop/rap arena.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Robin Forman, project manager for Muzak,
notes, is to link brands with ``powerhouse leaders of urban music
and culture like Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy Entertainment label.''
</P>
<P>
   Other artists on the 10-track CD, available for $9.99 only at
Footaction stores, include Faith Evans, the late Notorious B.I.G.,
the Lox and Mase.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beastie Boys, ``Hello Nasty'' (Grand Royal/Capitol). Grade:
B.
</P>
<P>
   -- BR5-49, ``Big Backyard Beat Show'' (Arista). Latest from
crossover country act that's toured with Bob Dylan, Black Crowes
and George Strait. It includes Billy Joe Shaver's ``Georgia on a
Fast Train.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Monica, ``The Boy Is Mine'' (Arista). Grade: B+.
</P>
<P>
   -- P.A. (Parental Advisory). Grade: B.

duet with her father, ``Somethin' Stupid,'' and two other tunes
will benefit Frank Sinatra Foundation's charities.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lucinda Williams, ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' (Mercury).
Grade: A.

 &HT;    COLUMN:Time's the best gift a child can give Dad on her big day
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For her birthday, our daughter suggested a few things that might
be nice for a girl of her age. There were about a dozen, actually,
and she printed them on a piece of white notebook paper with a lead
pencil. They included a turtle, a boom box, a certain Beanie Baby
whose going price would buy a set of tires and, last but hardly an
afterthought, a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a lot to shell out. The turtle, fortunately, already
comes equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Alex turned 8 years old today, 8 going on 12. When a girl is 8,
she is, of course, quite grown up. She is not of voting age or
drinking age or even driving age, but why split hairs? She's all
but there.
</P>
<P>
   Any child born on Bastille Day is bound to be a pistol. A trip
to France, in fact, was casually mentioned. Next year if not this
year. We could fly over on the Concorde, she said, take in Paris
and do it up right.
</P>
<P>
   Alex is our spunky one, certain of what she wants, given to
insurrection and exasperated by an old stick who's just running out
the clock. The ancien regime _ that's me.
</P>
<P>
   Already at seven and a half she had become too worldly for the
adventures of Sally O'Malley and Molly McGolly, fictional
characters in bedtime stories we told each other when she was still
a mere child. Not to be be immodest, but I thought those stories
had real possibilities. I thought of this once when reading her a
story by William Steig, a better writer than her father but
something to shoot for just the same. Elaborate a bit on the story
lines, sharpen the dialogue here and there, find us a good
illustrator and we're in business, kiddo.
</P>
<P>
   My chance to become a famous author, or at least co-author, has
gone by the boards. At the witching hour she hasn't time anymore
for Sally and Molly.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough that she has time for me, and I try to show my
appreciation. One way of doing that lately is by playing the number
game, a kind of roulette in which you win a quarter if you can
guess what number between 1 and 20 is hidden in the other person's
head. You get three guesses and she usually nails it by the third
one. The girl's got a knack for holding my head between the palms
of her hands, peering deep into my eyes (poking around in my ears,
too, if necessary) and, so to speak, reading my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it saddens me that the acquisitive impulse has
won out over storytelling. But she's up by $1.75 _ nothing to sniff
at.
</P>
<P>
   With luck I'll retain financial leverage for another 14 years.
But in time I'll have to let go, not as soon as she'd like and
sooner than I'll be ready for. ``A father's anxieties end only in
his grave,'' a friend of mine wrote when his daughter reached 20.
Until then, he clings to the illusion that the child can be molded
to his design.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, she's not a bad fit. I always liked a spirited woman
with a mind of her own, and I think she knows that a part of me is
silently applauding her resistance to paternal commands. I'm not
going to be a pushover, and I don't want her to be either. Just
don't whine.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where the balance lies, but I hope that before she
goes her own way we'll have struck something close to it. Give me
the short end, if need be. I'll trade a measure of permissiveness
for the assurance of trust. Drugs, drinking, smoking, teen
pregnancy, the wrong crowd, boys too much like the ones I once knew
_ those are the nightmares that loom larger with every year.
</P>
<P>
   Has there ever been a worse time to raise kids? She already
knows too much while not knowing enough. When she starts dancing,
limbs and torso loosey-goosey, it scares me as much as it charms
me. The high school girls didn't even come on to me like that, and
_ come to think of it _ neither has anyone since.
</P>
<P>
   You can't expect Sally and Molly to be much competition for the
Spice Girls. I just hope Leonardo DiCaprio hasn't got so much over
Daddy that nothing I say registers.
</P>
<P>
   On a chest of drawers, there's a picture of her when she was
about 3. In it, I can see an intimation of the girl she's become,
sly and smart. I look at the girl she's still becoming and hold my
breath. Somewhere in there I think I see the dim outline of a woman
I'm going to like.
</P>
<P>
   I just don't want to see it too soon. I still want to see a girl
who could forget Leonardo DiCaprio for a box turtle and might even
turn off a cell phone to let her father tell her a story at
bedtime.

 &HT;    2 events explore images presented by music videos
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--We're talking about one guy who calls himself the Media
Assassin and another who describes himself as ``an anarchist and a
subversive.'' So you can expect the National Black Arts Festival
program that Harry Allen (Media Assassin) and Greg Tate (choose
your adjective) have assembled on hip-hop music music videos will
be a bit more than your daily BET or MTV countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Allen's two-hour ``Hip-Hop Music Video Giga-Film
Festival'' deals with how hip-hop visualizes images of black men,
black women, power and race. It will end with a video countdown.
Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say the best, I don't mean music videos that promoted
popular songs,'' explains Allen, a contributor to Vibe and its
upcoming sister publication Blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a song was popular doesn't mean the video was
good,'' he continues. ``If a song conveys `positive' messages, (it)
doesn't automatically get (recognized). They won't make my list
just because they were popular videos or if they were the video
debut of influential or popular artists.''
</P>
<P>
   For a video to be considered for his list, Allen said it should,
among other accomplishments, set new and higher creative standards,
reflect a powerful synergy between sound and image, and affect
``the way hip-hop was seen, discussed or treated in a larger
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. All this serious talk about a three-minute promotional
tool?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the Media Assassin has always been serious about his
work,'' says Public Enemy's D, who boosted Allen's profile by
mentioning him in his song ``Don't Believe the Hype.'' ``And
videos, legitimately, should be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Allen: ``Most people think of (music videos) disposable
form, but it is the largest mass of documented black popular
musical performances in this portion of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   As of this writing, Allen, who also serves on the advisory board
of the Race Relations Institute at Fisk University, still hadn't
come up with his ``best of the best'' list. Maybe Coolio's ``C U
When I Get There'' will be on it. Or Dr. Dre's ``Nuthin' But a `G'
Thang.'' He's already certain Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony's
``Crossroads,'' a dark video about afterlife, is ``the greatest
music video ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate is shorter on specifics about his ``Music Video As Film''
program the following evening. ``I'm going to be using a DJ and
we'll be using turntables and guitar to help tell the story,''
offers the 40-year-old author and Village Voice columnist who's
also in town for the Black Rock Coalition performance Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really necessarily accept this hierarchy of cinema
being art and video being a lesser form. There's really a lot of
imagination in some of this work which I hope to show. The
cheesiest r&AMP;b video is less offensive to me than these so-called
black comedy films.''

 &HT;    Results of tests may lead to rescheduling of Akinwande-Holyfield
bout
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rescheduling of Evander Holyfield's heavyweight
title defense against Henry Akinwande is closer to realization
after Akinwande's most recent blood test showed Monday that the
residual strain of hepatitis B in his system is non-infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation where it has become more likely than not
that this fight will go forward as soon as it's practicable,'' said
Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King and Showtime executive Jay Larkin had penciled
in Aug. 29 at Madison Square Garden as a potential resetting for
the fight. But the New York State Athletic Commission still may
refuse to license Akinwande, based on the fact that the virus
remains detectable in his blood. A positive test can occur even
after a person recovers from a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Garden, which has a right of first refusal, has
sent mixed signals on whether it wants to host the fight after the
original June 6 card was shaping up as a financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   If either the commission or Garden officials say no, the fight
may go to Las Vegas on Sept. 5 _ possibly at the Mirage, which has
shown interest. The timing could bode well for ticket sales. That
date would be on Labor Day weekend and the first week of the NFL
season, when crowds flock to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   States often adhere to each other's conclusions on the medical
status of boxers. But Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada
Athletic Commission, said Akinwande can fight in Las Vegas if he is
approved by its doctors. Nevada, unlike New York, doesn't
customarily test boxers for hepatitis but would in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the postponement, Holyfield received an offer from HBO of
$20 million for a title unification bout against Lennox Lewis in
December. He said he would not commit to the offer until assessing
how he feels following an Akinwande bout. ``I have to listen to my
body,'' he said, adding he would prefer meeting Lewis in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who was recently quoted as saying he would demand a
$25 million guarantee against Lewis, says those comments were not
accurate. He now says a $20 million guarantee would be acceptable,
with more revenue possible based on sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is I don't want anybody to put a cap on (my
purse),'' he said. ``If the fight does well (on pay-per-view), I
expect to get compensated for it.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight at 7:40 p.m.; Wednesday at 12:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Radio/TV: Fox Sports South will broadcast both games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight: RHP John Smoltz (6-2, 3.77;
7-7, 3.96 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. RHP Bobby Jones (7-5, 3.88; 3-6,
5.40 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday: LHP Denny Neagle (9-7, 3.30;
4-3, 4.33 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. RHP Masato Yoshii (4-4, 3.65; 0-1,
3.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: The Braves trail the all-time series 197-201 and
are 6-13 at Shea Stadium the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves swept a three-game series from New
York at Turner Field on July 3-5 just before the All-Star break.
The New Yorkers were outscored 10-5 and did not hold a lead the
entire series.
</P>
<P>
   Mets leaders: Avg: John Olerud (.328); HR _ Mike Piazza (14);
RBIs _ Piazza, Olerud, Huskey (50); SB _ McCrae (15). W _ Rick Reed
(10); ERA _ Al Leiter (1.86). Strikeouts _ Leiter (96). Saves _
John Franco (18).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: The Mets opened a 12-game homestand by dropping two of
four to visiting Montreal during the weekend and still managed to
pick up a game in the NL East on the front-running Braves. The last
time the Braves saw them, the Mets were chasing the umpiring crew
off the field following Atlanta's 11th-inning victory on July 5, an
incident that prompted a three-game suspension for closer John
Franco. He continues to pitch until his appeal can be heard. . . .
The club's biggest news is the return of Todd Hundley, the
catcher-turned-outfielder who is 1-for-6 and starting in left. The
club has tried Bernard Gilkey in right field (where he last
appeared in 1993 with St. Louis), but Butch Huskey started there
Sunday. Good idea. Huskey is hitting .484 with eight RBIs in his
last eight games. . . . New York, which like the Braves had an
off-day on Monday, has won its last two, but is 4-9 dating back to
June 26. The Mets bullpen has five blown saves in the last 13
games. . . . Jones, tonight's starter, has rebounded from a 1-3
start to go 6-2 in his last 11 games. The Mets are 8-4 in his last
12 appearances, his last one coming Thursday against Montreal, an
11th-inning loss. Jones allowed four earned runs in five innings
that night but drew no decision. He was 0-2 against the Braves in
three starts last season, Atlanta pounding him for 25 hits and 16
earned runs in just 11 2/3 innings. . . . On the DL: 1B Matt Franco
(broken toe), RHP Jason Isringhausen (right shoulder surgery), LHP
Al Leiter (torn tendon, left knee), LHP Hector Mercado (left elbow
surgery), INF Craig Paquette (sprained left ankle), RHP Armando
Reynoso (right elbow strain), C Tim Spehr (broken left wrist) and
RHP Paul Wilson (right shoulder sprain).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: CF Brian McRae has six homers in his last 17 games
and has a .424 on-base percentage during his last 59 plate
appearances. 1B John Olerud's .328 average is sixth in the NL.
Light-hitting SS Rey Ordonez is hitting .400 with four runs scored
and two RBIs in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: 3B Edgardo Alfonzo hit 3-for-16 (.188) in the weekend
Expos series. Closer Franco blew two saves in his first two
appearances of the second half.

 &HT;    Els in search of old confidence at British Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Ernie Els played in Ireland mostly for
laughs and leisure last week instead of competing at the Loch
Lomond Invitational in Scotland, but also to get the feel of links
courses heading into Royal Birkdale and this week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nice plan. Too bad there wasn't a spare wind tunnel to borrow at
Ballybunion.
</P>
<P>
   After a practice round Monday at Royal Birkdale, Els promptly
called the British Open venue ``the toughest par 70 I have ever
played. I would say it's even tougher than The Olympic Club if it
blows like this.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not particularly good news for Els, whose first two
majors of 1998 will not add too many pages to the scrapbook. He
tied for 16th at the Masters, then fell to a tie for 49th at the
U.S. Open in his defense after winning in 1997 at Congressional. A
sometimes aching back has not aided the process. He welcomes an
arrival by Columbus, Ga., physical therapist Tom Boers, who will
work with Fred Couples and Sea Island's Davis Love III. Admittedly,
Els ``has lost a little confidence'' in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the bloody spasm,'' Els said. ``It doesn't want to
go away, doesn't want to release. ... I think I'm going to give a
really good go this week, play as hard as I can. If it's still
niggling a little bit by Sunday or Monday, I am going to take maybe
a month off and get it sorted out and come back healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen: Get used to me
</P>
<P>
   When Lee Janzen checked into the Royal Birkdale locker room
Sunday, an attendant asked, ``Are you a qualifier?'' With that, the
U.S. Open champion just smiled and said, ``No, I'm exempt. ... Get
used to my face. I'll be coming here the next 10 years.'' The
attendant's embarrassment only grew painfully when told by his
fellow workers the identity of the player he had just questioned.
``The other guys,'' said Janzen, ``gave him a hard time right
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mize qualifies for spot
</P>
<P>
   Columbus' Larry Mize, who made the overseas trip without a spot
in the British Open, justified the effort Monday by securing a spot
through the local qualifier at Heskett Golf Club with rounds of
71-75_146. Considering the nature of Sunday's weather _ wind gusts
measured up to 55 mph and one qualifier suspended because of balls
blowing off the greens _ a 71 was the relative equivalent of a 66.
... Gary Nicklaus, son of Jack, won't be able to carry on the
family tradition at the British Open. Trying to qualify the past
two days, he bogeyed the last three holes Monday at Hillside Golf
Club for a 78 then lost in a playoff. ... American John Cook
withdrew for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo says he's greatly improved
</P>
<P>
   England's Nick Faldo, who withdrew from Loch Lomond less than an
hour before his tee time last Wednesday, said his injured right
elbow is ``75 percent better'' and he's confident of playing in the
tournament. A soft cast that was placed on the pained elbow has
been removed and the inflammation reduced. Faldo walked the course
Sunday and planned to play a practice round Tuesday. He will use a
tee on every shot for a while to avoid jarring the elbow with a big
divot. ``There is no point taking any unnecessary risks,'' Faldo
said. ``Hopefully by Wednesday I'll be okay to play a proper
practice round without the aid of a tee. Right now I am confident
I'll be fit to play on Thursday.'' ... Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar
wants to maintain what has been a successful trend in the Masters
and U.S. Open. He played a pre-tournament practice round with
fellow Yellow Jacket Stewart Cink of Smyrna at both Augusta
National and The Olympic Club and tied for 21st and 14th,
respectively. ``Hopefully, we'll continue our tradition of doing
well,'' Kuchar said.

 &HT;    Corporate sponsorship the name of the game in NASCAR
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He hasn't won a race in 247 tries, so when Rick Mast
climbs out of his No. 75 Ford Taurus after another Winston Cup
adventure, he gets right to the point. He describes how the car
ran, or didn't run. He remembers key moments in the three-hour
race.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes he forgets to plug Remington rifles, as in, ``The
Remington Arms Ford really gave it a good shot today.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mast is waiting to get to victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Remington, the manufacturer of rifles and ammunition, pays
Mast's race team between $3-6 million to remember why that big 'R'
is on the hood of his yellow Ford.

   ``The problem I have with this is that all the years I was with
Skoal (chewing tobacco), they never wanted me to say 'Skoal,'''
Mast said. ``On TV or radio or nothin'. Just wear the uniform and
hat. I kind of got in that mode. So I get with these folks, and
they're calling me up asking, 'When you gonna start saying
'Remington, Rick?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question more and more sponsors are beginning to ask.
Sponsorship is the driving force behind NASCAR, and as stock car
racing has grown into a major lifestyle sport, the cost of
advertising on the brightly painted 200 mph billboards has
increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Every inch of the car, except for the roof, is for sale. The
major sponsors get the biggest decal, on the hood. Associate
sponsors may pay up to $500,000 to be on the rear deck lid. NASCAR
controls the decals in the 36-inch space from behind the front
wheel to the driver's window.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the sponsorship varies with the success and
popularity of the race team and driver.
</P>
<P>
   Remington is delighted with Mast, because he's an avid
outdoorsman with a playful sense of humor who enjoys making his
obligatory three trips to the rifle factory and hanging out with
the employees.
</P>
<P>
   He even won the pole at Rockingham on the same weekend Remington
introduced its new model rifle by painting a picture of the gun
across the hood of the No. 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked with him on how and when to say Remington,'' said
Phil Murdock, the company's Manager of Sports Marketing. ``It means
a lot to us. We're involved in racing because we like racing, but
we're involved very much to promote our brand to outdoorsmen.
Rick's getting better. He's doing a good job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Remington is just one example of how Winston Cup's sponsor base
has expanded from what once was predominantly automotive products
and beer. Of the 38 primary sponsors this season, 11 are companies
that either manufacture shelved goods or sell them. Kellog's, Tide
and Kodak have sponsored cars for more than five years. Other major
sponsors include a satellite TV company, financial-services firms
and Tabasco hot pepper sauce.
</P>
<P>
   They all want to buy into the loyalty factor: 71 percent of
NASCAR fans buy products of NASCAR sponsors, according to
Performance Research, a company that tracks that sort of thing.
Performance Research also found that 40 percent of race fans will
switch to a product if it becomes a NASCAR sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as Remington, which sees the NASCAR fan and the
outdoorsman as one and the same, and Midwest-based Thorn Apple
Valley Meats (yes, race fans like sausage) are proof that the
little guys, if they come up with the money, can ride with the big
guys, like McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn Apple Valley Meats has tied into Winston Cup this year in
an effort to turn around its financial situation. The company lost
$21.7 million in fiscal 1996 and $3.2 million last year. But
president Joel Dorfman asked stockholders to be encouraged by the
company's investment and growth potential that would come because
of its affiliation with NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sponsorships puts the Thorn Apple Valley brand in the
company of Tide, Budweiser, Winston, Kodak and other leading
brands, provides the broad, national exposure that had been missing
from our marketing arsenal and gives us a significant marketing
advantage over our competitors,'' Dorfman wrote in his annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   You can't buy Thorn Apple Valley sausages everywhere, but you
might be curious about the brand name if the Cale Yarborough-owned
No. 94 Ford is running well enough to get some TV exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The company wasn't even that concerned about buying into a team
that has won only once in 10 years, that victory coming last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In auto racing, there's one team that wins, and 42 that lose
every week, if you want to categorize it as losing,'' marketing
director Mike Farley said. ``It takes a long time to build a team,
as in football, basketball, baseball. We didn't think we were going
to be a Jeff Gordon and DuPont in the first year. But running a
Winston Cup car can achieve your objectives outside of winning,
like brand identification. People know who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For their investment, the sponsors are paired with teams by
NASCAR and have a major say in who drives the car. ``It's like a
personal services contract,'' Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one bottom line that makes the investment seem like a
smart one. The Joyce Julius Sponsors Report, based in Ann Arbor,
Mich., studies each race telecast frame-by-frame and feeds
information into a computer that calculates how much time a
sponsor's decal is on screen. Then it computes what it would cost
the sponsor to buy that much time at a non-discounted advertising
rate for that broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, sponsors accumulated more than $1
billion in comparable exposure value. The sponsors consider this
free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to count the exposure it has to be clear and in
focus,'' said Eric Wright, vice president of the Report. ``It can't
be blurred or partially obscured. Our researchers are trained to
only tabulate what's clear and in focus. The larger sponsors that
are across the hood show up more frequently than those smaller type
decal sponsors. But that doesn't mean those smaller sponsors are
not receiving exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at a pit situation, where they're focusing on the
tire being changed. That's real prime time for them to pick up that
screen time. We're able to tell our clients where they're showing
up and for how long. We can tell them they appeared on the hood of
so-and-so's car for four minutes and 32 seconds and on a uniform
for another 25 seconds, on a billboard in Turn 3 for 15 seconds or
what have you.''
</P>
<P>
   So there is a reason for that suspension cam beneath the car.
``Lots of times you'll see decals down there, too,'' Wright said.
``The only people who are going to see that are the people sitting
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrecks often can cost a sponsor credit in the Report. ``We fall
back on our methodology,'' Wright said. ``If it's a 10-letter
sponsor, and seven of the letters are mangled and you can't read
it, we're not going to count that.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't necessarily have to win a championship to win in the
Sponsors' Report.
</P>
<P>
   When last year's tabulations were complete, Mark Martin's
Valvoline-sponsored Ford led all sponsors in exposure. It was
captured on camera for 14 hours, 46 minutes, 10 seconds. Add in 270
sponsor mentions during telecasts, and Valvoline accumulated the
equivalent of $43,108,036 in air time.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 events this season, Martin's car was leading again with
$26,514,195 on six hours, 27 minutes and 35 seconds of air time. He
had 125 sponsor mentions.
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Jeff Gordon's DuPont Chevy was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valvoline has been the No. 1-ranking team sponsor over the
last five years,'' Wright said. ``They've got a really nice V logo;
you can see it all the way down the track.''

   Ingmar Bergman turns 80 Tuesday, and though the great filmmaker
has often talked of retiring, he continues to write and direct. At
present, he is reported to have written a new film for the Swedish
actress Lena Endre. Titled ``Troloesa'' and translated unofficially
as ``Faithless,'' it is described by Bergman as ``a passionate
drama, almost a thriller.'' The director will be Liv Ullmann, the
star of many Bergman films.

 &HT;    HBO &AMP; Co. reports 56% increase in earnings
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. continued its run of good financial results Monday,
announcing record second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares hit a 52-week high of $38.37 1/2 after the
announcement, but closed at $36.12 1/2, down $1.37 1/2 in Nasdaq
trading. The health-care software and services company's stock
typically climbs in the days preceding earnings announcements, then
falls off, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter profit rose 56 percent to $73.8 million, or 17
cents a share, from $47.4 million, or 11 cents per share. The First
Call consensus was 16 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. cited strong sales growth, as well as improved
margins, for the quarter's performance. The numbers exclude a
non-recurring credit of $3 million in the latest quarter, and a
non-recurring charge of 5 cents a share related to an acquisition
in the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter revenue was also a record, increasing 29 percent
to $376.7 million vs. $291.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a good solid quarter, pretty strong across the
board,'' said analyst Stephen Fitzgibbons of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, who
had a 16 cents estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The company leads the health care information technology sector
in revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co.' customers include 2,800 hospitals, 5,000 physician
practices, 600 insurers and 700 home care agencies. Software sales
increased during the quarter in each sector, and service revenue
climbed as well, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the quarter, HBO &AMP; Co. had almost $500 million in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Brown, director of investor relations, would not comment
on possible acquisitions. ``There's always a variety of things
we're looking at,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, income was $138.7 million, or 32 cents per
share, vs. $85.8 million, 20 cents, in the year-ago period. Revenue
rose to $719.5 million from $554.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Charles Trafton of Adams Harkness predicted the company
would surpass $1.5 billion in revenue this year.

A JAPANESE TV SHOW THAT PAIRS BEAUTY AND PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese television is known around the world for its
outrageous, sadistic antics. There are game shows in which men
compete to see who can keep from going to the bathroom the longest
and in which women play games of Ping-Pong and the loser must
strip. Now, thanks to the hit weekend television comedy show
``Super Jockey,'' one more popular culture apparition can be added
to the list. And it comes not from a desire to see beautiful,
scantily clad women or to see men in pain, but to see beautiful,
scantily clad women in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Jockey'' is a comedy program disguised as a game show in
which Japanese celebrities are pitted against one another in
contests involving feats like eating disgusting flavors of ice
cream and playing charades, with bad hints punishable by electric
shocks. But somewhere along the line, the makers of the show
decided to give sponsors who couldn't afford air time another
option.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying for commercials, they could earn a spot by
bringing bikini-clad women (usually themselves or employees) onto
the program to be dunked into scaldingly hot water. The longer the
woman can stay in the water, the longer she is allowed to deliver a
commercial. Most women last three or four seconds in the heat,
after which they rub ice over themselves or jump up and down in
pain as the camera focuses on their reddened breasts and legs. Once
they have cooled off, they can advertise whatever product they want
for exactly the amount of time they were able to stay in the water.
</P>
<P>
   An added twist is that one host of ``Super Jockey'' is an
internationally known movie director, Takeshi Kitano, who has been
described by American critics as the decade's most important
Japanese filmmaker. Last year, he won the top prize at the Venice
International Film Festival for his movie ``Hana-Bi''
(``Fireworks''). Many Japanese believe that the more seriously
Kitano (or Beat Takeshi, as he is known in his stand-up comic
guise) is taken in the film world, the more outrageous he feels he
needs to become on television in order to prove that he hasn't
become stuck up.
</P>
<P>
   Like posed White House shots of President Clinton jogging and
frolicking on the beach, Kitano's antics are an effort to prove
that despite all his recognition, acclaim and responsibility, he
isn't any less of an average guy. The difference is that in
Kitano's world, there appears to be nothing the average guy loves
more than seeing beauty, and then seeing beauty humiliated or
destroyed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A simple explanation of such mass-entertainment misogyny is to
look at it as a need for men to overcome their feelings of
inadequacy around powerful women, especially considering the old
Japanese woodblocks and prints in which female sexuality is
depicted as threatening, demonic and life-destroying. As Ian Buruma
writes in his book on Japanese culture, ``Behind the Mask,'' the
``violent entertainment and grotesque erotica are still important
outlets in what continues to be an oppressive social system.''
While this offers a partial explanation for ``Super Jockey,'' the
culture's relationship to beauty is also more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Japanese are not particularly keen to claim Yukio
Mishima as a spokesman for their heritage, he may have described
the attitude best in ``Runaway Horses.'' In the novel, the main
character, Isao, wants nothing more than to commit suicide at the
pinnacle of his youth, beauty and purity _ ``to die atop a cliff
swept by a breeze fresh with the scent of pine overlooking a sea
bright in the morning sun.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mishima writes of a desire to destroy or subvert
beauty at its height, thus strengthening its appeal and preventing
its slow decay. It is not just a coincidence that this is to be
done in front of water. Water is a constant character in Kitano's
films, representing death and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals are drowned by being held under water, and characters
whose lives have hit dead ends ritually make pilgrimages to the
ocean. As an element of pain in ``Super Jockey,'' hot water is an
ingenuous choice. It is pure and clear, enabling the audience to
see through the glass tank the destructive chemistry that occurs
when two beautiful and innocent forces, flesh and water, combine.
And though ``Super Jockey'' may seem to have nothing to do with
Kitano's films, both are hinged on a mutually dependent balance of
comedy and violence, albeit in different proportions.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between ``Super Jockey'' and Kitano's movies is
that in the films violence is sudden. It appears in a blinding and
irreversible flash, as it did in Kitano's life four years ago when
his face was disfigured in a motorcycle accident.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Super Jockey,'' however, violence is an eagerly anticipated
ritual, like a meal. The women, in fact, look as if they are being
cooked in the water, since during each show men stand behind the
tank, ladling hot water over the women's breasts as if they were
chickens in a pot. Making this sadomasochistic entertainment even
more disturbing is the habit Japanese women have of smiling and
laughing when they are embarrassed or humiliated, letting the
audience indulge in the fantasy that the women have reached Isao's
goal in ``Runaway Horses'': ``the peak of sensitivity where the
scarlet and white threads of ultimate pain and ultimate joy are
woven together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the feminist outrage such a show would cause in the
United States, it is nothing too out of the ordinary in Japan. The
facet of Japanese culture that has probably most interested,
confused and frustrated Westerners is the sharp demarcation between
public life, where strict rules of formality and conduct apply, and
private life, where anything goes so long as it doesn't carry over
into the public life.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its content, ``Super Jockey'' belongs in the realm
of private life. Though television programs are of course on view
for the public, they, like theater, aren't real, and thus don't
rupture the delicate fabric of conformity and respect holding the
society together. Therefore, on shows like ``Super Jockey,''
breaking taboos isn't transgression. It's comedy.

UNITED STATES URGES JAPAN TO STICK WITH ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Monday it hoped the
resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto would not
derail an overhaul of that country's economy, which experts say is
needed to shield the United States from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to the United States that the new
government, whatever its composition, move quickly to implement
concrete fiscal and banking measures to achieve strong domestic
demand-led growth in Japan and to restore confidence in Japan's
financial system,'' White House press secretary Michael McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they will see it in their own self-interest to pursue
economic reform quickly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There is general agreement among economists that Japan must
deregulate its economy and, in particular, overhaul its banking
industry or risk an economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Japan doesn't get fixed, the Asian financial crisis has a
very good chance of going worldwide, and, then, the United States
won't be able to escape without serious harm,'' said Clyde V.
Prestowitz Jr., senior fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute, a
Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto announced his resignation Monday after his Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) suffered a stunning defeat in Sunday's
parliamentary elections. The prime minister also said he was
canceling a scheduled meeting with Clinton on July 22 in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral drubbing was unexpected. The LDP retained only 44
seats of the 61 it was defending in the upper house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Because the upper house has little real power, Sunday's
elections were in large part symbolic. However, the results are
seen as a sign that the Japanese people want change.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto will remain in office until his party chooses a
successor later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP, which has dominated Japanese politics for 50 years,
still holds a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament,
which controls government policies, including banking and financial
reforms, and chooses the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said U.S. officials would work with Tokyo to schedule a
visit by Hashimoto's successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a close and enduring relationship with
Japan, and the change in leadership does not alter the strong
nature of the relationship or the strong sense of a personal
connection of our two peoples,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is dominated by a handful of massive corporate
conglomerates, each tending to include a major bank. Because of the
strong ties between the bank and the other companies within the
conglomerate, loans often are made on the basis of personal and
professional relationships rather than the merit of applicant.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a massive number of bad loans, leaving some
financial institutions near bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Prestowitz said Sunday's vote showed the depth of Japanese anger
over the government's current economic course and their fear that
stagnation will not soon fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese people want change, but they haven't really
rallied around any one plan for that change,'' Prestowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy has declined for two consecutive quarters _
the definition of a recession _ and despite a large government
stimulus package announced in April, consumer and business
confidence remain low.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Hashimoto announced a plan to stabilize the
banking system. But there were doubts about whether the prime
minister would fully implement the plan in the face of political
pressure from big banks, which are major donors to the LDP.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Alexander, president of the Japan Economic Institute, a
Washington-based economic think tank, said the LDP should take the
election as a mandate to speed up their push to deregulate the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese people are willing to accept a stronger,
harder-line reform package than what the government has been
doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said Hashimoto, who took office in January 1996 vowing
to overhaul the economy, was defeated because he failed to carry
through with his promises to change the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Hashimoto's election as a reformer and now his defeat for
failing to reform enough, the country is showing that it wants
faster economic change,'' he said.
</P>

</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Cohen, a professor at American University's School
of International Service, said the United States should not expect
any major changes from the Japanese soon.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Japanese culture discourages quick actions,
preferring, instead, for the country to reach a consensus before
moving in one direction. While the elections may cause the pace of
reforms to increase slightly, he said, the changes will still take
many years longer than they would in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are not Americans, and we shouldn't expect them
to act like we would,'' he said.

`JAYSON': ROUTINE SHOW WITH UNMEMORABLE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wine and wit are delicate travelers. And what makes
one or the other savory in one setting is easily lost in the
transition to another.
</P>
<P>
   So it is, for the most part, with ``Jayson,'' the syndicated gay
comic strip that has been turned into a musical comedy at the 45th
Street Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in small doses on the printed page, the tart, keenly
observed humor of its author, Jeff Krell, is amusing. But in its
longer form, on the stage, ``Jayson'' becomes just another routine
sitcom, accompanied by some unmemorable music.
</P>
<P>
   The show, directed by Jay Michaels from a book by Krell, with
music and lyrics by Ron Romanovsky and Paul Phillips, isn't dull.
But its plot _ a ``boy meets hunk, boy wins hunk, boy loses hunk''
romance about true friendship and true love and personal honesty
and parental acceptance of gay children _ covers ground that has
been visited before and more tellingly. And pivotal moments _ the
gay Jayson's decision to marry his female roommate, Arena Stage,
for money and his well-built lover, Eduardo's, decision to drop
Jayson and medical school in favor of a Hollywood career _ seem
more arbitrary and out of character on the stage than on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McNicholas contributes a set of Sunday comic strip
colorfulness, bathed in never-a-rainy-day brightness by Roger
Formosa, and Julia N. Van Vliet's costumes are a knowing complement
to character.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing the show in a display of queenly bitchiness, flamboyant
male and female attire and withering commentary is Craig Dawson as
Robyn Ricketts, a producer of gay porn films like ``Locker Room
Lust.'' Robyn energizes ``Jayson'' at every opportunity, from the
moment he turns up shortly after the action begins.
</P>
<P>
   Boyish, decent and unassuming as portrayed by Brian Cooper,
Jayson Callowhill, yearning for a career in advertising and true
love, is a recent college graduate, newly arrived in New York from
the confines of Farmville, Pa. In short order he finds himself with
a roommate in the form of his old college pal, the sometimes shrill
Arena Stage (Susan Agin), a dentist's daughter from Long Island,
and a neighbor in the form of Robyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jayson'' proceeds to have its fun with conflict between Arena
and Robyn Ricketts, the arrival of the appealing Eduardo (Mark
Haen) and the appearance of Jayson's ``American Gothic'' parents
and Arena's Jewish parents. Kenny Morris contributes a gallery of
comic characters in roles ranging from both fathers to a rabbi and
one of Jayson's bosses, and Jane Smulyan has a high time as both
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But transferring ``Jayson'' from page to stage doesn't really
improve the content.
</P>

IMF-LED BAILOUT PACKAGE FOR RUSSIA ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a dramatic show of support for the Kremlin's efforts
to avert financial collapse, the International Monetary Fund and
other lenders announced Monday a $22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia's beleaguered economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other Western leaders praised the whopping
bailout, larger than the $10 billion to $15 billion Russia had
previously requested, as a vote of international confidence in
Russia's ability to put its fiscal affairs in order.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vowed, and failed, to do this in return for aid many
times before. But Monday's loan could also be seen as a sign of the
West's concern over what economic meltdown could mean in a
politically unstable nuclear superpower, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The new cash, $6 billion of which could be available early next
week, will give President Boris Yeltsin's embattled administration
badly needed breathing room by allowing it to meet short-term debt
service obligations and protect the ruble from a politically
dangerous devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, should restore some investor faith in Russia's
stock market, which has lost 60 percent of its value since the
beginning of the year. Monday, Russia's leading index rose nearly
10 percent at the news of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue package brought little good news to a nation that
has heard promises of better times to come for years, but has yet
to feel positive effects of market reforms. If anything, the tough
conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank for receipt of the
new credits augured even harder times in the short run for millions
of increasingly disgruntled workers who go months without
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western officials Monday hailed the agreement as a
sign of faith that the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko had the right recipe for fixing what ails Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions taken today signify a restoration of faith in
Russia's ability to overcome its difficulties,'' Russia's lead
negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, told a news conference after emerging
from three days of talks with officials of the IMF and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is spread over this year and next, calls
for the IMF to provide $11.6 billion, for the World Bank to add $4
billion and for Japan to give $1.5 billion in a World
Bank-sponsored program _ for a total of $17.1 billion. That, added
to $5.5 billion Russia will receive under existing loan
arrangements with all three, totals $22.6 billion, Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis was ignited by outside factors, such as the
Asian economic collapse and low oil prices, but has been fanned by
a host of domestic woes, such as chronically poor tax collection,
corruption and misuse of funds at all levels, and the slow pace of
restructuring of Russian industry.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Russia has built up a mountain of short-term
debt that it must repay at interest rates as high as 150 percent.
Government officials say about 33 percent of total budget spending
goes toward debt service. Chubais Monday announced a plan to reduce
Russia's short-term domestic debt burden by replacing short-term
government securities with longer-term debt that would be
denominated in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question Russia now faces is whether it can
implement badly needed reforms in the grace period the bailout has
created. In the past, Russia has promised to improve taxation, cut
spending, and restructure inefficient industry in return for IMF
and World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   But those promises have faded, largely thanks to Yeltsin, who
tends to distance himself from unpopular but necessary measures,
which in turn reduces the chances that they will be enforced. For
example, promises to cut spending and improve tax collection went
right out the window in the presidential election year of 1996,
when Yeltsin needed to be able to offer tax breaks and increased
social benefits to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the government's austerity plan will
withstand growing social unrest. IMF official John Odling-Smee said
Moscow had vowed to cut its budget deficit to 5.6 percent of gross
domestic product this year and to 2.8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If the government fulfills the austerity program to the letter,
in the short run things will get even harder for unpaid miners and
state employees, some of whom are camped out in protest at
government headquarters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The debt crisis produces stories that would be almost funny if
it were not for the looming danger they signal. Soldiers' laundry
is held up by cleaners who have not been paid; soldiers are fed dog
food instead of beef stew.
</P>
<P>
   The first test for the austerity program will come at the end of
the week, when the State Duma, the lower house of parliament
dominated by opposition parties, debates the tough new spending
cuts and tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not do something radical, this money will quickly run
out and we will have to borrow again,'' said Alexander Zhukov,
chairman of the Duma's Tax and Finance committee. But Zhukov will
likely be in the minority of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's board, which must formally approve the agreement at a
meeting scheduled for July 20 in Washington, will be watching. So
will Yeltsin, who has sounded an increasingly shrill note of late,
hinting at an extremist plot to unseat him, and warning he would
implement tough measures by decree if the Duma fails to pass them.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiriyenko's program faces an even more fundamental problem.
It is easy to talk about collecting taxes. But in Russia's economy,
most transactions are done by barter, not money. How does the
government collect on this?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wage arrears are not caused by a lack of money, but
by the fact that directors of large enterprises are able to get
away with not paying their workers. What is needed, observers say,
is political resolve not economic bailouts. But that, too, has been
lacking over the years, said Andrei Piontkowski, a Moscow-based
analyst on Russian politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as they always do, most of the new money will end
up stolen, while nothing in the country will change,'' Piontkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians would appear to agree. A recent poll showed that
61 percent of Russians are convinced the Kiriyenko government
cannot solve the country's problems. That attitude put a cloud over
the news of Monday's bailout package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for Russia because it definitely puts off
anything like the meltdown we were facing for six months or maybe a
year,'' said Gleb Shestavkov of Global Fund Management in Moscow.
``But it doesn't really solve the problem in the long run.''

have strong populations of wild brown, rainbow and brook trout, and
bi-weekly plants of catchable trout are made by the Department of
Fish and Game to ensure the fishery remains healthy. However, if
you come to the Eastern Sierra for solace and a pristine mountain

HASHIMOTO RESIGNATION DRIVES BOND SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treasury securities suffered their worst one-day losses in more
than a month Monday on suggestions that Japan and Russia would
overcome their economic crises, which diminished the allure of U.S.
bonds as a safe-haven investment.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year bond's price fell 31/32, or nearly $10 for
each $1,000 in the face amount, to 106 7/32. Its yield, which rises
when the price falls, increased to 5.69 percent from 5.62 percent
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The main force behind the bond selloff was the resignation of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan, after weekend elections
that reduced his party's power and showed widespread
dissatisfaction with his Cabinet's handling of the country's
deepening economic problems. The drop in U.S. bond prices came on
speculation that the new Japanese prime minister, as yet to be
designated, might speed up tax cuts and other measures to stimulate
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil in Asia has been a major reason why U.S.
bonds have rallied in recent months, sending the yield on the long
bond as low as 5.56 percent last week, the lowest level since the
Treasury began regular sales of these securities in 1977. Buyers
have been acting on the belief that Asia's problems will hurt the
U.S. economy, keeping inflation and interest rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also weakened Monday on news of an agreement on new
international aid to Russia to help it avoid default. Russia's
worsening economic problems had also been an important force
driving up U.S. Treasury bond prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, bond traders should get more data on the possibility
of American inflation when the consumer price index for June is
released along with the report on June retail sales. Most
economists are expecting a gain of two-tenths of a percentage
point, both in the overall inflation index and in so-called ``core
inflation,'' which excludes food and energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's bond market weakness, the weekly Treasury
auction of new three- and six-month bills met with strong demand.
Three-month bills were priced to yield an average rate of 4.98
percent, up from 4.96 percent a week ago, while the six-month bill
was priced to yield an average rate of 5.025 percent, up from 5.010
percent last week.

IMF-LED BAILOUT PACKAGE FOR RUSSIA ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a dramatic show of support for the Kremlin's efforts
to avert financial collapse, the International Monetary Fund and
other lenders announced Monday a $22.6 billion rescue package for
Russia's beleaguered economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other Western leaders praised the whopping
bailout, larger than the $10 billion to $15 billion Russia had
previously requested, as a vote of international confidence in
Russia's ability to put its fiscal affairs in order.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vowed, and failed, to do this in return for aid many
times before. But Monday's loan could also be seen as a sign of the
West's concern over what economic meltdown could mean in a
politically unstable nuclear superpower, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The new cash, $6 billion of which could be available early next
week, will give President Boris Yeltsin's embattled administration
badly needed breathing room by allowing it to meet short-term debt
service obligations and protect the ruble from a politically
dangerous devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, should restore some investor faith in Russia's
stock market, which has lost 60 percent of its value since the
beginning of the year. Monday, Russia's leading index rose nearly
10 percent at the news of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue package brought little good news to a nation that
has heard promises of better times to come for years, but has yet
to feel positive effects of market reforms. If anything, the tough
conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank for receipt of the
new credits augured even harder times in the short run for millions
of increasingly disgruntled workers who go months without
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western officials Monday hailed the agreement as a
sign of faith that the government of Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko had the right recipe for fixing what ails Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions taken today signify a restoration of faith in
Russia's ability to overcome its difficulties,'' Russia's lead
negotiator, Anatoly Chubais, told a news conference after emerging
from three days of talks with officials of the IMF and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is spread over this year and next, calls
for the IMF to provide $11.6 billion, for the World Bank to add $4
billion and for Japan to give $1.5 billion in a World
Bank-sponsored program _ for a total of $17.1 billion. That, added
to $5.5 billion Russia will receive under existing loan
arrangements with all three, totals $22.6 billion, Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's crisis was ignited by outside factors, such as the
Asian economic collapse and low oil prices, but has been fanned by
a host of domestic woes, such as chronically poor tax collection,
corruption and misuse of funds at all levels, and the slow pace of
restructuring of Russian industry.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, Russia has built up a mountain of short-term
debt that it must repay at interest rates as high as 150 percent.
Government officials say about 33 percent of total budget spending
goes toward debt service. Chubais Monday announced a plan to reduce
Russia's short-term domestic debt burden by replacing short-term
government securities with longer-term debt that would be
denominated in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The critical question Russia now faces is whether it can
implement badly needed reforms in the grace period the bailout has
created. In the past, Russia has promised to improve taxation, cut
spending, and restructure inefficient industry in return for IMF
and World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   But those promises have faded, largely thanks to Yeltsin, who
tends to distance himself from unpopular but necessary measures,
which in turn reduces the chances that they will be enforced. For
example, promises to cut spending and improve tax collection went
right out the window in the presidential election year of 1996,
when Yeltsin needed to be able to offer tax breaks and increased
social benefits to woo voters.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the government's austerity plan will
withstand growing social unrest. IMF official John Odling-Smee said
Moscow had vowed to cut its budget deficit to 5.6 percent of gross
domestic product this year and to 2.8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If the government fulfills the austerity program to the letter,
in the short run things will get even harder for unpaid miners and
state employees, some of whom are camped out in protest at
government headquarters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The debt crisis produces stories that would be almost funny if
it were not for the looming danger they signal. Soldiers' laundry
is held up by cleaners who have not been paid; soldiers are fed dog
food instead of beef stew.
</P>
<P>
   The first test for the austerity program will come at the end of
the week, when the State Duma, the lower house of parliament
dominated by opposition parties, debates the tough new spending
cuts and tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not do something radical, this money will quickly run
out and we will have to borrow again,'' said Alexander Zhukov,
chairman of the Duma's Tax and Finance committee. But Zhukov will
likely be in the minority of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's board, which must formally approve the agreement at a
meeting scheduled for July 20 in Washington, will be watching. So
will Yeltsin, who has sounded an increasingly shrill note of late,
hinting at an extremist plot to unseat him, and warning he would
implement tough measures by decree if the Duma fails to pass them.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiriyenko's program faces an even more fundamental problem.
It is easy to talk about collecting taxes. But in Russia's economy,
most transactions are done by barter, not money. How does the
government collect on this?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wage arrears are not caused by a lack of money, but
by the fact that directors of large enterprises are able to get
away with not paying their workers. What is needed, observers say,
is political resolve not economic bailouts. But that, too, has been
lacking over the years, said Andrei Piontkowski, a Moscow-based
analyst on Russian politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as they always do, most of the new money will end
up stolen, while nothing in the country will change,'' Piontkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians would appear to agree. A recent poll showed that
61 percent of Russians are convinced the Kiriyenko government
cannot solve the country's problems. That attitude put a cloud over
the news of Monday's bailout package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news for Russia because it definitely puts off
anything like the meltdown we were facing for six months or maybe a
year,'' said Gleb Shestavkov of Global Fund Management in Moscow.
``But it doesn't really solve the problem in the long run.''

THE REBIRTH OF A WRITER MURDERED IN POLAND
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the sort of twist he might have found
paradoxically engaging, fate has finally turned kind to Bruno
Schulz decades after a Gestapo officer shot and killed him in 1942
as he crossed a street in Drogobych, the provincial Polish hometown
he hated but could never leave.
</P>
<P>
   The two short books of shimmering mythologized reminiscence that
this shy and often depressed high school art and shop teacher wrote
in the 1930s have by now been translated into many languages. With
every year their author is acquiring more and more distinguished
devotees eager to honor his work and spread his fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the second of those books, ``The Street of Crocodiles,''
has been turned into a theatrical piece that opens Thursday at the
John Jay College Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival
'98.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we come to do it?'' asked Simon McBurney, the founder
and director of Theatre de Complicite, the innovative troupe that
despite its French name is based in England. ``Well, in 1990 a
Polish-born director, Helena Kaut-Howson, introduced me to Schulz's
two books saying that they were strange and extraordinary stories
and that she thought they might have something to do with the
theater but she didn't know how to make use of them.'' Speaking
from London, McBurney said he had read the books ``and found them
neither strange nor out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately recognized Schulz's world as the place of
childhood and his recognition of the openness of a child's
imagination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McBurney, whose own childhood was spent in Cambridge as the son
of an academic, said the writing was ``a little like Proust, like
the images of Marc Chagall, like Dylan Thomas when he makes you
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect is, as Schulz himself wrote, `to mature into
childhood,' '' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Schulz stories, originally written in Polish, lack a
conventional narrative, so McBurney, whose experimental theater
relies on very physical and highly choreographed movements, merged
elements from Schulz's melancholy life with images drawn from his
poetic prose. These gave willful force to images like store
dummies, coagulating clouds, the curve of a servant girl's leg, the
oppressive miasma of small-town boredom.
</P>
<P>
   The production was last performed at the Young Vic in London in
1994, and McBurney decided to revive it when his company was
invited to this year's Lincoln Center Festival. ``New York is the
only place I wanted to revive it since there are probably more
people there who admire his work than anywhere else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's work has been gaining respect all over the world since
the war, but New York writers have been among the most effective of
his champions. Philip Roth published Schulz's two books of poetic,
nostalgic prose as part of his Penguin series, ``Writers From the
Other Europe.'' John Updike has written several admiring critical
essays about Schulz and has called him ``one of the great writers,
one of the great transmogrifiers of the world into words.'' Cynthia
Ozick has attributed to Schulz ``one of the most original
imaginations in modern Europe'' and made the writer a central
presence in her novel ``The Messiah of Stockholm.'' In 1988 Jerzy
Kosinski held a Town Hall evening to honor the writer, announcing a
$10,000 prize in Schulz's name, to be given to writers who are
insufficiently well known. Elizabeth Hardwick and Susan Sontag
offered praise. Shortly before his death, Isaac Bashevis Singer
said of Schulz, ``He wrote sometimes like Kafka, sometimes like
Proust and at times succeeded in reaching depths that neither had
reached.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Europe, Danilo Kis, the Yugoslav novelist, had written,
``Schulz is my God,'' and Jerzy Ficowski, a Polish writer, spent
four years searching for drawings, letters and written fragments
that Schulz left behind. Neither Ficowski nor anyone else has yet
been able to find the manuscript of a large novel called ``The
Messiah'' that Schulz had placed in the countryside for safekeeping
before he and the other Jews of Drogobych were herded into the
city's ghetto by the occupying Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But among the cult of Schulz enthusiasts no one has welcomed his
growing reputation with more delight than an 80-year-old retired
piano teacher named Renato Laufer who lives in Inwood, Manhattan.
Her feelings are deeply personal since Schulz had been her drawing
teacher when she was the teen-age daughter of well-to-do parents in
Drogobycz, a city now in Ukraine that grew rich when nearby oil
deposits were discovered early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 15 or 16 years old,'' said Mrs. Laufer. ``My parents
thought that I had some talent in sketching and so every Sunday I
would go with my girlfriend and we would draw for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was already famous in Poland,'' she said. ``He had
published the first book, `The Sanatorium Under the Sign of the
Hourglass.' He had sent it to a famous woman writer, and she had
gotten it published and it was a sensation. It was read on the
radio, but he lived with two aunts and taught at the boys' high
school and could not leave Drogobycz. But for my girlfriend and I
he was very strange. He seemed so somber. He always wore a flannel
jacket and a scarf around his neck. He was afraid of colds and
worried about his lungs. We would tease him and laugh at him behind
his back. From some of his drawings you can see he was a foot
fetishist, and once I caught him secretly sketching my friend's
legs; she had very lovely legs. Later I read everything he wrote
and everything about him. I realized he was so far ahead of his
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In her apartment Mrs. Laufer keeps a portrait of her old teacher
not far from a sketch of Chopin.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered how she heard about Schulz's death while she was
in hiding. It was a day that the people came to call Black
Thursday, when another group of Jews hiding beyond the ghetto had
been discovered and one of them, a young man, fired at and wounded
a German. Reprisals were ordered. At the time Schulz, who had been
commissioned to paint frescoes in the house of a Gestapo officer,
had been given a pass by his patron and was walking in the town. He
was spotted by a Nazi storm trooper who had argued with the man for
whom Schulz was working. He stepped up to the writer and shot him.
``The way we heard the story,'' said Mrs. Laufer, who later
survived the war in the forests of southeastern Poland, ``the man
who shot him went to the man for whom he was painting and said, `I
have just killed your Jew.'''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A SINGING VOICE ON THE SEXUAL FRINGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grumblings go on about how we are living through a drought of
great singers. Recordings from two or three generations back are
forever being cited as evidence, though we ought to wonder whether
their simple existence does not half-prove the case. In no other
time have great dead performers lived on to challenge the living,
providing competition that is unfair in two ways. The old singers
are taken to set the standard and do not allow the art of singing
to change. Also, what may have been their very finest performances,
captured on record, become the measure for what happens on any
particular night at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever may be the rival claims of a recorded Rosa Ponselle and
a live Renee Fleming, there are kinds of singing in which the
present age has not been matched for a very long time. You probably
have to go back 800 years to find someone who was singing
troubadour songs with as much distinction and passion as Paul
Hillier, or 500 to find choirs as capable as the Clerks' Group or
the Tallis Scholars in the music of Ockeghem. But what is most
striking by far, and a glory of contemporary musical life, is the
abundance of outstanding countertenors.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the recent upsurge are clear. They include the
presence of inspiring models, from Alfred Deller through James
Bowman to David Daniels. But they also include the demand created
by the early-music revival for people to sing not only music
written for the countertenor voice but also the enormous repertory
of castrato roles in baroque opera. For these roles, countertenors
provide the best substitute for the castratos, because like them
they contradict customary specifications of the male. The
countertenor voice, utterly male in timbre but usurping female
territory in range, is hermaphroditic. And this sexual ambiguity
speaks loudly for the countertenor's modern desirability.
</P>
<P>
   At the Glyndebourne festival in England this summer, the triumph
of the countertenor is being acted out twice a week, for the
countertenor Andreas Scholl is making his operatic debut in
Handel's ``Rodelinda'' there, and he outshines everyone onstage.
The calm beauty of his singing in Jean-Marie Villegier's tenebrous
Fascist-period staging, suggests the moon: This is singing that
glows.
</P>
<P>
   Handel wrote the part of Bertarido in ``Rodelinda'' for his star
castrato, Senesino, and his librettist, Nicola Francesco Haym,
provided opportunities for a character who would express himself in
tones at once ardent and plaintive. Bertarido is a king who has
been exiled and separated from his wife and son. Having returned to
his former kingdom, he spends most of the first two acts in
disguise, and most of the third, once his identity has been
discovered, in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Disguise and prison: In both situations the hero is bereft. All
that remain are his emotions and hopes. He is often alone, and
though Handelian opera is everywhere an art of soliloquies,
Bertarido, in this piece, is the greatest soliloquist of them all,
delivering laments and love songs.
</P>
<P>
   Scholl's performance of them is gorgeous. His tone is pure and
perfectly made, yet at the same time highly expressive; his voice
moves with ease through the stately slow movements that are
Bertarido's forte, and with only a little less ease through the
much more ebullient aria in the second act. Sometimes his control
is breathtaking. On one long note he executes a steady loudening
and then softening, as if his voice were an instrument he was
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the countertenor voice, which is no more unnatural than
any other operatic type but which has its own particular
artificiality, more easily suggests this kind of separateness from
the performer. At the Glyndebourne ``Rodelinda,'' it is as though
Scholl has a special advantage, shared only with another fine
countertenor, Artur Stefanowicz, in the role of Unulfo, Bertarido's
loyal follower and confidant. Paradoxically, the strange vocal
world in which they operate offers the most stable ground for
viewing the action. It is the rest of the characters, with their
more usual voices, who sound as if they are making pretenses, or as
if they are being perverse in staying outside the luminous sphere
around Scholl and Stefanowicz.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fine a singer as Kurt Streit, in the role of the tyrant
Grimoaldo, sounds tied by being only a tenor. He, his baritone
henchman (Umberto Chiummo) and two women (Anna Caterina Antonacci
and Louise Winter) circle the stage as if mystified, recognizing
the power that Scholl wields, but not knowing where it comes from.
</P>
<P>
   William Christie, conducting the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment, knows. His partnership with Scholl, and with the
other singers, is very fine: He makes the orchestra wait on them,
and phrase with them. He and Scholl also keep the long evening
floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodelinda'' is one of those Handel operas that remain in a
state of permanent arousal, until a rapid denouement comes as a
merely mechanical necessity. This is opera mirroring the myth, at
least, of the castrato's sexual potency. You are to wish the night
would never end, and here you do.

CAMPAIGNING FOR OSCAR NIXED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; What's good for beauty contestants and
school-board candidates is apparently good for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In what's being described as ``an effort to maintain a high
degree of fairness and dignity'' in the Academy Awards process, the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is requiring filmmakers
to stop unfair and overly aggressive ``campaigning'' to win Oscar
nominations and awards.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executive administrator Ric Robertson said in a
statement that the guidelines are similar to last year's and are
primarily designed to clarify existing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In the new guidelines, set forth in a July 9 letter to film
marketers, the Academy's board of governors orders a ban on
``letters of any kind that extol the merits of a film or an
achievement,'' letters to Academy members that contain critics'
blurbs, and the inclusion of photographs or ``extraneous''
advertising copy in printed screening schedules for eligible films.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also put restrictions on the packaging and
submission of videocassettes of eligible films, recordings and
sheet music, and on descriptions of submitted screenplays. One
specific change from last year is that the mailing of video
excerpts from eligible films in order to spotlight particular songs
or musical scores is now prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also forbid telephone solicitations of voting
members and ``receptions, dinners or other events to which Academy
members are invited and which are connected to the promotion of a
film or achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter warns that companies guilty of infractions may lose
their allotment of tickets to the awards presentation. More serious
violations involving the solicitation of votes may result in a film
losing its eligibility for awards consideration. &UR;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ America is a nation of poets; New York is a city of
poets. But it often seems that only poets themselves are aware of
the fact. Audiences for their work are small, financial rewards
meager, opportunities to appear in prominent public forums few.
</P>
<P>
   This situation seems to be changing. Competitive poetry readings
known as slams have gained an ardent following, and the National
Slam, a four-day world championship of poetry, will kick off on
Aug. 18 in Austin, Texas.; a 1998 documentary titled ``Slam
Nation'' will open at Film Forum on Friday; literary bands are
flourishing in rock clubs, and poetry has blossomed on the
Internet, a medium that eliminates the customary publication
hierarchies and gives everyone a say.
</P>
<P>
   But writing poetry as a full-time pursuit, as the thing you do,
is still a pioneer's art. There are no shortcuts, no guarantees;
resilience and self-reliance are crucial career qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   This has always been true. More than a century ago, Walt Whitman
paid a Brooklyn print shop to run off the first edition of his
too-hot-to-handle ``Leaves of Grass'' and distributed and promoted
the book himself. Emily Dickinson stitched her handwritten poems
into little packets _ each, in effect, a self-published book _ to
store away in her New England bedroom for future eyes to find.
</P>
<P>
   Self-publishing enjoyed a real florescence in our own century.
Beginning in the 1950s and early '60s, a new poetry outside the
academic mainstream was on the rise. It was encouraged by advances
in duplicating technology _ mimeographing, offset printing,
photocopying _ that made it possible for writers to produce
magazines and books cheaply and virtually overnight while having
control over contents and circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in
Writing, 1960-1980,'' at the main branch of the New York Public
Library at Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street through July 25, documents
this rich, four-decade-long indie phenomenon in American
literature, often called the ``mimeograph revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Rodney Phillips and Steven Clay and drawn mostly
from the library's collection, the show encompasses some 400
publications, from quick-and-dirty pamphlets to elegantly designed
books. (About half the material, in fact, isn't mimeographed.) Some
of the best known artists of the era contributed cover art.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the journals are still appearing; most are long gone.
And in a sense, it is their ephemerality and their underground
origins (the show's title is borrowed from the poet Edward Sanders'
account of producing a dissident magazine in his New York
apartment) that makes them historically important. As the show's
rows upon rows of vitrines reveal, these fragile publications were
not so much literary monuments as records of dynamic ideas and
personalities passing through a particular time and place.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States was in tamped-down Cold War mode in
the 1950s, countercultural energy was stirring. Experimental poetry
was an outlet for this ferment, and early on, the avant-garde
tended to separate into movements along lines of style, locale and
dominant personalities, all of which were defined by Donald Allen's
groundbreaking 1960 anthology, ``The New American Poetry,
1945-1960.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Olson and Robert Creeley, for example, presided over an
influential group of writers at Black Mountain College in North
Carolina. Robert Duncan was a central figure in a San Francisco
renaissance. The poet Frank O'Hara was the lodestar for a so-called
New York School. And Allen Ginsberg turned beat poetry into a
galvanic force from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   The work that resulted was wildly varied, but it staked out new
esthetic terrain. It brought popular culture, non-Western thought
and countercultural politics together in a language that mixed the
rhythms of common speech and the improvisatory flair of jazz. And
each group generated a multitude of journals and small press books,
often created by hand and on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first entries in the show suggests the flavor of much
of what follows. It is a smudgy, much-handled copy of a poem by
Ginsberg titled ``Siesta in Xbalba.'' Ginsberg wrote the piece in
Mexico in 1954 but published it himself two years later as a
12-page booklet that he mimeographed aboard a cargo ship in the
Bering Sea. He gave friends almost the entire edition, 52
hand-stapled copies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year earlier, the writer had made literary history when
he read his explosively anarchic ``Howl'' in San Francisco. (A
first edition of another of his beat anthems, ``Kaddish,''
published by City Lights Books, is one of the show's iconic
objects.) And around the same time, extraordinary things were
starting to brew in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything about the city, the poetry was wildly
pluralistic, though social circles and trends overlapped. The beat
presence was evident in magazines like Yugen, founded in 1958 by
the poet and playwright LeRoi Jones (who changed his name to Imamu
Amiri Baraka). A little later came the highly polished Art and
Literature, edited by John Ashbery and devoted to the work of the
New York School poets. And both groups appeared in the mimeographed
magazine Kulchur, which had both O'Hara and Baraka on its editorial
board.
</P>
<P>
   All these journals figure in the show, but the real focus falls
on publications associated with a second generation of New York
School poets who settled on the Lower East Side around 1960. At
that point mimeographed publications really began to proliferate.
Among the most adventurous of them was C: A Journal of Poetry,
founded by Ted Berrigan, who had come to New York from Tulsa,
Okla., along with the poet Ron Padgett and the artist Joe Brainard.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Berrigan had learned to use mimeograph machines in the Army
during the Korean War, and he turned C into an exceptional product.
Not only was it packed with some of the best writers around, but
also it was almost as engaging to look at as it was to read, thanks
both to Brainard, who is one of the visual heroes of the
exhibition, and to the range of artists whom Berrigan asked to
contribute work.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay of literature and art was a hallmark of the
period. Poets like Ashbery, Bill Berkson and Peter Schjeldahl were
also art critics. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, among others, routinely
published poetry (and has recently begun to do so again). Work by
painters like Philip Guston, Alex Katz, Brice Marden, and Andy
Warhol crop up on book and magazines covers throughout the show.
(Reva Wolf's 1997 book ``Andy Warhol, Poetry and Gossip in the
1960s'' gives a fascinating glimpse, by the way, into these
relationships.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also makes good use of other visual material _
snapshots, paintings, videos _ to evoke the tightly networked
social communities from which these publications emerged. The
Aquarian Age of psychedelic drugs, Vietnam and sexual liberation
was itself, of course, a binding force. But so were the
collaborative activities that any shoestring literary scene
generates: readings and meetings and workshops, all-night printing
and collating parties, the passing of fresh images from hand to
hand.
</P>
<P>
   By 1966, much of the action centered on the utopian institution
known as the Poetry Project, established that year at St.
Marks-in-the-Bowery Church in the East Village. Some gorgeous
publications _ notably Angel Hair, edited by Anne Waldman and Lewis
Warsh _ had their origins there. So did the Poetry Project
Newsletter, which was started by Ron Padgett in 1972 (a copy of the
first issue is on display) and remains an invaluable source of
information on poetry, both in New York and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The show also succeeds in giving a sense of the sheer variety of
fringe publications that appeared. Designs range from the
minimalist look of journals devoted to Concrete poetry and Language
writing edited by Aram Saroyan, Clark Coolidge, Ron Silliman,
Charles Bernstein and Bernadette Mayer, to the surrealist flair of
the cult magazine Semina, created by the West Coast assemblagist
Wallace Berman. (The magazine, which was distributed through the
mail, was never for sale; its proto-hippie motto was ``Art is love
is God.'')
</P>
<P>
   And for evidence that multiculturalism was firmly in place many
decades before the 1990s, one need look no further than journals
that bring issues of race and sexuality to the fore. Some, like
Umbra, focused on black American culture. Others, like Poems From
the Floating World, edited by Jerome Rothenberg, mixed Chinese,
Arabic and American Indian work. And gay voices found a place, from
collaborations between Robert Duncan and his lover, the collagist
Jess Collins in the 1950s, to the stylish New Wave Little Caesar,
edited by Dennis Cooper in Los Angeles in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and '80s, a third generation of New York
School poets emerged, and with it publications reflecting new
impulses and styles, including neo-punk rock. Some of the
magazines, like the short-lived but lively Dodgems, created by the
poet Eileen Myles, who has been called ``the last of the New York
School poets,'' were nonmimeo in format. And by the late '80s,
desktop publishing had rendered such old production modes all but
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the show draws to a close, just short of the advent
of computer technology, it has covered a huge amount of material
and inevitably things are left out.
</P>
<P>
   An important and still-vibrant Lower East Side institution like
the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which is based on oral poetry traditions,
is given scant mention. The same is true of the wide range of
theater and performance art that has always been an integral part
of the poetry world. (Such work is increasingly available on
homemade videos and audio tapes, yet another alternative publishing
medium for poetry.)
</P>
<P>
   Even with some omissions, the ground that has been covered is
vast. And it is great to know that the painstaking exercise in
historical research that the show represents will have an afterlife
in the form of a catalog to be published jointly by the library and
Granary Books in October.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no book or lineup of display cases can convey the
exhilarating charge of live poetry, hot off the press or spoken out
loud. And this raises again the question of the future of this
seemingly vulnerable, transitory art. Will it find new venues?
(Surely the still-forming gallery neighborhood in Chelsea is
tailor-made for reforging the link between art and poetry.) Or will
it be swamped and made ever smaller by a media-saturated
information age?
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Myles, who has lived and written in the East Village for
25 years, is encouraged. ``Poetry is always radical,'' she says.
``It's pure democracy. You can't limit it to a one-minute MTV slot.
You can't confine it to bytes. It's an art about time and about
expansiveness, the open road. Young people now in their 20s are
hungry for that. And we're in there with them.''

CRITIC'S CHOICE CD'S: BEACH BOYS AND GIRLS OF SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In summer, myriad pop-culture offerings surface to suit the free
and overheated mood. There are literary page turners for beach
reading and blockbusters augmenting the allure of moviehouse
air-conditioning. Pop's hot weather genres include surf music and
Miami bass, and hit songs that seem to have been born inside car
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, are whole albums singled out for the season. The
qualities that make CD's ideal for summer lazing _ an easygoing
mood that can drift into hothouse torpor; a focus that fades in and
out, like a daydream _ aren't usually applauded by critics, who
prefer a certain clarity. That leaves listeners to find their
favorites on their own. Here are a few suggestions, keyed to
particular summer scenes. Consider these albums beach reading for
the ears.
</P>
<P>
   For an Urban Beach
</P>
<P>
   Hipsters heading to Coney Island will want to equip themselves
with the Beastie Boys' ``Hello Nasty'' (Grand Royal/Capitol), the
latest from this eminent trio of cool hunters. Mixing old-school
hip-hop bragfests with nearly New Age meditations about living
mindfully in a busy world, ``Hello Nasty'' ranges widely enough to
please everybody on the boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhist-inspired philosophizing is paired with vintage
Europop, ambient electronics and sweet, wide-eyed neo-psychedelia
like that of the Beasties' pal, Sean Lennon. The beat-heavy rants,
accelerated by the frenetic record-scratcher D.J. Mixmaster Mike,
feature enough dazzling wordplay to make for many surfside games of
Guess the Reference. Attentive listeners will notice an unresolved
split between the group's attempts at egoless expression and the
consummately ego-driven boasts essential to its raps. But
barbecuing party people will just enjoy the flow.
</P>
<P>
   For a Nude Beach
</P>
<P>
   Like those brave enough to take it all off near the sea, the
second album by the rhythm-and-blues love man Maxwell, ``Embrya''
(Columbia), wears its sensuality proudly. Its rhythms coalesce into
a mellow groove that rarely shifts, causing each song to crash into
the next in a great oceanic wash. A little bit jazzy, a little bit
Caribbean and a little bit 1970's soul, the sound is mostly
soothing, the work of an expert seducer who knows it never pays to
push. It's the aural equivalent of lotion rubbed on one's back by
someone interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, the man behind the massage, never lets his croon get
too urgent as he mouths coy phrases like ``Maybe you're more than
just a one-night lady,'' and cosmic ones like ``You are me and we
are you.'' It's all very relaxing, but like so many idealized
bodies, the one Maxwell presents doesn't have a lot going on
inside. That doesn't mean he's not fun to spend an afternoon
sharing a towel with.
</P>
<P>
   For a Rocky Beach
</P>
<P>
   Dana and Karen Kletter included a song about the seaside on
``Dear Enemy'' (Rykodisc), their debut album, and undoubtedly they
were imagining one of their native Southern beaches. But this
delicate collection just as easily evokes a stony coast, where
surprises lurk in the tidepools. The sisters are twins, and their
vocals twine together in that eerie way open only to siblings as
they share intimate, sometimes surreal tales of domesticity and
solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating homespun piano parts, accompanied by friends from
the underground rock scenes around Richmond, the Kletters hit upon
a folkwise sound that would be traditional if it weren't so quietly
quirky. Their unusual style prompted Joe Boyd, the producer who
worked with the late, legendary folk rocker Nick Drake, to come out
of retirement and produce ``Dear Enemy.'' Meticulous and strange,
with flashes of mordant humor, it is a rustic journey for the mind.
</P>
<P>
   For a Vacationland Beach
</P>
<P>
   Straying from the minimalist country of the Scud Mountain Boys,
that group's singer and guitarist, Joe Pernice, enlisted his
brother, the guitarist Bob, and several friends for a lush journey
into orchestral pop with the Pernice Brothers' ``Overcome by
Happiness'' (Sub Pop).
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of Big Star's classic third album, ``Overcome'' taps
an all-American yearning that recalls neon-lighted fairgrounds and
lovers' cars parked at the edge of a Great Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the beauty, each song is haunted by bitterness, but its
fatalism is characteristic, too, of a land _ and a season _ in
which dreams can be won or dashed at a sideshow roulette wheel. Joe
Pernice exhibits a tendency to say one thing and sound like its
opposite, which also suits summer, when life's hard edges seem to
melt like the sad verses of his songs.

LIBRARY INTERNET CASE COULD BE FIRST AMENDMENT LITMUS TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is not exactly ``Star Wars,'' but an intense
battle in cyberspace is coming to a head in the fast-growing
suburbs of the nation's capital. It pits the American Civil
Liberties Union against conservative anti-pornography crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the decision by the public library board of Loudoun
County, Va., which voted 5-4 last October to install so-called
blocking software to deny public library patrons access to computer
Internet sites featuring ``child pornography,'' ``hardcore
pornography'' and ``material deemed harmful to juveniles'' under
Virginia law.
</P>
<P>
   Library users calling up such sites are met with a computer
screen declaring ``Violation! Violation! Violation! Access to this
site has been blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and a local group, Mainstream Loudoun, are suing the
library's trustees in federal court in suburban Alexandria, Va.
They charge that the policy violates library patrons' First
Amendment rights because the software, X-Stop, designed by Log-On
Data Corp. of Anaheim, Calif., blocks not only pornographic sites
that have no constitutional protection, but sites that do have such
protection, such as sites maintained by the Yale University Biology
Department and the San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A highly trained, professional librarian can make those
distinctions,'' said Ann Beeson, the lead ACLU lawyer in the case.
``Blocking software never could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Located northwest of Washington, Loudoun County is the scene of
exploding growth as bedroom communities spring up to replace the
small-town and rural-farming traditions that were the hallmarks of
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henderson, Loudoun County library director, said last
November his staff tested X-Stop after it was installed and found
it blocked 57 sites that had nothing to do with pornography,
including the home page for the pacifist Society of Friends, also
known as the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   The policy puts librarians ``in the position of being parents,
and it makes second-class citizens out of those not affluent enough
to have this technology in their home,'' he said. People who rely
on the library for the Internet ``have a different level of access,
and I'm not comfortable with that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a specialist tinkered with the software, it still
blocked the Zero Population Growth web site and the Mormon Church
page on preventing masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Black, a Virginia state legislator and library board member
who voted for the policy, said that right now, ``99.9 percent'' of
sites blocked by the software clearly are pornographic. ``And even
if the software blocked some sites that didn't need to be blocked,
the fact is there is no other solution,'' he said. ``We've had very
few complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bass, the lawyer for the board, said the controversy is less
about the First Amendment than ``whether constitution compels
libraries to facilitate federal felonies. There's no question that
obscenity and child porno is not protected speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography viewing in libraries is not the board's only worry,
he added. Under sexual harassment law, permitting library users to
view pornography might enable employees to sue the county for
failing to do anything about a ``hostile work environment,'' Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Depositions in the case are continuing and absent a settlement,
it is likely to go to trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Intervening on the side of the plaintiffs are eight others, all
of whom contend that the blocking software unconstitutionally
restricts access to their work. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Troyer, whose ``Safer Sex Page'' gives advice on
sexuality to gay and bisexual teen-agers;
</P>
<P>
   _ John Ockerbloom, whose page features books ``from Ulysses to
Little Red Riding Hood'' that have been subject to censorship;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Maryland Chapter of the American Association of University
Women, which promotes education and pay equity for women;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rob Morse, columnist for the San Francisco Examiner;
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Myers, an 18-year-old offering advice and book
references for gay and lesbian teen-agers;
</P>
<P>
   _ Sergio Arau, a Mexican painter and rock singer known as ``El
Padrino'' whose artworks are displayed on the Internet;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Renaissance Transgender Association, a support group for
those switching sexual identities;
</P>
<P>
   - And Jonathan Wallace, whose on-line publication ``The Ethical
Spectacle'' examines Internet censorship issues.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff, Mainstream Loudoun, has its own lawyer and
is not represented by the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year threw out a federal ban against
transmitting indecent materials to minors. The justices said the
prohibition was overly broad and would cut out a multitude of
constitutionally protected speech aimed at adults.
</P>
<P>
   But the Loudoun County case is the first test of what, if any,
limits there are on the Internet in an institution that for
generations has been the average person's most common point of
access to information: The public library.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it is being closely watched by organizations ranging
from the American Library Association, which supports the ACLU
position, to the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by
conservative tele-evangelist Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservative groups are supporting the Loudoun County
Library Board, including the Family Research Council, led by former
Reagan administration official Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Most other conflicts involving blocking software have been
resolved without litigation, according to Beeson. After ACLU
complaints, library systems in Boston and in Kern County,
California agreed to give patrons the option of using the software
during Internet searches if they desired.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU also is involved in a case in Livermore, Calif. where a
local parent, identified only as ``Kathleen R.'' is suing the local
library system in California Superior Court in Alameda County for
not employing the software.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Corn-Revere, lawyer for the Mainstream Loudoun group,
recalled the statement by the late Justice Potter Stewart that he
could not define pornography, ``but I know it when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   By using the blocking software, he said, Loudoun County's
version would be ``we know it without looking at it.''

ITALIAN MEDIA TYCOON CONVICTED AGAIN ON CORRUPTION CHARGES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Silvio Berlusconi, the flamboyant media tycoon and former
prime minister, was convicted by a Milan jury on Monday of making
illegal political donations and was given a sentence of two years
and four months, as well as a $5.6 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this month that Berlusconi, 61, who heads
the center-right opposition group in Parliament, was convicted on
corruption charges. Last week, he was convicted of bribing tax
inspectors and sentenced to a term of two years and nine months. He
was also convicted of accounting fraud in a separate trial in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his three strikes, Berlusconi does not appear to be out.
The tycoon, one of Italy's richest businessmen, is in no immediate
danger of going to jail. As an elected member of Parliament, he has
immunity. Even if Parliament voted to waive his immunity, Italian
law guarantees him at least two appeals before the convictions take
force.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a measure of the baroque complexities of Italian
politics that Monday's long-awaited decision was in some ways less
awkward for Berlusconi than for the administration he accuses of
persecuting him for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an Anglo-Saxon point of view, three preliminary
convictions on separate corruption charges might raise ethical
questions about a politician's qualifications to serve the
public,'' said Massimo Pavarini, a professor of law at the
University of Bologna. ``But in a more Latin, Machiavellian
culture, three convictions can be made to look like a political
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party won a series of mayoral
elections in May, is not acting like a fugitive in disgrace. He has
instead turned his multiple legal troubles into a political
campaign, accusing left-leaning prosecutors of singling him out for
political persecution. A little like a player in the card game
Hearts, who decides to amass bad cards to shoot the moon,
Berlusconi is hoarding his convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, who denies all the charges, was found guilty Monday
of having been involved in a scheme to channel $12 million dollars
to a former prime minister, Bettino Craxi, and his Socialist Party
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Craxi, whose conviction on one of many corruption charges was
upheld by the Italian Supreme Court in 1996, is a fugitive in
Tunisia. Monday's ruling gave him a four-year sentence and a $10
million fine for having been on the receiving end of the political
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely evident that this is not about justice, but
about destruction,'' Berlusconi's media company, Fininvest, said in
a press release. ``The sentence was in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is an obvious self-serving streak to Berlusconi's
theme, Italian society is nonetheless asking itself painful
questions about the power of its magistrates and the entire
judicial system, turning one prominent politician's travails into a
more widespread social and political tempest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The storm not only affects the immediate future of the strained
center-left government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, but it also
clouds the past. Berlusconi is seeking to recast and darken one of
Italy's most crucial recent turning-points _ the 1992-1993
investigations into the complex web of political and financial
corruption known as Tangentopoli, or Bribesville, when Milan
prosecutors toppled an entire political class and put more than
2,500 businessmen in jail.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Tangentopoli investigations, magistrates
were viewed by most Italians as heroes, dedicated public servants
who dared to probe the deep collusion between politics and business
that was at the heart of the Italian system. Five years later, some
of those magistrates have come under scrutiny themselves, and so
have the broad powers of their office.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, shortly after Berlusconi was convicted on charges
that one of his companies, Fininvest, bribed tax officials, his
coalition proposed the creation of a parliamentary commission to
investigate Tangentopoli. The mere suggestion unleashed a bitter
political debate.
</P>
<P>
   While the commission was described as an inquiry into the nature
and breadth of political corruption in the Italian system, many,
including most magistrates, viewed such a commission as a
politically charged effort to investigate the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Parliament is expected to debate the scope and
purpose of the commission. It is a sensitive issue for the Prodi
government, which has repeatedly called for reform of the political
and judicial system, but does not want to inadvertently help
Berlusconi's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a problem,'' Prodi said, referring to the
inadequacies of the justice system. ``We need a solution, but the
solution cannot be reached by silencing the magistrates. We must
let the magistrates do their job.''

   I work in the publicity department of a publishing house
specializing in illustrated books, and we receive many requests for
free review copies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we received a letter from an inmate requesting a book
for the prison library. Apparently, he had been sentenced to 10
years and enjoyed drawing.
</P>
<P>
   While debating the cost of humanitarianism against sending an
expensive book to a prisoner, a co-worker from another department,
who had been listening to the discussion, asked, ``What's he in
for?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cat burglar,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Her face darkened, and she blurted, ``Don't send it to him; he's
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get 10 years for stealing cats,'' she said.

   Kenneth Berman was taken to Winfield's Restaurant in Greenwich,
Conn., for a Father's Day brunch.
</P>
<P>
   As the party was seated, he noticed a printed, filled-in form on
the table:
</P>
<P>

<P>
   That was followed by a table number, date and manager's name.
</P>
<P>
   What Berman wants to know is who or what is ``other''?
</P>
<P>
   The young man walking near Arlene Cohen in Central Park
observed, with a somewhat jaundiced eye, a woman jogging by. He
turned to Mrs. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spandex is a privilege, not a right,'' he said and went on his
way.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Mai and Tiffany Otto were in a SoHo boutique when they
were approached by an eager salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies,'' he said, ``if there's anything you need, I'm Nick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we don't need anything, who are you then?'' one of the
``ladies'' asked.

   I was riding the subway recently and noticed the following
advertising placard placed by the New York City Board of Education
for a teacher recruitment program: ``Our schools need certified
bilingual professionals qualified in the areas of'' _ and it then
proceeded to list a number of educational areas.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10, including English as a second language, had a
little star next to them. At the bottom, there was a note stating
that the star meant ``Qualified applicants need not be bilingual.''

   Scene: A recent evening at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Anne
Ritchie and other tired passengers waiting out a two-hour delay for
a flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Next gate: More tired passengers waiting out a delayed flight to
St. Louis. The St. Louis flight announcement rings out _ they will
be boarding in 10 minutes. Applause, laughter, cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the New York flight is announced, boarding in 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A lone voice cuts the silence. ``So, they want we should jump
for joy?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ritchie knew then that she was almost home.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marks was sitting near the front of a downtown Lexington
Avenue bus when a woman, obviously in a hurry, managed to get on
the lower step and prevent the door from closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an express?'' she gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the driver replied.
</P>
<P>
   She remained on the step, pondering her predicament aloud:
Should she board the bus or wait for a limited? The passengers
became impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she stepped up and, as she deposited her fare, said to
the driver, ``Well, will you drive fast?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a line at a bank on Madison Avenue, and waiting his
turn was a man holding the hand of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who appeared to be about 5 or 6 years old, looked
around and asked, ``What is this place?'' Her father explained that
it was a bank. ``What is a bank?'' was the next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, you've never been in a bank before,'' he
replied. ``A bank is what they had before there were money
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   She nodded, satisfied. It now all made sense.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three summers, our family, former New Yorkers, have
spent a week on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Our
daughter-in-law, Betsy Nicholas, loves to try out new recipes and
one, for yellow-fin tuna, called for a marinade using wasabi, the
Japanese herb. Our son, Paul Kessler, drove to the local
supermarket to search for it. After three unsuccessful attempts, he
found a cheerful clerk near the spice department and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where can I find wasabi?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the clerk replied, ``I don't live around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The wasabi was at the top of the spice rack, and the tuna
steaks were delicious.

   After enjoying lunch in the financial district, Sharon Druck and
her friends walked along West Broadway toward Battery Park. Along
the way, they noticed a commotion at the corner _ four police
officers were crowded around a police cruiser. A small crowd had
gathered and Ms. Druck and friends thought perhaps a suspect was
being arrested. As they got closer, they realized that the only
suspects were the keys to the police car, which had been locked
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this story _ it doesn't only happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adams was walking behind two women, and as they were
about to pass the Methodist Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew at
86th Street and West End Avenue, they noticed a discarded pair of
new-looking crutches in the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women paused, pointed toward the church and said
``Well, they seem to be getting results.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Marshman reports that his wife, Ann, was sitting on a
park bench when she noticed an elegant woman slowly parading an
equally elegant French poodle. The poodle had a dazzling white
coat, legs and hindquarters clipped to the skin except for fluffy
pompoms at ankles and tail and, on each ear, long combed-out locks
tied with red bows.
</P>
<P>
   A little girl approached the dog's owner and asked if she might
pet him, politely adding, ``It is a he, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a he all right,'' was the response. ``The groomer
just likes to cross-dress him.''
</P>
<P>
   The place: Eighth Avenue in the 40s.

   The time: Saturday afternoon; curtains still up on matinee
performances.

<P>
   FEATURE STORY
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOVIE-ACTORS (Los Angeles) _ A tide of movie and theater
actors, as well as established film writers, directors and
producers, are surging into a medium that they once scorned. And
just as important, the gates of movie studios have been flung open
to television actors and writers after decades of not-so benign
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   OFFLEAD
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-RYAN-FILM (Undated) _ It's the morning of D-Day, June 6,
1944, just off Omaha Beach. Laden with rifles and unwieldy packs,
some of the men pray, others are sick into their helmets. A few are
visibly shaking. Then the doors to the landing craft fall open, and
Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opens on July 24,
becomes an entirely different kind of movie than the audience
expects. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   LONDON-THEATER-COPENHAGEN (London) _ Why did Werner Heisenberg,
the German who formulated the uncertainty principle, pay a visit to
Niels Bohr, the Dane who made key discoveries in quantum theory, in
the occupied Copenhagen of 1941? The meeting of the two Nobel
Prize-winning physicists could help explain why you and I are not
now living in a world controlled by Son of Hitler and his
cybernetic Gestapo. It certainly supplies Michael Frayn with the
material for one of the boldest, meatiest plays the Royal National
Theater has staged this decade: ``Copenhagen.'' By Benedict
Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   FORBIDDEN-BROADWAY (New York) _ Gerard Alessandrini, 44, has
been Broadway's premier parts collector for a long time. Since 1982
he has been presenting a series of rude, yet ultimately
affectionate cabaret-style satires on the Broadway scene under the
moniker ``Forbidden Broadway,'' which he created, writes and
directs. At one time, he also performed in it. The current
incarnation, the year-and-a-half-old ``Forbidden Broadway Strikes
Back!,'' will be replaced by a new edition at the end of September,
and Alessandrini is on the prowl for fresh material and new cast
members. By Rick Lyman.

   HADID-CINCINNATI (Cincinnati) _ Herbert Muschamp reviews Zaha
Hadid's Museum of Contemporary Art in Cincinnati.

   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   PIMPERNEL-TV (Undated) _ Now A&AMP;E Television Networks, which
brought ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Emma'' and ``Tom Jones'' to
television, are producing ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' with the BBC.
The three 90-minute television films of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,''
replete with 1,200 costumes and visually rich locales in the Czech
Republic, promise to be not only lush in the style we've become so
accustomed to with literary adaptations. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   SEXY-OPERA-JACKETS (Undated) _ A jet-black man, facing front and
nearly naked but for a spiked leather G-string with matching spiked
sunglasses, and holding a dead white swan; a trio of skinny,
scantily clad, bewigged and beribboned drag queens who could be
drum majorettes in a Gay Day parade; a naked obese woman sitting on
a floor and cuddling a tiny dog between her fleshy arm and
humongous bosom, with heart-shaped trinkets masking her face and
nipples. Are we leafing through some gay and lesbian soft-porn
magazine? No, these are the covers of three new RCA Victor
recordings of orchestral excerpts from Wagner operas. By Anthony
Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   OPERA-YOUNG-TURNOFF (New York) _ One of the better ways to
understand your chosen field is through the eyes and ears of those
outside it. ``As Thousands Cheer,'' the musical by Moss Hart and
Irving Berlin resuscitated in a production by the Crama Dept. that
just closed at the Greenwich House Theater, had something to tell
us about the early-music movement. And in a roundabout way, its
performers helped explain why some younger audiences don't like
operatic singing. By Bernard Holland. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   BEASTIE-BOYS (Undated) _ There is a term in hip-hop, flavor. It
is a good thing. Rappers want to have flavor: panache, style,
something extra that enables them to stand out from the pack. In
their 17 years together, however, the Beastie Boys have developed
something much better than flavor: taste. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   BRISTOL-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ Bristol, England, has been the
capital of sonic murk and undertow for a decade, and it's not about
to give up the claim. Two new albums from Bristol's
standard-bearers _ Tricky's ``Angels With Dirty Faces'' (Island)
and Massive Attack's ``Mezzanine'' (Virgin) _ insist on the
continuing allure of ambiguity. Since the disk jockey and
production collectives Soul II Soul and Massive Attack emerged from
Bristol, the city's aural signature has been a slow, deep bass line
_ reggae with English reticence _ below hazy sounds that drift
through the mix like troubled memories. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION-TRENDS (New York) _ The scene was a salesroom at
Christie's in New York on June 18, the prize an 18th-century
Newport chest signed, labeled and dated by one of America's
greatest cabinetmakers, John Townsend. At first, hands and paddles
shot into the air as 10 people swiftly bid the masterpiece up to $2
million. But then an air of secrecy descended on the room as the
telephones took over: five unidentified bidders, then three, then
two competed until the hammer fell on the last bid, for $4.7
million. In one stroke, the sale underscored two trends now in
evidence at auction houses: a surge in prices for Americana, and a
growing demand for anonymity by a new generation of wealthy
collectors. By Rita Reif.

BY KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (LOS ANGELES) _ Q: I was taking a brief nap at my desk after
lunch, and my manager walked in and said I will be terminated if
this ever happens again. I'm a good employee, and I believe my
manager overreacted. I've even heard that in some companies, taking
a nap is acceptable and even has some benefits. What do you think?
D.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's time to wake up and smell the reality. Although naps can
have beneficial results and they are permitted in some companies,
you obviously work for a company that prefers to have the employees
remain awake on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In most companies, employees are subject to swift discipline for
sleeping, all the way up to termination. The best way to understand
your manager's reaction is to review your company's policy in this
area, as well as review the kinds of problems that can develop as a
result of your catnap. For example, if you are in a position in
which inattention can lead to serious accidents, injury or
production problems, your manager may have actually underreacted.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, rather than trying to change the culture and
sleeping habits of the company, you are better advised to look at
yourself and see if there may be any physical problems wearing you
down. It will also be helpful to look at your job and see if there
is anything about it that may be putting you to sleep. Since sleep
is a way to psychologically withdraw from work, perhaps your body
is trying to tell you something.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several employees who report to me have been coming to me for
advice on personal matters, and I am not equipped to help them. I
am a good listener with a lot of common sense, but I am not trained
as a counselor and I am not comfortable advising employees in areas
I know little about. But I do not want to abandon them. What can
you suggest? C.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: As a person with a good deal of common sense, you need to
apply it to yourself in this situation. If your common sense tells
you that a particular issue that an employee raises can be easily
remedied with basic horse sense, you can certainly render some
words of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   However, your good judgment should also tell you when you are
out of your league. For example, when the questions start to focus
on issues like depression, serious problems at home or feelings of
rage, the best strategy is to refer the person to the company's
human resources staff, a health care professional or a religious
adviser. This is not abandoning the employee. In fact, you are
giving him or her excellent advice: Get some professional help.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, it is also important to be sure that you are not
spending too much time advising your employees on personal matters
and too little time advising them on job-related matters. While
professional counselors often play the role of best friend, it is
appropriate for a manager to be friendly, but not best friends,
with the troops.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been with the company for 15 years, but now there is a
merger in progress and talk about severance pay for those who will
be let go. I want to know if or how a person can negotiate this
package. P.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Many strategists believe that it pays to negotiate severance
pay. However, one concern is that many companies have specific
formulas in this area, such as so much pay for so many months
worked and they are often reluctant to deviate from them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is often some wiggle room, particularly if
you envision your severance as a package and not just a cash
payout. In this regard, you can try to negotiate for longer medical
coverage as well as outplacement support, such as a desk, phone,
secretarial help and career counseling while you search for a job.
</P>
<P>
   If the cash payout is less than what you desire, another
negotiating approach is to try to remain on the payroll longer
while you are doing your job search. This may appeal to the company
because it does not set a precedent in the way that the severance
itself is calculated. Do not be afraid to tell management about
your financial situation and the hardship the current severance
arrangement will cause.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists also suggest that you look for leverage. For
example, if the company wants you to sign an agreement regarding
your right to sue or compete in the future, the suggested strategy
is to consider rejecting the first offer and holding out until they
sweeten the package for you to the point that parting is more
likely to be sweetened sorrow. &QL;

`What's Keith Richards doing here?`
</P>
<P>
   9. You get a thank you note from the president of `Kleenex.`
</P>

   5. You've taken to frying delicious bacon on your forehead.

<P>
   4. You deliriously think, `Maybe I'll sit down and watch the new

<P>

<P>
   2. Label on your Dristan package reads, `This won't help at all,

   I work in the publicity department of a publishing house
specializing in illustrated books, and we receive many requests for
free review copies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we received a letter from an inmate requesting a book
for the prison library. Apparently, he had been sentenced to 10
years and enjoyed drawing.
</P>
<P>
   While debating the cost of humanitarianism against sending an
expensive book to a prisoner, a co-worker from another department,
who had been listening to the discussion, asked, ``What's he in
for?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cat burglar,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Her face darkened, and she blurted, ``Don't send it to him; he's
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get 10 years for stealing cats,'' she said.
</P>

   Kenneth Berman was taken to Winfield's Restaurant in Greenwich,
Conn., for a Father's Day brunch.
</P>
<P>
   As the party was seated, he noticed a printed, filled-in form on
the table:
</P>
<P>
   Mr./Mrs./Ms. Berman Kenneth
</P>
<P>
   Number of Guests: 3
</P>
<P>
   Adult (CHECKMARK)
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a table number, date and manager's name.
</P>
<P>
   What Berman wants to know is who or what is ``other''?
</P>
<P>
   The young man walking near Arlene Cohen in Central Park
observed, with a somewhat jaundiced eye, a woman jogging by. He
turned to Mrs. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spandex is a privilege, not a right,'' he said and went on his
way.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Mai and Tiffany Otto were in a SoHo boutique when they
were approached by an eager salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies,'' he said, ``if there's anything you need, I'm Nick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we don't need anything, who are you then?'' one of the
``ladies'' asked.
</P>
<P>
   I was riding the subway recently and noticed the following
advertising placard placed by the New York City Board of Education
for a teacher recruitment program: ``Our schools need certified
bilingual professionals qualified in the areas of'' _ and it then
proceeded to list a number of educational areas.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10, including English as a second language, had a
little star next to them. At the bottom, there was a note stating
that the star meant ``Qualified applicants need not be bilingual.''

   Scene: A recent evening at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Anne
Ritchie and other tired passengers waiting out a two-hour delay for
a flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Next gate: More tired passengers waiting out a delayed flight to
St. Louis. The St. Louis flight announcement rings out _ they will
be boarding in 10 minutes. Applause, laughter, cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the New York flight is announced, boarding in 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A lone voice cuts the silence. ``So, they want we should jump
for joy?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ritchie knew then that she was almost home.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marks was sitting near the front of a downtown Lexington
Avenue bus when a woman, obviously in a hurry, managed to get on
the lower step and prevent the door from closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an express?'' she gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the driver replied.
</P>
<P>
   She remained on the step, pondering her predicament aloud:
Should she board the bus or wait for a limited? The passengers
became impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she stepped up and, as she deposited her fare, said to
the driver, ``Well, will you drive fast?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a line at a bank on Madison Avenue, and waiting his
turn was a man holding the hand of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who appeared to be about 5 or 6 years old, looked
around and asked, ``What is this place?'' Her father explained that
it was a bank. ``What is a bank?'' was the next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, you've never been in a bank before,'' he
replied. ``A bank is what they had before there were money
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   She nodded, satisfied. It now all made sense.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three summers, our family, former New Yorkers, have
spent a week on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Our
daughter-in-law, Betsy Nicholas, loves to try out new recipes and
one, for yellow-fin tuna, called for a marinade using wasabi, the
Japanese herb. Our son, Paul Kessler, drove to the local
supermarket to search for it. After three unsuccessful attempts, he
found a cheerful clerk near the spice department and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where can I find wasabi?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the clerk replied, ``I don't live around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The wasabi was at the top of the spice rack, and the tuna
steaks were delicious.

   After enjoying lunch in the financial district, Sharon Druck and
her friends walked along West Broadway toward Battery Park. Along
the way, they noticed a commotion at the corner _ four police
officers were crowded around a police cruiser. A small crowd had
gathered and Ms. Druck and friends thought perhaps a suspect was
being arrested. As they got closer, they realized that the only
suspects were the keys to the police car, which had been locked
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this story _ it doesn't only happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adams was walking behind two women, and as they were
about to pass the Methodist Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew at
86th Street and West End Avenue, they noticed a discarded pair of
new-looking crutches in the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women paused, pointed toward the church and said
``Well, they seem to be getting results.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Marshman reports that his wife, Ann, was sitting on a
park bench when she noticed an elegant woman slowly parading an
equally elegant French poodle. The poodle had a dazzling white
coat, legs and hindquarters clipped to the skin except for fluffy
pompoms at ankles and tail and, on each ear, long combed-out locks
tied with red bows.
</P>
<P>
   A little girl approached the dog's owner and asked if she might
pet him, politely adding, ``It is a he, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a he all right,'' was the response. ``The groomer
just likes to cross-dress him.''
</P>
<P>
   The place: Eighth Avenue in the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The time: Saturday afternoon; curtains still up on matinee
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Charter bus waiting for returning theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   The observer: Linda Cohen
</P>
<P>
   The action: Bus driver relaxing, arms behind his head in a
hammock he has hung between the side-view mirror of the bus and a
lamppost.

   ``A South African man has set a new world record by dancing to

career lasted that long.''

   ``That anti-impotence pill Viagra, getting more popular every

   Next gate: More tired passengers waiting out a delayed flight to
St. Louis. The St. Louis flight announcement rings out _ they will
be boarding in 10 minutes. Applause, laughter, cheers.

<P>
   Minutes later, the New York flight is announced, boarding in 10
minutes.

   Gene Marks was sitting near the front of a downtown Lexington
Avenue bus when a woman, obviously in a hurry, managed to get on
the lower step and prevent the door from closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an express?'' she gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the driver replied.
</P>
<P>
   She remained on the step, pondering her predicament aloud:
Should she board the bus or wait for a limited? The passengers
became impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she stepped up and, as she deposited her fare, said to
the driver, ``Well, will you drive fast?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a line at a bank on Madison Avenue, and waiting his
turn was a man holding the hand of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who appeared to be about 5 or 6 years old, looked
around and asked, ``What is this place?'' Her father explained that
it was a bank. ``What is a bank?'' was the next question.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, you've never been in a bank before,'' he
replied. ``A bank is what they had before there were money
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   She nodded, satisfied. It now all made sense.

   For the last three summers, our family, former New Yorkers, have
spent a week on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Our
daughter-in-law, Betsy Nicholas, loves to try out new recipes and
one, for yellow-fin tuna, called for a marinade using wasabi, the
Japanese herb. Our son, Paul Kessler, drove to the local
supermarket to search for it. After three unsuccessful attempts, he
found a cheerful clerk near the spice department and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where can I find wasabi?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the clerk replied, ``I don't live around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The wasabi was at the top of the spice rack, and the tuna
steaks were delicious.

   After enjoying lunch in the financial district, Sharon Druck and
her friends walked along West Broadway toward Battery Park. Along
the way, they noticed a commotion at the corner _ four police
officers were crowded around a police cruiser. A small crowd had
gathered and Ms. Druck and friends thought perhaps a suspect was
being arrested. As they got closer, they realized that the only
suspects were the keys to the police car, which had been locked
inside.

   One of the women paused, pointed toward the church and said
``Well, they seem to be getting results.''

   A little girl approached the dog's owner and asked if she might

EX-OFFICER DEFENDS HANDLING OF SECURITY AT SAUDI BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With every crack of a hammer and the daylong whine
of power saws slicing into wood, Terryl Schwalier moves closer to
building a new home. And he edges ever farther from a distant
desert community known as Khobar Towers.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Air Force brigadier general never truly can
escape Khobar, a 180-building Saudi Arabian dorm complex rocked
June 25, 1996, by a terrorist blast that killed 19 Americans and
wounded 345 others, many seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't done the things that we did, if we had not acted
aggressively and practically with the information that we knew,
then it would be much more difficult,'' Schwalier, 51, said. ``But
I know we were acting responsibly, taking care of the people who
were put in my charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was acting responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is talking, Schwalier is a hero or a scapegoat,
a commander who went above and beyond the call of duty to protect
those he led, or fell well short of the standard for American
generals.
</P>
<P>
   Then a brigadier general on his way to a second star and a
coveted Pentagon post, Schwalier's bright career crumbled like the
buildings closest to Khobar's blast center. Defense Secretary
William Cohen laid the bulk of the blame on Schwalier, saying in a
June 25, 1997, Pentagon news conference that Schwalier failed to do
everything possible to protect his forces against the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly believe that it was politically motivated,''
Schwalier said of Cohen's decision. ``I do not believe it was the
right decision. But I respect his right to make that decision. I
think it was the wrong one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's conclusions didn't just bring down Schwalier. His
assessment prompted Air Force Chief of Staff Ronald Fogleman to
quit his post in protest _ an unprecedented event in Air Force
history. It exposed strained relations between the Saudis and the
United States, and sparked profound changes in the way America
protects the oil-rich desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent $122.6 million moving its troops
from Dhahran to Prince Sultan Air Base in the Saudi desert, where
adversaries now face winding roads, night vision devices and sensor
networks. The Air Force's Security Forces Center, a relatively
obscure anti-terrorist operation, opened in the wake of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Richard A. Coleman, commander of the Security Forces
Center, sees the improvements as ``formidable steps'' intended to
foil attacks like the one at Khobar.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's claim that Schwalier stumbled while trying to protect
his wing draws defenders and detractors in and out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech since quitting the joint chiefs, Fogleman
last fall told a group in Austin, Texas, that Schwalier took around
130 actions to prevent the blast. David Winn, consul general in
Dhahran during Schwalier's year in the desert kingdom, said
``extraordinary measures'' were taken that included car and body
searches at the compound's gate, and placing sharpshooters on dorm
roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabian authorities, as recently as the day before the
bombing, had repeatedly assured the Americans there were no
indications of a terrorist attack and ``even gently chided us for
worrying too much,'' Winn said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said intelligence reports indicated a terrorist attack
on Dhahran was to be expected. Like Cohen, retired Army Gen. Wayne
Downing said Schwalier didn't prevent terrorists from setting off a
bomb on the complex's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said there were other failings, Downing _ who headed
an influential task force that found fault with Schwalier's efforts
_ is quick to say that Schwalier's bosses erred, too. He said those
in the command chain ``were let off rather easily,'' but couldn't
explain why Schwalier was singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Downing's report identifies the leadership of the U.S. Central
Command, which was responsible for the Persian Gulf region, and Air
Force Central Command as failing to have done more to protect
Khobar.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Heiser, a Palm Coast, Fla., real estate company owner who
lost her only son, Air Force Master Sgt. Michael Heiser, 35, in the
blast, said Schwalier must take responsibility as commander at
Khobar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been labeled a scapegoat,'' Heiser said. ``But isn't
losing a star a small price to pay for 19 lives?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A sympathetic Downing praises Schwalier for boosting defenses at
Khobar and preventing the worst attack _ a bomb that could
penetrate the complex.
</P>
<P>
   But both his report and the one later issued by Cohen dovetail
on issues ranging from the need for alarm systems at Khobar to
alerting superiors to problems beyond Schwalier's control.
</P>
<P>
   Downing shares Cohen's view that Schwalier had served well, but
as wing commander was ``ultimately responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwalier said he believes Sens. Arlen Specter and Joseph
Lieberman helped launch a search for a fall guy. Specter, R-Pa.,
said in a June 30, 1996, appearance on NBC's ``Meet The Press''
that there's ``a real need to shake up'' the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 9 Senate hearing, Lieberman, D-Conn., said: ``The
obvious fact is they didn't do enough because 19 Americans are
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter's office did not return a phone call. A spokesman with
Lieberman's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``I
can tell you Sen. Lieberman never wanted any witch-hunting to occur
and he never called for that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For Schwalier, there is one great, unstated but obvious truth:
America has moved its troops to the desert, a decision that implies
commanders can't protect their forces in Saudi urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reported to my location, I didn't choose it. I tried to make
it better and I tried to make it safe. That was my job,'' Schwalier
said. ``I was dealt a deck and that's the one I worked with,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a personal failing, why have we changed
everything?''

U.N. NOT AIMING TO MEDIATE CHIAPAS CONFLICT, ANNAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DEPALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan denied Monday that
the United Nations was looking to mediate the conflict in Chiapas,
even though he expressed concern over the fragile state of peace in
Mexico's southernmost state.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, in Brazil on the first leg of a 10-day visit to Latin
America, said some of his statements last week at a news conference
in New York had been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had apparently not realized how Mexican officials would
react when he broadly suggested, in response to a reporter's
question, that the possibility of U.N. involvement in resolving the
four-and-a-half-year standoff in Chiapas would depend on what
government leaders told him when he visited Mexico later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   That was widely reported in Mexico as an offer to mediate, and
Mexican officials rejected it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Annan made it clear Monday that although Mexican officials had
sent him reports about Chiapas, which he will study, they had not
formally sought U.N. help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a role could only be considered under certain conditions,
among them an official request by the Mexican government,'' said a
statement Monday morning from Annan's office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely considered highly unlikely that Mexico would make
such a request. The government has moved to bar some international
observers from Chiapas, and even the hint of foreign involvement is
usually enough to evoke the tragedies caused by interventions and
invasions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can sort out our problems amongst ourselves,'' Interior
Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa told reporters over the weekend.
He said the documents on Chiapas had been sent to New York simply
to inform the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not consider it appropriate to internationalize the
conflict,'' Labastida said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roberto Albores Guillen of Chiapas was more direct, telling
reporters that Annan would be welcome in Chiapas ``as a tourist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Annan's concern has encouraged church leaders and human
rights groups in Mexico, setting off a broad discussion over
whether international efforts are needed to bring permanent peace
to Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the United Nations take an interest in Chiapas has been
a very important advance,'' said the Rev. Edgar Cortez, director of
the Miguel Agustin Center for Human Rights in Mexico City, which
has long monitored Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez said he doubted that the government or the Zapatista
National Liberation Army rebels would accept direct U.N. mediation.
But he said by simply monitoring human rights the group could calm
tensions and help set the stage for a resumption of peace talks,
which broke off in September 1996, mostly over granting autonomy to
Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Chiapas government proposed a plan that offers to
recognize the autonomy of Indian-run communities designated by the
Zapatista rebels. But its chances of success are considered
minimal, because the rebels demand that the federal government pull
back its troops, while the government refuses to do so and insists
that Zapatista sympathizers surrender their arms.

CRASH SNAPS BOARDMAN'S WRIST -- AND LEADING EFFORT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leader's yellow jersey in the Tour de France is never easy
to keep, but it's usually the steep mountain rides or the strenuous
grind of three weeks of racing that bring a rider down.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Chris Boardman's case. The British rider who had worn the
jersey for the first two days, crashed Monday and fractured his
left wrist. So now he's not just out of the leader's spot, he's out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 minutes away from the finish of the 127-mile stage in
Cork, Ireland, Boardman crashed after his front wheel clipped the
rear wheel of his teammate, Frederic Moncassin of France.
Boardman's helmet hit a stone fence by the roadside, cutting his
forehead. Tour doctor David Curtis said Boardman had a fractured
left wrist, as well as cuts and bruises to his face. His arm was
put in a cast and he was to spend the night in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Svorada of the Czech Republic won the stage, which was the
Tour's final day in Ireland, while Germany's Erik Zabel finished
17th and took over the yellow jersey as the overall leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour has not been kind to Boardman, 29, who was the gold
medalist in the 1992 Olympics in the pursuit race. He won the
prologue in his Tour debut in 1994, but he broke his ankle in the
1995 prologue and was eliminated. He went on to finish 39th in the
1996 Tour, and in 1997 again won the prologue but was forced to
withdraw two weeks later because of crash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 189 riders began Monday's race at Enniscorthy, a market town
near the ancestral home of the Kennedy political dynasty. About
one-third of the way along the route, the riders reached
Carrick-on-Suir, the hometown of Sean Kelly, who won the sprinter's
green jersey a record four times during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The riders stuck together and set a leisurely pace through most
of the stage along Ireland's flat southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   But then the crash occurred and set up a new race for the yellow
jersey. Two of Boardman's Gan teammates, Frenchmen Eddy Seigneur
and Francois Simon, broke away from the pack and pulled ahead by
more than a minute until the race reached the outskirts of Cork.
</P>
<P>
   A second pileup 7 miles from the end caused more than a dozen
cyclists to topple over and others to veer onto the grassy banks to
avoid the collision. That crash injured another Gan rider, Francois
Simon of France, who received four stitches in his heel after
finishing the race in 184th place. But crashes aside, the race went
on.
</P>
<P>
   Czech rider Svorada won the sprint finish, while Zabel took over
the yellow jersey as overall leader with a cumulative time of 10
hours 21 minutes 16 seconds. He is now 7 seconds ahead of Tom
Steels, winner of Sunday's stage. American Bobby Julich is in sixth
place, just 9 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   The riders flew to France Monday night, to resume the race
Tuesday _ Bastille Day _ in the host country. The 106-mile stage
goes from Roscoff to Lorient in the northwestern Brittany region of
France.

KOOL-AID WEEK IN NEBRASKA  
 HEALTH ADVISORY FOR TRAVELERS TO TAIWAN

</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 19)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kool-Aid was formulated and first produced in Hastings, Neb. To
recognize this momentous fact, Gov. Ben Nelson recently proclaimed
it the official state soft drink, and Nebraskans will celebrate
Kool-Aid Week from Aug. 9-15. Travelers who find themselves in
Nebraska during that time can partake of the neon-bright beverage
(the original six flavors will be offered free) at rest stops along
Interstate 80, the state's main east-west thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, the Hastings Museum, in conjunction with the town of
Hastings, is planning an extravaganza called Kool-Aid Days. The
town is in south-central Nebraska 16 miles south of I-80 on U.S.
Highway 281. Activities will include a Kool-Aid recipe cook-off, a
contest to choose the most creative Kool-Aid stand, and races for
roller-skating waiters and waitresses (who carry a tray of glasses
filled with Kool-Aid). Exhibits about Kool-Aid and its inventor,
Edwin Perkins (1889-1961), will be on display.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins' first foray into drink concentrates was a product
called Fruit Smack. It was sold as a liquid in glass bottles, but
shipping proved expensive and precarious (the bottles broke). In
1927 he figured out a way to dehydrate the liquid and sell the
powder in little envelopes. He called it Kool-Ade, shortly changed
to Kool-Aid. The drink proved to be wildly popular; because it was
also affordable, Perkins' business flourished during the
Depression. Perkins Product Co. moved to Chicago in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   For information, call the Hastings Museum at (800) 508-4629 or
(402) 461-2399. The museum is open daily. Admission is $5.

   CDC Issues Warning on Virus in Taiwan
</P>
<P>
   A widespread viral illness on Taiwan that can be fatal to
infants and young children poses some risk to international
travelers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The virus causes a hand, foot and mouth disease that is
identified by sores in the mouth and rashes on the palm of the hand
and soles of the feet. Meningitis, encephalitis or a poliolike
paralysis may follow. Sixty children under 3 years of age on Taiwan
had died by July 7. The risk of death to visitors was described as
``very small''; the death rate in the age group in Taiwan was one
in 10,000.

   The virus is described as moderately contagious; it is not
spread by airborne transmission, and is unlikely to be spread by
food or water. It is spread by direct contact with a sick person's
saliva, mucus or stool. The government recommends that travelers
avoid prolonged direct contact with infected people and take
hygienic steps: Wash hands frequently, especially after diaper
changes; disinfect contaminated surfaces, and wash soiled clothing.
The government asked travel agencies and airlines to notify their
clients of the recommendations.

   Tours and Museum Focus on Aborigines
</P>
<P>
   Travelers interested in Australia's aboriginal heritage can view
traditional dances at the new National Aboriginal Cultural Center,
scheduled to open in early August in the Darling Harbor section of
Sydney. The center houses the most extensive collection of
artifacts of the country's 200 aboriginal tribes, including some of
the earliest rock art dating back at least 50,000 years. Other
relics include masks, boomerangs, dancing sticks, fishing spears
and colorfully painted didgeridoos, flute-like instruments made of
eucalyptus wood.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and craftsmen from various tribal nations work at the
center, open from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Dance performances
take place at 11 a.m. and 1, 4 and 6 p.m. Admission, which includes
performances, is $18.
</P>
<P>
   More knowledge of the aborigines can be gained by taking tours
offered by organizations like Tobwabba Arts and Aboriginal Cultural
Tours in the Forster region of New South Wales, a three-hour drive
north of Sydney, and Harry Nanya Tours in Wentworth in the Outback.
Participants often sample aboriginal food, called bush tucker,
which can include emu, kangaroo, roots, flowers, leaves and
insects, and view paintings and decorative wares. The Tobwabba tour
costs $21 a person with lunch; the Harry Nanya tour is $27.

   Sports and the Arts at Gay Games in Amsterdam
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam, Netherlands, one of Europe's gay capitals, is
anticipating an influx of more than 200,000 people for the fifth
Gay Games _ the first to be held outside North America. From Aug.
1-8, 15,000 participants from 64 countries will compete in 29
sports events and take part in 14 artist's workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Badminton, ice hockey, volleyball, wheelchair dancing and a
marathon along the route of the 1928 Olympic race in Amsterdam are
among the competitions to be held throughout the city and also in
Amersfoort, a town east of Amsterdam, which will be the site of the
swimming events.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paul van Yperen, a spokesman for the Games, the
competition will be open to both homosexuals and heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to government subsidies and contributions from 38
private sponsors, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Kodak, the
Games are also the recipient of the first contribution (about
$55,000) from the European Commission to a gay event.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Ministry of Defense is helping out with 3,000 cots to
be set up for athletes in schools and campgrounds, although there
is still hotel availability.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand volunteers are being trained to help organize the
events and manage crowds. Central Amsterdam is expected to be the
busiest during the games, particularly the area around Dam Square,
Friendship Village and gay centers such as the
Reguliersdwarsstraat.
</P>
<P>
   When this event was first held in 1982 in San Francisco, the
U.S. Olympic Committee sued to forbid the use of the name Gay
Olympics; the organization subsequently changed the name. The event
was last held in 1994 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual gold, silver and bronze medals,
commissioned by the municipal Amsterdam Fund for the Arts and
designed by Marcel Wanders, there is a fourth medal that all
participants will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural events _ including some 40 exhibitions _ will
complement the games. At the Rijksmuseum, ``Olympic Gods'' will
feature prints and drawings of Jupiter, Adonis, Diana and other
mythological beings, and at the Stedelijk Museum for Modern Art,
lesbian and gay artists will display their sculptures, paintings,
photographs and other works.
</P>
<P>
   Many theaters are putting on special shows, among them two
performances on Aug. 3 and 4 by Harvey Fierstein in the Municipal
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   There will be free concerts on Dam Square, open-air theater in
the Vondelpark, and presentations of recent gay-themed films on an
outdoor screen every evening after 10 on Nieuwmarkt Square. The
opening ceremony in Amsterdam Arena, on Aug. 1 at 8 p.m., will
include performances by Dana International, the Israeli transsexual
who won this year's Eurovision song contest, and the Weather Girls
accompanied by a hundred dancers in sailor outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sports events are free; the swimming, dancing,
body-building and ice hockey competitions and a number of finals
will cost between about $6 and $12.
</P>
<P>
   For tickets, call (31-20) 420 0200; for accommodations, call

NEW ENCRYPTION PLAN COULD ALLOW AMERICAN SOFTWARE EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new data scrambling technology probably won't resolve a
long-running dispute between law enforcement officials and the
computer industry. But the plan announced Monday could enable
American firms to export data-protection products worth billions
while easing concerns about national security.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of 13 firms led by Cisco Systems Inc. proposed a
new way to use sophisticated encryption technology to scramble
Internet messages so unauthorized people could not read them. The
system is designed for major corporations that send Internet
messages around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the encryption would occur inside the
``router,'' a computer on the network that sends the information to
its destination. There, another router would decode the message.
Between the two routers, the message would be gibberish, even if it
were intercepted. But at either end, the message would be in the
clear, and easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, a computer networking company based in San Jose, Calif.,
is the world's leading maker of network routers.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would allow the network operator to intercept
messages from individual computers before they were encrypted and
sent over the Internet. If a law enforcement agency suspected
illegal activity, it could obtain a court order forcing the company
to intercept the data before encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government won't allow US firms to export their
top-quality encryption products. The government fears that the
software will fall into the hands of spies and terrorists, who
would then be able to plan crimes without fear of government
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have offered their own compromise. They would
allow exports of the software only if companies gave copies of its
code-cracking keys to some outside agency, which in turn would
provide them to the police. But security experts have denounced
this plan, saying it would be hard to prevent the spare keys from
falling into the hands of hackers or rogue government agents.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's vice president of legal and government affairs Dan
Scheinman said the new approach solves this problem. ``There are no
keys,'' Scheinman said. ``The only people who have access to the
data are the people who have access to the data today, which are
the network managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet news service Wired News reported that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation sees merit in the plan. ``If the router is
in the possession of a third party such as an Internet service
provider, that would very much meet the needs of law enforcement,''
said FBI spokesman Barry Smith. But Scheinman said that the new
system would mainly be designed for internal corporate
communication, not for individual users connected to Internet
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Software executives are desperate for a solution to the
encryption deadlock. A report issued in April by the Economic
Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, said the U.S. computer
industry will lose $35 billion in revenues over the next five years
as foreign firms provide encryption products.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schnell is vice president of marketing for RSA Data
Security Inc., a leading encryption software company that licenses
its software for use in other firms' products. Schnell would like
to see no restrictions on the export of encryption software. But
the new plan holds out hope of a compromise that would allow at
least some export sales to major corporations and government
agencies abroad. ``We're pragmatists,'' said Schnell. ``Our focus
is in helping our licensees help to sell their products freely on a
worldwide basis. Anything that fosters that goal is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Davidson, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, and a staunch critic of encryption controls, agreed
that the new plan is good news. ``Any opportunity to get more
encryption in the hands of more people is a step forward for
Internet privacy,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the proposal is only useful for large
organizations with network routers that can handle data encryption.
It does nothing for Internet users who want to encrypt and decrypt
messages on their personal computers. Exports of this kind of
software are still subject to strict control. Davidson asked,
``What about the rest of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's stock Monday closed at $94 1/4, up 1 5/16 on the Nasdaq
stock market.

IMF DIPS INTO EMERGENCY FUND TO AID RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund plans to use
emergency reserves to help fund $22.6 billion in loans to Russia, a
move that places new pressure on Congress to provide more money for
the lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has used its emergency fund only nine times since it
established the reserve account in 1962. The last time the account
was used was in 1978, when the United States withdrew money in a
bid to stop the declining value of the dollar, and in 1977 to aid
the United Kingdom and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the IMF has warned that its regular reserves
are low because of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, which
the agency has tried to ease by offering tens of billion of dollars
in loans to South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials recently said that $15 billion or less is left in
their regular accounts. But borrowers such as Indonesia are calling
for even more loans, and the IMF has committed $11 billion as its
share of the Russian bailout package.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and its supporters, including the Clinton adminstration,
say the agency needs new funding to continue its mission of
promoting a stable global economy. The IMF acts as a lender of last
resort to troubled nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called on Congress to transfer $18 billion
to the IMF as part of an international program to boost its
reserves. The proposal has passed the Senate, but it is stalled in
the House, where some lawmakers are complaining that IMF operations
are too secretive. They also argue that IMF loans carry strict
economic terms that can close businesses, raise prices and leave
workers unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF bailout of Russia is an enormous scam that will not
only not help the Russian people, but will continue the
destabilization of their economy, causing increased poverty and
misery,'' Representative Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the IMF loans merely funnel US tax money to Russia,
which uses it to repay ``large banks and speculators who have made
risky loans to Russia at high interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael McCurry, the White House, said the IMF's loan offer
to Russia shows that Congress should ``stop fooling around, stop
the politics'' and approve the administration's request for new
funds for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ample evidence in today's developments that the
Republican Congress is being very short sighted in not moving
forward on the funding commitments we need to deal with these
international economic issues,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House are generally united behind a bill that
funds the IMF but includes new protections for foreign workers and
the environment, said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he and some other Democrats are finding it easier to
support the IMF funding because a major stumbling block -- IMF
support for President Suharto of Indonesia -- has been removed.
Suharto has stepped down, replaced by a new government that may
ease up on repression in East Timor and which has released a
prominent labor leader from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF issue is a tricky one for Republican leaders. One wing
of the party supports corporate America, which generally backs the
IMF efforts to bring stability to the world economy. But other
Republicans believe the IMF uses tax money to support international
lenders who have made reckless loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``IMF bailouts encourage investors to assume additional risk in
pursuit of extra-normal returns, in the expectation that losses may
be absorbed by the IMF,'' Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey
Republican who is co-chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton also calls the IMF a ``secretive organization'' that
should release more information about its inner workings in order
to receive new US tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Another political problem for the IMF bill could arise as social
conservatives try to attach an anti-abortion measure to it, which
would be unacceptable to Democrats and the White House. But at the
same time, support for the IMF is building among lawmakers from
farm states, who believe IMF loans help US farmers sell their
products overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping the IMF emergency fund to aid Russia requires permission
from the United States and 10 other industrialized nations, but all
are considered likely to approve the withdrawl. The United States
is the largest contributor to the IMF, and holds 18 percent of the
votes, the largest share of any nation.

LOUDON LANDS LATE-AUGUST WINSTON CUP DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Burton and his winning team were off to Indianapolis to
test for the upcoming Brickyard 400. Bob Bahre was back in his
office in Oxford, Maine. And stragglers in motor homes continued to
stream off the grounds of New Hampshire International Speedway
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Things were just about back to normal in Loudon, N.H., a day
after 90,000 filled the speedway's 83,000 seats and luxury suites,
infield, and hillside on the backstretch for the running of the
Winston Cup Jiffy Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Bahre and thousands of fans in recreational vehicles
and thousands more coming for the day will all reconvene again late
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The speedway landed a second date on the Winston Cup tour and
ran its first CMT (for Country Music Television) 300 last year,
which was won by Jeff Gordon. The second race will be held the last
weekend of August, and will most likely switch to mid-September for
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Having the next Cup weekend go as well as this one would suit
Bahre fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things went very well, to be honest with you,'' he
said. ``We had everyone on the grounds in plenty of time, an hour
or an hour and a half before the race. People seemed to be happy. I
was walking around and people were thanking me and I told them I
should be thanking them. Where would we be without them? You've got
to have fans.''
</P>
<P>
   By the nature of the business, traffic was slower leaving the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between coming in and getting out is that some
people wnat to be here at 5, some want to be here at 7, some at 9,
and some at 11,'' said Gary Bahre, Bob's son and NHIS president.
``And everyone plans to leave when the checkered flag falls.
Although we were pleased with the way we got people out, we didn't
get them out as fast as they came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crowd stayed around an extra hour or so for a
postrace auto show.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, the parking lots were cleared by
8:45, 8:30,'' said Gary Bahre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think things went very well,'' said Capt. David McCarthy of
the New Hampshire State Police. ``The only real slowdowns we
noticed were because it was the first real good weather weekend of
the summer, and a lot of the resort traffic from the north came
down and led to some delays. Interstate 93 got extremely heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sunday's race, the second Cup race is once again sold out.
The speedway drew an estimated 19,000 last Friday for Cup
qualifying and practice and 40,000 Saturday for the final
qualifying and more practice and a pair of NASCAR-sanctioned
support races _ the Featherlite Modified Tour race and a Busch
Grand National North race. The schedule for the Cup weekend in
August is the same, and the Bahres hope to draw similar crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Burton would love to match his result.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cuppers have this weekend off, head to Pocono and
then the Brickyard 400 Aug. 1, and return here in the middle of a
grueling stretch run of races on 16 consecutive weekends to finish
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who defended his Jiffy Lube title Sunday, has now won
two of the last three Cup races here. His team was good in
practice, good in the early stages of the race, and kept getting
better as he and crew chief Frank Stoddard kept adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has won three races and was fourth in the points last
year. Now, the team has its first win of the season and is eighth
in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck to our game plan,'' he said about some problems the
team had earlier in the season. ``We kept working and we still have
work to do. Just because we won today it doesn't mean the world's
gonna be great from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a little better than it was a week ago.

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Federal agents were hunting for containers of
HIV-infected blood, the rabies virus and anthrax spores earlier
this month when they arrested three men on charges of threatening
government officials and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also searched for written threats, instruction
manuals and tools to turn disposable lighters into mechanisms for
using biological weapons, according to search warrants unsealed
Monday a federal magistrate in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were arrested July 1 and accused of using e-mail to
relay threats of biological and chemical attacks on the heads of
the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Johnnie Wise, 72, of Olmito; Jack Abbott Grebe Jr., 43, of Los
Fresnos; and Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, of Harlingen, remained in
custody at the Cameron County Jail Monday on charges of conspiring
to use weapons of mass destruction and using weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the IRS, Secret Service and the Cameron County
Sheriff's Department searched three Rio Grande Valley residences
about the time of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials seized chemistry and electronics books, photographs,
notebooks and assorted other material, according to a search
warrant signed by an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   However, no chemicals are specifically mentioned in the
inventory sheets of items that agents seized from the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is an infectious cattle and sheep disease that can be
transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials declined to comment on the seized items.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate John Black ordered the search warrants unsealed
at the request of defense attorneys who argued that they were
unable to defend their clients without knowing more about the
government's case.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is set for Thursday at the federal courthouse in
Brownsville. At the hearing, defense attorneys are expected to have
an opportunity to question at least one government witness.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing earlier this month, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Rick Lara told Black that the men not only conspired to use the
weapons, but discussed how to use them and who would be targets.

 &HT;    NationsBank tops forecast for second quarter
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Buoyed by a 31 percent increase in non-interest
income, NationsBank reported a 23 percent rise in second-quarter
operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte-based banking company logged operating income of
$1.13 billion, or $1.15 per share, compared to $919 million, or 94
cents, a year ago. Net income, which included a $430 million
pre-tax gain from the sale of 67 Florida offices, was $1.41
billion, or $1.43 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Per share earnings were a penny above a 20-analyst consensus,
according to the First Call service.
</P>
<P>
   Non-interest income was $1.86 billion, which represented 42
percent of revenue, up from $1.42 billion and 37 percent a year
ago. Traditional lines of business appeared to be flattish, with
net interest income at $2.53 billion versus $2.44 billion a year
ago. Net interest margin _ the difference between what it cost a
bank for money and what it makes on money_ declined 0.24 percentage
points to 3.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robinson-Humphrey analyst John W. Coffey said, ``The
reported numbers belied what was really going on in the loan
portfolio. If you exclude the effects of Florida divestitures of
over $1.4 billion in loans'' and another $2 billion in other loan
sales, ``the loan portfolio grew about 8 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, revenue rose 14 percent to $4.42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Non-interest expense was up 12 percent to $2.51 billion from
$2.23 billion. On a cash basis, which excludes accounting for
intangibles, it cost NationsBank about 53.6 cents, down from 54
cents last year, to bring in a dollar of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping expense growth lower than revenue growth accounts for
the higher earnings gain, said NationsBank spokesman Robert
Stickler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real significance of their success'' in turning in this
kind of quarter while absorbing Barnett Banks ``is that it bodes
well for their upcoming merger with BankAmerica,'' said Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported return on assets of 1.45 percent and return
on equity of 18.3 percent compared to 1.3 percent and 15.7 percent
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The provision for possible loan losses was $265 million, or 0.47
percent of assets, versus $225 million, or 0.53 percent, a year
ago. Net charge offs were $276 million, or 0.61 percent of average
loans, compared to $220 million, or 0.49 percent, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, operating earnings totaled $2.27 billion, or
$2.32 per share, versus $1.77 billion, or $1.81 per share.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank had assets of $307.99 billion at quarter's end. Its
stock closed at $87, down 18 3/4 cents.

FINDING A REPLACEMENT FOR HASHIMOTO A TOUGH TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Whoever replaces Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
have his work cut out for him. Unfortunately, say analysts and
voters, there may not be a politician in Japan who is up to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has focused on Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, 60, a
12-term member of the Lower House who has held several top party
posts. Obuchi heads the largest faction in the LDP and, based on
party politics, is the leading candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the colorless politician could be a liability
for the LDP. A recent survey of pundits by the leading business
magazine Toyo Keizai ranked Obuchi next to last among politicians
in his grasp of economics. More disturbingly, last place went to
Finance Minister Hikari Matsunaga.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi ``is not charismatic, he's extremely ignorant of
economics and he's not popular with the public...Most Japanese
wouldn't even recognize him,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist for
HSBC Securities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Young, head of economic analysis in Japan at Salomon
Smith Barney, said with Obuchi's ``lack of policy experience and
the LDP's weak position in parliament, it's going to be an uphill
battle'' for him to take decisive action.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate is former chief Cabinet secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, 71, the markets' favored choice. Kajiyama advocates
letting insolvent banks fail, a radical stance in Japan, and is
considered a free-marketeer. But he also supports higher interest
rates, a policy many economists call wrongheaded in a time of weak
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more outspoken and bold than most politicians in
this country,'' Evans said. ``The problem is he's a bit populist _
he swings whichever way he thinks the public mood is going. He
wants to raise interest rates, which would be disastrous, to
satisfy people who live off their savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has also turned to former Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, 78, who was in charge in 1993 when the LDP was thrown out
of power for the first time in 38 years. Last December, Miyazawa
helped forge a 30 trillion yen ($2.1 billion) bank bailout. He also
pushed his party to move faster on economic stimulus and a ``bridge
bank'' plan for failed banks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Evans, ``Miyazawa was the cause of the end of LDP
rule. The economy at that stage was in bad shape, too. But now he's
seen as a safe pair of hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another option is Yohei Kono, 61, former party leader when the
LDP was out of power following Miyazawa's ouster. Kono later lost
the party leadership to Hashimoto, and became the only LDP chief
not to serve as prime minister. Having lost the top job once, he
may not want to stand again.
</P>
<P>
   The dark horse candidate is Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, 56, an outspoken fiscal policy specialist who in
a previous job pushed for selling off the government's postal
savings fund, a move that investors supported, but which the LDP,
bureaucrats and unions opposed.
</P>
<P>
   With his longish hair, he stands apart from the standard LDP
conservative politician lineup, and in a time of voter discontent,
Koizumi is probably the best electoral draw the party has got.
</P>
<P>
   One LDP faction, including Koizumi, may back party General
Council Chairman Yoshiro Mori, according to today's Daily Yomiuri
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, opposition groups are discussing joining
forces behind Democratic Party of Japan leader Naoto Kan for prime
minister, but it's unlikely they could succeed, given the LDP
majority in the Lower House of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uninspiring field of LDP contenders, Evans said, ``I
could imagine in six months time that we might look back with
nostalgia on Hashimoto.''

COMMENTARY: DESPERADO DEMOCRACIES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago I visited Tirana, Albania, and on my way out of
the airport to board my plane, I was stopped by an Albanian customs
``official.'' She looked me up and down and asked: ``How much money
are you carrying?'' There was a certain Jesse James tone in her
voice. I told her I had $3,500. ``$3,500,'' she repeated, her eyes
lighting up. ``He has $3,500,'' she said to her fellow customs
agent. ``Where are you from?'' he asked, apparently trying to
determine if I was a diplomat and therefore immune from this
bureaucratic stickup. ``I'm from The New York Times,'' I answered.
``Let him go,'' the man said, apparently concluding it wouldn't be
good publicity to separate me from my money.
</P>
<P>
   These two Albanian customs agents had a lot more in common with
Bonnie &AMP; Clyde than Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. They were a reminder,
though, of a basic truth _ that in many formerly Communist
countries, the successor to Communism is more often kleptocracy
than democracy. That fact is too often forgotten in today's debates
about China, Russia and other once-Communist states.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Kosovo Liberation Army is now talking about
uniting all the Albanian communities in the Balkans into a
``Greater Albania.'' That is a frightening thought _ not because
Albanians aren't entitled to unification, but because they haven't
proved they can properly run  &UR; one &LR;  Albania, let alone  &UR; five &LR;  put
together. The whole debate in Washington about China is  &UR; when &LR;  it
will become a democracy. The much more important question _ for
them and us _ is  &UR; how &LR;  it will become a democracy. How will it make
the leap from where it is now _ with antiquated institutions and a
police-state apparatus increasingly unsuited to its rapidly
modernizing economy _ to a more open, rule-based system, without
chaos in the transition?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for Albania to collapse; it would be quite
another for China to start spewing refugees, weapons and financial
scams. ``China had 70,000 traffic deaths last year _ roughly 630
deaths per 100,000 cars. America had 21 deaths per 100,000 cars,''
notes the Stanford University China scholar Mike Oksenberg. ``It's
because China has all these new highways with inadequate passing
signs, or warnings about oncoming hills, or even traffic lights in
some places, and no free press to report on it all. Their growth is
simply outrunning their existing systems of governance and
education.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the ultimate test of U.S. China policy is not whether
President Clinton shook his fist hard enough at President Jiang
Zemin. The ultimate test is how well the United States uses its
influence to promote a more rule-of-law system in China _ one that
first constrains the Chinese state, and then gradually lays an
institutional foundation that can carry Chinese society forward
after the inevitable collapse of the Communist Party or its
evolution into an electoral body.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress wants to do something useful on China, it should
spare us the chest-thumping and instead appropriate the funds
sought by Clinton to train lawyers, judges and law professors in
China. When Communist states collapse, before the new institutions
have evolved you are much more likely to get Russia _ where they
have a free press and the Mafia guns down inquisitive journalists _
then you are the best case, Poland, which had a Catholic Church and
trade unions to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   But preventing Albania in China takes a lot of engagement, on a
lot of levels. Those who argue that America should simply isolate
China and hasten the collapse of its system now are just begging
for a big Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Fatos Lubonja, editor of the Albanian literary journal Endeavor,
talked to me in Tirana about post-Communist Albania: ``After
Communism we had total equality in Albania. We were all at zero.
There was no real infrastructure, no one really had property or
contacts. Politics became just another business, because being a
politician meant you could or could not give stamps of approval.
The free market here was considered freedom to do anything. One of
the West's great errors was that during the collapse of Communism,
sometimes we changed the people (in charge), but we did not really
change the system. Instead of building a free economy, based on
initiative and risk, we created a criminal economy. No one
understood that without the software (of real governing
institutions), Albania is just a jungle.''

IMF DIPS INTO EMERGENCY FUND TO AID RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund plans to use
emergency reserves to help fund $22.6 billion in loans to Russia, a
move that places new pressure on Congress to provide more money for
the lending agency.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has used its emergency fund only nine times since it
established the reserve account in 1962. The last time the account
was used was in 1978, when the United States withdrew money in a
bid to stop the declining value of the dollar, and in 1977 to aid
the United Kingdom and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the IMF has warned that its regular reserves
are low because of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, which
the agency has tried to ease by offering tens of billion of dollars
in loans to South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   IMF officials recently said that $15 billion or less is left in
their regular accounts. But borrowers such as Indonesia are calling
for even more loans, and the IMF has committed $11 billion as its
share of the Russian bailout package.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and its supporters, including the Clinton adminstration,
say the agency needs new funding to continue its mission of
promoting a stable global economy. The IMF acts as a lender of last
resort to troubled nations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called on Congress to transfer $18 billion
to the IMF as part of an international program to boost its
reserves. The proposal has passed the Senate, but it is stalled in
the House, where some lawmakers are complaining that IMF operations
are too secretive. They also argue that IMF loans carry strict
economic terms that can close businesses, raise prices and leave
workers unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF bailout of Russia is an enormous scam that will not
only not help the Russian people, but will continue the
destabilization of their economy, causing increased poverty and
misery,'' Representative Bernie Sanders, Independent of Vermont,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the IMF loans merely funnel US tax money to Russia,
which uses it to repay ``large banks and speculators who have made
risky loans to Russia at high interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael McCurry, the White House, said the IMF's loan offer
to Russia shows that Congress should ``stop fooling around, stop
the politics'' and approve the administration's request for new
funds for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ample evidence in today's developments that the
Republican Congress is being very short sighted in not moving
forward on the funding commitments we need to deal with these
international economic issues,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House are generally united behind a bill that
funds the IMF but includes new protections for foreign workers and
the environment, said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he and some other Democrats are finding it easier to
support the IMF funding because a major stumbling block -- IMF
support for President Suharto of Indonesia -- has been removed.
Suharto has stepped down, replaced by a new government that may
ease up on repression in East Timor and which has released a
prominent labor leader from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF issue is a tricky one for Republican leaders. One wing
of the party supports corporate America, which generally backs the
IMF efforts to bring stability to the world economy. But other
Republicans believe the IMF uses tax money to support international
lenders who have made reckless loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``IMF bailouts encourage investors to assume additional risk in
pursuit of extra-normal returns, in the expectation that losses may
be absorbed by the IMF,'' Representative Jim Saxton, a New Jersey
Republican who is co-chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton also calls the IMF a ``secretive organization'' that
should release more information about its inner workings in order
to receive new US tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Another political problem for the IMF bill could arise as social
conservatives try to attach an anti-abortion measure to it, which
would be unacceptable to Democrats and the White House. But at the
same time, support for the IMF is building among lawmakers from
farm states, who believe IMF loans help US farmers sell their
products overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping the IMF emergency fund to aid Russia requires permission
from the United States and 10 other industrialized nations, but all
are considered likely to approve the withdrawl. The United States
is the largest contributor to the IMF, and holds 18 percent of the
votes, the largest share of any nation.

FIRE DEATHS CLOUD PROTESTANT MARCH PLANS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ By mid-afternoon Monday, even as
police held two men for questioning in the arson attack on Sunday
that killed three boys, the conspiracy theory had worked its way
through the crowd that was standing around Drumcree Church.
</P>
<P>
   According to this theory, the Quinn brothers who were burned to
death in their beds early Sunday were not the victims of Protestant
extremists who targeted their Catholic mother, as the police have
said, but were killed in a domestic dispute. The police, this
theory holds, are trying to smear the loyal people of Ulster, those
camped out on the hillside next to Drumcree Church.
</P>
<P>
   That such a story, no more than rumor, could be spread and
embellished by those who describe themselves as upstanding,
God-fearing men and women speaks volumes about the denial at work
here, and how divided this society remains.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested the appalling deaths of the Quinn brothers
-- 8-year-old Jason, 9-year-old Mark, and 11-year-old Richard --
marked a turning point in Northern Ireland, that even the
recalcitrant minority that refuses to accept the new spirit of
accommodation and cooperation would be marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a propensity here to claim that the latest
atrocity would be the key that unchains Northern Ireland from its
past. But while some hardline loyalists were moved by the deaths of
the three boys, many others were not. There were gestures of
compassion from some Orangemen, so named for King William of
Orange, whose 1690 victory over Catholic forces was celebrated
Monday. But many others ignored pleas from their own political and
religious leaders that they curtail celebrations and end the
standoff here at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people here, both Protestant unionists and
Catholic nationalists, are sick of the violence and voted
overwhelmingly to endorse new political arrangements two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But some 29 percent of the electorate voted against the Good
Friday agreement, and within that minority is a smaller minority
who want to foment the hatred and bigotry that has defined Northern
Ireland to the outside world for so long.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of hatred and bigotry, the police say, that led
someone to firebomb the Quinn house and incinerate three little
boys in the pre-dawn hours of Sunday. Police sources said the men
being questioned Monday have links to Protestant loyalist
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fields of Drumcree, those who ignored pleas to end
their standoff were irritated when asked whether they were being
disrespectful by carrying on their protest against being barred
from marching down the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's disgusting what happened to those three little
boys, but I think it's equally disgusting that we're being blamed
for it,'' said Stephen McKinney, an Orangeman from Lurgan who
brought his wife and young son to Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Drumcree is full of families like the McKinneys, and it
has a benign, almost carnival-like atmosphere. But as night falls,
a sinister element takes over, taunting the security forces on the
other side of the barbed wire. Shots have been fired and bombs
thrown at the security forces from the Orangemen's side, a sight
that has shaken many Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Bingham, an Orange Order chaplain who wept when
he learned of the boys' deaths, spoke from his pulpit Sunday,
asking the Orangemen to call off their protest because they could
not control their violent sympathizers. Monday, Bingham was heckled
by some fellow Orangemen who called him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You betrayed your country!'' screamed Joel Patton, leader of
the hardline Spirit of Drumcree group.
</P>
<P>
   As other Orangemen asked Patton not to make a public spectacle
of the split within the Orange Order, scuffles broke out.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific deaths of the Quinn boys may signal the end of the
Orange Order as a potent political force. Founded 203 years ago,
the Protestant fraternal organization has over the last 30 years
been nearly halved in size, to about 70,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Its reputation for always getting its way has taken a beating as
the British government has made it clear that British soldiers and
the Royal Ulster Constabulary will not allow Orangemen to defy the
Northern Ireland Parades Commission ban against it marching down
the Catholic Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   The determination of some Orangemen to carry on the protest that
began 10 days ago when the authorities barred them from marching
through a Catholic neighborhood has bitterly divided the Orange
Order, especially in the wake of the deaths of the three boys. Many
Orangemen take their religion seriously, and consider it Christian
to show respect to the dead boys.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night only a few thousand people showed up here to show
solidarity with the Orangemen. Last week Orange leaders predicted
they would have 100,000 people in the fields with them. They
explained the discrepancy by saying they asked other lodges to stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   Some Orange lodges were unmoved by the deaths of the Quinn
brothers. An Orange parade was held in Ballymoney, the town where
the boys died. Some people had asked the Orangemen to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   In Rasharkin, the village where the boys' bodies were being
waked at their grandmother's house, another Orange parade passed,
playing loud music that celebrated military victories over
Catholics some 300 years ago. Some passersby made obscene gestures
at the Quinn family.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Quinn, the dead boys' grandmother, said the booming drums
and music could be heard in her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought today would've been different,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Intransigence is not confined to hardline Protestants. A
Protestant parade in Belfast was held up Monday for over an hour
after the Irish National Liberation Army, a small Catholic
republican splinter group that refuses to call a cease-fire, said
it had planted two bombs on the route. A car bomb, believed left by
republican dissidents, was defused outside the Newry courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, hopeful signs Monday. In several villages,
nationalists called off protests out of respect for the Quinn
brothers. In Dunloy, Orangemen did not challenge a ban from
marching through the Catholic village. Many Orange leaders began
speeches with sympathetic words for the Quinns.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite the bomb threats that delayed it for an hour, an
Orange parade passed without acrimony down the Lower Ormeau Road in
South Belfast, which besides the Portadown parade is the most
controversial, disputed route in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where peaceful protest has been rare since 1972, when
14 Catholics were shot dead by British soldiers at a civil rights
march, there was proof Monday that it can work, on both sides.

<P>
   Dig inside Xerox Corp.'s newest stand-alone digital copier and
the nuts and bolts of a big shift in manufacturing swing into view.
</P>
<P>
   Parts that were welded are now fastened, and easy to take apart.
Components that were scattered throughout the machine are arranged
on subassemblies that can easily be lifted out. The fuser roll,
which fixes the toner to the paper, is no longer made of an
aluminum core that is tossed out when its rubberized coating wears
off; the core is now a combination of aluminum and steel that can
be re-coated again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the changes _ particularly since some of the new parts
are more expensive to make? Because they add a re-use option to the
recycle-or-dump-it choice for disposing of used or obsolete
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, it is cheaper to re-use a part than to
recycle it,'' said Jack Azar, Xerox's director of environment,
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Once the purview of myriad small companies that eked out a
living refurbishing carburetors, printer cartridges and other used
parts, re-manufacturing _ a method of re-using old parts in new
machines _ has hit corporate America in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   From Xerox to Saturn, from Lucent to DuPont, from Kodak to
Steelcase, companies of all types and technologies are looking to
re-manufacturing as a premier way to hold costs down and keep
products out of landfills. No longer happy to let their
small-company forebears breathe new life into their discarded
machines, many are stepping up their collection methods and re-use
technologies to bring older products home.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not content just to salvage parts from old
products. Now, they are beginning to design products with eventual
re-manufacturing in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally convincing designers that it doesn't matter if a
part is twice as expensive if you can use it again and again,''
said Cavan Kelsey, manager of design for health, safety and
environment at Eastman Kodak Co., which recently replaced some
plastic parts in its high-speed copiers with more expensive, but
reusable, stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are not the only converts. The Federal Trade
Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and even Congress
have recently embraced re-manufacturing, with money, technological
support and new rules. And numerous universities are studying it
and teaching it.
</P>
<P>
   Interest is running so high that some manufacturers are using
design changes and sometimes lawsuits to keep the independent
re-manufacturers at bay. Some are fearful that the re-manufactured
versions of their products will eat too deeply into sales of new
ones. Others just want to do the re-manufacturing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have similar environmental goals, recycling and
re-manufacturing are not at all alike. Recycling generally involves
destroying something so that its materials can be re-used.
Re-manufacturers remove parts, test them, refurbish them and re-use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling methods _ melting down steel, or dissolving paper _
can be energy-intensive and polluting, and often yield lower-grade
materials. And they do not recapture the value that was added
through processing or assembling.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``re-manufacturing is an affordable way to get the
highest value out of parts,'' said Nabil Nasr, director of the
Rochester Institute of Technology's National Center for
Re-manufacturing and Resource Recovery. That realization, said
Stuart Hart, professor of strategic management at the University of
North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School, is yielding
``tremendous corporate interest in, and sophistication about,
re-manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Universities are fanning the embers. Kenan-Flagler just hired a
professor of ``reverse logistics'' _ getting products back and
re-manufacturing them. The Rochester Institute sponsored a
conference on re-manufacturing in June. Gary Davis, director of the
University of Tennessee's Center for Clean Products and Clean
Technology, said his group was about to study re-manufacturing for
the automobile industry ``because it is infinitely superior to any
type of recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   And numerous schools now preach re-manufacturing in industrial
design courses. ``We are teaching students that it is silly to
think one-time use when they design products,'' said Steven Derby,
associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Re-manufacturing is no panacea. The logistics of getting
products back can be daunting. So can putting in tracking systems
to insure that a part with a 10-use life is not on its 11th
go-round. And some customers eschew re-manufactured products, no
matter how rigorously tested and warrantied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will always believe that if something isn't brand
new, it isn't high quality,'' said Michael Best, a product manager
for Steelcase Inc., which makes new and re-manufactured furniture.

STEELWORKERS SUIT ASSAILS NAFTA AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United Steelworkers of America filed a lawsuit
against the federal government Monday, charging that the North
American Free Trade Agreement is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The steelworkers, along with the Made in the USA Foundation,
charge that NAFTA is a treaty and needed a two-thirds vote of the
Senate when it was passed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the Pittsburgh-based union, said
NAFTA must be retracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is to wipe NAFTA off the books clean,''
Becker said at a news conference. ``It was not constitutionally
adopted. Then let's negotiate trade agreements, but let's do it
with the understanding that we'll have input for the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups filed the lawsuit in the US District Court in
Northern Alabama, because, Becker said, workers there have been
hurt by NAFTA. A Steelworkers local that represents employees from
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in Gadsden, Ala., is also a plaintiff
in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks the court to decide whether NAFTA is a treaty,
and if it is, to retract the trade accord with Mexico and Canada
because it did not pass the Senate with the two-thirds vote needed
for treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Senate voted 61-38 to adopt NAFTA, and the House
approved it with a 234-200 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NAFTA is not a treaty, we can't imagine what would qualify
as a treaty,'' Becker said. ``NAFTA is a failed treaty. It has not
expanded the economy of the US, Canada, or Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA has turned out to ``betray the trust of workers and
families who bought into the dream of an improved economy,'' Becker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the Labor Department has certified that more than
180,000 US workers, including 7,400 from the Steelworkers union,
have been displaced by NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit attacks only the constitutionality of NAFTA, not
whether it is effective, said Carl Frankel, the union's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not in the lawsuit debate whether the treaty is good
or bad except to show we have been injured as a result of NAFTA,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Becker cited the loss of American jobs to cheaper
Mexican labor and unimproved conditions for Mexican workers.
</P>
<P>
   Joel D. Joseph, chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation, said
the nonprofit group promoting American products joined in the
lawsuit because NAFTA ``has not helped workers or consumers in the
United States, Canada, or Mexico, and because it was not enacted as
a treaty by the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups pointed to an article by Laurence H. Tribe, professor
of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, stating that NAFTA is
a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of creating a government for the Western Hemisphere,
NAFTA does everything else a treaty could do,'' Tribe said Monday
in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman, Chris Watney, said, ``The
government has not yet seen that suit. We will be reviewing it as
soon as possible, and we will comment after we review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the steelworkers union waited five years after NAFTA
was passed to file the lawsuit because the group wanted to see how
the agreement would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was, maybe, a way of hoping things were going to get
better, but they don't,'' he said.

UNDATED: re-manufactured furniture. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still, a growing number of manufacturers think the pluses
outweigh the drawbacks. Computer companies, including IBM, are
retrieving chips from old machines. Telecommunications equipment
companies, including Lucent Technologies, are re-manufacturing
switching equipment. Lexmark International, which re-manufactures
its own printer cartridges, is looking ``on a test basis'' at
whether it should use re-manufactured parts in printers, said a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp.'s Saturn division is working with the
University of Tennessee to develop a software program that tracks
the energy and environmental impact of every part of a car, from
manufacture to disposal. One major use for the program: let
designers run ``what if'' scenarios to see whether tinkering with
certain parts will make them easier to recycle or re-manufacture.
``We want designers to look at the environmental component of all
their decisions,'' said William Miller III, Saturn's manager of
environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even chemical companies, which deal with vats of materials
rather than discrete parts, are learning to re-manufacture. Instead
of melting down old polyester film _ which degrades the fiber _ or
burning it for fuel, DuPont now ``unzips'' the polyester molecule
down to its atoms, and re-manufactures the polyester. DuPont is
``scouting around for a similar chemistry for nylon,'' said John
Carberry, director of environmental technology. ``Billions of
pounds of nylon carpeting is going into landfill that we should be
able to re-use.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins &AMP; Aikman Floor Coverings Inc. has noticed that, too. It
has a new technology, which falls between recycling and
re-manufacturing, for grinding up old carpets and, without any
chemical processing, using them as backing for new ones. ``You can
do this forever, without the fiber degrading in any way,'' said Lee
Schilling, senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Re-manufacturing as a separate industry has been around for more
than 50 years. Re-manufactured parts dominate the aftermarket for
cars and trucks. Re-manufactured office furniture and printer
cartridges have also been available for years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States military, the largest re-manufacturer in the
world, routinely uses re-manufactured parts in vehicles and
weapons. And ``disposable'' cameras are a misnomer: since the early
1990s, Fuji and Kodak have retrieved them from photofinishers and
re-used the flash and other parts in new cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take long to realize how much value was left in
those so-called throwaways,'' said Stephen Rumsey, Kodak's
manufacturing manager for single-use cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Re-manufacturing is a good-sized industry in its own right.
Robert Lund, a professor of manufacturing engineering at Boston
University, said that in 1996, the last year for which he gathered
figures, companies that rebuild parts comprised a $53 billion
business employing 480,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, manufacturers and regulators barely
acknowledged them. ``This industry has grown and grown, yet it's
been completely overlooked,'' Lund said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, re-manufacturing is being promoted by its proponents _
including several state legislators in New York, which is home to
many cartridge re-manufacturers _ as the answer to everything from
global warming (it requires less energy, and thus reduces
greenhouse gases) to welfare reform (it provides jobs for
low-skilled workers). Congress just granted the Rochester
Institute's re-manufacturing center $10 million over five years to
develop new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC, whose Green Guide to products with recycled content is
widely followed by corporate and government procurement
departments, amended its guidelines in May to embrace
re-manufactured products. The Environmental Protection Agency is
financing some studies on re-manufacturing. ``It's an
environmentally friendly solution for businesses looking to hold
down costs,'' said Jane Bare, a chemical engineer in the EPA's
office of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Re-manufacturing companies are trying to capitalize on their new
fame. Last year they formed the Re-manufacturing Industries Council
International, which is lobbying Congress to make re-manufacturing
equipment eligible for a 25 percent capital investment tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As George Burns used to say, `Hang around long enough, and
you'll get discovered,' '' said William Gager, chairman of both the
Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association and the new council.
</P>
<P>
   But what may be old hat for Gager is brand new for primary
manufacturers. Many are under pressure from shareholders to meet
environmental goals, and from customers who, facing their own
environmental pressures and leery of rising landfill charges, want
them to take back used items.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of technology and the robust economy together encourage
companies to upgrade old equipment, creating a steady flow of
products to be re-manufactured. And the pressure to keep costs
down, combined with the growing number of start-up businesses that
cannot afford all-new products, has created a growing market for
re-manufactured goods like office furniture or cartridges which,
unlike re-manufactured copiers or cameras, are generally sold at a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines between primary manufacturers and the
independent re-manufacturers are being drawn. Several printer
companies have redesigned their cartridges to make them harder to
refill. And they have aggressively sued re-manufacturers _ and
sometimes each other _ for trademark infringements when the
packaging on the re-manufactured cartridges looks too much like
that on their new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture manufacturers may be playing hardball, too. Bill
Davies, owner of Davies Office Refurbishing in Albany, N.Y., says
it used to be simple to remove fabric from the frames of office
panels; now, he says, Steelcase and other manufacturers are
laminating the fabrics ``solely to make them hard to
re-manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelcase's Best says that is nonsense _ particularly since his
company has a thriving re-manufacturing business of its own. ``The
new design makes it easier to route cable through the panels,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But it also brings more of the panels home to
Steelcase itself for re-manufacturing.

 &HT;    HASHIMOTO RESIGNATION, JAPANESE ECONOMY HAS U.S., OTHERS ASKING,
'WHAT NEXT?'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With American jobs, profits and stock prices at
stake, the White House moved quickly Monday to stress that whoever
replaces Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime minister of Japan must
prescribe the tough medicine needed to prevent the country's
sagging economy from dragging down global growth.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, however, whether Hashimoto's replacement,
as yet unchosen, would have the motivation or the means to carry
out reforms the United States has sought, and Japan has promised,
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   All that was certain was that the prospect of dealing with yet
another Japanese prime minister -- Hashimoto's replacement will be
the seventh person to lead Japan's government since President
Clinton took office five years ago -- added yet another layer of
uncertainty to the future of the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan's recovery is now in doubt,'' said Robert DiClemente,
chief economist for the New York investment house Salomon Smith
Barney. ''Who's going to lead them out?''
</P>
<P>
   By early Monday morning, the White House and U.S. State and
Treasury departments had cobbled together a single policy line
meant to display a veil of public confidence in Japan's ability to
pick a new leader that would carry out long-promised, though
ill-defined, measures to cut taxes, shore up Japan's ailing banks
and invigorate consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important for the new government, as it forms
itself, to move quickly to implement concrete fiscal and banking
measures, to achieve strong domestic, demand-led growth in Japan,''
said White House spokesman Michael McCurry. ''The president
believes that a healthy Japanese economy is critical for the entire
Asia region, that it's critical to the global economy and thus to
the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It was largely the ailing economy that prompted Japanese voters
to deal a punishing drubbing in Sunday's elections to Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The party dropped from 61 seats to
44 seats in the 252-member Upper House of Japan's legislature,
called the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto announced Monday that he would resign in two weeks --
he cancelled his White House visit scheduled for next week -- to
take responsibility for the harsh judgment by voters fed up with
nearly a decade of lackluster growth and, most recently, a
full-blown recession, in a country that had, for two generations,
led the way to stunning economic vitality across much of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that Sunday's election results would
provide a wake-up call to the LDP, which remains in control of the
more powerful legislative wing, the Lower House. Japanese
politicians, much like their American counterparts, have often
avoided painful change until a crisis makes it impossible to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be the crisis,'' said Edward Lincoln, former economic
adviser in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is actually a mildly encouraging development, because the
election results leave the LDP frightened,'' said Lincoln, now a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank. ''They might start coming up with some new policies, or
different policies, than what they've done up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout nearly a decade of nearly-flat economic performance,
Japan's government has been loathe to reject the formula that
carried the country from the ashes of post World War II destruction
to prosperity over the course of three decades.
</P>
<P>
   That formula boils down to easy money for industry, low interest
rates for savers and policies that protect domestic industry from
competition, largely at the expense of consumers, so that huge
corporations can use lucrative domestic markets as a springboard
for global exports.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has long been a bone of contention for U.S.
policymakers, which have complained for two decades now that Japan
doesn't import as much as might be expected for an economy its
size.
</P>
<P>
   One result: a chronic U.S.-Japan trade gap that has averaged $50
billion, in Japan's favor, for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's figure was $55.7 billion, and this year's deficit is
already on target to top $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   That, American critics say, results in the loss of tens of
thousands of American jobs that might be supported by exports to
Japan, were the two-way trade flow closer to balanced. It also
affects profits of many U.S. corporations which rely on exports for
a growing portion of their sales. That, in turn, has a dampening
effect on stock prices. Wall Street, which has struggled for the
past two months in the face of deepening worries about Japan,
drifted downward on Monday, with the closely watched Dow Jones
Industrial Average falling 9.53 points to close at 9096.21.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling the increase in the trade deficit is Japan's
economic weakness, combined with a precipitous drop in the value of
the Japanese currency. The yen has lost some 80 percent of its
value against the dollar over the past three years, as investors
flee the yen as a show of no-faith in the future of the economy
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   A weak yen makes Japanese products cheaper, in dollar terms, in
the United States, providing an incentive for Americans to increase
their purchases of Japanese imports. It has the opposite effect on
U.S. exports to Japan, making American goods most costly to
Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening yen also puts pressure on other Asian currencies,
such as those of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, which have
already plummeted some 40 percent against the dollar over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
currency but has hinted that a continuing slide in the yen could
force a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, a move that analysts fear
would trigger further declines in currencies regionwide.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sagging economy, moreover, denies the region, and the
world, an economic locomotive that, in healthier times, might be
stimulating growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get Japan's economy moving again, and to shore up the
addled yen, Hashimoto had vowed a permanent tax cut -- as yet
undefined -- and a program to try to consolidate and deal with bad
bank loans valued at some $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The loans have crippled many of Japan's largest banks, crimping
credit and putting a drag on economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto also reluctantly talked of reforming Japan's economy
more generally to promote consumption, and of stimulating growth by
spending billions of dollars on public works.
</P>
<P>
   One problem politically, however, is that Hashimoto's policies
remained so vague that it's hard to draw a clear mandate from
Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were just kind of mad that the government's letting the
economy slip,'' Lincoln said. ''Virtually nothing they have done
for the past nine months has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sunday's humbling of the LDP leads to change remains the
central question for analysts trying to piece together the future
of Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to remain somewhat skeptical,'' said
DiClemente. ''This was already a very dramatic challenge for the
authorities there. Now, suddenly, the means to do all that itself
is up in the air. Who among the (LDP) party leadership is capable
of really taking charge?''

drifted downward on Monday, with the closely watched Dow Jones
Industrial Average falling 9.53 points to close at 9096.21.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling the increase in the trade deficit is Japan's
economic weakness, combined with a precipitous drop in the value of
the Japanese currency. The yen has lost some 80 percent of its
value against the dollar over the past three years, as investors
flee the yen as a show of no-faith in the future of the economy
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   A weak yen makes Japanese products cheaper, in dollar terms, in
the United States, providing an incentive for Americans to increase
their purchases of Japanese imports. It has the opposite effect on
U.S. exports to Japan, making American goods most costly to
Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening yen also puts pressure on other Asian currencies,
such as those of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, which have
already plummeted some 40 percent against the dollar over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
currency but has hinted that a continuing slide in the yen could
force a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, a move that analysts fear
would trigger further declines in currencies regionwide.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sagging economy, moreover, denies the region, and the
world, an economic locomotive that, in healthier times, might be
stimulating growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get Japan's economy moving again, and to shore up the
addled yen, Hashimoto had vowed a permanent tax cut -- as yet
undefined -- and a program to try to consolidate and deal with bad
bank loans valued at some $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The loans have crippled many of Japan's largest banks, crimping
credit and putting a drag on economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto also reluctantly talked of reforming Japan's economy
more generally to promote consumption, and of stimulating growth by
spending billions of dollars on public works.
</P>
<P>
   One problem politically, however, is that Hashimoto's policies
remained so vague that it's hard to draw a clear mandate from
Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were just kind of mad that the government's letting the
economy slip,'' Lincoln said. ''Virtually nothing they have done
for the past nine months has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sunday's humbling of the LDP leads to change remains the
central question for analysts trying to piece together the future
of Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to remain somewhat skeptical,'' said
DiClemente. ''This was already a very dramatic challenge for the
authorities there. Now, suddenly, the means to do all that itself
is up in the air. Who among the (LDP) party leadership is capable
of really taking charge?''

HASHIMOTO DEPARTURE LEAVES MOUNTAIN OF PROBLEMS FOR JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Edgy financial markets and disgruntled voters cheered
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's resignation Monday after his
party's hammering at the polls, hopeful that his replacement would
succeed in reviving Japan's sluggish economy where Hashimoto had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems facing Japan are monumental _ from fixing a
banking system strapped with $550 billion in problem loans to
appeasing a population suffering the worst unemployment in postwar
history. Hashimoto's departure has set off a scramble to replace
him, but has failed to turn up a shining contender. The jockeying
within a weakened ruling party could also delay essential financial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But even if his notoriously snail-paced party finally makes a
commitment to consistent economic policies following its stunning
electoral defeat Sunday, passing legislation to tackle the mess may
be harder now.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party will retain its hold on power
through its dominance of the Lower House, but the party lacks a
majority in the Upper House. Rival parties picked up 17 seats the
LDP lost in the Upper House elections. It must now work feverishly
to find allies _ at a time when the opposition wants to distance
itself from a discredited establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread corruption and pork-barrelling by the LDP had primed
voter discontent over the last decade. But Hashimoto's ultimate
downfall was indecisiveness and frequent reversals on economic
policy that undermined his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Japan is whether _ and how fast _ Hashimoto's
successor will commit to measures that many economists say are
needed: letting insolvent banks fail and cutting taxes to spur
demand while managing a colossal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors hope a fresh face will instill confidence and shake
things up. But skeptics say there is no credible leader in the
wings, and that whoever fills Hashimoto's shoes may be no more than
a transitional figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to change the people at the top to create change in
this country, and it's got to start today,'' declared Kenzo Uchida,
a politics professor at Tokai University in Kanagawa. ``But there
is nobody to replace Hashimoto and no political party to take the
LDP's place...so it will be difficult to achieve change. That is
the tragedy of Japanese politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a sell-off in shares followed news of the LDP's dramatic
defeat, but the benchmark Nikkei index rebounded after Hashimoto
stepped down, closing 1.7 percent up. The yen also recovered after
his resignation to hit 142.42 to the dollar by the end of the day
in Tokyo, up 1.09 yen from late Friday here.
</P>
<P>
   A newly strengthened opposition could thwart the LDP in order to
boost its own position. Conversely, it could force the LDP to adopt
more dramatic reforms than the conservative party might otherwise
support. For example, the Democratic Party of Japan wants at least
6 trillion yen ($42 billion) in tax cuts _ one-third more than the
LDP has proposed. If the LDP goes begging for allies in parliament,
it might have to bend to the opposition's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have repudiated Mr. Hashimoto, the LDP and the
long-standing system of government by bureaucrats,'' said DPJ
leader Naoto Kan. ``The people have lent an ear to what we said,
and they are giving us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of voters' anger against the LDP can hardly be
underestimated, but what will follow the upset at the polls is
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Tokashi Imai, chairman of Keidanren, the Japanese Federation of
Economic Organizations, an industry group traditionally allied with
the LDP, said: ``Voters believed voting against the LDP would be
the fastest and most extreme way to resolve the economic crisis.''
Hashimoto had no choice but to step down, he added, but ``we cannot
afford to have a vacuum in government.''
</P>
<P>
   When a moist-eyed Hashimoto announced Monday he would step aside
to take responsibility for the electoral drubbing, it was with
humility and barely restrained emotion, but without an explanation
for his policy flip-flops that so angered voters, nor with news of
who would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything rests on my shoulders and I was powerless to do
anything about it,'' he told reporters in a question-and-answer
session. ``(But) it is very necessary to try to tackle these
(economic) problems...There will not be a setback in the approach
to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The LDP hopes to nominate a candidate for prime minister with a
vote July 21 _ but Parliament is not expected to reconvene to
approve the nominee until after July 26, along with a new Cabinet
if Hashimoto's team steps down, as they are expected to. Hashimoto
cancelled a July 21 trip to Washington to discuss economic reform
efforts with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The top candidates to succeed Hashimoto appear to be Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, head of the largest faction in the LDP, and
former cabinet chief Seiroku Kajiyama, a free-market advocate and
the markets' favored choice.
</P>
<P>
   One strong faction of the LDP is backing party General Council
Chairman Yoshiro Mori for the job, according to Tuesday editions of
The Daily Yomiuri.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned have been former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
who has taken a lead role in economic reform, and Yohei Kono, a
former LDP chief. An underdog is Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, who saved social security from the axe when
other ministries endured deep cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the elections, the once stunningly-popular
Hashimoto had dropped to a 28.5 percent approval rating. In the
end, his waffling over the economy overshadowed his
accomplishments, a sign of rising public anger over Japan's first
recession in 23 years. As in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea,
where leaders or ruling parties were ousted in the last year amid
financial meltdowns, it was a sorry economy that ended Hashimoto's
2 1/2 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto did manage to bring about several significant reforms
during his tenure, including a ``Big Bang'' plan to open financial
markets by 2001. He also downsized the bureaucracy by cutting 22
ministries to 12, a near-miracle in a nation run by bureaucrats. He
also managed to stifle opposition to US military bases on Okinawa
by returning US-leased land to the local government.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto also instituted a series of unpopular policies,
including hiking the sales tax, cutting spending drastically and
bailing out failed loan companies in what was seen as favoritism
for cronies. In a reversal this year, he proposed a $127 billion
tax cut and spending package _ Japan's largest ever _ and a
``bridge bank'' plan that would allow weak banks to fail.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITTIER, Alaska _ On rare days when the clouds lift, it is
still hard to see why anyone would want to live in this toenail of
a port at the foot of a glacier on Prince William Sound. It rains
more than 15 feet a year _ and snows another 10 _ and the town has
the sort of why-bother feel that is common to places where snow
will soon cover whatever rusted appliance has been left to the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   But when the train departs, leaving Whittier alone at the edge
of the world, it is evident why 250 or so people have chosen to
live in a bombproof tower in a town that is an asterisk in World
War II history. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea
on the other, Whittier is that rare American town with no road
connecting it to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move here to get away from people,'' said Don Grande,
who has lived in Whittier for two years. ``But that's not going to
be the case anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, bulldozers and tunnel-boring machines, cranes with
bridge parts and trucks loaded with gravel growled a few miles
away, clawing a costly road to Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here say they do not want the road, but it is
favored by the tourism industry, and Alaska's powerful
congressional delegation. So state and federal taxpayers are
spending $70 million to build about five miles of road to a town
that got along without one for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the road is opened in two years, connecting Whittier to the
main highway running to Anchorage, state officials expect that 1.4
million people a year will use it. And then Whittier, a town with
one public bathroom and no gas station, will be, perhaps, not
unlike any other dot on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are so hidden here that if you turned out the
harbor lights you couldn't find us,'' said Carrie Williams, the
city manager, a title that is perhaps overblown for a burg that is
little more than a harbor and a 14-story apartment tower built to
take a hit by Japanese bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Whittier was a creation of the U.S. Army during World War II.
The military was looking for an ice-free, year-round port, close to
Anchorage, but one largely hidden from view. Whittier became a
staging area for the fierce fighting that eventually took place on
the Aleutian Islands, the only part of the United States to
experience ground battles during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Army built two towers to house men whose needs did not run
to high aesthetics, and then it blasted a path for a railroad track
through the mountains, over wetlands and on to Anchorage, about 45
miles away. One tower has been abandoned; it sits gray and
odd-looking against the gravel and scruffy alder bushes at the edge
of town.
</P>
<P>
   The other tower houses most of the residents of Whittier, as
well as City Hall, a country store, a travel agency and a church.
Its 3-foot-thick concrete walls withstood the 1964 earthquake _ the
strongest ever recorded in North America _ which sent tsunami waves
that destroyed other towns on Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The entire town looks something like a space colony on a planet
where it never stops raining.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Whittier had a peak population of more than a thousand.
When the Army pulled out in 1960, however, the town nearly died. It
has been revived by tourists, who stop here on ferry runs, or take
off from here in kayaks to explore the myriad wonders of Prince
William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Whittier has had splendid isolation _ a commodity
that has considerable value in Alaska, a big land with few roads.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the state, there are passionate struggles raging over
plans to build roads in places where none exist. To the southwest,
a plan supported by Alaska's congressional delegation would punch a
road through a protected wilderness area in Izembek National
Wildlife Refuge. The road would cost an estimated $40 million, and
if approved it would mark the first time that Congress has
authorized a road into an area designated as wilderness. Supporters
say it is needed to provide emergency access to a pair of small
villages on the outskirts of the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, another road is planned across the biggest wetland
on the West Coast _ the estuary of the Copper River Delta.
Fishermen, who rely on prodigious salmon runs on the Copper River
for a catch that has become world famous, have been staging
protests in opposition to the road. But supporters, led by Rep. Don
Young, R-Alaska, say the road is needed for loggers who plan to cut
down a large section of trees in the area.
</P>
<P>
   And a third road, which is planned for the nearly six million
acres of Denali National Park and Preserve, is being promoted by
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. Park officials say the money for
the road could be better spent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the road to Whittier is beyond the theoretical stage. It
will give residents of Anchorage, the home to half the population
of Alaska, a quick route to boat moorages on Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live here through the gloom and low clouds, the
dark and the isolation, do not seem to welcome the change, although
the town council is on record as favoring the road. ``I'm worried
it's going to pollute our salmon run,'' said Donna Lagod, who
operates an espresso stand near the railroad tracks. The train
comes to Whittier several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are worried about us losing our privacy,''
said Ms. Lagod. She was dressed in beach clothes on a day when it
was raining and the temperature was 50 degrees. ``But they've been
putting in all this fiber-optic cable, and that's pretty much taken
our privacy right there anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Whittier for 10 years, Tim Esmonde, is concerned
about the impact of all those people, RVs and campers backed up at
a place that has but one, nearly invisible hotel. ``Prince William
Sound is finally getting fixed from the Exxon Valdez oil spill and
now you're going to put all these people here with nowhere to go,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city manager, Ms. Williams, says there is no use fretting
about the lost Whittier way of life. ``It's coming, and change is
going to be radical,'' she said. ``We might as well try our best to
get ready for it. Sometimes, God forbid, you get what you asked
for.''

STEELWORKERS SUIT ASSAILS NAFTA AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United Steelworkers of America filed a lawsuit
against the federal government Monday, charging that the North
American Free Trade Agreement is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The steelworkers, along with the Made in the USA Foundation,
charge that NAFTA is a treaty and needed a two-thirds vote of the
Senate when it was passed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the Pittsburgh-based union, said
NAFTA must be retracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is to wipe NAFTA off the books clean,''
Becker said at a news conference. ``It was not constitutionally
adopted. Then let's negotiate trade agreements, but let's do it
with the understanding that we'll have input for the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups filed the lawsuit in the US District Court in
Northern Alabama, because, Becker said, workers there have been
hurt by NAFTA. A Steelworkers local that represents employees from
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in Gadsden, Ala., is also a plaintiff
in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks the court to decide whether NAFTA is a treaty,
and if it is, to retract the trade accord with Mexico and Canada
because it did not pass the Senate with the two-thirds vote needed
for treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Senate voted 61-38 to adopt NAFTA, and the House
approved it with a 234-200 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NAFTA is not a treaty, we can't imagine what would qualify
as a treaty,'' Becker said. ``NAFTA is a failed treaty. It has not
expanded the economy of the US, Canada, or Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA has turned out to ``betray the trust of workers and
families who bought into the dream of an improved economy,'' Becker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the Labor Department has certified that more than
180,000 US workers, including 7,400 from the Steelworkers union,
have been displaced by NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit attacks only the constitutionality of NAFTA, not
whether it is effective, said Carl Frankel, the union's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not in the lawsuit debate whether the treaty is good
or bad except to show we have been injured as a result of NAFTA,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Becker cited the loss of American jobs to cheaper
Mexican labor and unimproved conditions for Mexican workers.
</P>
<P>
   Joel D. Joseph, chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation, said
the nonprofit group promoting American products joined in the
lawsuit because NAFTA ``has not helped workers or consumers in the
United States, Canada, or Mexico, and because it was not enacted as
a treaty by the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups pointed to an article by Laurence H. Tribe, professor
of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, stating that NAFTA is
a treaty.
</P>

   NEW YORK _ The possibility of two fashion weeks in New York, one
of which might pre-empt the European shows, has taken on serious
proportions as Donna Karan, John Bartlett and Ralph Lauren say they
are considering showing their spring 1999 women's lines in New York
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Helmut Lang announced that he would show on Sept. 17
rather than during the regular New York shows, most of which are
scheduled for Oct. 31 through Nov. 6 in the tents in Bryant Park.
His announcement was followed the next day by Calvin Klein's saying
that he, too, would show early.
</P>
<P>
   The declarations seemed like the work of two titans going head
to head, with Klein having been stung by comments that he has been
unduly influenced by Lang's work. But now several American
designers are considering moving their dates forward. The benefits
would mean more attention _ and, they hope, more money _ from
retailers who tend to be most influenced by the Europeans, whom
they normally see first. There is also a matter of pride, as
American designers have been considered followers of European
trends since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely looking at it,'' said Patti Cohen, a senior
vice president for Donna Karan International. Ms. Cohen was in
meetings Monday trying to figure out whether the move is feasible.
``There's the mills, the fabrics that are due in. Each division is
now looking into what everyone would be responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett arrived in Italy Monday to check whether his samples
would be ready for an early showing.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Tesoro, a spokeswoman for Lauren, said that the designer
would consider changing if there is enough support for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it is likely that the tents in Bryant Park
will go up as scheduled. But Fern Mallis, the executive director of
Seventh on Sixth, the shows' producer, is concerned about the
impact two show weeks could have on the organization and the
industry. To move the shows would require coordination with their
sponsors and the Bryant Park Restoration Corp., which manages the
park. ``We sent out a letter last week, and the general consensus
is most people appreciate and like the idea, but it just can't be
done this quickly for most of the industry,'' Ms. Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Finley, the publisher of the New York Fashion Calendar,
which began more than 40 years ago, recalled that American
designers tried to show earlier about 10 years ago. ``A group of
designers pushed to have it to get the money,'' she said. ``Mollie
Parnis was one of the leaders. And it didn't work. The buyers
didn't want to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson in London
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Betsey Johnson plans to take her wares to London and
show during the ready-to-wear shows at the end of September. Ms.
Johnson opened her first store in England in April, at 106 Draycott
Ave. in the Knightsbridge section of London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Londoner at heart,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``It's a much
more frivolous, creative and personal design approach. I'm not the
only crazy one on the runway.''
</P>
<P>
   English designers are known for their eclectic approach to
design, and last season Ms. Johnson's fall show in New York, a
bawdy runway romp of lingerie-inspired clothes, was but another
chapter in her madcap runway book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson has not yet nailed down a time and location for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the excursion into London is to raise her
visibility throughout Europe in preparation for a more
mass-oriented collection than her popular Betsey Johnson and
higher-priced Ultra lines. She would not disclose the nature of the
venture, but there has been talk for some time that the designer
was in negotiations to introduce a jeans collection. Jeans would be
a natural next step for Ms. Johnson, whose body-conscious designs
are popular with the young and the youthful.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson said that she would return her show to New York next
year and that she supported the move by some designers to show
before the European designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our collections are open in the showroom three months before
we show them, so our English sales reps can have them to show
around in time in Europe,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``New York should
absolutely open early.''

HASHIMOTO DEPARTURE LEAVES MOUNTAIN OF PROBLEMS FOR JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Edgy financial markets and disgruntled voters cheered
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's resignation Monday after his
party's hammering at the polls, hopeful that his replacement would
succeed in reviving Japan's sluggish economy where Hashimoto had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems facing Japan are monumental _ from fixing a
banking system strapped with $550 billion in problem loans to
appeasing a population suffering the worst unemployment in postwar
history. Hashimoto's departure has set off a scramble to replace
him, but has failed to turn up a shining contender. The jockeying
within a weakened ruling party could also delay essential financial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But even if his notoriously snail-paced party finally makes a
commitment to consistent economic policies following its stunning
electoral defeat Sunday, passing legislation to tackle the mess may
be harder now.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party will retain its hold on power
through its dominance of the Lower House, but the party lacks a
majority in the Upper House. Rival parties picked up 17 seats the
LDP lost in the Upper House elections. It must now work feverishly
to find allies _ at a time when the opposition wants to distance
itself from a discredited establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread corruption and pork-barrelling by the LDP had primed
voter discontent over the last decade. But Hashimoto's ultimate
downfall was indecisiveness and frequent reversals on economic
policy that undermined his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Japan is whether _ and how fast _ Hashimoto's
successor will commit to measures that many economists say are
needed: letting insolvent banks fail and cutting taxes to spur
demand while managing a colossal deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors hope a fresh face will instill confidence and shake
things up. But skeptics say there is no credible leader in the
wings, and that whoever fills Hashimoto's shoes may be no more than
a transitional figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to change the people at the top to create change in
this country, and it's got to start today,'' declared Kenzo Uchida,
a politics professor at Tokai University in Kanagawa. ``But there
is nobody to replace Hashimoto and no political party to take the
LDP's place...so it will be difficult to achieve change. That is
the tragedy of Japanese politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a sell-off in shares followed news of the LDP's dramatic
defeat, but the benchmark Nikkei index rebounded after Hashimoto
stepped down, closing 1.7 percent up. The yen also recovered after
his resignation to hit 142.42 to the dollar by the end of the day
in Tokyo, up 1.09 yen from late Friday here.
</P>
<P>
   A newly strengthened opposition could thwart the LDP in order to
boost its own position. Conversely, it could force the LDP to adopt
more dramatic reforms than the conservative party might otherwise
support. For example, the Democratic Party of Japan wants at least
6 trillion yen ($42 billion) in tax cuts _ one-third more than the
LDP has proposed. If the LDP goes begging for allies in parliament,
it might have to bend to the opposition's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have repudiated Mr. Hashimoto, the LDP and the
long-standing system of government by bureaucrats,'' said DPJ
leader Naoto Kan. ``The people have lent an ear to what we said,
and they are giving us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of voters' anger against the LDP can hardly be
underestimated, but what will follow the upset at the polls is
still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Tokashi Imai, chairman of Keidanren, the Japanese Federation of
Economic Organizations, an industry group traditionally allied with
the LDP, said: ``Voters believed voting against the LDP would be
the fastest and most extreme way to resolve the economic crisis.''
Hashimoto had no choice but to step down, he added, but ``we cannot
afford to have a vacuum in government.''
</P>
<P>
   When a moist-eyed Hashimoto announced Monday he would step aside
to take responsibility for the electoral drubbing, it was with
humility and barely restrained emotion, but without an explanation
for his policy flip-flops that so angered voters, nor with news of
who would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything rests on my shoulders and I was powerless to do
anything about it,'' he told reporters in a question-and-answer
session. ``(But) it is very necessary to try to tackle these
(economic) problems...There will not be a setback in the approach
to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The LDP hopes to nominate a candidate for prime minister with a
vote July 21 _ but Parliament is not expected to reconvene to
approve the nominee until after July 26, along with a new Cabinet
if Hashimoto's team steps down, as they are expected to. Hashimoto
cancelled a July 21 trip to Washington to discuss economic reform
efforts with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The top candidates to succeed Hashimoto appear to be Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi, head of the largest faction in the LDP, and
former cabinet chief Seiroku Kajiyama, a free-market advocate and
the markets' favored choice.
</P>
<P>
   One strong faction of the LDP is backing party General Council
Chairman Yoshiro Mori for the job, according to Tuesday editions of
The Daily Yomiuri.
</P>
<P>
   Also mentioned have been former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
who has taken a lead role in economic reform, and Yohei Kono, a
former LDP chief. An underdog is Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi, who saved social security from the axe when
other ministries endured deep cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the elections, the once stunningly-popular
Hashimoto had dropped to a 28.5 percent approval rating. In the
end, his waffling over the economy overshadowed his
accomplishments, a sign of rising public anger over Japan's first
recession in 23 years. As in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea,
where leaders or ruling parties were ousted in the last year amid
financial meltdowns, it was a sorry economy that ended Hashimoto's
2 1/2 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto did manage to bring about several significant reforms
during his tenure, including a ``Big Bang'' plan to open financial
markets by 2001. He also downsized the bureaucracy by cutting 22
ministries to 12, a near-miracle in a nation run by bureaucrats. He
also managed to stifle opposition to US military bases on Okinawa
by returning US-leased land to the local government.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto also instituted a series of unpopular policies,
including hiking the sales tax, cutting spending drastically and
bailing out failed loan companies in what was seen as favoritism
for cronies. In a reversal this year, he proposed a $127 billion
tax cut and spending package _ Japan's largest ever _ and a
``bridge bank'' plan that would allow weak banks to fail.

ZAPRUDER FILM RELEASED TO STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ They are 26 seconds of infamy, the rolling film
of a national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Dallas dressmaker Abraham Zapruder's horrific home
movie of President John F. Kennedy's assassination has been locked
in the National Archives, off limits to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   But to the anguish of Kennedy supporters and the anticipation of
conspiracy buffs, thousands of digitally enhanced videtapes of
Zapruder's historic recording of Kennedy's slaying are bound this
week for the ``new release'' shelves of the nation's video stores.
</P>
<P>
   An American tragedy for sale: $19.98 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Billed by Zapruder's heirs as a public service to satisfy
unrelenting demand for the film, the videotapes will make widely
available for the first time the most gruesome image of the
assassination: the instant when Lee Harvey Oswald's bullet struck
the president's head.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, captured on frame 313 of the 500-frame film, has
rarely, if ever, been shown by television networks, although it has
been available for years on illegal, bootleg copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think US culture cannot be degraded any further,
something like this comes along,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, a
long-time Kennedy ally who was Robert F. Kennedy's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, who died in 1970, was hoping to capture an image of
Kennedy for his grandchildren when he raised his Bell &AMP; Howell
movie camera in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, as the
presidential motorcade approached. His hands shaking, Zapruder
recorded the closest and most vivid film of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The footage was scrutinized by the Warren Commission, whose 1964
report concluded that Oswald acted alone when he shot Kennedy from
the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building.
</P>
<P>
   That finding has long been challenged by many conspiracy
theorists, and the newly released videotapes could become the stuff
of a new wave of assassination questions. The footage, digitally
enhanced at an estimated cost of $500,000, provides a fuller
picture of the killing than has been available before, including
images between the original film's sprocket holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see images no one ever saw before, like extra people in
the motorcade and extra movement by the Secret Service,'' said
Natalie Olinger, a spokesman for MPI Home Video of Orland Park,
Ill., which collaborated with Zapruder's heirs on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute video, titled ``Image of an Assassination: A New
Look at the Zapruder Film,'' includes a 40-minute documentary about
the ``preservation and restoration'' of the Zapruder film and shows
numerous images of the bullet striking Kennedy's head. Olinger said
the production company, which will split the proceeds equally with
Zapruder's heirs, hopes to sell 200,000 copies of the video.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy said, ``The Kennedy
family has chosen not to comment'' on the video release.
</P>
<P>
   However, family supporters said the development was deeply
painful to the Kennedys and expressed dismay at the prospect of the
grisly footage becoming a form of mass entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing but titillation,'' Mankiewicz said. ``I'm
surprised they don't get the film of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey
Oswald and run it as a second feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Olinger defended the video release. ``The story is not meant to
hurt the Kennedy family in any way,'' she said, ``but John F.
Kennedy was our president and people have a right to see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zapruder sold Life magazine the rights to the footage
in 1963 for $50,000, he made clear before he died that he did not
want to use the film to exploit Kennedy's death commercially. James
L. Silverberg, a lawyer for Zapruder's heirs, including his son and
daughter, Henry and Myrna, said they share that desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done with the expectation that the Zapruder family
would have invested a substantial amount of money in order to
answer a public need,'' Silverberg said, referring to demand for
the footage.
</P>
<P>
   The Assassination Record Review Board ruled last year that the
original Zapruder film should be part of its permanent records.
Since then, the Zapruder family, which maintains copyrights to the
film, has been negotiating how much the government will compensate
them for the footage.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered $3 million. But the Zapruders, citing
appraisals as high as $70 million, are asking for $18 million.

   French impeccable &QL; 
as World Cup hosts
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ With all due respect to Les Bleus, the real French heroes
are les verts.
</P>
<P>
   Beating Brazil to win France's first World Cup is one thing.
Cleaning up the mess after Brazil has been beaten and that first
World Cup won, however, is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is when I went to bed in the wee hours Monday
morning, the party of this half-century raged on unabated. Yet in
the final victory of this emotional Coupe du Monde, by 7:30 a.m.
the boulevards and avenues where millions had swarmed were already
trash-free. I swear to goodness, there wasn't a piece of litter to
be seen anywhere, and it was drizzling to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the men in green, Paris' hard-working garbage collectors,
had trumped the Blues. And to think they'll just have to start all
over again Wednesday morning, following today's Bastille Day bash.
Allez, verts!
</P>
<P>
   This World Cup, then, would be a start-to-finish triumph for the
home team. On every front, victory can be declared, from critical
acclaim for the Stade de France _ the planet's most beautiful
sports stadium _ to France's breakthrough on the soccer pitch to
the massive tidying-up effort afterward.
</P>
<P>
   No real trace of danger
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many dire warnings about France's scary
vulnerability to terrorist actions, none materialized. The closest
thing to trouble I saw was when the CRS, France's national police,
blew up an unattended bag at Charles De Gaulle Airport one Saturday
morning. Even that had the feel of a fete to it.
</P>
<P>
   And the imposing, occasionally ominous CRS presence
notwithstanding, the cops were always quick to give advice or
directions. The only really foul behavior, not surprisingly, was
the result of the idiots barging in from across (and under) the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, a mob of a million-plus delirious fans taking to the
streets late Sunday night didn't produce a body count or do
irreparable harm to the local monuments. A comparable number of
Yankees fans would have torn down the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   So the French people, as underrated as their rubbish collectors,
came through in smashing style, actually surpassing the efforts of
the footballers representing them. And while, no, not everyone was
polite, not everyone is polite in New York, either.
</P>
<P>
   Or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's John P. Lopez was hopelessly lost in Bordeaux
late one night. Seeking help in getting to his hotel, he found only
one place open, a small bar on a narrow, deserted street where a
half-dozen surly-looking men were still drinking. Madam bartender
had the obligatory tattoo and only the slightest comprehension of
the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within half an hour, Lopez had seven new friends and a taxi
waiting at the door.
</P>
<P>
   George Vecsey of the New York Times misplaced his press pass, an
almost insurmountable faux pas given FIFA's ponderous and arrogant
bureaucracy. One of the aforementioned street sweepers, however,
found it lying amid the refuse and immediately phoned the Times'
office here to inquire how he might return it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. inferior, but that's OK
</P>
<P>
   Memo to you tourists planning a visit to Paris, or anywhere in
France: Forget everything you've heard about how difficult the
French are. They're terrific, save for the cigarette smoke. Be
polite _ deferential won't hurt; smile when smiled at; and always
stay patient if the natives don't understand you.
</P>
<P>
   As the guest, you are obliged to find a way to understand them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is what befell the U.S.'s long-vanquished soccer
team. Our lads just didn't get it either, and, as I have noted
previously, they probably never will. The demographics of the
current team, which performed at a level inferior to any of the
other 31 to reach France, suggest our being competitive in, never
mind winning, the Japan-South Korea World Cup in 2002 is only a
remote possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Which is perfectly OK, as I have previously noted. We don't need
soccer, and soccer doesn't need us. We can get enough kicks from
the Super Bowl, the World Series, et al., and let the rest of the
planet have the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Although we would like to believe the approval of the almighty
U.S. market is essential for anything to be judged significant, the
delirious mobs that partied down all night long on the Champs
Elyses would seem to suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Brazil's Ronaldo is 21 years old and earns the equivalent
of $10 million per year already. France's 25-year-old superstar
Zinedine Zidane, among others, isn't way behind. You think they're
worried about selling soccer to the American people?
</P>
<P>
   It's a great game. It just isn't our game. No biggie. Vive la
diffrence!
</P>
<P>
   And again, vive les verts! I could use a few of those guys
around my house.

   `Dirty bits' included in Showtime's `Lolita'
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: Georg is cq)
</P>
<P>
   By Lyle V. Harris
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Oscar winner Jeremy Irons remembers the first
time he read ``Lolita,'' the 1954 Vladimir Nabokov novel about a
middle-aged professor's sexual obsession with a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it when I was 18 and I was looking for the dirty
bits,'' Irons recalled via satellite from England during a press
interview before the nation's TV critics meeting here to preview
the upcoming fall season. ``But there are no dirty bits in this
novel, and that's what's surprising about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said, however, for director Adrian Lyne's
adaptation of ``Lolita,'' which premieres Aug. 2 on Showtime. (The
film is being shown before that in a New York theater to qualify it
for possible Oscar nominations.) For that and other reasons,
``Lolita'' has become one of the biggest, and most controversial,
movies of the new television season.
</P>
<P>
   Made for theatrical release, the movie was held up two years
because of concerns it might offend moviegoers. Its $58 million
price tag makes it the most expensive film ever made for cable, and
director Lyne's reputation raised concerns that he would turn the
classic novel about a complex and disturbing relationship into an
exploitative sex romp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie in places is erotic,'' said Lyne, whose films
include ``9 1/2 Weeks,'' ``Flashdance'' and ``Fatal Attraction.''
``But for a movie to be erotic, it doesn't have to have acres of
flesh. I think some people will be judging me rather than the
movie. But it's not the salacious piece of work they expect it to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Irons says he wasn't worried about Lyne, but had doubts about
the subject matter. When Lyne asked him to play Lolita's older
lover, Humbert Humbert, he turned him down _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   Irons said he realized that his decision was based on trying to
be ``politically correct'' and he eventually changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Dominique Swain, 17, who stars in the title role, said
she never felt uncomfortable on the set of ``Lolita,'' especially
since her mother was always nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Swain, a high school senior who resembles Marcia of ``The Brady
Bunch'' and talks like a total Valley Girl, said, ``I think Adrian
did a pretty good job of keeping me from being corrupted by this
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime programming chief Jerry Offsay said he hasn't been
inundated by complaints about ``Lolita'' _ nor is he expecting
many. Offsay said another movie about child sexual abuse, ``Bastard
Out of Carolina,'' was far more disturbing. Showtime aired
``Bastard'' last season after TNT (and reportedly then-owner Ted
Turner) deemed some scenes too graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got five phone calls (about 'Lolita'). One person asked
me why I'm promoting pedophilia and another woman said she was
praying for me,'' Offsay said. ``I'm sure there will be some people
who will be unhappy. But we invite people who are criticizing the
movie to first see the film. It's a responsible, intelligent
treatment of a difficult subject.''

   Reid sets up bar again
</P>
<P>
   The new Showtime sitcom ``Lincs'' is set in a big-city bar where
everybody knows your name, the waitress is sassy and the owner has
a raffish charm. But no matter what you do, don't ask producer Tim
Reid if he's is trying for the black ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want do do is explode the myths that blacks are
monolithic, that we're either in prison or in Princeton,'' says
Reid of the show set in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Williams (Mr. X on ``The X-Files'') stars in the title
role as outspoken black conservative Russell Lincoln, Pam Grier as
lusciously liberal children's rights activist Eleanor Winthrop and
Georg Stanford Brown as Johnnie B. Good, a morally challenged
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said she was excited to be reunited with Reid, who cast
her on his critically acclaimed but long-defunct CBS sitcom
``Frank's Place.'' Reid admitted that he also played favorites when
looking for actors to star in his new half-hour sitcom, which
debuts Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife (Daphne) plays the hooker on the show, and yes, she
slept with me to get the part.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie does `Baby Dance'
</P>
<P>
   A very pregnant Jodie Foster waddled into the convention to
promote ``Baby Dance,'' a Showtime movie about a wealthy infertile
couple trying to adopt a baby from a pair living in a trailer park.
Foster called her imminent motherhood (she's due in September) and
her decision to produce the movie ``a coincidence.'' But she says
the movie made her ``obsess a little bit more'' about parenthood.
Commenting on her success as a director, producer and Oscar-winning
actress, Foster called herself ``the luckiest white girl in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lust in the dust
</P>
<P>
   Proving again that kids say the darnedest things, ``Lolita''
star Dominique Swain dissed El Paso, Texas, which experienced
severe weather while the movie was filming there. Swain described
the event that delayed shooting as a ``dust storm in the hick
bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The gang's all here
</P>
<P>
   Ray Liotta stars as Frank Sinatra in HBO's unauthorized biopic
``The Rat Pack,'' about the coolest cats America has ever known,
scheduled for August. Don Cheadle plays Sammy Davis Jr. with Joe
Montegna as Dean Martin and William Petersen as John F. Kennedy.
Asked what qualified him to play ``The Voice,'' Liotta paused for a
few seconds and said, ``I've got blue eyes and I'm from New Jersey.
That seemed to be enough.''

 &HT;    Georgia air waves polluted with political commercials
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is making TV stations rich, giving campaign
strategists headaches, and driving some viewers crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It's political ad clutter, and it has become a nightly feature
on local TV newscasts across Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the July 21 primary elections, a record number
of candidates are relying on TV to get their messages to voters.
The main reasons are the increased strength of the Republican
party, resulting in heated GOP primaries, and an explosion of TV
advertising by candidates for lieutenant governor and other
``down-ballot'' offices.
</P>
<P>
   One media strategist said the glut of political ads is unusual
for a major TV market like Atlanta, where a 30-second spot on an
evening newscast can cost as much as $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clutter will rival any state's clutter, any time,'' said
Raymond Strother, a consultant who produced his first political ad
three decades ago and is working in Georgia this year for Rep. Roy
Barnes, a Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as bad as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   There are seven Republican and Democratic candidates for
lieutenant governor trying to reach voters on TV this week,
compared to just three Democrats before the 1990 primary, the last
time an incumbent wasn't running.
</P>
<P>
   Six gubernatorial hopefuls from both parties are also on TV,
along with candidates for attorney general, labor commissioner and
the state Supreme Court. Michael Coles, a Democratic candidate for
U.S. Senate, also launched a 60-second biographical ad this week.
</P>
<P>
   The clutter is thickest on the local evening news shows, where
as many as five 30-second political ads can be jammed together
during a commercial break.
</P>
<P>
   TV news is normally considered a good advertising slot for
political campaigns, because people who watch the news are more
likely to vote than those who don't. But with so many ads on the
air this year, campaigns fear that their messages are getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much stuff on TV, people are learning not to
notice information,'' U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with voters around the state, several said they
were turned off by the barrage of ads this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost at the point of throwing a shoe at the TV, it's
that bad,'' said Rowena Wall of Warner Robins.
</P>
<P>
   If the sheer number of ads wasn't confusing enough, the
similarities in the messages would be. Because there has been very
little negative advertising so far, most of the ads have stuck to
themes such as improving education, slashing taxes or cracking down
on criminals. After watching several in a row, it's hard for many
voters to remember which candidate said what.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so confusing, there's nobody that really stands out,''
said Charles Wise, a retiree who lives near Blue Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike
Bowers decided to launch his broadcast ad campaign by attacking
racial quotas and preferences, according to his campaign spokesman,
Bill Crane. Bowers also will debut a new ad Tuesday featuring his
wife, Bette Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers had produced commercials dealing with crime, taxes and
education, Crane said. But by the time he was able to buy TV time,
other candidates including his GOP rival Guy Millner had already
been talking about those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an arena where you have a half-dozen candidates for
governor, and even more for lieutenant governor, trying to reach
voters in a 10-day window, you have to do things a little
differently to break out of the pack,'' said Crane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we needed to speak to issues that were outside
of the norm.''

 &HT;    Georgia court gives OK to link violent films, acts
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ultra-violent movies like ``Natural Born Killers'' and
``Menace II Society'' may be shown during murder trials to prove
defendants were inspired by Hollywood to commit real mayhem, the
Georgia Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence of a movie in a criminal defendant's possession which
depicts the conduct with which the defendant is charged may be
admissible to show the defendant's bent of mind,'' Justice Harris
Hines wrote in a 4-3 decision upholding a Worth County murder
conviction and dismissing claims the movie prejudiced the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this decision is not unprecedented, it's certainly
unusual,'' said professor Robert Pugsley from Southwestern
University School of Law in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the Worth County case, jurors watched the grisly opening
sequence of ``Menace II Society,'' a film that defendant Gerald
Nathaniel Rushin watched at least five times. The film opens with
character ``O-dog'' fatally shooting two convenience store clerks
and taking the store's surveillance videotape. Rushin shot and
killed a store clerk in 1995 and took the surveillance tape.
</P>
<P>
   The court also upheld Ronnie Jack Beasley Jr.'s murder
conviction in Toombs County. Beasley and his girlfriend had watched
``Natural Born Killers'' an estimated 20 times. In the movie, 52
people are killed by a man and woman on a three-month crime spree.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley sometimes referred to himself as ``the Natural.'' The
jury watched the entire movie during his trial for a murder
committed in a 1995 robbery. ``The visceral impact that one
experiences in seeing a mindless, blood-thirsty film like 'Natural
Born Killers' can have a far-reaching, inflammatory impact,'' said
Pugsley. ``You're also taking a truly monstrous example, a
caricature, and showing this person kill 52 while asking the jury
to convict the defendant of killing only one. This constitutes, no
pun intended, overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Torre, director of the Georgia Film and Video Commission,
said, ``This ruling doesn't sit well with me. If an individual is
going to commit a crime, I don't think it takes a movie to do it.
The same can be said for books and video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Norman Fletcher wrote dissents to both rulings, saying
the violence in the movies was prejudicial and unnecessary in light
of corroborating evidence. ``The movie thus served as a dramatic
state witness who blurred fact and fiction but who was not subject
to cross-examination,'' Fletcher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In Rushin's case, the store surveillance film was recovered and
used to rebut his contention that the killing was accidental. For
this reason, ``The real purpose of the movie was to provide a more
explicit visual picture of the state's theory that Rushin committed
crimes similar to the movie's crimes,'' Fletcher said. ``In
contrast to the store videotape, which had only fuzzy black images
and ended before the shooting, the movie presented a clear and
colorful image of two senseless murders.''

MARK STROHMEYER, ACCOUNTANT, AMATEUR ARCHEOLOGIST; AT 45 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Allen Strohmeyer of Watertown, Mass., an accountant and
amateur archeologist who found meaning in stoneworks he claimed
were constructed by Native Americans, died of liver failure
Saturday in Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Strohmeyer was born in Boston and raised in Bethlehem, Pa.
He graduated from Boston University in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Active in Boston public-housing circles, he was a teacher at
Casa del Sol, an agency serving Latinos in the South End; and an
accountant for the Justice Resource Institute and the Committee for
Boston Public Housing.
</P>
<P>
   Though most archeologists discounted his theories, he spent much
time exploring local rock formations and discussing his findings
with local historical groups.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn of the winter solstice on Dec. 21, 1996, Mr. Strohmeyer
was hunkered down in the potato cave in Acton, Mass., a slab-roofed
chamber set into the hillside above Nashoba Brook, studying what he
thought was an ancient astronomical observatory. ``Every time I
come in here, I'm still in awe of these huge slabs,'' he said in a
story published in the Globe on Jan. 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The potato cave is entered through a long crawl space that opens
into a chamber large enough to stand in. It is supported on one
side by a column of stones that has a small crevice opening to the
morning sun. At dawn on Dec. 21, Mr. Strohmeyer said, a beam of
light shone through the crevice and illuminated a spot just below a
large stone of quartz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the shortest day of the year; then the sun comes back and
the light comes back,'' he said. ``It's an event that's observed
throughout the world, and the Indians here saw the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He also studied a network of stone rows, mounds, and chambers
from Billerica, Mass. to Boxborough, Mass., which he believed
native people constructed to celebrate the earth. ``There are
stoneworks that are staggering in their beauty and their
construction,'' he said. ``It's right in your back yard. The whole
question is seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also found meaning in certain large boulders and outcroppings
in Great Brook State Park in Carlisle, Mass. At Mr. Strohmeyer's
prodding, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management
commissioned a study of the site in 1995. The study found no
evidence that Native Americans constructed anything on the site.
However, Native American consultants told the study's authors that
a large boulder on the site that is shaped like a turtle _ the
Native American symbol of creation _ and topped with a pine tree _
the Native American symbol of peace _ was considered sacred.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two sons, Fernando Vitol and Andres Colby, both of
Watertown; his parents, John and Nancy (Jordan) Strohmeyer of
Anchorage; a brother, John of Bloomfield, Mich.; a sister, Sarah
Strohmeyer Merriman of Middlesex, Vt.; and his former wife, Beatriz
McConnie Zapater of Boston.

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Tens of thousands of Orange Order
Protestants walked peacefully Monday in several hundred parades
throughout Northern Ireland, after a week of Protestant violence
over patriotic marches in Catholic neighborhoods and the death of
three young Catholic brothers in an arson attack.
</P>
<P>
   In what was taken to be a reaction to the killing of the boys on
Sunday, the level of violence in the British province on Sunday
night and Monday was low, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear yesterday, after those murders, an awful lot of
people did reflect on what is happening, and it is absolutely
appalling that it should take that to make some people see where
they potentially were heading,'' a spokesman for Prime Minister
Tony Blair said in London. ``The vast majority are making it clear
they will not tolerate violence, that that is the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence had threatened the peace pact approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   The situation grew tenser after the boys had been killed in a
fire that the police said was the work of Protestants in the
predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney, 40 miles north of
Belfast. Today, as the boys became virtual martyrs in the eyes of
Catholics, and some Protestants, the tension seemed to ebb. But
they could rise again in nighttime demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   A march that led to violence in the past passed calmly through a
Catholic area in Belfast this morning. To honor the dead boys,
Catholics did not resist. One leader, John Gormley, said, ``We
thought it would be a good tactic, as well as good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange parades, held annually to celebrate the victory in
1690 of the Protestant William of Orange over his Catholic
father-in-law, King James II, had threatened to cause further
disturbances. The Protestant violence began after a British
government commission had forbade Orangemen to march through a
Catholic area in Portadown, 35 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   For a week protesters in the Drumcree area of Portadown attacked
with gasoline bombs, rocks and ball-bearings hurled from
slingshots. Hundreds of police officers and British troops blocked
the Protestants and kept them from Catholic Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters across the province also hijacked and burned dozens
of cars and blocked scores of major roads. But the Orange Order's
case seemed substantially weakened, as public support, even among
Protestants, seemed to drop after the arson attack.
</P>
<P>
   An Orange leader, the Rev. William Bingham, chaplain of the
Portadown unit, urged an end to the protest at Drumcree, saying,
``No road is worth a life.'' Some Orangemen denounced him as a
traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Robin Eames, the Protestant Primate of the Church of
Ireland, said, ``What is being done in the name of Protestantism is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The churchmen's view was echoed by other prominent Orangemen,
including David Trimble, the First Minister of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, which is supposed to enact changes to give the
Catholic minority added power.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party,
raised his arm in triumph after joining the Drumcree march. The
gesture enhanced his image among Protestants and led, ultimately,
to his post as First Minister. In that post he is committed to
cooperate with Catholic officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen at Drumcree said that they were not responsible
for the killings or the widespread Protestant mob violence and that
they would continue their protest until they were allowed to march
through the Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   The police in Ballymoney arrested two men, whom they did not
identify, for questioning in the arson that killed the Quinns _

<P>
   Monday afternoon at Drumcree, about 1,500 Orangemen and
supporters continued to face the police and soldiers across the
barbed-wire and concrete barriers blocking the way to the Catholic
area.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 parades Monday, only one was considered highly
volatile, along a Catholic stretch of Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast.
The march, after a delay caused by bomb hoaxes, began in heavy rain
at about 8:40 a.m. A government parade commission authorized the
march after having banned it for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Ormeau Road has been a flash point since the 1992 march,
when Orangemen passing the Catholics raised their hands with five
fingers spread wide at the crowd. The gesture was a brutal,
gloating reminder that several months earlier Protestant gunmen had
shot dead five Catholics in front of a bookmaker's shop on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   This morning 200 quiet men, most in black suits and orange
stoles, many wearing black bowlers, marched briskly to the beat of
a large drum. The fife-and-drum band, which traditionally played
martial music that angers Catholics, was silent by order of the
parade commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the Catholics did not, as they have in the past, sit down in
the road, confront the police separating them from the parade or
hurl rocks and bottles at the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Quinn family said although the three brothers
would be buried Tuesday in a Catholic cemetery after a funeral
Mass, they had not been raised as practicing Catholics. Their
mother, Christine, the friends said, had sent them to a
predominantly Protestant school so that they would be assimilated
with the largely Protestant population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were raised both Catholic and Protestant,'' said an
uncle, Robert Patton, a Protestant. Their father, John Dillon, who
is estranged from their mother, arrived from England, where he
lives, for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was quoted by The Irish News, a respected Belfast
newspaper favored by Catholics, as having said that Protestant
militants ``chased me to England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys and their mother came back last year,'' he added. ``I
still live in England. So they go after the wee ones.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ Politicians began jockeying on Monday for the chance to
play chief surgeon to the world's second-largest economy after
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, saying he was
responsible for his party's disastrous finish in parliamentary
elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's resignation left a political vacuum at the economic
heart of Asia, sending stocks and currencies reeling across the
continent and triggering fears that another chapter could be
beginning in the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden and unexpected nature of the political upheaval here
was underscored when Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko of Russia
arrived in Tokyo on Monday morning for a visit with Hashimoto. It
was the first such visit ever by a Russian prime minister, and it
seemed sensible enough when Kiriyenko left Moscow, but by the time
he stepped off the plane in Tokyo, Hashimoto was history.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto also had to cancel plans for a state visit to the
United States later this month.
</P>
<P>
   A new prime minister is expected to be chosen in the next week
and installed on about July 30, after intensive horse-trading in
the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But the election has left some wondering whether Japan is on a
transition toward a two-party system that will change the character
not just of the party but also of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That is subject to debate, but there seems little doubt that the
election has already left the party with a reduced ability to
govern and with a handful of prime ministerial candidates who
represent precisely the old school of politics that the voters
decisively rejected on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hashimoto is one of the best that the LDP can produce,'' said
Takashi Inoguchi, a political scientist at Tokyo University.
``Unless someone terribly fresh and surprising comes along, it's
hard to see how the next prime minister can handle the issues head
on and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``To handle the problems efficiently, you need a fresh, strong
and decisive leader, but they are very hard to find. So we'll have
to muddle through with less than competent political leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of a new prime minister for Japan is of intense
interest around Asia, for Japan is seen as the key to overcoming
the region's crisis. Its economy is eight times as big as China's
and twice as big as all the rest of Asia's put together, and it has
contributed far more to bail-out packages than the United States or
any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the race is a bit difficult, however, for the last
thing candidates do is express interest in the job. Instead, if one
is asked if one is interested, it is deemed polite to assume a
pained expression and rush away without answering _ which is
precisely what the front-runner, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, did
on Monday when reporters raised the issue outside his home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While in the United States the metaphor for becoming a candidate
is to toss one's hat into the ring, in Japanese it is to be an
omikoshi, a portable shrine. Just as throngs of revelers together
carry an omikoshi on their shoulders in exuberant street festivals,
so the candidate is supposed to be carried by supporters into the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, of course, the candidates are a bit different from
other omikoshi: they desperately scramble for shoulders to carry
them, and in some cases they even pay party officials huge sums in
exchange for support.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, 61, is the leading candidate largely because he heads
the largest faction in the party and is respected for his
affability. But critics say that while he may not have enemies, he
also has no policies or initiatives, and it would be difficult to
find someone less charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender is Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, a much more outspoken
and controversial party elder. He has some support, because he has
consistently urged a more aggressive posture in tackling Japan's
economic problems, but he has also made missteps over the years.
</P>
<P>
   A possible compromise is Kiichi Miyazawa, 78, a former prime
minister who is respected for his command of financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto, in announcing his resignation, declined to endorse a
successor. His face grim and his eyes moist, he urged his
successors to continue his policies of rectifying Japan's finances
and restructuring government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proposed a number of reforms that are painful to
people,'' Hashimoto said, apparently referring to such measures as
his increase of the national sales tax. ``I realize that there are
various objections to this. But I did my best on these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the biggest reason was for his defeat, Hashimoto
scarcely paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally my fault,'' he said. ``I lacked ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto will remain a caretaker prime minister until his
successor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the new leader's central tasks will be to shore up not
only the country but also his party. The elections on Sunday for
the upper house of Parliament were a major blow to the party, as it
won only 44 seats out of the 126 contested.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worrying for the Liberal Democrats were the hints
that Japan might be moving toward a Western-style system in which
two political parties alternately hold power. For decades, Japan
has been a multiparty democracy in form, but the reality has been
something closer to a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is surely changing,'' Takao Toshikawa, publisher of a
political newsletter in Tokyo. ``We're moving toward a two-party
party system.''
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have been saying that for a number of years, and it
never came true in the past, even in similar circumstances. In the
1989 elections for the upper house, for instance, the Liberal
Democrats suffered an even worse defeat, which was widely seen as a
sign of fundamental change. Then tides quickly shifted again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest result also indicated that a two-party system may
be emerging. The main opposition group, the Democratic Party,
consolidated its status by winning big in the election, gaining
respectability and legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the proportional representation part of the ballot,
the Democrats won 22 percent of the vote, only just behind the
Liberal Democrats, who got 25 percent. The balance was divided
among a profusion of small opposition parties, and if some of them
join forces with the Democrats _ as the Democrats hope _ then the
opposition would be theoretically able to outvote the Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is poorly organized. Its greatest asset is
Naoto Kan, a dynamic former Cabinet minister who is by far the most
popular politician in the country. The Liberal Democrats are
fretting that they have no one with close to the appeal of Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor is that disaffected citizens once simply did
not bother to vote. But this time, exit polls indicate, the
disaffected turned up at the polls _ and voted against the Liberal
Democrats. Voter turnout surged from 44 percent in the last
election for the upper house to 59 percent this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time is extremely different from past elections, both
upper house and lower house elections,'' Toshikawa said. ``This
time, people were motivated to vote because of the economic
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the election suggests that the Liberal Democrats
are relying on a dwindling power base. They won their seats
primarily in the rural areas that are losing population and
influence, and they were demolished in the urban areas, failing to
win a single district in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe or Nagano. In urban
areas, even the Communists did better than the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuyuki Hamada, a political commentator in Tokyo, said that the
challenge will be for the Democratic Party to unite the fragmented
opposition, but that if this happens, the impact on Japan will be
historic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to put aside their differences and work together,''
Hamada said of the opposition parties. ``It's a life-or-death
moment for Japan. If they fail, in the 21st century Japan will
drift along and we will have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and Western analysts, even those in the Liberal
Democratic Party, often emphasize the importance of a nurturing a
two-party system as the best way to create a responsive political
structure to lead the nation. For now, Japan in some respects
resembles a one-party state, with a familiar pattern of political
corruption and stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many say that it would be difficult to restructure the
Liberal Democratic Party and make it more forward-looking unless it
is evicted and kept from power for some time. Just as the best
thing that happened to the British Labor Party was the
introspection and change triggered by its years in the political
wilderness, the thinking goes, the only way to refocus the Liberal
Democratic Party may be to exile it from power.

MICROSOFT OFFERS HOME-BUYING SERVICES SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. launched Monday a new Internet site -- called
HomeAdvisor -- that touts an array of home buying services, from
listings and primers on the purchase process to demographic data on
local neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may also connect with lenders through the site, a
service that allows Microsoft to collect a minimal fee for acting
as a mortgage broker.
</P>
<P>
   The software giant's entry into the home buying business has
rekindled a debate over the propriety of home listings in an
increasingly crowded and competitive on-line marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of some critics, the site does not include homes
that are for-sale by owners, though it does claim to have about
400,000 Realtor-listed homes displayed.
</P>
<P>
   With a paucity of homes listed on its site, it's not clear
whether Microsoft will be able to make a dent in the real estate
market. After proposing an alliance with Massachusetts' largest
real estate listing service recently, the latest entrant into the
cyber real estate market was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: MLS Property Information Network Inc. already has a
relationship with realtor.com, which with 1.2 million listings,
operates the largest real estate web site in the nation. The
National Association of Realtors has a financial stake in that
site.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's courtship did provide PIN with an unintended
fringe benefit: the leverage to demand its longtime web partner pay
a fee, about a $1 per listing, for the privilege of posting about
90 percent of PIN's nearly 80,000 annual residential listings on
its web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time we will not be cutting a deal with
Microsoft,'' said Court Dwyer, president and CEO of PIN, which is
the byproduct of a merger earlier this year between Bay State MLS
and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board's MLS 1 division.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffed Michael Keller, vice president of marketing at Real
Select, which operates realtor. com. ``One of the most recent
entrants is very late to the game and is joining a very large sea
of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance on the part of various real estate boards has forced
Microsoft to court local and regional real estate companies across
the country in search of on-line inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Preview'' by Microsoft, the site is still grappling
with some glitches. An early review of the site, while graphically
pleasing, proved arduous and frustrating: data on home listings was
nearly impossible to obtain, and numerous delays made surfing
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there were some issues today there is no
doubt about it,'' said Microsoft spokesman Larry Cohen. ``It's like
the final test phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Significant explosions in both the real estate market and the
World Wide Web have led to a proliferation of on-line real estate
centers and services. Many real estate agencies have their own
sites, and most national brokerage firms also have a presence on
the web. Newspaper-linked sites, such as The Boston Globe's
boston.com, offer classified real estate ads on-line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are more and more players entering the
field,'' said Alison Berkley, group product manager for Intuit,
which touts similar mortgage and homebuying services on the
Internet. In addition to advertising about 600,000 homes, Quicken
markets the wares of 11 lenders. If a deal originated by Quicken
closes, the company derives a fee of just under one half a
percentage point, and passes a $225 rebate to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Since Quicken came on-line last November, about ten new home
buying web sites have been launched, Berkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Tutunjian, manager of five Boston real estate offices for
Hunneman/Coldwell banker, believes that Internet marketing does
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we get a lot of our out of state contacts,'' he
said. ``But unless you are part of other links, you kind of get
lost.'' hunneman.com, a web site serving 72 Hunneman offices in
Massachusetts, gets about 18,000 hits per week, according to
Tutunjian.

 &HT;    Hashimoto resignation, Japanese economy has U.S., others asking,
'what next?'
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By Bob Deans

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With American jobs, profits and stock prices at
stake, the White House moved quickly Monday to stress that whoever
replaces Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime minister of Japan must
prescribe the tough medicine needed to prevent the country's
sagging economy from dragging down global growth.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, however, whether Hashimoto's replacement,
as yet unchosen, would have the motivation or the means to carry
out reforms the United States has sought, and Japan has promised,
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   All that was certain was that the prospect of dealing with yet
another Japanese prime minister _ Hashimoto's replacement will be
the seventh person to lead Japan's government since President
Clinton took office five years ago _ added yet another layer of
uncertainty to the future of the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan's recovery is now in doubt,'' said Robert DiClemente,
chief economist for the New York investment house Salomon Smith
Barney. ''Who's going to lead them out?''
</P>
<P>
   By early Monday morning, the White House and U.S. State and
Treasury departments had cobbled together a single policy line
meant to display a veil of public confidence in Japan's ability to
pick a new leader that would carry out long-promised, though
ill-defined, measures to cut taxes, shore up Japan's ailing banks
and invigorate consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important for the new government, as it forms
itself, to move quickly to implement concrete fiscal and banking
measures, to achieve strong domestic, demand-led growth in Japan,''
said White House spokesman Michael McCurry. ''The president
believes that a healthy Japanese economy is critical for the entire
Asia region, that it's critical to the global economy and thus to
the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It was largely the ailing economy that prompted Japanese voters
to deal a punishing drubbing in Sunday's elections to Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The party dropped from 61 seats to
44 seats in the 252-member Upper House of Japan's legislature,
called the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto announced Monday that he would resign in two weeks _
he cancelled his White House visit scheduled for next week _ to
take responsibility for the harsh judgment by voters fed up with
nearly a decade of lackluster growth and, most recently, a
full-blown recession, in a country that had, for two generations,
led the way to stunning economic vitality across much of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that Sunday's election results would
provide a wake-up call to the LDP, which remains in control of the
more powerful legislative wing, the Lower House. Japanese
politicians, much like their American counterparts, have often
avoided painful change until a crisis makes it impossible to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be the crisis,'' said Edward Lincoln, former economic
adviser in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is actually a mildly encouraging development, because the
election results leave the LDP frightened,'' said Lincoln, now a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank. ''They might start coming up with some new policies, or
different policies, than what they've done up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout nearly a decade of nearly-flat economic performance,
Japan's government has been loathe to reject the formula that
carried the country from the ashes of post World War II destruction
to prosperity over the course of three decades.
</P>
<P>
   That formula boils down to easy money for industry, low interest
rates for savers and policies that protect domestic industry from
competition, largely at the expense of consumers, so that huge
corporations can use lucrative domestic markets as a springboard
for global exports.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has long been a bone of contention for U.S.
policymakers, which have complained for two decades now that Japan
doesn't import as much as might be expected for an economy its
size.
</P>
<P>
   One result: a chronic U.S.-Japan trade gap that has averaged $50
billion, in Japan's favor, for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's figure was $55.7 billion, and this year's deficit is
already on target to top $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   That, American critics say, results in the loss of tens of
thousands of American jobs that might be supported by exports to
Japan, were the two-way trade flow closer to balanced. It also
affects profits of many U.S. corporations which rely on exports for
a growing portion of their sales. That, in turn, has a dampening
effect on stock prices. Wall Street, which has struggled for the
past two months in the face of deepening worries about Japan,
drifted downward on Monday, with the closely watched Dow Jones
Industrial Average falling 9.53 points to close at 9096.21.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling the increase in the trade deficit is Japan's
economic weakness, combined with a precipitous drop in the value of
the Japanese currency. The yen has lost some 80 percent of its
value against the dollar over the past three years, as investors
flee the yen as a show of no-faith in the future of the economy
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   A weak yen makes Japanese products cheaper, in dollar terms, in
the United States, providing an incentive for Americans to increase
their purchases of Japanese imports. It has the opposite effect on
U.S. exports to Japan, making American goods most costly to
Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening yen also puts pressure on other Asian currencies,
such as those of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, which have
already plummeted some 40 percent against the dollar over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
currency but has hinted that a continuing slide in the yen could
force a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, a move that analysts fear
would trigger further declines in currencies regionwide.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sagging economy, moreover, denies the region, and the
world, an economic locomotive that, in healthier times, might be
stimulating growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get Japan's economy moving again, and to shore up the
addled yen, Hashimoto had vowed a permanent tax cut _ as yet
undefined _ and a program to try to consolidate and deal with bad
bank loans valued at some $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The loans have crippled many of Japan's largest banks, crimping
credit and putting a drag on economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto also reluctantly talked of reforming Japan's economy
more generally to promote consumption, and of stimulating growth by
spending billions of dollars on public works.
</P>
<P>
   One problem politically, however, is that Hashimoto's policies
remained so vague that it's hard to draw a clear mandate from
Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were just kind of mad that the government's letting the
economy slip,'' Lincoln said. ''Virtually nothing they have done
for the past nine months has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sunday's humbling of the LDP leads to change remains the
central question for analysts trying to piece together the future
of Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to remain somewhat skeptical,'' said
DiClemente. ''This was already a very dramatic challenge for the
authorities there. Now, suddenly, the means to do all that itself
is up in the air. Who among the (LDP) party leadership is capable
of really taking charge?''

believes that a healthy Japanese economy is critical for the entire
Asia region, that it's critical to the global economy and thus to
the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It was largely the ailing economy that prompted Japanese voters
to deal a punishing drubbing in Sunday's elections to Hashimoto's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The party dropped from 61 seats to
44 seats in the 252-member Upper House of Japan's legislature,
called the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto announced Monday that he would resign in two weeks _
he cancelled his White House visit scheduled for next week _ to
take responsibility for the harsh judgment by voters fed up with
nearly a decade of lackluster growth and, most recently, a
full-blown recession, in a country that had, for two generations,
led the way to stunning economic vitality across much of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predicted that Sunday's election results would
provide a wake-up call to the LDP, which remains in control of the
more powerful legislative wing, the Lower House. Japanese
politicians, much like their American counterparts, have often
avoided painful change until a crisis makes it impossible to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be the crisis,'' said Edward Lincoln, former economic
adviser in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is actually a mildly encouraging development, because the
election results leave the LDP frightened,'' said Lincoln, now a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think
tank. ''They might start coming up with some new policies, or
different policies, than what they've done up to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout nearly a decade of nearly-flat economic performance,
Japan's government has been loathe to reject the formula that
carried the country from the ashes of post World War II destruction
to prosperity over the course of three decades.
</P>
<P>
   That formula boils down to easy money for industry, low interest
rates for savers and policies that protect domestic industry from
competition, largely at the expense of consumers, so that huge
corporations can use lucrative domestic markets as a springboard
for global exports.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has long been a bone of contention for U.S.
policymakers, which have complained for two decades now that Japan
doesn't import as much as might be expected for an economy its
size.
</P>
<P>
   One result: a chronic U.S.-Japan trade gap that has averaged $50
billion, in Japan's favor, for more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's figure was $55.7 billion, and this year's deficit is
already on target to top $62 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim. Story can end here.)
</P>
<P>
   That, American critics say, results in the loss of tens of
thousands of American jobs that might be supported by exports to
Japan, were the two-way trade flow closer to balanced. It also
affects profits of many U.S. corporations which rely on exports for
a growing portion of their sales. That, in turn, has a dampening
effect on stock prices. Wall Street, which has struggled for the
past two months in the face of deepening worries about Japan,
drifted downward on Monday, with the closely watched Dow Jones
Industrial Average falling 9.53 points to close at 9096.21.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling the increase in the trade deficit is Japan's
economic weakness, combined with a precipitous drop in the value of
the Japanese currency. The yen has lost some 80 percent of its
value against the dollar over the past three years, as investors
flee the yen as a show of no-faith in the future of the economy
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   A weak yen makes Japanese products cheaper, in dollar terms, in
the United States, providing an incentive for Americans to increase
their purchases of Japanese imports. It has the opposite effect on
U.S. exports to Japan, making American goods most costly to
Japanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening yen also puts pressure on other Asian currencies,
such as those of South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, which have
already plummeted some 40 percent against the dollar over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
currency but has hinted that a continuing slide in the yen could
force a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, a move that analysts fear
would trigger further declines in currencies regionwide.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's sagging economy, moreover, denies the region, and the
world, an economic locomotive that, in healthier times, might be
stimulating growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get Japan's economy moving again, and to shore up the
addled yen, Hashimoto had vowed a permanent tax cut _ as yet
undefined _ and a program to try to consolidate and deal with bad
bank loans valued at some $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The loans have crippled many of Japan's largest banks, crimping
credit and putting a drag on economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto also reluctantly talked of reforming Japan's economy
more generally to promote consumption, and of stimulating growth by
spending billions of dollars on public works.
</P>
<P>
   One problem politically, however, is that Hashimoto's policies
remained so vague that it's hard to draw a clear mandate from
Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were just kind of mad that the government's letting the
economy slip,'' Lincoln said. ''Virtually nothing they have done
for the past nine months has been encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sunday's humbling of the LDP leads to change remains the
central question for analysts trying to piece together the future
of Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have to remain somewhat skeptical,'' said
DiClemente. ''This was already a very dramatic challenge for the
authorities there. Now, suddenly, the means to do all that itself
is up in the air. Who among the (LDP) party leadership is capable
of really taking charge?''

ZAPRUDER FILM RELEASED TO STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ They are 26 seconds of infamy, the rolling film
of a national nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Dallas dressmaker Abraham Zapruder's horrific home
movie of President John F. Kennedy's assassination has been locked
in the National Archives, off limits to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   But to the anguish of Kennedy supporters and the anticipation of
conspiracy buffs, thousands of digitally enhanced videtapes of
Zapruder's historic recording of Kennedy's slaying are bound this
week for the ``new release'' shelves of the nation's video stores.
</P>
<P>
   An American tragedy for sale: $19.98 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Billed by Zapruder's heirs as a public service to satisfy
unrelenting demand for the film, the videotapes will make widely
available for the first time the most gruesome image of the
assassination: the instant when Lee Harvey Oswald's bullet struck
the president's head.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, captured on frame 313 of the 500-frame film, has
rarely, if ever, been shown by television networks, although it has
been available for years on illegal, bootleg copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when you think US culture cannot be degraded any further,
something like this comes along,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, a
long-time Kennedy ally who was Robert F. Kennedy's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, who died in 1970, was hoping to capture an image of
Kennedy for his grandchildren when he raised his Bell &AMP; Howell
movie camera in Dealey Plaza in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, as the
presidential motorcade approached. His hands shaking, Zapruder
recorded the closest and most vivid film of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The footage was scrutinized by the Warren Commission, whose 1964
report concluded that Oswald acted alone when he shot Kennedy from
the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building.
</P>
<P>
   That finding has long been challenged by many conspiracy
theorists, and the newly released videotapes could become the stuff
of a new wave of assassination questions. The footage, digitally
enhanced at an estimated cost of $500,000, provides a fuller
picture of the killing than has been available before, including
images between the original film's sprocket holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see images no one ever saw before, like extra people in
the motorcade and extra movement by the Secret Service,'' said
Natalie Olinger, a spokesman for MPI Home Video of Orland Park,
Ill., which collaborated with Zapruder's heirs on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute video, titled ``Image of an Assassination: A New
Look at the Zapruder Film,'' includes a 40-minute documentary about
the ``preservation and restoration'' of the Zapruder film and shows
numerous images of the bullet striking Kennedy's head. Olinger said
the production company, which will split the proceeds equally with
Zapruder's heirs, hopes to sell 200,000 copies of the video.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy said, ``The Kennedy
family has chosen not to comment'' on the video release.
</P>
<P>
   However, family supporters said the development was deeply
painful to the Kennedys and expressed dismay at the prospect of the
grisly footage becoming a form of mass entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing but titillation,'' Mankiewicz said. ``I'm
surprised they don't get the film of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey
Oswald and run it as a second feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Olinger defended the video release. ``The story is not meant to
hurt the Kennedy family in any way,'' she said, ``but John F.
Kennedy was our president and people have a right to see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zapruder sold Life magazine the rights to the footage
in 1963 for $50,000, he made clear before he died that he did not
want to use the film to exploit Kennedy's death commercially. James
L. Silverberg, a lawyer for Zapruder's heirs, including his son and
daughter, Henry and Myrna, said they share that desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done with the expectation that the Zapruder family
would have invested a substantial amount of money in order to
answer a public need,'' Silverberg said, referring to demand for
the footage.
</P>
<P>
   The Assassination Record Review Board ruled last year that the
original Zapruder film should be part of its permanent records.
Since then, the Zapruder family, which maintains copyrights to the
film, has been negotiating how much the government will compensate
them for the footage.
</P>
<P>
   The government has offered $3 million. But the Zapruders, citing
appraisals as high as $70 million, are asking for $18 million.

PRI AUTOMATION TO LAY OFF 180 WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asia's economic problems and a worldwide slowdown in orders for
computer chip equipment took a further toll in Massachusetts as PRI
Automation Inc. of Billerica said Monday it planned to lay off
about 180 employees, or 15 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the layoffs will be in Massachusetts and range from
production to sales and management positions, including ``a couple
at the highest levels,'' chief financial officer Stephen D. Allison
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it also expects to report up to a 20 percent
decline in sales for its most recent quarter from the previous
three-month period, along with a net loss for the quarter of
between 12 cents and 16 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   PRI makes robotic equipment and software bought and used by
semiconductor manufacturers, and the company's announcement was the
latest round of gloom from an industry that, a year ago, had
expected big gains from an ongoing changeover in technology that
would increase computer chip production.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, thousands of workers around the world, including
hundreds in Massachusetts, have been pink-slipped as customers
postpone orders for new machines or request a delay in shipments.
Many Asia-based chip makers are cutting back on equipment purchases
in wake of the financial crisis that has swept the region; US chip
suppliers are slowing production as Asian customers, such as
computer makers, reduce spending.
</P>
<P>
   Offering an optimistic note, Allison said, ``Some start out as
cancellations but then turn around to become postponements.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading, PRI shares fell 1 to close at 15 1/16 after
dropping earlier in the day to 14. The company's 52-week peak share
price was 58 1/2, last Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said that as part of PRI's restructuring, two small
sales offices will be closed and manufacturing space in Lowell
leased earlier this year will remain empty.
</P>
<P>
   This is PRI's second round of layoffs this year. The first
involved 60 employees, most of them temporary workers, who were
furloughed last January.
</P>
<P>
   The current dismissals will be more costly. PRI said that
severance and other payments are expected to bring between $5
million and $7 million in extraordinary charges when it posts
financial results for the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps we are taking will help make PRI a stronger and more
competitively positioned company once the upturn comes,'' chairman
and chief executive Mord Wiesler said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   PRI uses a fiscal year ending Sept. 30; the upcoming report will
cover the third quarter of that year, which ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The company said sales for the most recent quarter are likely to
be down between 15 percent and 20 percent from the $47.1 million
posted for the second quarter, which ended March 30. The projected
quarterly loss did not include extraordinary charges for
restructuring and writeoff of excess assets.
</P>
<P>
   One of Masschusetts' fastest growing companies, PRI was on its
way to a record of $200 million-plus in annual sales through the
first half of its fiscal year, although the company suffered a
22-cent &UR;  &LR; per &UR;  &LR; share net loss for that period.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1997, PRI chalked up $17.08 million in earnings on
$169.5 million in sales, for a fourth straight profitable year
since its stock went public in 1994.

   Turner, who spoke during a telecommunications forum at the 89th
Annual NAACP Convention at the Georgia World Congress Center,
criticized both for making it more difficult for small businessmen
to get into _ and stay in _ the business.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, drawing laughs from the audience of about 300, recalled
when he was a small businessman and had difficulty getting capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really tough,'' said Turner, vice chairman of Time
Warner Inc., and one of the world's wealthiest individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It's even worse today, he said, because television and radio
``prices have been bid up so high. Quite frankly, America is run by
the Golden Rule to the extent that he who has the gold, rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, in his ``just folks'' style, accused media conglomerates
of swaying Congress with hefty campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big boys shoveling the big dough,'' said Turner, who
peppered his speech with calls for campaign reform. Congressmen
``vote where the money comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner also said he could understand what women and blacks have
gone through because he, too, faced discrimination _ as a
Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to have an education, you just have to have
smarts, Bubba,'' he said. ``You've got to find out what's coming
next and you'd better be right. If you bet on the wrong horse you
can end up with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the panel were Federal Communications Commission chief
William Kennard; Percy Sutton, chairman of African Continental
Telecommunications; and Eddie Edwards, president and chief
executive officer of Glencairn Ltd. Broadcast Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Minority ownership of media properties has long been an issue
among civil rights groups. But concerns intensified with the
passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which eased media
ownership rules, allowing chains to buy out smaller operators.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of all television and radio stations are
owned by minorities, down from a peak of 3 percent in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues affecting minority ownership include access to
capital, and the launching later this year of digital TV, which
will offer better pictures but take up more airwaves. Low-power TV
stations, including many that are minority-owned, could go off the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, the first black chairman of the FCC, said the
Information Age is having a profound impact on the U.S. and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil rights challenge of the next decade and the next
century is to make sure African-Americans share in the benefits of
the Information Age,'' through access to technology, employment
opportunities and ownership, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of employment, Kennard said the FCC plans to continue
to fight a court ruling in the Lutheran Church v. FCC case that
struck a blow at the agency's efforts to promote equal employment
opportunities for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cold wind blowing through Washington,'' he said.

   ATLANTA _ John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers
Association, plans to stage a rally here Wednesday before a speech
by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to the NAACP convention on
the black farmer issue. Boyd, who has been a leader in the effort
by hundreds of black farmers to win compensation for years of past
discrimination by the Agriculture Department, is also scheduled to
speak during the convention. The Baskerville, Va., man provided The
Associated Press on Monday with a copy of an Agriculture Department
letter stating the investigation into Boyd's complaint that an
agency lawyer referred to him with a racial epithet during a
telephone conference call has ended.
</P>
<P>
   In a formal complaint, Boyd claimed that Teresa Gruber, counsel
to August Schumacher, undersecretary for farm and foreign
agriculture services, used the word ``nigger'' in referring to the
farmer at the end of a May 27 conference call. Schumacher and
Gruber both denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The letter dated Friday from John Sparks, special civil rights
assistant to Glickman, said the USDA inspector general's own
interviews of those involved ``do not provide sufficient evidence
to support the allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Green, 22, said she's glad the NAACP's Annual Diversity
Job Fair lasts two days. Otherwise, she said she'd never get
through it in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought 30 resumes with me. I have no idea how many I've
handed out today,'' she said on Monday, day one of the job fair. A
recent Shaw University graduate, Green said the fair is much more
diverse than the others she's attended this year. She said she is
looking for a job in computers.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Wakefield, a recruiter from the Georgia-based American
Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (AFLAC), said she was
impressed with the candidates she had seen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very pleased,'' Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 companies attended the Diversity Job Fair
sponsored by the NAACP National Labor Department. The fair runs
from noon to 6:30 p.m. today in the Georgia World Congress Center.
The job fair is free and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of The Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., addressed her own struggles in an address Monday to the youth
NAACP members.
</P>
<P>
   King said she had become increasingly angry and
``self-destructive'' over the years while trying to deal with the
deaths of her father and other relatives who were close to her. She
said the culmination came when she considered suicide when she
landed in academic trouble after her first year of law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I saw before me was failure. I said, `my God, if don't
come out of this then, the whole world would know that Dr. King's
daughter is a failure,''' she said. ``God really, literally came
into my home and told me to put that knife down because I had a
reason and a purpose for living.''
</P>
<P>
   King encouraged the audience to recognize that they are destined
for greatness as well and that their family or academic
circumstances do not have to dictate their fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, today, is the beginning of your new life regardless of
what happened yesterday,'' she said. ``Stop replaying the tape.
Live in the present.''
</P>
<P>
   An NAACP leader died of a heart attack en route to the group's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dogan, head of the Stark County, Ohio, NAACP branch,
collapsed and died Saturday during a stopover in his hometown of
Greenville, S.C. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Dogan was a longtime member of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and had been chapter president since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   He was a critic of the Canton, Ohio, Police Department and once
tried to get the Department of Justice and FBI to investigate the
department on allegations of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral is planned for Wednesday in Massillon, Ohio.

COALITION OF HMOS IS WILLING TO ACCEPT COMPROMISE PLAN ON
REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Minn., N.J., Wash.)   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
(sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of 25 health maintenance organizations
said on Monday that it was willing to accept substantial federal
regulation _ much more than the Republican leaders of Congress
want.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that they said should restore public confidence in
their industry as it is buffeted by sharp partisan attacks, the
HMOs endorsed a series of guarantees, including coverage of
emergency room care, grievance and appeal procedures for patients
and assured access to medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   But the group said it was opposed to one major provision
demanded by Democratic congressional leaders: a wide expansion of
patients' ability to sue HMOs and insurance companies when medical
benefits are improperly denied.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, known as the HMO Group, said that patients could
resolve such disputes by appealing to an independent panel of
medical experts, and that lawsuits would unnecessarily increase
costs and reward lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs, which are mostly nonprofit organizations, supported
legislation being developed by Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., and Bob
Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Chafee-Graham plan is intended as a compromise between a
Democratic leadership proposal, which includes the right to sue,
and legislation being drafted by Republican leaders of the Senate
and the House, who promise to protect patients without entrusting
vast new power to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   George Strumpf, senior vice president of HMO Group, which
represents 25 HMOs with more than six million members in 26 states,
praised the Chafee-Graham legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moderate proposal,'' Strumpf said. ``It represents the
best interests of consumers, providers and health plans. It strikes
a balance. That's what's lacking in the bills introduced by other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMO Group includes some of the nation's oldest and largest
HMOs: Kaiser Permanente, based in Oakland, Calif.; Group Health
Cooperative of Puget Sound, in Seattle; HIP Health Plans, in New
York City; Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, based in Brookline, Mass.;
Health Partners, of Minneapolis, and the Fallon Community Health
Plan, in Worcester, Mass. The HMO Group has offices in New
Brunswick, N.J., and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lesley, a lobbyist at the National Association of
Children's Hospitals, said on Monday night: ``The Chafee-Graham
legislation could be the basis for a bipartisan agreement. It
includes the most important protections for patients, including
children, while leaving out the most controversial proposals found
in other bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella group that lobbies for managed-care companies, the
American Association of Health Plans, is running television
advertisements that oppose legislation to regulate the industry.
``When politicians play doctor, real people can get hurt,'' the
commercials say.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, a vice president of the association, said it had
spent $2 million on advertising and public relations this year, and
would spend much more. ``The budget keeps growing every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit companies like the Cigna Corp., which have branched
out from traditional health insurance into managed care, are also
resisting federal legislation. The Health Benefits Coalition, which
includes employers and insurance companies opposed to ``patient
protection'' bills, said it had spent $1.5 million on radio and
print advertising, direct mail and public relations since January.
</P>
<P>
   But the HMO Group has adopted a detailed statement of principles
that is generally consistent with the Chafee-Graham bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bewildered to see what the public thinks about our
organizations and the industry now,'' said Daniel Wolfson,
president of the HMO Group. ``Patients feel they are not in control
of their health care. They feel powerless. Legislation could defuse
that distrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer
group, said he could not endorse the Chafee-Graham bill because it
did not authorize lawsuits against HMOs. But he said, ``It does
contain many features that are important in a patients' bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Many provisions of the Chafee-Graham bill are taken word for
word from legislation introduced by the Senate Democratic leader,
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., with
support from House Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO Group has endorsed these proposals, all of which are in
the Democratic leadership bills and in the Chafee-Graham bill:
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs would have to disclose large amounts of information on
costs, benefits and the quality of care, so consumers could
intelligently compare health plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs would have to pay for emergency care in any situation
that ``a prudent lay person'' would regard as an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs would have to allow access to appropriate specialists
whenever a patient required specialty care. Women would have direct
access to routine obstetrical and gynecological services, without
having to get approval in advance from their health plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ People denied care or coverage could demand a review first
within their HMO and then before an independent panel of medical
experts outside the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs could not use financial incentives as an inducement for
doctors to reduce or limit medically necessary services.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs must insure ``continuity of care'' for patients receiving
a course of treatment from a particular doctor. Such patients could
continue using that doctor for several months even if the doctor's
contract with the HMO had expired or been terminated.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs covering a limited number of prescription drugs would
have to make exceptions for patients who could show that they
needed other medications not on the list of approved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the HMO Group has endorsed a provision of Daschle's
bill that would prohibit health plans from retaliating against
``whistle-blowers'' who advise federal or state authorities of
substandard care endangering patients.

RELIEF IS FELT IN TOKYO THAT THE MESSAGE HAS FINALLY GOTTEN
ACROSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: see related JAPAN-POLITICS.) 
(HLW) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ While investors are worrying that the prime minister's
resignation on Monday has left a political vacuum that may lead to
economic paralysis, voters are sighing in relief that their
political message may have finally gotten through to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Some people want to teach a lesson to the governing Liberal
Democratic Party and its departing Prime Minister, Ryutaro
Hashimoto. Others want to vent their anger. Some voters want a big
tax cut, while others fear that a tax cut now will bring high tax
bills later on.
</P>
<P>
   But the one message that many people seem to have in common is
that they want stronger leadership and economic change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a good thing that Hashimoto is resigning,'' said
Shinichi Miyagi, 61, an electronics consultant who runs his own
company. ``He is not a leader. People began to feel a sense of
urgency that if they did nothing, Japan would end in failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a big factor was the lack of vision for the future,
the absence of someone saying, `Follow us because the future will
be bright if you put up with this period of pain.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's resignation sent markets tumbling throughout Asia,
and fears rose that weakness in the Japanese economy, the
second-largest in the world, could pummel the yen and provoke a
recessionary backlash in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But to some voters the resignation was almost cathartic,
offering new hope that there may be opportunity for economic
revival. At the very least, some say, things could not get much
worse than they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people wanted to change the trend and they felt that
the recession would not go away unless they took some drastic
measure,'' said Yoshitoyo Nakano, 54, an electrician, who took his
entire family together to vote on Sunday _ and not for Hashimoto's
candidates. ``I hope that as a result of this election, the Liberal
Democratic Party will reflect on its inability to deal with the
economy and then concentrate its energies on reviving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese have long shown an uncanny ability to endure an unhappy
situation, and one consequence is that there has not been a deep
sense of crisis among the leadership, or even among the people,
until now. Indeed, the political scrambling after Hashimoto's
resignation may finally lead to a sense of urgency among the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That was not necessarily clear before the election. Japan is a
deceptively affluent society, and that may have made it hard for
the leadership to appreciate the overwhelming sense of malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are still buying presents for friends during the
traditional summer gift-giving season. They still go out to golf,
and they still plan summer vacations. And soon, a $117-billion
fiscal stimulus package will begin trickling through the economy,
lifting many companies out of their misery.
</P>
<P>
   But just now, the brutal defeat of the Liberal Democrats at
least sends a message to voters as well: that other people think
the same way they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that something is wrong, but they don't really
feel it,'' said Masao Miyamoto, a social psychologist and author of
``The Straightjacket Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The restaurants are full of people,'' he said. ``People take
cabs. They don't express their anger. These things have to come
out, and for that to come out, we need bigger crises to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, perhaps for a lack of a crisis, the leadership has been
slow to address problems in the financial system. It took eight
years after the speculative economic bubble burst and the stock
market crashed for the Liberal Democratic Party to come up with its
``Total Plan'' to mop up the nation's $540 billion in bad and
doubtful loans.
</P>
<P>
   Now the election may cause the Total Plan to face even more
delays, and political bickering between a weakened governing party
and emboldened opposition parties could also whittle away at the
plan. But even among those who acknowledge that there may be a
period of economic disarray, the trade-offs may be well worth it,
at least emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about time,'' said Hideaki Kato, 50, a banker at a small
financial institution, who still voted for the Liberal Democratic
Party's candidate in his district.
</P>
<P>
   He added about Hashimoto: ``He could not solve the economic
problems and the financial industry is in chaos, and he only acts
when the Americans tell him to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of the election are a real scolding to the LDP. It
does not show that people are totally abandoning the party. But it
turns out that the scolding was a bit too effective, and now the
economy may become even less stable. That is unfortunate for
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto and other government officials on Monday tried to
assure the markets that economic policy would not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single day of political vacuum can be allowed, given the
current economic situation,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo
Muraoka.
</P>
<P>
   But emotions ran high this morning, with Taku Yamasaki, the
Liberal Democrats' top policy maker, suggesting concern about a
political void if there is a sudden bank failure. Finance Ministry
officials denied that there would be disruptions in the financial
system but acknowledged a possible delay in carrying out the Total
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no distinction between the opposition and the
ruling side, because we are in a crisis period,'' Deputy Finance
Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki said in an interview. ``We should
coordinate and cooperate together to overcome this rather
historically important and serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A benchmark stock index, the Nikkei average, rose on Monday,
hitting a peak just after Hashimoto's resignation. Some analysts
said the government might have poured money into the stock market
to prevent a protracted sell-off. Other investors went hunting for
bargains after prices fell in the early morning, and their buying
helped buoy the market in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei ended on Monday at 16,360.39, up 270.33 points, or
1.68 percent from Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Though a successor to the prime minister has not yet been named,
several candidates from the Liberal Democratic Party have emerged,
nearly all of whom are unlikely to veer too far from the current
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that the worst-case scenario is more of the
same,'' said Kathy Matsui, strategist at Goldman Sachs Japan.
``They don't see anything different if they're just picking someone
from the LDP pot.''

 &HT;    RBI dearth starts with Weiss
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ The Braves No. 3 and 4 hitters go into the two-game
Mets series with just two RBIs in the second half. Before anyone
indicts Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga for the three losses in
Florida, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   Lead-off hitter Walt Weiss is 4-for-32 this month, and his
average (.295) just dipped below .300 for the first time this
season. No. 2 hitter Keith Lockhart went 1-for-10 against the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   That means RBIs become harder to generate with no one on base.
Jones' two RBIs came on solo home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored only 13 runs in four games against Florida.
Houston is the only club to hold down the Braves like that in a
four-game series. The Astros limited Atlanta to 10 runs on May
15-18. Rarely is the Astros' pitching staff mistaken for Florida's.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you say? Talk them out of not hitting?'' manager Bobby
Cox said. ``You have to have some luck. Look at Lockhart. The first
night (last Thursday), he has three balls right on the button and
didn't get any hits. All line drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he is not considering changes in the order, although
his club is getting a first glimpse of what can happen when Weiss
doesn't get on base. Even after hitting .280 in June and getting
through his family crisis with his son, Brody, Weiss still took a
.323 average into July. But he was hitless against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two games, I've felt real good at the plate and I
didn't get anything either game,'' said Weiss, who had two hits in
the All-Star game. ``But that's the way it goes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Charting Chipper
</P>
<P>
   Jones reached 23 home runs on Sunday in his 348th at-bat of the
season. He needed all of his 597 at-bats in 1997 to reach 23. He
currently is projected to reach 40. His career-high is 30, which he
hit in 1996. With five homers in nine games this month, Jones
trails club leader Galarraga by three.
</P>
<P>
   Tending the fields
</P>
<P>
   It is going to take weeks before New York's outfield situation
plays out. For now, converted catcher Todd Hundley is being given
top priority in left field because his power gives clean-up hitter
Mike Piazza the best protection in the order. That leaves Butch
Huskey and Bernard Gilkey to share right field. Gilkey has started
in right field five times in his career. Huskey is a converted
infielder the Mets switched to outfield in order to get him more
playing time. Both are right-handed, both ideally are No. 5 hitters
and who starts tonight against the Braves is anyone guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you've got four players who have been around the
game makes it easier,'' said Gilkey. ``We just want to win. I know
people don't want to hear that. They want to get on the radio and
just talk their heads off.''

 &HT;    Millwood sitting on 10 wins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Millwood won't be the Braves' starter tonight,
even though it's his turn to pitch. In most cities, any man who
wins 10 times before the All-Star break can call his own tune.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood instead sits in the bullpen and waits for a kinder
calendar. John Smoltz opens a two-game series tonight with the New
York Mets, and Millwood, who has made one start in the last 14
games, parks the cars, scrubs the pots and waits for the phone to
ring.
</P>

   ``Before the season started, I told myself this was something I
was going to have to do and have to do it all year long,'' he said.
``It's not like I wasn't ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox used his underemployed fifth starter in his first
relief appearance of the season Sunday at Florida, and with two
more scoreless innings, Millwood pushed his total to 10 innings
without allowing a run. But Cox is forced by Monday's off day to
pass Millwood by for the fourth time this season to keep the rest
of the rotation on a five-day work program. Millwood has pitched 14
2/3 innings since June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to do it, so I have no clue what it's like,''
said Smoltz, who is 2-1 in four starts since last coming off the
disabled list. ``But you need to have patience and know in time
that it's not going to be like this. In thinking with him, it sure
beats the alternative in my mind. You get to learn from the best.
Although you might not get to pitch as much, I think it's going to
prolong his career, personally, with all the knowledge he gains and
knowing what it's like to win at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my first time I've ever come out of the bullpen,''
Millwood said. ``It won't be the last. Whatever they want me to do,
I guess that's part of my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood is one of eight National League pitchers with 10 or
more victories. He knows what separates him from more steady work.
Four times this year, he has been hit for five or more runs. Five
times in 16 starts, he hasn't lasted into the sixth inning. At
first, he found the heart of the plate instead of the corners. Then
his change-up, his newest pitch learned from Greg Maddux, went
haywire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my change-up just about where I want it now,''
Millwood said. ``All my pitches are fine. I just want to be a
little more consistent with them. And I think that's what separates
me from the other four starters.''
</P>
<P>
   And from starting tonight.

HEAT WAVE KILLS 15 IN DALLAS AREA SINCE JUNE 1 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The blistering heat that has wrapped itself around
north Texas for the past six weeks loosened its grip slightly
Monday, but the death toll continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1, the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office has
attributed 15 deaths to the heat wave, eight of them in the past
two days. Seven additional deaths are being investigated and
autopsies may show they also were heat-related.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims have been elderly and lived in homes with no
air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't pretty,'' said an investigator for the medical
examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport reached 110 Sunday,
the third-hottest day on record. Fort Worth's Meacham Field
reported 112 degrees Sunday, but a city health department
spokeswoman said there have been no confirmed heat-related deaths
there.
</P>
<P>
   The north Texas weather is beginning to rival the summer of
1980, when Dallas recorded 69 days _ 42 of them consecutive _ with
temperatures of 100 degrees or above. The high that summer was 113
degrees, reached June 26.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, there have been 21 100-degree days, and no
end is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's high at DFW was 101 degrees, and the forecast called
for more of the same throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff House, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Fort Worth, said Monday's respite was the result of a dissipating
high-pressure ridge that had been parked over Texas. As that system
shifted to the west, temperatures in north Texas fell, but only
enough to provide moderate relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a weird summer,'' said Teresa Rehfeld, who has
worked the past five years for America Ice Co. in Dallas. ``We're
going nonstop, 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have increased their ice stocks to treat hyperthermia
victims, but ice suppliers have also seen a surge in demand from
individuals. Deliveries of 800 to 1,000 pounds to cool residential
swimming pools is not uncommon when temperatures linger in three
digits, but Rehfeld said this year's weather has pushed some
customers a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people try to buy one or two tons of snowcone ice so
they can have snowball fights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Dallas residents are combating the heat simply by
staying indoors under the air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Schein, a spokesman for TU electric, said the record for
usage, 208 million kilowatts, was actually set last Tuesday, when
the temperatures only reached 105 degrees. Because the 110-degree
mark was reached on a Sunday, when many businesses are closed, the
demand that day was 19.7 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
   Water consumption in Dallas hit a record 664 million gallons
Saturday but declined Sunday to 650 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths that have been attributed to the heat, according to
the medical examiner's office, follow the typical pattern. Five of
the 15 victims were older than 80 and all but two were older than
50.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Monday's victims, an 88-year-old woman and an 83-year-old
man, were found in overheated residences. The woman's home had air
conditioning, but it was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victims were found outside, where they apparently
had been engaged in strenuous activities. The season's first heat
death was Jason Stogsdill, a 23-year-old Arlington man, who died of
hyperthermia June 1 while riding a bicycle in Cedar Hill State
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Gonzales, 83, was found dead July 10 after he had walked
about 100 yards from his van, which was crippled by two flat tires.

NASDAQ SETS RECORD ON GAINS FROM TECHNOLOGY ISSUES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A brighter earnings outlook for several leading
technology companies propelled the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index to its fourth consecutive new high Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the gains among technology issues, stocks were mixed,
as investors pondered how the unexpected resignation of Japan's
prime minister would affect American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 22.49 points, to 1,965.53, led by
gains among some of its bellwether issues such as Microsoft, Intel
and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in the index reflected renewed enthusiasm by investors
for computer-related issues, which have largely been the
torchbearers of this year's bull market. Many investors are now
betting that earnings and sales of these companies _ which have
taken a hit this year, in part due to slowing demand from Asia _
will rebound in the second half of 1998, as a worldwide glut of
personal computers abates. Once that happens, personal computer
manufacturers like Dell and Compaq will increase production and
purchases of computer chips, improving the lot of chip makers like
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel rose 2|, to 82], on expectations that sales for
the world's largest semiconductor maker will soon improve. While
Intel is expected to report weak second-quarter earnings later this
week, investors are optimistic the company will signal a sales
improvement in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft gained 4], to 117 9/16, on optimism it would report
better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.53 points, to 9,096.21.
General Motors, Exxon, Sears, Roebuck and Procter &AMP; Gamble were the
leading decliners among the blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.86 points, to
1,165.19, just 1.18 points shy of its July 8 record close.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei index rose 1.68 percent, but
most equity markets were lower. The prime minister of Japan,
Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, accepting responsibility for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's dismal showing in weekend elections.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the news, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen
Monday and Treasury bond prices dropped, suffering their largest
declines in more than a month. The retreat indicated that the
strong gains among the dollar and bonds recently, much of which was
attributed to safe-haven buying by foreign investors, may end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts offered mixed views of how domestic stock
markets will fare as a result of the latest Japanese development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just breathing a sigh of relief that they got off the
ground,'' said Peter Canelo, a U.S. investment strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``I wasn't expecting a resignation, but that's
even better. It's an even stronger signal that they're going to do
something right.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts remain skeptical that the resignation signals
that the Japanese government is ready to take quick action and
implement major economic reforms to pull the economy out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors around the world are looking for concrete steps,''
said Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities in New York. ``There've been a lot of false
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's change. I think people are hoping there will be change
in the right direction, but I don't know if there's anything to
support'' that conclusion, Cliggott added.
</P>
<P>
   While technology shares led the market higher Monday, declines
among issues like Applied Materials indicated that aside from
global economic news, quarterly corporate earnings reports are
still a focus.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials closed at 28 9/16, down 15/16. Shares declined
after the computer chip equipment manufacturer warned that fiscal
third-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' forecasts,
weakened by order delays and spending cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the stock really didn't cascade'' the way other shares
have done after forecasting earnings disappointments, said Anthony
Conroy, a managing director for Bankers Trust Global Investment
Management. He attributed the stock's limited slide to investors'
belief that ``we're close to a bottom'' and the sector is ready to
rebound.

 &HT;    PUERTO RICO TARGETS GOP IN QUEST FOR REFERENDUM
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It comes as no surprise that Puerto Rico would wage
a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign to push for congressional
backing of a vote on its political status.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing between statehood, becoming an independent country or
remaining a U.S. commonwealth has been at the top of the island's
legislative agenda for the better part of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   What is so unusual about Puerto Rico's quest these days is where
the island is getting its support: from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has supported allowing
Puerto Ricans the right to vote on statehood, a stand that recently
drew cheers at a speaking engagement in Dallas where the speaker
was reaching out to Hispanic voters. And other key Senate
Republicans are backing the measure as hearings start Tuesday in
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are a potential voting pool of 3.8 million voters,
which would translate to as many as seven House seats and two
Senate seats if Puerto Rico became the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to the commonly held belief that most of those
seats would be held by Democrats, Puerto Rican officials say the
Democrats should not be so confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption that Puerto Rico is a liberal Democratic
community is wrong,'' said Xavier Romeu, executive director and
general counsel for the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration
in Washington. ``Everyone thinks that, but it is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Puerto Rico's political agenda echoes the GOP agenda,
Romeu said. For example, Puerto Ricans are largely against
abortion, they support school vouchers, they mandate a five-minute
reflection or ``prayer time'' at the start of each school day, and
they want to reduce the capital gains tax to spur economic
development, Romeu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the speaker (Gingrich) is to be commended for reaching
out,'' Romeu said. ``He realizes that the Republican Party will be
the minority party unless they reach out to Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is just what the Republican Party wants to
hear. The party has been actively courting Hispanic and other
minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been voting Democratic; that's a habit we'd like to
break,'' said Tim Fitzpatrick, deputy press secretary at the
Republican National Committee. ``On a lot of issues we are closely
aligned with Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Democrats concerned about the GOP edging in on the
Hispanic voting pool by supporting popular Hispanic issues such as
granting Puerto Rico the right to vote on its political status?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supporting any type of initiative that the Puerto Rican
population would like to take,'' said Lina Garcia, deputy press
secretary at the Democratic National Committee. ``I don't think the
Republicans are genuinely trying to reach out to help Hispanics. I
think the record shows that the Democratic Party is much stronger
on issues that matter to the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum issue is expected to be a thorny one as it moves
to the Senate chamber, closely mirroring the struggle in the House,
where the measure barely passed by a 209-208 vote.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this is a test of both political parties, said
Romeu.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats are not careful, they will lose our vote,''
Romeu said. ``The Republicans also stand to lose if they validate
the perception in the community at large that the Republican Party
is anti-Hispanic.''

State of euphoria 
envelops France
<TEXT>
<P>
   World Cup champs feel vindicated
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ The street sweepers went rumbling through Paris on Monday
morning, up the avenues and down the boulevards, like they do every
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But business was good this time. Very good. Better than ever, in
fact.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's jubilant World Cup championship celebration in
France left behind piles of champagne bottles, streamers and
confetti. The streets were stained with the remnants of red, white
and Les Bleus face paint and shoe polish.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as the aftermath of the party was washed and cleaned
away nice and neatly, the memories of France's thrilling 3-0 World
Cup victory over Brazil likely never will be swept away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after saying it 10 times, we can't believe it _ we're
world champions,'' France forward Christophe Dugarry said. ``We
could have won that game 5-0 or 6-0. We played fantastic football.
It's incredible to believe that we put on that kind of show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed quite a show and definitely worthy of lifting the
Cup. It led to more than 1 million people flooding the Paris
streets in the kind of all-night celebration not seen in France
since the Liberation and the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And for this marvelous team, liberation definitely was the key
word to the World Cup victory. So many players, along with coach
Aime Jacquet, felt liberated, vindicated or finally fulfilled with
the victory. France is an also-ran no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that French teams can play good football and win
championships,'' midfielder Emmanuel Petit said. ``That's something
that we have wanted to prove as a nation for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is still mixed up in my head. It all feels unreal.
The best thing is that we have brought pleasure to the French
people, and that is something that they have deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, French soccer fans felt betrayed by the national
team when it was eliminated from USA '94 on the final day of
qualifying. Four years before that, France also failed to qualify
despite being a world-ranked contender.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the disappointment of 1986, when a Michel
Platini-led French team eliminated Brazil in the quarterfinals but
then stumbled in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our dreams have come true, finally,'' France's Alain
Boghossian said. ``We really deserved this victory and to finally
win the Cup. We won this for everyone in France, especially the
supporters and the players before. We felt enormous pressure, but
now we've got good times.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual demons seemed to vanish in the revelry, too.
</P>
<P>
   For Jacquet, who was harshly criticized throughout qualification
and early Cup games, the relief was clear in his face after
Sunday's game. During his official news conference after the
victory, Jacquet scolded certain French publications for not
believing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of France saw the kind of team we were and how we play,''
Jacquet said. ``The people judged for themselves, and they saw the
best team in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Jacquet did, in fact, often struggle trying to find
offense in this team, the defense proved to be among the toughest
in World Cup history. And the three goals in the final against
Brazil proved offense ultimately was no big problem, either.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie and close-knit nature of this team was evident,
too, especially after defender and popular star Laurent Blanc was
red-carded in the semifinal against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The popular opinion was that Brazil would be able to slice
through a French defense that didn't have Blanc. Instead, the team
rallied around replacement Frank Leboeuf, and Blanc was an
inspiration on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``After each victory, the atmosphere in the dressing room was
wonderful with this team,'' Petit said. ``This team possessed a
wonderful joie de vivre and a will to win as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bixente Lizarazu: ``We were rewarded for several years of
working together and months of preparation together for this
tournament. It's incredible how this team came together. It was a
destiny. We played the perfect game. We're world champions. It
sounds so strange to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's true. Just ask the street sweepers.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE INQUIRY SAID TO BE MAKING SCANT PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CAMPAIGN-FINANCE-INDICT) 
(mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-one months after accusations of illegal fund
raising arose from President Clinton's re-election campaign, law
enforcement officials concede they have no big cases to show for
their effort and express doubts that they will obtain evidence to
warrant prosecution of senior White House or Democratic Party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are increasingly pessimistic that they will
ever answer questions at the heart of the inquiry; that is, whether
there was a plot by the Chinese military behind contributions to
the Democratic Party that may have been intended to help Beijing
gain easier access to American space technology, and whether any
Democratic Party or White House officials knew of the Chinese
effort. Thus far investigators have been stymied in their efforts
to obtain the cooperation of witnesses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are still people being investigated, and
conceivably a witness with crucial evidence could decide to
cooperate, breaking open the investigation. And it is even
conceivable that an independent counsel could be named to
investigate top officials. But the cases brought so far by the
Justice Department's campaign-finance unit have centered on
relatively low-level fund-raisers charged with illegally disguising
overseas contributions through straw donors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Monday of the Thai businesswoman Pauline
Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law brings to eight the number of
people who have been charged, and officials expect more will be
charged with similar crimes in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that despite hundreds of subpoenas and
thousands of hours of grand jury testimony, they have no evidence
that White House officials, their aides or Democratic Party leaders
broke the law, even though some investigators, from the inquiry's
early days, have sought evidence that higher-ups knew or encouraged
the acceptance of illegal contributions. Now, whether such cases
will be brought depends on the willingness of the fund-raisers to
plead guilty and testify against their superiors, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary value of that cooperation could prove only
marginally useful. So far, only one defendant, the California
businessman Johnny Chung, has cooperated with authorities. Although
he provided what was apparently a link between the Chinese military
and the Democratic Party, the officials said, it remained uncertain
whether his information would implicate any officials at the
Democratic National Committee or in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Justice Department officials are prepared to concede
that their investigative leads are drying up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task force is on a roll with four new charges in the last
six days,'' said Bert Brandenburg, a spokesman for the Justice
Department, referring to tax charges brought last week against the
California fund-raiser Maria Hsia and fund-raising charges against
Howard Glicken of Miami, as well as the indictments Monday of Ms.
Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law, Duangnet Georgie Kronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``White-collar cases take longer than any other types of
cases,'' Brandenburg said. ``But through aggressive investigation
and prosecution, we have brought charges in mere months that
usually take years to bring. This continues to be the department's
largest criminal investigation, with more than 120 task-force
members, offices on two coasts and resources drawn from around the
country. And we are not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans pass scathing judgment on the inquiry
and continue to demand the appointment of an independent
prosecutor, saying that the Justice Department, under Attorney
General Janet Reno, will never be able to credibly investigate the
fund-raising practices of the president's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people running this thing are people of
integrity,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who was chairman of
the Senate hearings on campaign finance abuses. ``But they refuse
to acknowledge the hopelessly conflicted situation they are in. If
they continue to travel down this road and wind up where it looks
like they are headed, it's going to look a lot like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling measure of the low fortunes of the campaign-finance
inquiry was illustrated after its top prosecutor, Charles Labella,
announced in May that he would resign to become the acting U.S.
attorney in San Diego. In trying to fill Labella's job, Reno found
few prosecutors willing to take on the challenge of leading the
inquiry already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, such an assignment might be
considered a high-profile, career-making plum. But at least two
prominent federal prosecutors refused the offer. ``It's a loser,''
one prosecutor said. ``And it's going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno picked David Vicinanzo, an assistant U.S. attorney from New
Hampshire, to take command of an inquiry that critics insisted was
never given the top priority or the prosecutorial mandate that it
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation can only be described as a total disaster,''
said Michael Madigan, the former chief counsel to the Senate
committee that investigated campaign-finance abuses. He is now a
partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, the Washington law

</P>
<P>
   Madigan and leading congressional Republicans said that
prosecutors have only themselves to blame. They said members of the
campaign finance team had moved lethargically, failed to dig for
evidence against powerful Democrats and concentrated mainly on
lower-echelon fund-raisers like Ms. Hsia, Chung and Yah Lin Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hsia and Trie have pleaded not guilty to the charges against
them and are scheduled to go on trial this fall. Chung pleaded
guilty in March to campaign-related bank and tax fraud. He is the
first defendant to cooperate with authorities; he is scheduled to
be sentenced later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Republicans complained that the most vivid
example of the task force's failure was prosecutors' not taking
action against John Huang, the former Commerce Department official
and Democratic fund-raiser. He raised $1.6 million in contributions
that the Democratic Party later returned after questions were
raised about the origins of the money.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that investigators were actively
reviewing Huang's activities, including fund-raising solicitations
made while he was an official at the Commerce Department and his
role in funneling overseas contributions to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Huang, who lives in California, has denied through his lawyers
any wrongdoing, but he refused to testify before Senate or House
committees by invoking the Fifth Amendment, the constitutional
guarantee against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the White House is stonewalling and you're having
hearings that are overtly partisan,'' Thompson said, ``it's
absolutely vital to have an aggressive prosecution going on
downtown. It was that way during Watergate. It was that way during
Iran-Contra. That was the big missing element we have seen in this
investigation. There was no pressure brought to bear on any of
these key people. So they either fled the country or refused to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews last week, Justice Department and other law
enforcement officials said that the investigation's failure to meet
the early expectations and perceptions of ineptitude were the
result of several factors, including investigators' own missteps
and changes in the leadership of the campaign- finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was first assigned to the Justice Department's
public integrity unit, which prosecutes official corruption. But
Reno, prodded by complaints from the FBI, brought in a fresh team
in October 1997, led by Labella, the federal prosecutor from San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Labella is planning to leave later this month to return to San
Diego and the U.S. attorney's office. James Desarno, the lead FBI
investigator assigned to the inquiry, was planning to accept a
promotion at his agency until the FBI director, Louis Freeh,
ordered him to remain in place indefinitely after news reports
about the move.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some prosecutors acknowledge that a battle-weariness has
slowed the pace of day-to-day operations, fed by the lack of
cooperative witnesses and the difficulty of conducting an inquiry
that must decipher the muddled and arcane laws involving campaign
finance. The House's campaign-finance investigation, led by Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., has also been stymied by a lack of cooperation
from many of its 108 witnesses, who have either left the country,
refused to be interviewed or invoked the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also acknowledged that the inquiry was
hamstrung by sporadic feuding within the Justice Department over
the investigation's direction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, FBI officials and investigators continue to openly
question Reno's refusal to seek an independent prosecutor to
examine the vast swirl of accusations. Reno's repeated refusals
have been used to attack her image as a fair and objective law
enforcement official. Some say her obstinacy has drained the
campaign-finance investigation of its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno will most likely face new questions about the
inquiry's status when she appears before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

NEW YORKER STAR REMNICK NAMED NEW EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ The factions and feuds that have tried the soul of
the nation's most prestigious magazine for the past six years may
soon come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   That was how the New York publishing world received the news
Monday that Pulitzer Prize winner David Remnick _ the most
acclaimed writer that Tina Brown hired during her six years as
editor of The New Yorker magazine _ had been named as her
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the one who engendered those feuds. The Old Guard, who
worked for or simply cherished The New Yorker of the 1960s and '70s
under William Shawn _ serious, restrained, deeply literary _
lambasted Brown as a betrayer of the tradition, a vulgarian
obsessed with glitz, glamour and power-profiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Turks, on the other hand, who escorted Brown on her
ascension, lauded her as a fresh force who brought zip and energy
to what felt was becoming _ especially under Shawn's successor,
Robert Gottlieb _ an increasingly stodgy tome.
</P>
<P>
   All last week, after Brown announced she would be quitting the
job to run a multi-media enterprise for the Miramax film-production
company, the factions and their acolytes _ who abound in nearly
every quarter of the media business _ have been buzzing about who
would replace Tina and in which direction the new New Yorker, under
only its fifth editor in 73 years, would spin.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's appointment, which takes effect Aug. 1, came as a
surprise. The New York Post, which had been running a handicapper's
sheet on the subject every day, put his odds at 15-to-1. But
Monday, it seemed, everyone, on all sides of the Tina Brown
struggle, reacted with delight.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGrath, editor of the New York Times Book Review _ and
a former deputy editor of The New Yorker under Shawn, Gottlieb, and
Brown _ was typical in his enthusiasm, calling Remnick ``the best
possible choice'' for the job, the one person who might span all
factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will know, perhaps more than anybody else,'' McGrath said,
``what aspects of the old New Yorker and the new New Yorker are
worth salvaging and scuttling.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, in a phone interview, said, ``I do have ideas for
changes, some of them quite radical, but it's not Year Zero.'' He
declined to elaborate on his ideas, noting, ``I haven't been editor
for four hours yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, 39, first made his mark as the Washington Post's Moscow
reporter during the final years of the Soviet Union, and won the
1994 Pulitzer Prize for ``Lenin's Tomb,'' a book he wrote about
that era.
</P>
<P>
   He caught Brown's eye with an article he wrote about Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev for Vanity Fair while Brown was editor
of that magazine. Around the same time, he also wrote a piece about
the fall of the Soviet Union for Gottlieb's New Yorker. When Brown
was hired to replace Gottlieb in 1992, Remnick was one of her first
hires and has remained, ever since, a key and _ among the rest of
the staff _ highly popular figure in her inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick has never been an editor, unless one counts a year as
the editor of his high-school newspaper in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hendrik Hertzberg, a senior editor at The New Yorker
during Brown's entire reign, said Monday, ``To a degree that is
highly unusual for a writer, David was involved in editorial
consulting, decision-making, meetings. Tina put a lot of stock in
his judgment and advice. Almost every day, she asked his advice
about pieces, people, ideas for the direction of the magazine. And
he edited pieces. He edited some of my pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Remnick's interests and tastes are
known to be broader _ more global and more literary _ than Brown's.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Fadiman, editor of The American Scholar, said, ``It's quite
exciting that they picked someone who's a writer, not an editor.
This is a vote for literary quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick graduated from Princeton University with a degree in
comparative literature. He started out at the Post as a sports
writer, moved speedily to the Style section, the Sunday magazine,
then to Moscow. In his time at The New Yorker, he has written over
100 pieces, not only about Russia _ which he has revisited many
times _ but also about subjects as farflung as race relations,
poetry, religion, and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   His next book, ``King of the World,'' to be published this fall,
is about Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's interested in everything, he reads everything,'' Benjamin
Bradlee, who hired Remnick while he was the Post's editor, said
Monday. ``I think he's a terrific choice. I just hope he knows what
he's getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick comes to the helm at a crossroads moment for The New
Yorker _ not only in terms of its identity, but also of its
commercial viability. Although Brown raised the magazine's
circulation from 500,000 to 800,000, it lost money _ $11 million
last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the current issue of Fortune magazine attributes
the loss more to the executives at Conde Nast _ which owns The New
Yorker _ than to Brown. However, one old New Yorker hand, who asked
not to be identified, speculated Monday that the mishmash of
articles in a typical Brown issue might have sent advertisers
confusing signals as to what sort of magazine it was _ and what
sorts of readers they were reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's appointment was announced at a morning staff meeting
Monday by Conde Nast chairman S.I. Newhouse, and, according to New
Yorker spokeswoman Morie Perl, was received with ``a standing
ovation of total jubilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse had met with Remnick twice last week, and called him at
8:30 Monday morning to come to another meeting, where he told the
writer that he was the new editor.
</P>
<P>
   However, Remnick may not have been Newhouse's first choice for
the job. Michael Kinsley, editor of Slate, Microsoft's on-line
magazine, said Monday that Newhouse offered him the position over
the weekend but then retracted the offer when he responded too
hesitantly.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message to the Slate staff, entitled ``My Career As
Editor of The New Yorker'' _ which was instantly circulated in
cyberspace and ended up reprinted in full by the on-line
newsletter, Hotline _ Kinsley wrote that Newhouse called him Friday
morning to come to New York for a meeting the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley _ who has also been a co-host of ``Crossfire'' and the
editor of The New Republic and Harper's _ said he and Newhouse
talked on Saturday for a few hours and that Newhouse offered him
the job. Kinsley said he would need 48 hours to decide _ which did
not make Newhouse happy. Still, he was invited for dinner Sunday
night with Newhouse and ``his wife, son, brother, brother's wife
and son.'' Kinsley left, saying he would call Newhouse the next
morning at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 15 minutes later,'' Kinsley continued, Newhouse called
him at his hotel to say Kinsley seemed reluctant, adding, ``I'm
starting to feel reluctant, too. I think it would be better to call
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls Monday to Newhouse's spokesman, asking about
Kinsley's e-mail, were not returned.

MASSACHUSETTS TOPS LIST IN CHILD IMMUNIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston and Massachusetts lead the country in immunizing
children against disease, a new report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city immunized 88 percent of children two years
of age or under, compared to the national average of 78 percent;
and the state inoculated 87 percent, according to a report
published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The report, called the National Immunization Survey, tracked
immunization rates for diphtheria, polio, measles, mumps, and
rubella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were tied with another locality,'' said Dr. Anita
Barry, director of communicable disease control for the Boston
Health Commission. ``This year we're just out ahead of the pack.''
The CDC tracks only large cities for its statistics.
</P>
<P>
   City officials credit the rankings to a tracking and recall
system in place since 1993 that helps disseminate recommendations
to health care professionals, aids in distributing vaccines to
where they are needed most, and coordinates the activities of
various groups such as community health centers, hospitals,
physicians, and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some good partnerships throughout the city,'' Barry
said. ``And people are very interested in the health of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, many of these activities have also expanded
throughout the state using the same federal funding source.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunization is one of the most cost effective public health
things that we do,'' Barry said. ``For every dollar you spend in
immunity, you save $10 in subsequent health care costs that you
would incur from disease occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Bay State and Boston have come in near or at
the top in immunizing children. But a proposed 35 percent cut in
the federal budget for 1999 threatens the progress made here. The
result would be major program cuts, Barry said, and fewer
immunizations.

SOUTHPORT, England _ Golfers got a blustery welcome to the 127th
Open Championship, with gusting winds, bouts of rain and chilly
temperatures making golf at Royal Birkdale Golf Club on Monday a
major challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure this suits anybody's game,'' said Tom Lehman. ``I
would not say the course is unplayable, but it is awfully
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers who arrived early in Southport, hoping to get in some
extra practice time before the championship begins Thursday, ended
up spending much of Sunday and Monday searching for more than just
their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, I took my driver and the 5-iron and the putter with
six golf balls,'' Lehman said. ``By the time I got to the eighth
tee, I was out of golf balls. It was blowing 45 mph. On the second
hole, which was 410 yards, I hit two drivers and didn't get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep going. But it was my first time seeing the
course, and I did not know where to aim. With the wind blowing, I
ended up hitting it everywhere. Somebody in one of the galleries is
going to find six brand-new Titleists with my mark on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasters said the gusts were as strong as 55 mph at
times Sunday. The wind was almost as bad Monday, gusting to 30 to
35 mph and the temperature hovering in the low 60s.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to leave U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen longing for
the comforts of the treacherous greens at the Olympic Club in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get some occasionally bad weather, but we do not play on
golf courses like this with this kind of bad weather,'' Janzen
said. ``It is extremely tough out there. I cannot think of a time
I've lost more golf balls without hitting the water than I have in
the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Janzen lost five Sunday. He managed to hold on
to most of them Monday but not without a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only made two birdies in two rounds of golf, and
that did not come until the 17th hole today,'' Janzen said. ``The
downwind holes, it's tough to hit the ball straight. If you do, it
is tough to keep the right distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot see anybody shooting under par for four days if it
stays like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the golfers in the Open Championship, Mother
Nature is expected to lighten up a little bit. The extended outlook
was calling for warmer temperatures and sunny skies for the next
few days at least. And a high-pressure system moving out of the
area is likely to calm the wind as well.
</P>
<P>
   That was good news for everyone, including those golfers much
more accustomed to such nasty conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see a little bit of a breeze, but I don't call
that a breeze out here, I don't think,'' Ernie Els said. ``Today, I
think I shot 74 or 75. And I would say 72 would have been a really
good score. It is really blowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those golfers trying to qualify for the British Open at one
of four open qualifying sites had their share of problems with the
wind. Korean Young Woo Nam, playing at West Lancashire, was forced
to quit in the second round when he lost his last golf ball on the
18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had four this morning in the bag, and at 18, I could
not find the last one,'' Nam said.
</P>
<P>
   Nam was 11-over on the round and 25-over for the two days at the
time after an 86 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the expected improvement in weather, it is likely that
this week's contest at Royal Birkdale will be a difficult one.
Anyone having trouble hitting it straight might as well not tee it
up at all, and putting will be at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best players will rise to the top,'' Lehman said.
``When it is blowing hard, you just have to hit the ball solid, and
that is the end of the story. If you do not hit it solid, you have
no chance whatsoever of winning, I don't care how good you play.
The best ball-strikers definitely have an advantage at Birkdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best players will come to the top for sure.''

not make Newhouse happy. Still, he was invited for dinner Sunday
night with Newhouse and ``his wife, son, brother, brother's wife
and son.'' Kinsley left, saying he would call Newhouse the next
morning at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 15 minutes later,'' Kinsley continued, Newhouse called
him at his hotel to say Kinsley seemed reluctant, adding, ``I'm
starting to feel reluctant, too. I think it would be better to call
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls Monday to Newhouse's spokesman, asking about
Kinsley's e-mail, were not returned.

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ It began 39 days ago as a simple strike at a
single General Motors factory over how modern-day workers should
build fenders and hoods. But like two neighborhood toughs daring
each other with escalating taunts, the dispute between GM and the
United Automobile Workers union has grown so big, complicated and
destructive that a solution now seems more elusive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has forced GM to lay off 162,000 workers across North
America and close 26 of 29 assembly plants. Any hope of resolving
it soon was dealt a big setback this weekend when both sides threw
up their hands in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The strike also has laid bare some emotional issues for UAW
workers about their job security and a steely resolve by the
world's largest automaker to fracture, once and for all, the
union's insistence on a relationship that GM says threatens its
competitiveness. Both sides have invested too much in the strike to
accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at it in actual dollar terms, it's hard to justify,
but our long-term viability is on the line,'' Donald Hackworth,
GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said
Monday night in recorded strike-update telephone message for
workers, investors and the press that suggested an end will not
come soon. ``We continue to lag behind the competition _ as they
continue to get better, our volumes continue to shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side has repeatedly tried to force the other to back down
by escalating the struggle _ and in the process has introduced new
issues that are not even part of the original dispute.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the union have been willing to escalate the dispute
partly because of a combustible combination of huge cash reserves,
which have given them the confidence that they can stand a fairly
long strike, and a desire by GM executives to stand fast.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has a strike fund of $725 million and is only spending
about $3 million a week for strike benefits and health insurance
for the 9,200 striking workers and a few laid-off workers who
appear ineligible for unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   GM had $13.6 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter,
and has probably spent no more than half of it so far.
</P>
<P>
   GM has been fighting for years to reduce its costs. But its
struggle has grown more intense because of steady cost reductions
at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Record profits at crosstown rivals in Detroit, combined with
Chrysler's pending merger with Daimler AG of Germany, have put
pressure on GM to eliminate a succession of factory-level
agreements over the years that have allowed some employees to stop
work early and have left GM with the highest labor costs in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth emphasized that GM is continuing to pursue a legal
complaint accusing the UAW of using the parts factories to wage in
effect a national strike. The union has denied this, but if GM wins
an arbitration ruling, it could not only seek damages from the
union but could also stop the union from launching similar
crippling strikes in the future. Legal experts gave GM little
chance of success when it started the effort three weeks ago, but
GM has pursued it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   GM's biggest productivity problem lies in its auto parts
factories, which were also starved of investment during the 1980s
and have antiquated machinery as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour and Associates, a manufacturing consulting firm in Troy,
Mich., has calculated that GM's average labor cost for the auto
parts in each vehicle is $2,765, compared with $2,322 for Ford and
$2,167 for Chrysler. Ford and Chrysler buy a slightly higher
proportion of their parts from outside suppliers that pay lower
wages, and also require fewer workers because they have invested in
more modern equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Because a strike at a crucial parts factory can shut down the
company, GM has been leery until now of taking on the UAW. But
under steady pressure from Wall Street, GM has become more willing
to challenge the union.
</P>
<P>
   Each side's sheer losses are now making it harder to compromise.
The strike has cost UAW workers about $300 million in lost pay,
although many workers are eligible for unemployment benefits equal
to about a quarter of their usual compensation.
</P>
<P>
   GM's losses have been heavier: 227,000 cars and light trucks not
produced, with further production losses now rising at a rate of
21,000 a day, and an after-tax loss of $1.18 billion in after-tax
losses, also rising now at a rate of $75 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the workers will recover half or more of their losses
through extra production and overtime pay after the strike. But GM
dealers are complaining that they are running out of popular models
and may lose customers permanently who try other automakers' cars
and light trucks and never come back.

 FLINT, Mich.: come back.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after the strike began, both sides began alternating
serious negotiations with moves to escalate the dispute further.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the UAW made a strenuous effort to solve after just six
days the strike at an auto body parts factory in Flint that makes
hoods, fenders and engine mountings. GM even made the important
concession on June 11 of promising to return parts-making equipment
removed from the factory before the strike. But when those talks
broke down, the UAW ordered a walkout at a nearby spark plug and
speedometer factory that is losing jobs to Mexico and East Asia,
where wages are lower.
</P>
<P>
   The second walkout raised the difficult question of GM's steady
push to build factories overseas while slowing investment in its
low-profit American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the auto body parts factory, the spark plug and
speedometer factory is part of GM's inefficient Delphi Automotive
Systems subsidiary, which makes mostly small, low-technology auto
parts. GM wants to sell part or all of Delphi and the UAW does not
want it sold, so the second walkout dragged in this long-festering
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the second walkout, GM began threatening to
close assembly plants and terminate the production of some
slow-selling car models if the UAW did not compromise. The threats
angered the UAW, and raised the contentious question of how many
workers GM would employ in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the UAW threatened further walkouts later this year
at other parts factories here and in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio.
GM responded last week by insisting that long-simmering disputes at
those factories be resolved before any agreement is reached here
</P>
<P>
   The entire morass of issues has left bargainers saying that
while GM and the UAW have labored through more than a dozen local
strikes in the last five years, not one of those disputes has
approached the complexity of the current mess. ``It's complex
enough. These are sufficiently complicated, I'm not sure you could
make them more,'' said Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president
for GM issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both sides say that the broader questions are unlikely to be
settled by any deal here. Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for
North American personnel, said on Sunday that the main issue
remained a union insistence that GM invest more money in the auto
body parts factory here despite its low productivity. Improving
that productivity will require changes in union work rules and a
company investment in new equipment - the local issues here 39 days
ago before either side began bringing up other problems.
</P>
<P>
   And Hackworth warned Monday night that, ``it appears as though
we have a long haul before settlement is reached.''

RUSSIA'S FINANCIAL CRISIS EASED BY NEW LOAN AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-U.S.) 
(ART ADV.: a graphic giving details of the IMF loan to Russia is

(HLW) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government and international lenders
concluded a landmark agreement on Monday aimed at easing Russia's
financial crisis and restoring confidence in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would provide $17.1 billion in additional loans
over the next two years. About $12.6 billion would be delivered
this year and another $4.5 billion would be available in 1999.
Combined with existing international assistance, the new pact would
bring total lending to Russia to $22.6 billion over this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the new money will be lent by the
International Monetary Fund, which came under pressure from the
Clinton administration to increase the amount of money it was
willing to loan to Russia and to quickly wrap up negotiations that
had dragged on for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To finance the Russian bailout, the United States agreed to loan
the fund $2.1 billion. Other countries making loans include Japan,
Germany, France and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, the lead Russian negotiator, described the
round-the-clock talks as the most difficult ever held between the
Yeltsin government and the IMF. ``The decisions taken today signify
a restoration of faith in Russia's ability to overcome its
difficulties,'' Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the process -- and the endless drama here -- is far
from over. Russia still has to take a number of important steps
before any of the money will be distributed. On Wednesday and
Thursday, the Russian government will attempt a crucial hurdle when
the lower house of Parliament is expected to vote in extraordinary
session on the Kremlin's plan for ending the financial crisis. That
plan reflects several demands made by the monetary fund as
conditions for further loans.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for lower tax rates and laws to stimulate
investment as well as a new law on budgeting procedures, all
considered vital by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   John Odling-Smee, the chief negotiator for the fund, said that
the fund would decide on July 20 whether to start distributing its
new loan to Russia. He added that the actions of the Parliament
would heavily influence the IMF's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament has already balked at measures to reform the
personal income tax and to change procedures for determining
value-added taxes. If the legislature also rejects additional
proposals, Yeltsin can impose some of his measures by decree. But
that could plunge the nation into a legal and political quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Monday's announcement provided a badly needed boost to
Russia's financial markets, which has been waiting for the IMF to
throw its support behind the Russians. Russia's stock market rose
10 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, Russia suffered from the general unease
Western investors had over emerging markets following the economic
turmoil in Asia. But Russia has also been vulnerable to a global
currency crisis because it depends on foreign investors to finance
so much of its deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the IMF said that new loans were not needed. It
wanted to husband its limited resources and insisted that the
Kremlin could weather the financial storm by taking its own
corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   But as interest rates on Russian Treasury bills soared, reaching
120 percent recently, and Russia's bond markets weakened, investors
began to worry about the ruble and whether the government would be
able to avoid a devaluation of the currency as a means to lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With Central Bank reserves of dollars and other foreign
currencies at about $15 billion, and foreign investors owning $20
billion in treasury bills, there was a widespread concern among
investors that an investor panic might drain Russia's slender cash
reserve. Of the $15 billion, $5 billion of that is in gold, which
cannot readily be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The worry was that a foreign panic might set off a stampede in
the treasury bill market in which investors would convert their
rubles into dollars. Without adequate reserves, the Central Bank
would be unable to support the value of the ruble by purchasing it
in the currency markets, and a devaluation might soon follow.
</P>
<P>
   The concern was that a devaluation of the ruble would not only
lead to a round of inflation but might also shake the nation's
political establishment. Yeltsin has even gone so far as suggest
that ``extremists'' might attempt to launch a coup.
</P>
<P>
   As Russia's financial markets shuddered in May and June, the IMF
began to consider additional financing. IMF officials initially
proposed only $5.6 billion in new loans. But after President
Clinton returned from his trip to China, the United States began to
focus on Russia's economy with new intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration considers Sergei Kiriyenko, the
Russian prime minister, and his team of aides the most
reform-minded government Russia has had in years.
</P>
<P>
   American officials argued that assistance had to be large enough
to impress the world's financial markets and give Kiriyenko the
breathing space he needed to try to turn the country's economy
around.
</P>
<P>
   The American pressure bore fruit last weekend when the IMF
doubled its financial package and sought to wrap up the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with the additional funds, the IMF was forced to use
the General Arrangements to Borrow, a little-used loan fund
established in 1962 to stabilize the world monetary system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with the lure of additional funds, the monetary fund
and Russia had to work hard to overcome their differences.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue in the talks, for example, has been the pace at
which Russia should cut its budget deficit. The two sides now agree
that the deficit should be reduced to 2.8 percent of Russia's
economy in 1999 from about 5 percent currently, a huge step that
will require raising billions of dollars in new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To reasure investors, Chubais emphasized on Monday that Russia
will receive $22.6 billion in loans during the last half of 1998
and in 1999. That figure, however, combined old loans that were
worked out before the financial crisis and the new rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   The actual amount of new financing is somewhat less, though
still substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will receive $12.6 in additional financing during the
rest of 1998. Those loans include $11.2 billion from the IMF, $800
million by the World Bank, and $600 million lent from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some $2.2 billion in previously agreed IMF and World Bank loans
is also to be disbursed, bringing the total for this year to $14.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Russia will receive $7.8 billion in new aid,
including $4.5 in new loans and $3.3 in previously agreed
financing.
</P>
<P>
   There may be even more loans in the future, as the fund
indicated it is willing to negotiate a further three year loan if
the government stays on the reform track. That would provide an
additional $2.6 billion a year in new financing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a loan package, Russia agreed to stop issuing short-term
treasury bills, which have been sold at high interest rates in
auctions that have occurred every week or 10 days. Instead, it will
now offer investors an opportunity to convert their ruble
denominated treasury bills into longer-term dollar denominated
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone applauded the new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, complained about
provisions that would require it to make its transport pipeline
system available to other gas producers. The World Bank insisted
that the pipeline be opened to limit Gazprom's dominance and
introduce more competition.
</P>
<P>
   While the the Russian government was breathing a sigh of relief,
the toughest part lies ahead. The Yeltsin government has to win
parliamentary approval of its anti-crisis take-other measures to
qualify for the new loans. Then it has to try to stay the course.

NAACP TO FOCUS ON ATTACKS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NAACP President Kweisi Mfume conceded Monday that the
organization was caught flat-footed during last year's fight over
Proposition 209, the ballot measure approved by California voters
to end state affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the group has shifted into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   At the NAACP's 89th annual convention, its leaders have
strenuously defended affirmative action and belittled its critics,
and have pledged to defeat any effort to curtail it in Washington
state, which looms this fall as the latest battleground for a
California-style initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And in a shift in strategy, the leadership of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People has also
ratcheted up its rhetoric against Supreme Court justices who oppose
affirmative action _ seeking to challenge their decisions in the
court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proposition 209 got past us. We are absolutely certain nothing
will get past us again,'' Mfume told reporters after a hard-hitting
speech to the convention in which he called the justices
``hyprocrites'' for making decisions on affirmative action when, he
said, they have never promoted diversity among their own office
staff.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a single native America among the 397 law clerks who
work for Supreme Court justices and only seven are of African
ancestry, Mfume said. ``You have to hunt to find any'' minority law
clerks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In major back-to-back speeches over the last two days, Mfume and
board chairman Julian Bond have singled out Supreme Court justices
for harsh criticism. They have sought to make the case that the
NAACP is still relevant because discrimination remains rampant in
America and that ultimately, as in years gone by, the battle will
be fought in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night Bond referred to Clarence Thomas, the only black
Supreme Court justice and a conservative, as ``affirmative action's
poster child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even he says that affirmative action makes black people feel
bad,'' Bond said. ``But Thomas may be right. Ever since he got his
most recent affirmative action job, he has been in a foul and nasty
mood,'' he said. The remark moved the more than 3,500 delegates to
a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Mfume singled out Justice Antonin Scalia for criticism
saying he has never found it in his ``heart of hearts to employ one
black person'' while on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mfume defended the name-calling to reporters, saying
it was necessary to ``use the law of reason and the law of shame,''
to convince the court to change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state conservative activists, bolstered by the
success of the California effort, are pushihg Initiative 200, which
would curtail if not end most affirmative action programs. The
NAACP has set aside $50,000 to help to defeat the measure.
Officials hope to double that amount by the time the association's
board of directors holds its quarterly meeting in Seattle in
October. It says the donation has spurred other organizations to
become active as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has twice visited Washington state to drum up opposition to
the measure, and Mfume is planning a visit. The NAACP plans to use
the money to buy ads on cable television and erect billboards. They
are also planning marches and demonstrations to try to convince
voters not to approve the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has galvanized NAACP officials, but they also stress
other priorities. Among them: urging the Census Bureau to get an
accurate count of minorities, opposing school tuition vouchers, and
pushing for a proportionate share of any funds distributed from a
national tobacco settlement to be spent on groups that promote
minority health.
</P>
<P>
   But along with crafting their agenda, NAACP officials have also
sought to spotlight the persistent presence of racial
discrimination in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination is not an article of the past, it is an article
of the present,'' Mfume said. ``People of African ancestry in this
country, unless anyone forgets it, are not going to silently sit by
and let these years of progress be taken away without a fight.''

MCI CLOSE TO DEAL TO SELL ITS INTERNET BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Communications Corp. is close to an agreement to sell its
entire Internet business to Cable and Wireless PLC for $1.5 billion
to $2 billion in cash, executives close to the negotiations said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two companies could be announced this week,
the executives said, adding that minor negotiating points remained
unresolved Monday. The executives speculated that the only possible
development that could scuttle a deal would be the existence of
separate, secret talks between MCI and another buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would clear the way for the Justice Department to
approve the $37 billion acquisition of MCI by Worldcom Inc. While
the Federal Communications Commission would also have to sign off
on the MCI-Worldcom deal, few people in Washington or on Wall
Street expect the commission's review to be onerous for the
companies in the way the Justice Department's antitrust analysis
has been.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials, along with antitrust regulators
from the European Union, have been concerned that a combined MCI
and Worldcom could dominate the Internet business. Worldcom's Uunet
operation is the biggest Internet service provider, while MCI is
also a major Internet carrier. Opponents of the deal have said that
the combined company could control as much as 70 percent of the
market for wholesale access to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   MCI has tried to allay those concerns before. In May it
announced that it had sold its wholesale Internet business to Cable
and Wireless, an international communications company based in
Britain, for $625 million. The unit that MCI initially agreed to
sell served smaller Internet companies that in turn sold services
to consumers. At the time, MCI said that deal would be sufficient
to answer the antitrust questions of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``By divesting MCI's Internet backbone, we have eliminated any
overlap with Worldcom's Internet business,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr.,
MCI's chairman, said. ``We have formed an agreement that addresses
antitrust concerns with the MCI-Worldcom merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators did not agree. As GTE Corp. led the lobbying
effort against both of MCI's pending deals, U.S. and European
antitrust officials maintained that MCI would have to sell its
units that offer cyberspace services directly to businesses and
consumers in addition to the wholesale division.
</P>
<P>
   Any new deal between MCI and Cable and Wireless would include
those divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust officials, and GTE, would have preferred that
Worldcom sell Uunet. But Worldcom refused.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion-to-$2 billion negotiating range would include
the $625 million that Cable and Wireless already agreed to pay MCI,
executives close to the negotiations said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Like MCI's original deal with Cable and Wireless, any subsequent
agreement would also make the sale contingent on MCI's being
acquired by Worldcom, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, Cable and Wireless and the Justice Department all declined
to comment Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People close to MCI and the Justice Department said that the
department had all but agreed to approve the MCI-Worldcom deal if
MCI struck an additional deal with Cable and Wireless that included
the units that sell Internet services to consumers and business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   When MCI first explored selling parts of its Internet business,
Justice Department officials told the company that GTE and Sprint
Corp. would not be acceptable buyers. GTE and Sprint are big
Internet companies, and the officials were concerned that a sale to
either of them would fail to refashion the overall competitive
landscape in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless was of interest to both MCI and the
regulators because it is a hungry, hefty company that is not a
huge-scale communications competitor in the United States.

NAACP OFFICIAL CRITICIZES SUPREME COURT ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The nation's oldest civil rights organization stood
firmly behind affirmative action on Monday, publicly scorning
compromise on the issue and attacking its critics, including the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of accommodation was in short supply in speeches at the
convention of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, and speakers defended granting special breaks for
minorities in employment, college admission and government
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the organization's president and chief executive
officer, castigated the justices on Monday for limiting the
government's ability to run affirmative action programs, and for
the court's own lack of minority law clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court finds itself as hypocrites, particularly on
diversity and affirmative action issues,'' Mfume said. He added
that ``this Supreme Court ought to be ashamed of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong convention here marks the first gathering of the
NAACP since it selected veteran civil rights advocate Julian Bond
as chairman of the board of directors in February. Under the new
leadership team of Bond and Mfume, who was elected to his post in
1996, the internal squabbling that has marked the organization in
recent years appears to have been muted and its financial problems
lessened. As a result, the group appears poised to direct its
energies toward political and legal fights.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action is a particular battleground. Programs that
grant preferences to minorities have been under intense legal and
political scrutiny. Washington state, for example, will hold a
referendum in November on whether to outlaw government programs
that extend preferences based on race or sex. Voters in Houston
defeated a similar ballot initiative last November.
</P>
<P>
   The enrollment of minorities in the top schools in the
University of California system has dropped sharply in the wake of
passage of a similar ballot initiative in the state in 1996. And in
recent months, the Clinton administration, responding to Supreme
Court rulings, has scaled back the affirmative action efforts in
federal contracting.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, affirmative action has dominated the first days
of this year's convention. And, in public speeches, NAACP officials
have struck a defiant tone when it comes to support for programs,
even those that the courts have found to be illegal or
constitutionally suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of mealy-mouthed statements about
affirmative action,'' Bill Campbell, Atlanta's mayor, told the
delegates Sunday night. ``I want you to know I'm here for
affirmative action. I'm for quotas. I'm for set-asides. I'm for
whatever gets us back to where we ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume suggested that his organization would be willing to try to
work out some compromises on affirmative action, and that some
programs should be examined closely to insure that the benefits do
not go to people who do not deserve them. But he also insisted that
black civil rights organizations be consulted when changes in
policy are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to sit down and have discussion and debate,''
he said. ``We are prepared to hear the other side. We're prepared
to make our case. We're prepared to negotiate. But we are not
prepared to have policy imposed upon us, when we have no input into
that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume was critical, however, of a number of federal agencies,
specifically the Defense Department, for what he said was ``going
too far'' in scaling back their affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But he saved his harshest criticism for the Supreme Court, which
in recent years has imposed strict constitutional tests on when a
program that gives special aid to minorities or women can be
legally justified.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a report by USA TODAY in March that noted the court had
only seven black law clerks among the 394 appointed since 1971,
Mfume said the justices were not getting enough diverse opinions
when they deal with affirmative action issues.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all the law clerks ``who read the initial briefs, who
decide what goes forward and what goes back; who help to write
those decisions, who have the ear of those judges; who partake in
much of the process, seven are African-American,'' Mfume said. ``So
don't sit around, fellow justices, and tell us about affirmative
action and there is no need for it, until you practice it on your
own.''

 &HT;    Pierce wants NAACP to insist on higher educational standards
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Go ahead, raise the educational standards for students
in public schools and watch black children rise to the occasion.
But make sure they have the resources necessary to excel.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Pierce, deputy assistant secretary of education for the
U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, delivered
that message Monday to NAACP convention participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who think that when we push high standards,
that equity, fairness, will necessarily suffer and that is not
true,'' Pierce said. ``Too often when we receive complaints about
inappropriate use of tests _ when tests are designed for one
purpose and being used for another with an obvious disparate impact
upon minority students _ the only correction (taken by educators)
is to water down the tests, to lower the standards.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessary, he said. The key is to set high standards
and hold educators accountable. If they fail to produce, replace
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that sounds rather harsh, but we're losing too many
generations of our children not to take a serious look at the
process by which they're being educated,'' Pierce explained. ``Our
children should not be able to leave third grade and not read
independently. Our children should be able to master basic
mathematical skills by the end of eighth grade. At the same time,
we must make sure that the schools our children attend have the
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   By resources, he meant supplies, safe and clean buildings and
teachers instructing within their professions.
</P>
<P>
   As for schools that continually fall short of the mark, Edith
Bond of the American Federation of Teachers said closing and
restructuring them with a new educational focus is an option.
</P>
<P>
   But when discrimination issues are involved, Brian Kintisch of
the Center for Children and Education encouraged communities to
mobilize, get the facts straight and come up with a plan for
reforming bad policies.

 &HT;    Students tackle tough question
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the theme of this year's NAACP convention is ``Preparing
tomorrow's leaders today,'' The Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked
the national organization to identify college students considered
to be up-and-coming leaders. Some are regional youth
representatives to the national NAACP board; others are members of
the National Youth Work Committee, which consists of a youth
national board member, and a youth and adult representative from
each region; some were members or officers of local organizations.
The committee serves as a liaison between the youth and college
chapters and the national organization.
</P>
<P>
   Each was asked the question: How can you have an impact on the
civil rights movement as a student leader?
</P>
<P>
   Taj Brown, 19, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, Lock
Haven, Pa., sophomore:``I think that history reveals most
revolutionary movements are ignited with young people. An advocate
for civil rights is a proactive person. It is important for me to
be proactive... My responsibility/challenge would be to effectively
represent the young people of my region and at large when it comes
to top-level decision making in the NAACP. That is a challenge
because I think that all too often our parents or generations prior
tend to forget what it means to be a young person. If that is the
case, it is unfair for me to expect our seniors to effectively
advocate the youth cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gaulden, 20, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,
junior: ``I can help by raising awareness and by getting youths and
students to mobilize. Understanding that strength is in numbers
will get us far.''
</P>
<P>
   La'Keitha Daniels, 18, Clark Atlanta University, senior:``We are
seen as role models for the younger people. The youths coming up in
the organization see me as a leader. As a leader, I provide a venue
for other unheard youths across the nation. Every year I grow more
and more as I continue to learn the background and workings that
have sustained us as the oldest and strongest civil rights
organization. I can keep the struggle alive with the help of other
youth leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont Ross, 19, University of Texas at Austin, junior: ``(I can
help) by helping to motivate other people. We need to lose the
apathy. We have a lot of sleepwalkers among us, and a wake-up call
is long overdue. I look at myself as an implementer and a motivator
to help other people 'get on the bus' as we drive toward the goal
of true political independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomeka Berry, 22, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
graduate student: ``(I can help) by being active and letting people
be informed about the issues that affect them. I can help by being
active in the struggle to assist with protests, boycotts and
marches.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith, 19, Morehouse College, junior: ``Being that the
struggle started in the youth-college division, we're the ones to
begin the revolution again. We know firsthand of where injustice is
going on. As youths, a fighting spirit is instilled in us so we can
continue. We're the ones able to march and fight the long battles.
We're the ones who will have to continue the battle. Our older
freedom fighters have done it and they're getting tired. The
youth-college division is training leaders for the future. We hold
our destiny in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabari Baker, 19, Morehouse College, junior: ``I can get other
students to become involved in the NAACP and take a bigger stand in
things that are going on not just locally but throughout the state
of Georgia and nationally.''

 &HT;    GM looks to conserve cash
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp. stepped up its search for
ways to conserve cash after failing to settle two crippling strikes
in Michigan over the weekend as it had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Top-level talks in Flint foundered yesterday, largely over GM's
demand that the union agree not to strike elsewhere once the Flint
strikes ended. GM's top negotiator, Vice President Gerald Knechtel,
returned to Detroit and didn't meet with his UAW counterpart, Vice
President Richard Shoemaker, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-week vacation shutdown over, GM resumed absorbing
losses of $80 million a day from the dispute, now in its sixth
week. GM today will report a strike-caused plunge in second-quarter
earnings and probably will use the occasion to restate its
determination to stand fast, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM needs to find a resolution that will enable the company to
improve its labor productivity to competitive levels and avoid the
union going on strike every three months,'' said Morgan Stanley
analyst Stephen Girsky, who predicted the strikes will last until
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes have now idled 165,000 workers nationwide and nearly
8,000 GM workers in the Miami Valley. Those workers idled at local
plants include 3,900 at the Moraine truck assembly plant; 1,300 at
the Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems plant; 1,100 at the Kettering
suspension part plant; 550 at the Moraine engine plant; 500 at the
Vandalia air bag plant; and 420 at the Delphi Chassis parts plant
on Home Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite local layoffs, about 3,400 workers at two Dayton brake
plants went to work Monday. More than 1,000 brake plant workers on
Needmore Road and Wisconsin Boulevard were idled before the
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the future of the brake plants remain in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   UAW Local 696 in Dayton, which represents workers at the brake
plants, continued talks with GM officials Monday in hopes of
settling several issues that have split the company and union for
over two years. Like the Flint disputes, the Dayton talks center on
outsourcing issues, work rules and health and safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
   No progress was reported in the Dayton talks on Monday. UAW
officials have threatened to call a strike in Dayton after a
settlement in Flint, but the union has not served GM with a
five-day strike notice.
</P>
<P>
   GM shares fell 2 5/16 to 68 7/8, their biggest decline in more
than a month, reflecting investor disappointment in GM's failure to
reach a weekend settlement after raising expectations that it
would. The shares have dropped 8.7 percent since the strikes began,
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index has risen 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest automaker is expected to cut benefits for
about 100,000 UAW members in the U.S. laid off because of the
walkouts, in an effort to spread the strike costs to the union. The
union, which maintains such a move is illegal, would pick up the
benefits from its $800 million strike fund.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel also said the company would continue to push a
grievance it filed earlier alleging that the strike is illegal.
It's also considering whether to seek a court order forcing workers
back to the plant.

 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An athletic-looking Dane, with blond hair, blue eyes
and an arrest warrant for armed robbery, hires a British arms
dealer with a colorful resume. In Latvia, they buy a Russian cargo
plane and have it flown to Bulgaria where it is loaded with 77
cases of weapons, including 300 assault rifles, ammunition,
pistols, hand grenades and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then heads east to India. When it gets over the
village of Purulia, near Calcutta, the weapons are shoved out,
drifting down under parachute rigging purchased in South Africa.
The deal is financed out of Hong Kong. The intended recipient is a
violent religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   However fictional it might sound, this was a real-life arms
shipment, one that reveals the circuitous measures terrorists and
rebel groups employ to get weapons, and how relatively easy it is
for them to do so. It also illustrates the almost complete lack of
international controls on the small-arms trade. [In Oslo on Monday,
the United States and 20 other governments opened a meeting to
discuss measures to deal with the spread of assault rifles,
pistols, grenades and other so-called small arms.)
</P>
<P>
   Generally it is not a crime for a weapons dealer to get around
the arms-control laws of his country by having the weapons shipped
from another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge loophole,'' said Geraldine O'Callaghan, an analyst
at the British American Security Information Council, an
independent group that lobbies on small-arms issues. ``It needs to
be addressed urgently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Clinton administration closed this
loophole two years ago by giving the State Department greater
authority to monitor and regulate arms brokers. As a result,
American arms dealers are now subject to the same laws whether they
are shipping weapons directly from the United States or brokering
deals abroad. The administration is pushing other countries to
adopt similar controls.
</P>
<P>
   Britain plans to address this, but only in part, by preventing
arms dealers from selling weapons to countries on which the United
Nations has arms embargoes.
</P>
<P>
   While weapons falling from the sky is downright bizarre, the
other elements of this tale typify a black-market small-arms
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have deals like this being brokered on all continents of
the world every day,'' said Donald Manross, an American who is
director of the firearms and explosives division at Interpol, the
international police group that is still investigating the Purulia
deal, which occurred in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier for the black-market trade to flourish because even
legal transactions are highly secret. To protect the commercial
interests of businesses, most governments, including the United
States, do not disclose information about licenses issued to arms
exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the document that governments rely on to control the
destination of weapons, the so-called end-user certificate, can be
easily forged, and a dealer has no legal responsibility to check on
the validity of this certificate before shipping the weapons. Rebel
groups and terrorists use phony end-user certificates in order to
disguise where the weapons will wind up.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has tough export controls, but in this sale to the
Indian religious sect, none of the arms touched British soil and no
British documents were involved. Thus, while the British arms
broker, Peter von Kalkstein-Bleach, languishes in a Calcutta jail
on charges of waging war against India _ his plane was forced down
when the deal went sour _ he does not appear to have violated any
laws in Britain where he was based. Nor is the other British
arms-trading company, Border Technology and Innovations Ltd., which
arranged for the weapons to be bought and shipped from Bulgaria,
accused of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bleach has pleaded not guilty in India to 12 counts, all of
which carry the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If significant curbs are going to be made on the shadowy arms
trade, said Manross of Interpol, end-user certificates need to be
standardized so that it is more difficult for them to be forged and
easier for a company to check their validity.
</P>
<P>
   Manross noted that in the last year there has been considerable
discussion among a few government and independent groups that study
the small-arms trade about the need to crack down on the illicit
trade in small weapons. ``Now, we have to move to concrete
action,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bleach's deal began in the summer of 1995 when he heard from a
German commodities trader that a Danish businessman wanted to buy
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Like many arms traders, Bleach, now 47, has a military
background, having served in the British army. Afterward, he was a
prison guard in what was then white-ruled Rhodesia. He returned to
Britain as a private investigator and later took up commodities
trading, including arms deals. His company, Aeroserve, has a
license from the British Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Walter Mitty character, and a bit of a lady's man,''
said Christopher Hudson, who met Bleach 15 years ago in the course
of their political activities in the Tory Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who is engaged in a campaign to save Bleach from
hanging, likes to call Bleach ``the Milk Tray man.'' It is a
reference to an advertisement popular in Britain in the 1970s,
where a dashing man in a black polo shirt jumps out of planes and
helicopters and braves shark-infested waters or other dangers to
deliver a lady her Cadbury's chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   For the Purulia deal, Bleach showed up in Amsterdam to meet a
man who introduced himself as Kim Davy. Bleach also met with Davy
and his lawyer at the business center of the Intercontinental Hotel
in central London.
</P>
<P>
   Davy's real name is Niels Christian Nielsen. He was born in
Denmark in December 1961, according to a confidential Interpol
report. He took the name Kim Davy from a New Zealand infant who
died at the age of 5 weeks. He has also engaged in gold and drug
smuggling, money laundering and counterfeiting $100 bills,
according to the report Interpol refers to as a ``red notice.''
</P>
<P>
   A teetotaler and vegetarian, Nielsen is a member of the Ananda
Marga, a Hindu fundamentalist group founded in 1955 in India,
according to Interpol. The police agency says that the sect has
been responsible for ``many acts and threats of violence against
Indian government buildings and personnel,'' and was the intended
recipient of the weapons. Davy eluded the Indian police when Bleach
was seized and is still at large. Several European countries also
want him for crimes ranging from armed robbery to counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   A series of faxes from Bleach to Davy and his partners provides
rare glimpses inside the world of small-arms trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed from the very beginning that in order to be
successful, it is most important that this resembles a perfectly
normal transaction in every possible way,'' Bleach wrote in one
five-page fax.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single contractor should be aware of the entire route,''
Bleach scolded. Only the pilot should be aware of the ultimate
destination of the weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are not completely clear, at the time he was
meeting with Davy, Bleach decided to go to the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the British Defense Ministry, one that is again
highly revealing, Bleach said that if he backed out of the deal,
Davy ``will simply go elsewhere, and somebody else will provide the
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he took $30,000 from Davy and bought the Russian
aircraft, Hudson said. After the operation, Bleach planned to sell
the plane and keep the money as part of his profit, Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   To get the arms, Bleach turned to Border Technology, an
arms-trading company in Hexham, in northeast England, because it
had experience in getting weapons, said Peter Scott, one of the
company's two directors; both men are former British military
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Border Technology would not discuss the details of the
transaction but Bleach told Hudson the company was paid $165,000
for the first shipment of weapons, the one that was parachuted,
netting the company a ``minimum profit'' of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 300 Kalashnikov assault rifles there were 20,000
rounds of ammunition; 15 9-millimeter pistols and 4,000 rounds of
ammunition; two sniper rifles, with night vision sights; 10 rocket
launchers and 200 rocket grenades, and 100 hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   If they had been shipped from Britain, Border Technology would
have needed an export license, which the British government might
have been reluctant to issue.
</P>
<P>
   So Border Technology turned to a leading Bulgarian arms maker,
Arsenal Co., for the high-quality Kalashnikov rifles and pistols.
On the shipping documents Arsenal declared the weapons ``technical
equipment'' and omitted the code that would have identified the
cargo as weapons, a senior Bulgarian defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal did not respond to telephone and fax requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from prison to Hudson last August, Bleach said that
when he became suspicious about the deal, he told one of Border
Technology's directors ``the facts, and suggested that it would be
a damned good idea to call the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not want to know,'' Bleach wrote. Bleach had already
made his initial contact with the authorities, and continued to
talk with them after his warning to Border Technology, Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the Border Technology director, said his company had
acted on the basis of what it considered to be a ``genuine''
certificate that identified the final customer as the Bangladesh
Defense Ministry and in any event had done nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   The certificate was fraudulent, said Hudson.

CUBAN EXILES SAY NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES ARE BASELESS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Cuban-American National Foundation Monday dismissed
as ``baseless'' a series of articles that have appeared in The New
York Times in recent days about ties between leaders of the group
and a Cuban exile who has acknowledged carrying out a series of
bombings in Cuba last year. The foundation said there was ``no
truth to any of the allegations made in the story.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Monday afternoon at which he was
flanked by leaders of the organization, Jorge Mas Jr., a son of the
late founder of the group, described the articles as part of an
effort to weaken the foundation in order to end the American
economic embargo against Cuba. He also questioned whether an
interview with the exile commando leader, Luis Posada Carriles, had
taken place at all.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a Spanish-language television station in
Miami Monday that was later broadcast at the news conference,
Posada confirmed that he had talked with The Times about his
relationship with the foundation and its leaders. But he denied
that foundation leaders had ever supported him financially or that
he served as the armed wing of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article said that Posada agreed to about six hours of
tape-recorded interviews in which he said his efforts were
supported financially for more than a decade by leaders of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't represent the armed wing of any exile organization and
I don't belong to the foundation,'' he said in the television
interview. ``I am an independent man, which is why I call myself
Solo.'' He added, ``I make a living from my work, from the sale of
my paintings and my books.''

U.S. HOPES JAPAN CAN RESTORE CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: see related JAPAN-POLITICS, JAPAN-REACT) 
(HLW) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Monday urged Japan's next
government to move quickly to ``restore confidence in Japan's
financial system,'' even while administration officials said they
feared that political paralysis in Tokyo greatly complicated
efforts to ignite a recovery in Asia and ease pressure on other
countries, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials on Monday spent little time mourning the
departure of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose slowness to
act on economic reforms had been a continuing source of frustration
here.
</P>
<P>
   But several administration officials wondered aloud whether any
of Hashimoto's likely successors would be able to piece together a
coalition strong enough to bail out the Japanese banking system and
provide a sharp stimulus to the economy _ and to do so before the
deterioration in the Japanese currency does greater damage to the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, said in an
interview: ``One can hope that this vote will be seen by the new
administration in Japan as a definitive wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   But colleagues of hers in the administration said that it was
too early to determine whether Hashimoto's party would interpret
its electoral loss on Sunday as a signal to accelerate reforms or a
sign that it should be cautious about causing economic pain.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts on Japan say the election could stimulate action.
``Up to now, the main pressure to get the house in order was from
the U.S. and from the markets,'' said Michael Mochizuki, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``That was big pressure. But
still, what you read from Japan was that no one wanted to make any
hard choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is domestic political pressure. The question is
whether that translates into action.''
</P>
<P>
   How the markets interpret the politics will reverberate beyond
Japan. Just a few weeks ago, for example, a Treasury Department
study found a ``surprisingly strong correlation'' between the fall
of the yen and the flight of investors from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other financial contagions that have swept through Asia
and beyond in the last year, no one can entirely explain this
phenomenon, beyond citing the psychology of increasingly wary
investors who are nervous about emerging markets of all kinds,
including Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   But the link was one more factor in the race to put together the
$22.6-billion package for Russia that was announced on Monday by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It was this same concern about Russia, and the growing pressure
on China to devalue its own currency, that led President Clinton
and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin to order an intervention in the
currency markets a month ago to strengthen the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's election could unwind that effort. If the political
turmoil in Japan is prolonged, one result could be another panicky
sell-off of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to soak up time that Japan doesn't have, and
that the rest of Asia doesn't have,'' one administration official
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Liberal Democrats' drubbing clearly took the
administration by surprise. At White House meetings last week, the
consensus was that the party would garner at least 54 or 55 seats
in the upper house of Parliament. It won only 44.
</P>
<P>
   But in public on Monday, administration and Japanese officials
aimed their public comments at forestalling a sharp reaction in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever the new prime minister is, he will try to implement
the economic plans formulated by the Hashimoto government,''
Japan's ambassador to the United States, Kunihiko Saito, said as he
sipped green tea in his office along Embassy Row.
</P>
<P>
   Saito is a veteran of managing relations with Washington during
times of upheaval: he was the country's top career diplomat,
running the day-to-day operations of the Foreign Ministry, when the
Liberal Democrats were thrown out of power in 1993. Then, it was
because of corruption, not ineptitude in handling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sunday's defeat was less dramatic, in some ways it is
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   There was little international cost to the political chaos that
followed the 1993 upset; the issues of political reform were
entirely domestic. This time, they ripple daily through the
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   So now, though the party retains the prime ministership, it must
convince Washington, the markets and Asia that a weaker governing
party will push through painful reforms that a stronger government,
under Hashimoto, shied away from.

SENATE EFFECTIVELY KILLS GOP-BACKED BILL ON PROPERTY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Blocking a conservative drive to make it easier for
developers to challenge zoning and environmental laws in federal
courts, the Senate on Monday effectively killed a property rights
bill supported by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 52-42, with the leadership falling well short of
the 60 needed to prevent a filibuster, the Senate refused to limit
debate on the measure, and signaled that the legislation probably
cannot survive this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation passed the House last year by a wide margin,
but even if the Senate had concurred, the proposal faced a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of environmental votes pending before Congress
adjourns for elections, the Senate's action on Monday may reflect a
distaste in Congress for proposals weakening environmental
protections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, favored by home builders and agricultural groups but
opposed by environmental advocates and local governments, would
broaden the powers of two specialized courts, the Court of Federal
Claims and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington, to review federal, state and local restrictions on how
property may be used.
</P>
<P>
   Its sponsors, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, argued that landowners face too many legal
roadblocks when they claim that environmental regulations violate
their rights under the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits taking
private property without just compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, joined
those who argued that environmental regulations can amount to the
unfair seizure of property.
</P>
<P>
   ``What value does a piece of property have in Kansas, or in
Connecticut, or in Mississippi, if you have been told, `Yes, it is
your land, we won't take it, but by the way, you can't use it the
way that you had intended,''' he said. ``What value does it have if
you can't use it?''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow developers to move swiftly to challenge
state and local zoning rules in the federal courts, overturning a
legal doctrine that allows federal courts to defer to state courts
on many such issues and making federal claims ripe for review even
before local challenges are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives in Congress have offered property rights
proposals before, this attempt was unusual because it would have
affected state and local regulations as well as federal rules. The
legislation has been opposed by the national organizations that
represent state governors, state legislators, mayors and county
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, a leading Republican
environmentalist, called it ``strange to me that this is being
brought up by Republicans, who are always concerned about activist
federal judges. This puts everything in the lap of activist federal
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters argued that the constitutional rights of property
owners were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that every day in America, private property is
being taken without just compensation,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. ``We all know in the name of endangered species, in the
name of wetlands, in the name of numerous other public purposes,
that private property is being trampled on.''

Whittaker   investor   confident   of future 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a sign that Whittaker Corp.'s future continues
to brighten, Century City-based Tennenbaum &AMP; Co. LLC recently
bumped up its stake in the Simi Valley, Calif.-based developer of
aircraft fluid control and fire safety systems from 3 percent to
about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managing member Michael Tennenbaum said Monday his company first
invested in Whittaker about 15 months ago. Earlier this month,
Tennenbaum &AMP; Co. bought the additional shares on the strength of
the improvements spearheaded by Whittaker Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Joseph Alibrandi.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to the helm in 1996 after a brief retirement,
Alibrandi has shed several ``problem businesses'' and reduced debt,
leaving a strong core business that has helped return the company
to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses they have are excellent and they have been
excellent,'' Tennenbaum said. ``The bad businesses were obscuring
the good ones and threatening them financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Whittaker has a tax loss to carry forward for the next
three years that will save the company from paying taxes during
that time, which will boost cash flow and help the company whittle
down its approximately $71.5 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the company will be totally out of debt in
three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker officials did not return telephone calls Monday to
discuss Tennenbaum's investment. Whittaker shares closed up 0.875
at 15 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies or investment groups of late also have increased
existing stakes or bought into Whittaker, in some cases picking up
stock that was sold off by larger corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for example, Beverly Hills-based investment group
Canpartners Investments IV LLC purchased 1.97 million Whittaker
shares from electronics giant Raytheon Co., giving Canpartners
one-fourth ownership of Whittaker. &QL;

ZIMBABWE JOURNAL: MUGABE ATTACKS, AND GAY ZIMBABWEANS FIGHT BACK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Nearly three years ago, in a dispute over a
small stand at an obscure book fair, President Robert Mugabe
suddenly lashed out against gay men and lesbians, making remarks
that echoed around the world. He said they were ``worse than pigs
and dogs'' and had no civil rights in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Although gay organizations overseas were shocked and angry, gay
Zimbabweans largely did what white Zimbabweans had done 10 years
before, when Mugabe began attacking them: ducked their heads and
tried to get on with life.
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. Both sides have now dug in, and a state
of undeclared war exists between gay Zimbabweans and the president.
</P>
<P>
   Activists recently thwarted a plan by California State
Polytechnic University at Pomona to award the president an honorary
doctorate, and have asked foreign human rights groups to picket his
overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, for his part, repeatedly takes gratuitous slaps at gay
men and lesbians. At a news conference on another topic in another
country in May, for example, he told foreign reporters, ``In
Zimbabwe, all the freedoms you get elsewhere _ except that of gays
_ are allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently told journalists at an editor's funeral to ``report
negatively'' on homosexuality. He has even suggested, gay activists
said, that women not attend baby showers, saying that talk about
sex and libidinous kwasa-kwasa dance music led to lesbian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the press and society in general have become
homophobic in a country that was once indifferent to or tolerant of
gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   When the controversy began in 1995, many people were ignorant of
homosexuality. Rural Zimbabweans said some heterosexual friends had
asked if gay people had both male and female sex organs.
</P>
<P>
   Because African men commonly hold hands and share bedrooms, gay
men said, the police used not to recognize them as gay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say, the police sneer at them and refuse to
investigate gay-bashing incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't accept us anymore,'' said Tina Machida, a leader
of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, a gay rights group known as Galz.
``The bouncers from the bar next door to a club where we held our
last party tore down our decorations and got violent. They were
saying, `The president doesn't like people like you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Street boys who sell sexual favors to older white men now harass
black gay men. ``They see us as a threat,'' said Chesterfield
Samba, another activist. ``They start yelling to the police: `How
come you're not arresting them? They're homosexuals mincing
around!'''
</P>
<P>
   Galz recently opened a headquarters in a suburban house, and the
government-owned Sunday Mail promptly called it a whorehouse for
white foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The group used to meet with the police to press for fairer
treatment. ``We thought we were getting somewhere,'' Ms. Machida
said. ``But they were looking over the members, then finding their
parents and saying, `Do you know your child is gay?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The battle got nastier recently when the World Council of
Churches, which is to meet here in December, invited Galz to join
its human rights session. Conservative local churches and the
government have objected.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is all the more awkward for Zimbabwe's public image
because two prominent court cases about gay sex crimes are under
way, too.
</P>
<P>
   The first case concerns the Rev. Canaan Banana, 62, who was
president from 1980 to 1987, when Mugabe absorbed his largely
ceremonial post. He is charged with sodomy and indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses _ most of them his youthful police bodyguards or
cooks between 1983 and 1986 _ described a pattern in which he would
ask them to play cards, offer them a drink, put on some music and
then insist on teaching them to dance. While dancing, they said, he
would kiss or fondle them, in one case squeezing one's buttocks
appreciatively, saying, ``This is the food of the elders.'' Most
fled in confusion. One jumped out a window. Another screamed so
loudly that the president's wife appeared. A third said he pushed
the president into a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The key state witness, Jefta Dube, was sentenced in 1995 to 10
years for killing another policeman. His defense was that he had
been driven to do it because the man tauntingly called him
``Banana's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he was drugged, and later woke up with his
pants off and a smiling president saying, ``We helped ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He became, he testified, a reluctant sex slave. When he finally
resisted, he said, Banana jailed him.
</P>
<P>
   Banana, a Methodist minister with four children, has called the
accusations ``a mortuary of pathological lies and a malicious
vendetta.'' The defense said the acts never took place. But if the
court found that sodomy took place, his lawyer argued, it was
consensual, and consensual sodomy ought not to be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some Zimbabweans suspect that the charges were brought now to
destroy Banana as a possible successor to Mugabe, who is under
pressure to step down. Mugabe has never commented on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, a Galz leader, Keith Goddard, was accused of
sodomy. The charge was brought, he said, by a 20-year-old man he
had never met who wrote him letters recalling a night they had
supposedly spent together and demanding $500, a color television, a
stereo, an electric burner, a kettle and an iron. In the final
letter, the man threatened to have him arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard, 38, said he gave the letters to the police as evidence
of extortion. At a lineup, he recognized the author as someone who
had once visited the Galz office. Although Goddard is short,
stooped and frail, the man first accused him of overpowering him,
then said Goddard had a gun. The police searched Goddard's house
but found only toy guns still in their packages, which were
intended for his maid's children.
</P>
<P>
   Galz activists said the young man admitted extortion but was
pushed by the judge to change his plea to not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a pattern _ the police bringing prosecutions
against victims,'' said Iden Wetherell, a columnist who frequently
criticizes the government.

 FLINT, Mich.: come back.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon after the strike began, both sides began alternating
serious negotiations with moves to escalate the dispute further.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the UAW made a strenuous effort to solve after just six
days the strike at an auto body parts factory in Flint that makes
hoods, fenders and engine mountings. GM even made the important
concession on June 11 of promising to return parts-making equipment
removed from the factory before the strike. But when those talks
broke down, the UAW ordered a walkout at a nearby spark plug and
speedometer factory that is losing jobs to Mexico and East Asia,
where wages are lower.
</P>
<P>
   The second walkout raised the difficult question of GM's steady
push to build factories overseas while slowing investment in its
low-profit American operations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the auto body parts factory, the spark plug and
speedometer factory is part of GM's inefficient Delphi Automotive
Systems subsidiary, which makes mostly small, low-technology auto
parts. GM wants to sell part or all of Delphi and the UAW does not
want it sold, so the second walkout dragged in this long-festering
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the second walkout, GM began threatening to
close assembly plants and terminate the production of some
slow-selling car models if the UAW did not compromise. The threats
angered the UAW, and raised the contentious question of how many
workers GM would employ in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the UAW threatened further walkouts later this year
at other parts factories here and in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio.
GM responded last week by insisting that long-simmering disputes at
those factories be resolved before any agreement is reached here
</P>
<P>
   The entire morass of issues has left bargainers saying that
while GM and the UAW have labored through more than a dozen local
strikes in the last five years, not one of those disputes has
approached the complexity of the current mess. ``It's complex
enough. These are sufficiently complicated, I'm not sure you could
make them more,'' said Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president
for GM issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both sides say that the broader questions are unlikely to be
settled by any deal here. Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for
North American personnel, said on Sunday that the main issue
remained a union insistence that GM invest more money in the auto
body parts factory here despite its low productivity. Improving
that productivity will require changes in union work rules and a
company investment in new equipment - the local issues here 39 days
ago before either side began bringing up other problems.
</P>
<P>
   And Hackworth warned Monday night that, ``it appears as though
we have a long haul before settlement is reached.''

<P>
   When Patrizio Bertelli, the chairman of Prada, made his purchase
early last month of 5.5 percent of Gucci stock, he met with
Domenico De Sole, the chief executive of Gucci, to tell him so.
</P>
<P>
   What else the two might have discussed is not known, but a few
weeks later, Bertelli announced that he and his wife, the designer
Miuccia Prada, had increased their stake to 9.5 percent. The
Gucci-Prada relationship has quickly taken on the plot twists,
grand ambitions and personal intrigues of an Italian opera.
</P>
<P>
   Though sewing machines will be still next month, when Italians
take their annual summer vacation, lips will be atwitter about what
the Gucci-Prada attachment means. For many Milanese, the raid is
indicative of the way the Italian fashion business will change in
the next five years: a phalanx of generational family businesses
giving way to family-controlled public enterprises that can compete
globally.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction has not only exposed Gucci's weakness _
vulnerability to takeover _ but also laid bare Prada's uncertain
future. Will the company be able to evolve from its revolutionary
nylon handbags and jackets, which are now a part of the fashion
vocabulary?
</P>
<P>
   Aligning Prada with the much larger, debt-free Gucci, which in
1997 had sales of $975 million compared with Prada's $480 million,
would certainly benefit the privately held Prada. Both companies
have suffered loss of business, including 40 percent in the
deteriorating Asian market.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dutch law _ like many international companies, Gucci is
based in the Netherlands to take advantage of favorable tax laws _
a 10 percent stake would allow Bertelli to have the right to demand
a seat on the Gucci board. That request would be subject to
shareholders' approval. Among the shareholders are De Sole and Tom
Ford, the creative director of Gucci. But Bertelli has not yet
stated his intentions, a state of affairs that is confounding De
Sole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are monitoring the situation and we're very
thoughtful about it for the shareholders,'' De Sole said. ``And
obviously we don't want to be distracted because Asia is a very
sensitive situation and we want to be on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychodrama aspects of the purchase by Prada seem rooted in
the personal nature of the Italian fashion business and the rumors
and speculation the purchase has engendered. On Monday, HDP, a vast
Italian luxury goods holding company, denied reports that it was
negotiating a deal with Prada to take over Gucci. As reported in
the Italian press, the denial included the biting twist that if the
company wanted to take over Gucci, it would do so itself.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, several Italian business leaders said they were
shocked by Bertelli's actions. They now believe it indicates the
shadow of changes crossing over Italian fashion, one that will see
more family companies go public to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange,'' said Paolo Gerani, vice president of Gilmar
S.p.A., a second-generation fashion house owned by the Geranis.
``But that's life. That's business. Even if it's Italian. It's a
huge amount of money to put into a company without control or even
without asking for a seat on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is one of a handful of Italian fashion companies that are
public. Others include Bulgari and Marzotto. But Bertelli's move,
coupled with the many companies, including Giorgio Armani and
Gianni Versace, which have indicated an interest in going public,
point to a growing sense of how Italian fashion executives see
their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger would be positive for Italian industry because it
guarantees continuity,'' Massimo Ferragamo, president of Ferragamo
USA, said. ``Italy has learned takeovers and mergers from the U.S.
And we've noticed it with the French groups. It protects both
companies because you're part of bigger things.'' It was Ferragamo
last year that purchased Emanuel Ungaro's company. In January, HDP
bought Valentino. Both purchases were solicited and welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's Achilles' heel is that it is a public company without a
family dynasty exerting control. In fact, when referring to Gucci,
it is ``Dynasty,'' the television show, that comes to mind.
Patrizia Gucci now awaits trial on charges that she arranged the
murder of her husband Maurizio Gucci, one of the scions of the
founders of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   If there does not seem to be much sentiment either way for the
company's stewards, De Sole and Ford, it is because neither has
deep roots in the Italian fashion world, where Bertelli and Ms.
Prada have transformed a family business. They took it from being a
small respected luggage company to a global fashion arbiter. And in
one sense, fashion observers believe that Gucci, leaving itself
vulnerable, got what was coming to it.
</P>
<P>
   Vendome, the French luxury company that once owned Karl
Lagerfeld, was interested in buying Gucci before it went public.
Since then, LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton has expressed
interest, but nothing has come of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither De Sole nor Ford would comment on steps being taken to
fend off a takeover by Prada. Gucci has already bought back some
outstanding shares. To an extent, their hands are tied, as De Sole
must do what is best for shareholders, like maximizing the stock
price. On Monday, Gucci closed at 54 15/16. Its low in the last
year was 28}, reflecting troubles in Asia.

 UNDATED: in Asia. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born in Italy, De Sole, now a U.S. citizen, was once a partner
in Patton &AMP; Boggs, the Washington law firm. He has worked with
Gucci for 14 years. Ford is an American who left Perry Ellis to
become the designer for Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Malkin, director of equity research for Warburg Dillon
Read and a specialist in apparel, said a Gucci-Prada merger would
ultimately cut costs for both companies as they would pool
production, distribution and influence with retailers. Bertelli's
next step, she said, is to begin negotiations with Gucci. ``It
would be too expensive to keep buying shares on the open market,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rub in any such deal might be the grudge factor. It is
unlikely that De Sole or Ford would stay on with Bertelli. A few
years ago, Bertelli accused Gucci of copying his wife's designs.
Back then he must have taken satisfaction that everyone was copying
Ms. Prada's designs.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be lost on Bertelli that the man who stopped that
practice was Ford when he exploded onto the scene in 1994. Almost
overnight, Gucci became Prada's No. 1 competitor. Sales jumped from
$263.5 million in 1994 to $500 million the next year. Gucci surged
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prada has to find some definitive direction for its
ready-to-wear,'' said Gloria Gelfand, a director at Marketing
Management Group, a fashion consulting company. ``Where they're
great is those accessories that took over the market completely. I
guess I know who their customer is for ready-to-wear, but I don't
know that they're so many. Gucci has been able to get their message
out to a discerning customer.''
</P>
<P>
   In stores like Neiman Marcus, Prada and Gucci sometimes vie for
the same trendy fashion customer. But Gucci's coin of the realm is
easily understandable: sex. Ms. Prada's clothes are more cerebral.
The men's spring 1999 shows in Milan two weeks ago were
illustrations of the differing approaches. Ford chose a vibrantly
casual motif that drew on 70's pop culture and hip-hop; Ms. Prada
created her concept around stripped-down sleeveless suits with
subtle details like laser-cut collars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ford nor Ms. Prada returned telephone calls seeking
comment about the situation. Both designers, along with Bertelli
and De Sole, run into each other at industry functions, and it is
an uncomfortable situation among them and others in the Milan
fashion whirl. ``Tuscany is a very small place,'' one fashion
executive said in reference to the region where Gucci and Prada
operate offices and factories.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it will get smaller still as Prada, Gucci and other
Italian companies confront the unpleasant realities of global
business.  &QL;

IMF SAYS IT WILL BORROW FROM MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: see related RUSSIA-IMF) 
(HLW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Its financial strength depleted by the Asian
crisis, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday that it
would have to borrow from its richest members to pay for the
bailout of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The $11.2 billion in new loans being provided by the fund to
Russia this year, plus the possibility of an additional $2.6
billion next year, would just about wipe out the money available
from the fund's main financing pool, IMF officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the
fund, said that the loan package to Russia will largely tap a
backup credit line from 11 of the largest industrial countries,
including the United States. The American share is expected to be
$2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has not had to use the credit line _ described by a
senior American official on Monday as a ``spare fuel tank'' _ since
1978. With Japan in political and economic flux and other economies
throughout Asia moving downward, analysts and American officials
said that the IMF and the other multilateral lending institutions
faced a real possibility of being caught short should another major
crisis erupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts them pretty close to the bottom of the barrel,''
said Morris Goldstein, a former IMF official who is now with the
Institute for International Economics, in Washington. ``If a big
case comes in, or maybe a couple of medium-sized cases, then you're
stuck. Your alternative then is to go around hat in hand and try to
put it together bilaterally.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that the situation added
urgency to their request that Congress provide new money for the
IMF. The Senate has approved a White House request for $18 billion
for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the House has balked at providing the money without
conditions that the White House has considered unacceptable,
including limits on family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Any congressional approval would not have direct effects on the
Russia bailout. But it could help the fund if it needed additional
money to deal with a further spreading of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each of these developments, it becomes ever more
important that Congress act quickly to approve IMF funding,'' a
senior American official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee is scheduled to take up the
issue on Wednesday. But Republican aides said on Monday that the
party leadership has not decided whether to seek the full $18
billion or to limit the bill to one part of the financing, $3.5
billion that would go to an expanded version of the backup credit
line.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave open the question of the other $14.5 billion.
That money would be the American contribution to an increase in the
monetary fund's main financing pool, which is financed by quotas _
or membership dues _ levied on each of the 182 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress said that they would push the Republicans
to act quickly to approve the new appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have the luxury of simply waiting for something
to happen,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader, said after meeting President Clinton at the White House on
Monday. ``It's happened. We've got to act soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Fund officials said that they plan to raise $8.4 billion for the
Russia bailout from the credit line, known as the General
Arrangements to Borrow. The United States, which provides 25
percent of the money under the credit line, expects the fund's
request to be approved quickly by the big industrial countries, the
senior American official said. American participation would not
require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Under the credit line, the United States and its major allies
can provide the fund with up to $23 billion, which has to be repaid
at market interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The quotas paid into the fund by its members total $195 billion.
But of that, the fund has $30 billion available. Half of that has
to be kept in reserve in case any member countries decide to
withdraw part of their quotas, which they are free to do, much like
a depositor at a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that without tapping the backup credit line,
the fund has no more than $15 billion available. By the end of the
year, fund officials said, its available funds will have declined
to worrisomely low levels, even including the backup credit line.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in Congress said the fund was exaggerating the
crisis it faces. They said the fund has $30 billion in gold
reserves, plus the ability to borrow on the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said the fund badly needed the
flexibility that would accompany the pending quota increase and the
increased backup credit line. The increases were proposed by the
fund after the financial crisis in Mexico in 1995. That crisis
showed international lending institutions how quickly global
financial markets could overwhelm entire economies.

MARKET PLACE: A LEGAL-FEE FIRECRACKER IN CENDANT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since 1995, federal securities laws have been clear
about who should be in charge of a securities class-action case:
the plaintiffs with the biggest financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   But what if those plaintiffs are public entities whose officials
have received campaign contributions from the lawyers who represent
them in such cases? How, then, can investors be assured of getting
the lowest legal fees?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions have unexpectedly popped up in the huge
class-action case against Cendant Corp., the corporate owner of
such well-known brands as Avis car rentals, Howard Johnson hotels
and Century 21 real estate offices.
</P>
<P>
   Given the concern about legal fees and campaign contributions,
more is at stake than just the vast sum that vanished in the blink
of an eye for Cendant investors.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were born on April 16, when Cendant's high-flying
stock plummeted 46 percent, to $19.0625 from $35.625 the night
before, wiping out what lawyers call an unprecedented $14 billion
in market value. The plunge came after Cendant reported that
accounting irregularities had arisen at CUC, a discount shopping
club business it acquired late last year. Cendant's shares have
remained moribund since then, falling $3.125 on Monday to close at
$18.875 on continuing concern about revised financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 shareholder lawsuits were filed against Cendant in
the weeks after its stock's swan dive. Since class-action lawyers
typically seek about 30 percent of the amount they recover for
investors, it looked like a juicy plum in the legal basket.
</P>
<P>
   But who would get the biggest slice of it? Thanks to amendments
to the federal securities laws, adopted in 1995, the likely answer
is whoever represents the three giant public pension funds that
claim the biggest losses. All else being equal, the ``lead
plaintiffs,'' who will oversee the case for all affected
shareholders, are to be those with the biggest financial interests
at stake, according to the 1995 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The California Public Employees Retirement System, known as
Calpers, the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the New York
City Pension Funds together claim to have paper losses of more than
$89 million on their Cendant investments. No other group of
plaintiffs even comes close. And those funds have banded together
and selected Bernstein Litowitz Berger &AMP; Grossmann of New York and
Barrack, Rodos &AMP; Bacine of Philadelphia to represent them.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the end of this story but for a feisty New York
class-action lawyer named Howard Sirota. Sirota negotiated a $93
million settlement for investors hurt in the collapse of the Crazy
Eddie electronics store chain in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He tossed a firecracker into the Cendant case on Friday by
filing a motion in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., arguing
that the three pension funds should not be allowed to run the case
because they cannot assure the lowest possible legal fees and may
be influenced by campaign contributions that have been made by one
of the law firms representing them. Judge William Walls is
scheduled to hear arguments on the motion on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Sirota is urging the judge to conduct a sort of auction,
awarding ``lead plaintiff'' status to the plaintiff whose lawyers
will work for the smallest percentage of the ultimate recovery, a
process pioneered by Judge Vaughn Walker of U.S. District Court in
San Francisco in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Max Berger, senior partner at Bernstein Litowitz, argued in
response to Sirota that the 1995 amendments to federal securities
laws ``preclude competitive bidding'' as a way of determining who
should be lead plaintiff. ``The belief and hope by Congress was
that institutional investors would become more pro-active in
securities class-action cases _ and that seems to be the case _ and
that that would have a positive effect on the negotiation of
fees,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he added, ``We have agreed to accept fees substantially
below the level that are normally awarded in these cases.'' But
both he and his clients declined to describe the fee structure. (
Sirota, by contrast, said his team was willing to handle the case
for 15 percent of any recovery up to $100 million and 10 percent of
any additional amount.)
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Grundfest, a former member of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and now a law professor at Stanford University, flatly
disagreed with Berger about the 1995 securities law amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the law preventing a judge from adopting a
process that could only be satisfied by something very much like an
auction,'' he said. ``In a case of this magnitude, you could see
that even a 1 percent reduction in the normal fee would represent
millions of dollars that would go into investors' pockets, not into
lawyers' pockets. I could be disbarred for saying this, but I think
that's a better place for the money to go.''
</P>
<P>
   While calling for a competitive auction to determine the lead
plaintiffs, Sirota notes that Bernstein Litowitz and its partners
contributed more than $40,000 to the election campaign of the New
York state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, who is the sole trustee of
the New York State pension fund involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members of the class have a legitimate interest in
considering whether Carl McCall is going to be principally
concerned about the recovery by the investors, or the potential
campaign contributions from the legal community,'' Sirota said.
``It raises the `pay to play' issue in a new context,'' he added,
referring to the SEC's nickname for the genteel influence-peddling
that it fears has tainted the municipal bond market. In response to
the commission's concerns, underwriters of municipal bonds have
been barred for several years from contributing to the campaigns of
public officials who award local government bond business.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for McCall, said Sirota's
allegations were ``preposterous.'' He added, ``There is absolutely
no truth to it, and it is offensive.'' He noted that all three
pension funds had to agree on the choice of counsel, selected from
a pool of firms that were qualified through a competitive review
process.
</P>
<P>
   Berger confirmed that he and his partners had contributed to
McCall's past campaign, but he said that the donations reflected
gratitude for his ``courageous'' challenge to Texaco Inc. when
Berger represented Texaco employees in a suit over hiring and
promotion practices and that the donation had absolutely no effect
on the selection process in the Cendant case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sirota has touched a nerve. With Congress encouraging
public pension funds to get more active on the class-action front,
the public officials who oversee those funds find themselves with a
new basket of patronage plums to distribute _ the legal work from
such complicated and protracted cases. The temptation to award
those plums to campaign contributors is understandable, if
worrisome, said Grundfest, who has been monitoring the effects of
the 1995 amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, this is the first time this question has
arisen,'' he said. ``I think the courts should and will look at it
very carefully, although the remedy would be to look at the
selection process for the law firm, not to change the lead
plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Because of the magnitude of the potential fees, and
the relative clarity of the facts in this case, this might be the
ideal circumstance to raise those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirota could not agree more.

HOME SALES JUMP IN LOS ANGELES VALLEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the first sign of a broad-based recovery for
the housing market this decade, sales of single-family homes in the
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys soared in June, thanks to
brisk movement in homes of all prices, a trade association has
reported.
</P>
<P>
   For years, first-time home buyers drove the market with their
purchases of entry-level houses, while sales of costlier residences
remained sluggish. But lately, the recovery has spread to include
higher-end homes, including many that cost more than $1 million,
according to a Southland Regional Association of Realtors report
Monday. Together with tight inventory, home prices have rocketed to
recent highs as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular market upturn is in all areas,'' said Jim
Link, executive vice president of the Realtors group. ``Sales of
homes costing $300,000 and up are strong. It was dead in the
mid-1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling demand is a strong economy, a healthy job market and
long-term interest rates that are hovering at a low 7 percent, he
said. Link expects these factors to continue to drive home sales
and prices for the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is going to remain strong for the rest of the
year,'' he said. ``We're very confident that by the end of the
year, we'll greatly outpace last year and it will probably be the
best year we'll have since 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley last month, sales of existing
single-family homes rose 31 percent more than a year ago _ to 1,315
closed escrows. That is the most closed escrows since May 1989, the
Realtors group reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Clarita Valley, sales of single-family homes rose
37 percent last month to a record high of 269 closed escrows.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of stronger sales among higher-priced homes, the
median price of single-family residences in the San Fernando Valley
closing escrow last month rose 26.1 percent to $208,000, the
highest since January 1993. The percentage increase was the largest
since June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six of the San Fernando Valley escrows were priced at
more than $1 million, including a few sales at $2 million or more,
the Realtors group said.
</P>
<P>
   Median prices in the Santa Clarita Valley rose 10.8 percent to
$205,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Homeowners) have recouped a good bit of the equity they
lost,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is tighter inventory: There were 10.8 percent fewer
existing homes listed for sale last month in the San Fernando
Valley _ or 4,623 _ compared with a year ago. In the Santa Clarita
Valley, active listings dipped 21 percent to 799.
</P>
<P>
   The brisk housing market also brought out new sellers, with new
listings up 14.6 percent to 1,935 homes in the San Fernando Valley
and up 20 percent to 306 residences in the Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Zicarelli, president of Style Realty and Investments in
Tarzana, said it's a seller's market and that buyers don't have the
luxury of waiting to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   He knew of a potential buyer who waited through a weekend to
offer $30,000 below the asking price of a house he wanted. However,
the home seller got another offer for the full price in the
meantime and made a deal, Zicarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for homes costing $500,000 and higher is healthy, with
many selling in a month, Zicarelli said. In 1993, it would have
taken three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is different for San Fernando Valley condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   In June, sales dropped by 0.3 percent to 307 closing escrow. But
median prices rose 40 percent to $125,500. Active listings dropped
by 10.8 percent to 921 and new listings rose 1.3 percent to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Condominium sales slowed down after the number of units priced
under $100,000 dwindled, Link said. With available condos now
priced between $110,000 and $125,000, they became less attractive
to buyers since they're much closer in cost to single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Santa Clarita Valley condo sales rose 24.6 percent to
81 closing escrow last month. The median price rose 12 percent to
$124,500. &QL;

 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Hawaii, Nev., Okla., La., Fla., Bahamas,
Mexico)  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wherever she went, flaunting her bad wigs and paste
diamonds and hostile charm, something seemed to disappear: a
neighbor's wristwatch in Las Vegas, a car from a dealer's lot in
Honolulu, a mink coat from a piano bar in Washington. Then, it was
people who vanished.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Mexican women taken for slaves in her homes in
California, Hawaii and Nevada. There was the banker in the Bahamas
who met her for dinner and was never seen again. There was the Los
Angeles businessman who knew enough to be terrified of her. He was
found shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, after the 63-year-old grifter calling herself
Sante Kimes had come to New York with her son, Kenneth Kimes Jr.,
23, it was Irene Silverman, an elderly, eccentric millionaire who
disappeared in what the authorities call a not-so-mysterious plot
to take over her fortune and her Manhattan town house.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Silverman, an 82-year-old widow, was probably killed,
officials say, and while her body has not been found, the police
say they have virtually solved the crime and have had the suspected
killers in custody since hours after Mrs. Silverman vanished a week
ago. The Kimeses were seized in midtown on an unrelated warrant,
along with documents that the authorities say suggested an
extensive history of both subtle and violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the most ingenious, evil con artists we've seen in a
long time,'' a senior law-enforcement official said as a task force
of New York and federal investigators sought to piece together what
they characterized as a huge mosaic of fraud, theft, arson and
murder that reached across the country and into the past.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the record of crimes and its litany of dates, places
and victims, lies another story, as a review of court records and
more than two dozen interviews with former acquaintances,
law-enforcement officials and others show, about a tyrannical
mother and a malleable son caught in a love-hate relationship and
in a perilous dance of scams, aliases and life on the run that
would have seemed, at least from the son's standpoint, highly
improbable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange story of two generations of a family that
experienced poverty and riches; that had several luxurious homes
but staffed them with indentured servants; that owned motels and a
construction company but often acted penurious; that fought endless
battles, in court and out, with insurance companies that believed
Mrs. Kimes was trying to scam them.
</P>
<P>
   The central characters might have stepped out of Faulkner or
O'Neill: an outrageously flamboyant mother with a dark and
secretive side, stealing things endlessly, obsessed with
manipulating and controlling others; her husband, an older man,
sometimes drunk, often remote but seeming to have cared deeply
about his son, and the boy who was caught between them.
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances said Kenneth Kimes Jr. grew up in well-to-do
circumstances but in a turmoil of emotions, dominated by a mother
who hired his private tutors, selected his clothes, decided who his
friends would be and swept him off to another home, another town,
if he did not obey or got into trouble. Some neighbors said the boy
hated his mother, while others said he may have loved her but also
was ashamed of her, and feared and distrusted her.
</P>
<P>
   Sante Kimes had a criminal record dating to 1961 and made no
secret of her penchant for theft and scams. Two of her houses were
burned _ one of them twice _ in what authorities called suspicious
fires to collect insurance. She had aliases and phony papers to
keep creditors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Sante Kimes went to prison for three years, the
neighbors said, did her son lead a relatively normal life, growing
closer to the father who indulged him and dreading the day of his
mother's return. When she came back and reimposed her controls, the
boy attacked and beat her, a neighbor said. His father's death in
1994 was a crushing blow, a friend said. And when he went to
college in California, court papers show, he beat up one student,
hit a girlfriend and threatened others in a dispute over $35.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Kenneth had become his mother's criminal accomplice
stunned many who had known him as a boy. ``This is what astounded
us on the news, that he would team up with her,'' said one woman.
``He hated her. It's unbelievable that she could make him do these
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But several others said his father's death was the turning point
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Vittorio Raho, 23, a childhood playmate in Las Vegas, who called
Kenneth ``one of the first friends I ever had,'' said there was no
hint of trouble in the boy he knew, no impulse to cheat, steal or
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Raho said things might have been different if Kenneth's mother
had been kept in jail and his father had survived a few more years.
``If his mother was never allowed out, I don't believe these events
would have occurred,'' Raho said. ``I think a lot of it had to do
with his father's death, and his mother's return. Those two
combining factors may have pushed him over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   No formal charges have yet been filed against Sante Kimes and
her son in the disappearance of Mrs. Silverman; in the slaying of
David Kadzin, who was found dead in Los Angeles last March; in the
1996 disappearance of Syed Bilal Ahmed in the Bahamas, or in a
recent series of arson, theft and fraud cases in which one or both
are suspects. For now, they are being held in New York without bail
for an Aug. 6 hearing on a charge of defrauding a Utah car dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, gaps remain in the portrait of mother and son drawn
from interviews with former acquaintances and documentary evidence.
It is unclear, for example, what happened to the millions that the
senior Kimes, who died in 1994, had accumulated, and why scams were
resorted to in the light of such riches. But many people who knew
Mrs. Kimes said she simply had a compulsion to steal.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Meade, a Las Vegas accountant who was the family's
bookkeeper in 1993 and '94, said Mrs. Kimes was remarkably up front
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a crook _ don't trust me,'' she quoted Mrs. Kimes as
saying. ``She'd tell you that right up front. She thought it was
funny. To her it was like a game of Monopoly. She just liked to do
it, and when she got away with it, she was as happy and excited as
a little kid.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE EARLY YEARS: A STRANGE FAMILY, AN ISOLATED CHILD
</P>
<P>
   While much of the family's early history is unclear, court
records indicate that Sante Kimes was born Sandra Louise Walker in
Dust-Bowl Oklahoma in 1935. She grew up in Las Vegas. Her earliest
arrest record was for petty theft in Sacramento in 1961, and more
followed: larceny, auto theft and other crimes in Los Angeles,
Santa Ana, Calif., and Palm Springs, Calif., and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, she gave birth to a son, Kent Walker. A
decade later, she married Kenneth Kimes, a businessman 16 years her
senior. For 20 years, he had owned a construction company that
built motels in California, and he owned at least five himself,
including one across the street from Disneyland and one in Palm
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his wife, Kimes was quiet and shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little strange, I guess you would say,'' said William
R. O'Connell Jr., a hotel owner in California. ``He did not
socialize much. He kept to himself. He was kind of eccentric. He
was almost, on a much smaller scale, like a Howard Hughes
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage changed the fortunes of Sante, as she began to call
herself. Over time, she and her husband maintained homes in
Honolulu, La Jolla and Santa Barbara, Calif., and Las Vegas. In
1975, when Kimes was 56 and his wife was 40, she gave birth to
their only son, Kenneth Kimes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Walker was 12 years older than his half-brother. Now a
vacuum cleaner salesman in Las Vegas, he has been estranged from
the family for years, and has declined in interviews to discuss the
estrangement, his years with the family or the allegations against
Sante and Kenneth Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the family spent much of its time at a beachfront
house in Honolulu. Charles F. Catterlin, a lawyer who represented
Mrs. Kimes in Hawaii, recalled visiting her ``spacious and
absolutely beautiful'' home. He also said he was cheated out of
$12,000 in legal fees and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stiffed me,'' Catterlin said from Texas, where he now
lives in retirement. In his unsuccessful lawsuit to collect, he
listed 22 aliases he said she used. It included many variations of
Sandra: Santa, Sante, Santee, Sandy, Sane Taj, and surnames that
included Chambers, Jacobson, Powers, Saligman, Singer, Singhers,
Singhrs, Walker and Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he said, she stole a white Cadillac from a dealer in
Honolulu, and later tried to bilk an insurance company for
$100,000, saying she had lost an antique quilt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, on a trip to Washington, the Kimeses met Vice President
Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty, at a reception at Blair House.
Kimes got into the affair by calling himself an honorary official
of the Bicentennial Commission.
</P>
<P>
   On another visit to Washington, in 1980, Mrs. Kimes was arrested
at the Mayflower Hotel with a $6,500 mink coat she had stolen from
a piano bar. Using medical excuses, she succeeded in delaying the
trial for five years, but she was eventually convicted in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Kimeses moved to Las Vegas and bought a two-story,
4,000-square-foot house at 2121 Geronimo Way, a cul-de-sac on the
edge of the Las Vegas National Golf Club. It is a neighborhood of
lawyers and other professionals, retirees and casino workers with
houses valued today at up to $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Kimeses were regarded with suspicion, and 18
years later the animosity lingers. Several neighbors remember Sante
Kimes vividly: a voluptuous woman who wore heavy makeup, all-white
outfits, big black wigs and picture hats or turbans. Frank Clemens,
a lawyer who represented Mrs. Kimes, said: ``She had mounds of
hair. She was a large woman who wore scads of jewelry and an
enormous amount of perfume.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose child played with Kenneth said of Mrs. Kimes:
``You just knew she was strange. The moment you spoke with her, you
just didn't want your child to be in her company. She had a
condescending attitude.'' She added, ``When Kenny was little, she
didn't want neighborhood kids to play with him because he was a
`genius.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said she believed that Kenneth disliked his
oppressive mother, but was afraid to say so. But neighbors say
Kimes sometimes appeared to be drunk, unable to intervene for the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses were reclusive, as well, rarely inviting anyone in.
Brambles and a tall fence shielded the yard from the golf course
and prying eyes; the house, of a 1950s ersatz Frank Lloyd Wright
design, had almost no windows, only sliding glass doors with ``keep
out'' decals on them.
</P>
<P>
   The family often went away, leaving the house empty for months.
Long absences and poor maintenance left the place shabby, and that,
too, stirred resentment in the neighborhood. So did a Fourth of
July incident involving Kenny, who launched a rocket that set fire
to a neighbor's house and caused $170,000 in damage. A lawsuit led
to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought he was too bright,'' one neighbor said
of Kenny. ``He didn't have a lot of common sense the way he
rationalized and thought about things. Basically, he just didn't
care. I wouldn't say he was inconsiderate, but he wouldn't think of
others when he would do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was regarded as an oddball for another reason. For several
years, in the early '80s, his mother did not send him to school.
Instead, she hired tutors who accompanied the family on their
travels. Cynthia Montano, one tutor, went with the family from Las
Vegas to California and then to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, she said, she was told to roam poor sections and
find teen-age girls who spoke no English to work for the Kimeses as
maids. She was told to assure their families that they would be
well paid and cared for, given regular days off and allowed to call
home.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight young Mexican women were lured away and smuggled
into the United States by the Kimeses, usually one or two at a
time, over several years. Neighbors reported seeing them in and
around the family's homes in Las Vegas, La Jolla and Honolulu in
the early to mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1985, one of the Mexican maids sought refuge at
the door of a neighbor in Las Vegas. ``She looked panicky,
frantic,'' the man recalled. He said the young woman asked in
broken English for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Kimes were arrested in August 1985, on federal
charges of enslaving the maids. Seven testified in February 1986
that they were never paid, were allowed no days off and were not
permitted to leave or contact relatives. They also told of beatings
and other abuse by Mrs. Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes pleaded guilty to a reduced charge _ that he knew of the
offenses and did nothing about them _ and was given a three-year
suspended sentence and ordered to pay a $70,000 fine. But his wife
was sentenced to five years in prison. And their son's life began
to change dramatically.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TRAUMATIC EVENTS: A MOTHER'S RETURN AND A FATHER'S DEATH
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was 11 when his mother went to jail. His father, who had
always been generous, installed a swimming pool, bought the boy a
piano and gave him freedom to be with friends. He also dropped the
tutors and sent the boy into sixth grade at a Catholic elementary
school, where some of his friends went.
</P>
<P>
   Vittorio Raho, the childhood playmate, referred to the time of
Mrs. Kimes' imprisonment as ``Kenny's golden years,'' adding: ``His
father was a very kind guy, a good friend. We'd go over to his
house and he'd buy 10 McDonald's. There would be four or five of us
there lazing around.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kimes rushed construction of the pool for Kenny's
birthday and threw a party. Later, he took Kenny, Vittorio and
another friend on a weekend trip to Beverly Hills, Calif. They
stayed in a hotel on Rodeo Drive, went shopping and had breakfast
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes, then 67, made more time for his son by veering away from
business. He sold his motel in Anaheim near Disneyland, the Mecca,
to his fellow hotelier, O'Connell, for $3.4 million in late 1986.
``He kind of gave me the impression he was throwing in the towel,
that he planned to retire, that he was tired,'' said O'Connell, who
estimated Kimes' net worth at $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kenny had almost no contact with the mother who had
dominated his earlier life. ``He didn't even want to speak to her
on the phone,'' Raho said. ``He was ashamed of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend said Kenny began to voice resentment against his
jailed mother. ``He said he hated his mom,'' the man said. ``He
just said she was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the boy graduated from grade school and began classes
at Bishop Gorman High School. He soon become interested in sports,
clothes, computers and ``had several short-term girlfriends,'' Raho
said.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changed in 1989, when Mrs. Kimes was released
after serving three years of her five-year term. ``He was very
traumatized when she got out of prison,'' a female friend said.
``That was when the whole roller coaster started. He dropped out of
high school, then started travels to Tokyo, Hawaii, the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Raho agreed. ``When the mother came back, she told Kenny that
she did not want her son associating with any of the friends he had
made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was transferred to Green Valley High School, and the
family moved to a house across town where he had no friends. Before
they left, a neighbor said, Kenny, now 15, became so angry that he
attacked and beat his mother. But his rebellion was soon over, and
he was swept off to other homes and more tutors.
</P>
<P>
   In Montecito, an affluent enclave of Santa Barbara, they leased
a luxurious seaside house and contacted a friend, John Boettner, a
retired teacher, who helped them find several tutors for Kenny.
During what would have been his last three years of high school,
the tutors accompanied the family to Hawaii, the Bahamas and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Boettner called Kenny ``a courteous young man who had some
obvious academic abilities,'' and said he did well enough to be
admitted to the University of California at Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   But trouble seemed to follow the family. On Sept. 19, 1990, a
suspicious fire destroyed the Kimeses' house on Portlock Road in
Honolulu. There had also been a suspicious fire there in 1978, and
the insurers, Chubb Corp., refused to pay the 1990 claim.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, meantime, filed suit against Chubb and began making
threatening calls to Chubb executives. The company counter-sued and
obtained an injunction against her. Her suit was eventually
dropped. No criminal charges were filed in the fire, which was
never formally declared to be arson.
</P>
<P>
   While the Honolulu case was a standoff, there were always other
scams, other questionable activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas house, an open garage door occasionally
revealed television sets and other appliances that some neighbors
thought might be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, neighbors said they saw a moving truck cart away
some furnishings from the house. Shortly thereafter, an insurance
investigator came to their doors to ask about Mrs. Kimes' claims
that burglars had taken the furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade, the Las Vegas accountant who was the Kimeses'
bookkeeper in 1993 and 1994, said Mrs. Kimes always had many
lawsuits going, some against her and others against a myriad of
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade said Mrs. Kimes created confusing paper trails for
creditors, process servers and lawyers, and sometimes used Ms.
Meade's address or phone number to throw off the hounds.
</P>
<P>
   One gimmick, Ms. Meade said, was to list Kimes properties in the
names of other people; some of these people were paid, while others
were used unwittingly. She said she once learned, to her surprise,
that she was the owner of the house near Green Valley High, and
Kadzin, the Los Angeles businessman whom they had known for years,
became the unwitting owner of the Geronimo Way house _ an
arrangement that held sinister portents.
</P>
<P>
   While the couple had millions, Ms. Meade said, Mrs. Kimes could
not resist the temptation to steal and scam. Once, Ms. Meade said,
Kenny wanted a laptop computer with certain features and
specifications. Even before it could be bought, Mrs. Kimes was
submitting an insurance claim for such a computer, saying it had
been stolen from her car. It was her way of getting the laptop for
free, Ms. Meade said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meade said Kimes had told her not to give his wife details
of his portfolio of stocks. And when she refused to give in to Mrs.
Kimes' demands for information about his holdings, she said, Mrs.
Kimes dismissed her.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1993, Kenny enrolled at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, and in 1994, after several years of
failing health, his father died, apparently of natural causes. The
size of his estate and how it was disposed of is unclear,
investigators say. But a few months before his death, property
records show, he transferred a laarge parcel of land in Santa
Maria, Calif., to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kimes' ashes were being spread over a bay in Hawaii, his
wife was looking at engineering companies to survey the Santa Maria
site, consisting of 170 building lots, for a future housing
development _ and then refusing to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny was devastated by his father's death, a friend said.
Moreover, it seemed to move him closer to the mother he had long
distrusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months, maybe a year after his father's death, he still seemed
near tears about it,'' Raho said. ``He changed after his father
died, because he said he did love his mother. I said, `Are you
serious _ you love your mother?' He said, `She's my mother, man.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PARTNERS: SCAMS GROW MORE SINISTER
</P>
<P>
   At college, Kenny Kimes' own violent streak surfaced. In
November 1995, a student, Carrie Louise Grammer, filed for a
restraining order against him, saying he had become abusive after
his cat had soiled her roommate's bed. Kimes, she said, had
promised to pay for the $75 worth of bed linens and then handed
over only $35.
</P>
<P>
   Her petition said Kimes ``came at me in a threatening manner''
and ``proceeded to angrily curse me.'' She also maintained that
Kimes had ``hit his ex-girlfriend'' and had beaten another student
so badly that he had to be hospitalized. Kimes denied these
charges, and a state judge told him and Ms. Grammer to stay away
from each other.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Kenny had dropped out of college, and he may have
conspired with his mother for the first time in pair of malpractice
lawsuits against a plastic surgeon, Dr. Joseph Graves of San Diego.
Kenny sued for what he called a botched nose job. His mother
claimed she had suffered a head injury falling off the doctor's
operating table during a face-lift. ``She portrayed herself as a
`longevity model,' an older person who is beautiful and still does
modeling,'' said Joseph Lange, the lawyer for Graves. Both suits
were dismissed after the plaintiffs failed to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, the mother and son were staying in Nassau,
the Bahamas, when Syed Bilal Ahmed, 55, a native of Bahrain and an
officer of the First Cayman Bank in the Cayman Islands, began
investigating irregularities at a First Cayman subsidiary, the Gulf
Union Bank in Nassau, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Ahmed's said he had been approached by the Kimeses
about an online business venture. On his last trip to Nassau, his
family said, Ahmed was accompanied by the Kimeses. Doug Hanna,
chief of the criminal investigative unit of the Royal Bahamas
Police, confirmed that Mrs. Kimes later went to the Gulf Union Bank
in Nassau and saw Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's family said he had an appointment to dine that night
with Mrs. Kimes. But he disappeared and was never seen again. His
luggage also vanished from the Radisson Cable Beach Resort in
Nassau. By the time the police learned that Ahmed had met with
Sante Kimes, the woman and her son were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian investigators say they would like to question the
Kimeses, but have no proof linking them to the banker's
disappearance or the bank's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late last year, investigators say, Sante Kimes, trying to
cash in on the unused Geronimo Way house, began a series of complex
financial transactions. Since 1992, the house had been listed in
Kadzin's name, to keep it out of reach of creditors. Martin
Handweiler, a lawyer and longtime friend of Kazdin, said Kazdin had
signed a deed for the Las Vegas property as a favor for the elder
Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes went to a Florida bank and took out a $200,000
mortgage on the house. After obtaining the money, she again changed
the name on the title. The new owner became Frank McCarren, an
indigent man she found in a Las Vegas homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, investigators said, Mrs. Kimes took out fire
insurance on the home in McCarren's name. The house was then
heavily damaged in a fire on Jan. 31. Arson experts found that
fires had been deliberately set, one upstairs and one downstairs,
with a flammable liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance scam unraveled when McCarren told investigators
that Mrs. Kimes had held him captive, beat him and forced him to
memorize prepared lies for the inevitable questions. The insurance
money was never paid.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Florida bank that had given a mortgage on the
house contacted Kadzin, who said he had not applied for any
mortgage. Kadzin, 64, who had known Mrs. Kimes for 20 years, was
terrified of her, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bank called, a woman whom Kazdin did not
recognize appeared at the door of his home in Granada Hills,
Calif., and ``made the statement along the line of, `You know you
got the loan, but you're working with a very vague memory,''
Handweiler said, adding that Kazdin then received several phone
messages from the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
   And when Kazdin was found shot to death last March 14, suspicion
fell on the Kimeses, whose whereabouts were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they were nearby, in rooms at the Beverly Wilshire
Hotel. Before leaving the West Coast in April, they bought a green
1997 Lincoln Town Car from a dealer in Cedar City, Utah, who agreed
to take the order by phone because the Kimeses had bought other
cars from him without problems. It was delivered to Los Angeles,
and Sante Kimes paid for it with a $14,900 check that bounced.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer filed a complaint, but the Kimeses and the car were
gone, headed for Florida. In Baton Rouge, La., they picked up an
$80,000 motor home from a dealer with a similar scam, paying with a
rubber check. The motor home was found abandoned in Florida several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-June, mother and son were in New York, where Kenneth,
using a phony reference, rented a $6,000-a-month apartment at the
East 65th Street town house of Mrs. Silverman. By early July,
investigators said, the pair had forged the paperwork to take over
her money and town house. On July 5, Mrs. Silverman disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, as Sante and Kenneth Kimes returned to the New
York Hilton, they were finally arrested _ not for murder, arson or
any of the countless scams of which they are suspected, though
their car was full of papers that appeared to implicate them in a
vast web of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   They had been tripped up by the Utah car dealer's bad-check
complaint.

CHRYSLER POSTS STRONG SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GM-STRIKE)  
(lh) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Zipping smoothly past Wall Street's projections,
Chrysler Corp. reported second-quarter earnings Monday that were
more than double the strike-ridden second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler said that cost-cutting, strong sales, and the growing
popularity of high-margin products like the Dodge Durango sports
utility vehicle combined to overcome much of the financial damage
of high levels of rebates and discounting. Total revenue topped $17
billion, a Chrysler record for a second quarter that would have
been more impressive if it did not cost the company $1,485 a car in
sweeteners to secure buyers. That was up more than 20 percent from
$1,230 in the first quarter and 50 percent from $980 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been getting better every quarter at offsetting the
costs of incentives, even though they are going up,'' said Wendy
Beale Needham, an auto industry analyst for Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, summing up how Chrysler beat Wall Street's projections by
about 10 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting included reductions in advertising, lower raw
materials costs and about $100 million from more efficient
manufacturing, for a total of between $400 million and $500 million
in total savings, the company said. Chrysler said it is ahead of
its plans for meeting its previously announced goal of shaving $1.5
billion off of annual spending during the course of the year. And
the company's North American market share reached 16.1 percent, up
from 15.5 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler earned $1 billion, or $1.51 a fully diluted share,
compared with $483 million, or 70 cents a share in the quarter a
year earlier. In the 1997 quarter, a monthlong strike at a Detroit
engine plant cut deeply into sales of its high-margin trucks. As a
result, after tax profits of $1,040 a vehicle in the recent quarter
were nearly double those of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were initially pleased, bidding Chrysler shares up
more than $1 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading, but
the stock closed unchanged at $56.1875. Shares have been moving in
tandem with Daimler-Benz, the German carmaker Chrysler is planning
to merge with this fall, adjusting for currency fluctuations.
Daimler shares fell 2.85 marks, to 175.65 marks on the Frankfurt,
Germany, stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer, said in a
conference call with reporters that the company expected the
rebating and other discounting to subside enough to return the
average cost to first quarter levels for the rest of the year.
Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman, said in a statement that the
outlook for the industry remained favorable given high consumer
confidence and low unemployment but that growth is slowing and the
uncertain Asian economic situation merits close attention.
</P>
<P>
   Valade also said that the company had not benefited in the
second quarter from the General Motors strike and had not factored
in any strike-related gains in its projections for the current
quarter. He said Chrysler had already received inquiries from
rental car companies that normally buy from GM, but analysts noted
that automakers rarely find it profitable to pursue such business
when rivals are being struck because it can evaporate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The profits reported Monday helped swell Chrysler's cash
reserves to a record $9.2 billion, compared with $7 billion a year
ago. The company halted its share repurchase program when it
reached its agreement in May to merge with Daimler-Benz. Valade
said the cash would continue to accumulate for the next four or
five quarters and could be deployed in new products, or, at least
in part, returned to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not uniformly good. Total vehicle shipments rose
almost 15 percent to just over 849,000 but sales outside North
America tumbled 12 percent to 53,342 vehicles
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chrysler said that the heavy discounting had
probably moved some sales forward into the second quarter. The
company expects output to decline to 631,000 units in the current
quarter, which is still up 10 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is planning to release its earnings on Tuesday,
followed by Ford on Wednesday.

JURY SAYS SHARPTON, TWO ADVISERS DEFAMED FORMER PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Ten years after a white former assistant
district attorney filed a lawsuit to clear his name, a jury
declared Monday that he was defamed when three advisers to a black
teen-ager named Tawana Brawley accused him of kidnapping and rape,
creating a racial storm that roiled the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Steven Pagones, called the verdict a bittersweet
victory, for all the pain it had revived. But for the advisers, who
vowed to appeal, it was clear the verdict was just another chapter
in a case with its own life that has come to symbolize the
complexities of race relations in New York and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a battle that obviously is not over,'' said Michael
Hardy, the lawyer for the Rev. Al Sharpton, the best known of Miss
Brawley's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly eight-month trial, the verdict was an endorsement
of a 1988 grand jury report that discredited Miss Brawley's account
and suggested that her advisers had participated in a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was also a rebuke to the advisers, Sharpton, C.
Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr., whose critics have long said
represented a brand of ardent cynicism that twisted civil rights
advocacy into a vehicle for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   A separate part of the trial to set damages with the same
six-person jury is to begin Tuesday. Pagones, 37, is seeking $395
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are still to deliberate on the case, the jurors did
not speak about the verdict Monday. But there appeared to be some
division on the panel, with one unidentified juror refusing to sign
the verdict sheet. The jury includes two blacks and four whites.
Because Pagones' suit is civil, only five of the six votes were
required to find liability on each of the statements the advisers
made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones has always described his decade-long fight against the
advisers as a battle to establish accountability. As he claimed
victory Monday, he repeated that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mason, Maddox and Sharpton did hurt a lot of people. They
hurt race relations,'' he said, encircled by reporters from most of
the New York City news organizations outside the courthouse in this
Hudson Valley city, a two-hour drive north from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' wife, Niki, who married him surrounded by armed guards
because of the threats he was receiving in the midst of the Brawley
confrontation, leaned against him. ``It's been a long 10 years,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones may have trouble collecting any money from the advisers.
Maddox, 52, is a suspended lawyer. Mason, 51, is a disbarred lawyer
who is now a theological student. Sharpton, 43, says he owns no
home or other substantial property and is paid an annual salary of
about $60,000 by his organization, the National Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley, who was 15 at the time, was found apparently
dazed, with excrement and racial epithets etched on her body after
she disappeared for four days in November 1987. The grand jury
report suggested that she had concocted the story to avoid
punishment from her stepfather for being out without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also suggested that the advisers had permitted
the case to spiral into a national cause despite indications that
Miss Brawley's account was not what it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   With seven findings of defamation against Sharpton, including
two that he had made statements about Pagones that he knew were
false, the verdict presented a new challenge in Sharpton's widely
chronicled effort to give himself a broader base as he attempts to
forge a mainstream political career.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has attended the trial only intermittently, was
not here for Monday's verdict. As recently as last week, however,
he ridiculed the suggestion that his political ambitions could be
affected ``one iota'' by the verdict, saying his base of supporters
would always stand by his actions on behalf of Miss Brawley a
decade ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The jurors found that Maddox defamed Pagones twice and that
Mason defamed him once. But the jurors did not find defamation in
12 of the 22 statements upon which Pagones based his suit. The
jurors also rejected a contention by Pagones that the three
advisers, who are black, engaged in a conspiracy against him.
</P>
<P>
   After years of saying they would prove their allegations against
Pagones in court, the advisers never presented anything resembling
hard evidence that he was guilty of assaulting Miss Brawley or, as
they asserted 10 years ago, that he had killed a friend who they
said was also involved in an attack on Miss Brawley. The 1988 grand
jury concluded that the friend, Harry Crist, had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Maddox, who represented himself, and Stephen
Jackson, Mason's lawyer, often said they still believed Pagones was
one of Miss Brawley's attackers. Hardy, though, walked a delicate
line, never saying he believed Pagones had been guilty. Instead, he
argued that, as Miss Brawley's spokesman, Sharpton had a duty to
represent her zealously and that he did not behave with reckless
disregard for the truth and did not know any of the assertions he
was making were false.
</P>
<P>
   Because Pagones was an assistant district attorney, a judge
ruled early in the case that he would be viewed as a ``public
official.'' Under the law of defamation, a public official must
prove not only that derogatory and false things were said about
him, but also that the speaker either knew the statements were
false or spoke with reckless disregard of whether they were true or
not.
</P>
<P>
   One statement the jurors found Sharpton made with reckless
disregard for the truth was made on a television talk show on March
31, 1988: ``We stated openly, that Steven Pagones, the Assistant
District Attorney, did it. His lawyers say he may or may not sue
us. If we're lying, sue us, so we can go into court with you and
prove you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones sued after the grand jury concluded that there was no
evidence he had committed any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said that by finding no defamation in 12 of the
statements upon which Pagones sued, the jurors had agreed with the
advisers that something had happened to Miss Brawley. ``The main
thing here, was that this was not a hoax,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   In their verdict Monday, jurors seemed to focus on when some
statements were made. They found, for example, that nothing Mason
said during the most intense months of the Brawley confrontation
was defamatory. But they found that remarks by Mason in a talk at
Harvard Law School in March 1989, five months after the release of
the grand jury report, were defamatory and that Mason knew they
were false.

U.N. AGREES TO HELP ALBANIAN GOVERNMENT DISARM CIVILIANS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the request of the Albanian government, the
United Nations has agreed for the first time to help disarm a
civilian population that has amassed hundreds of thousands of
weapons and a vast supply of ammunition, a senior official said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians, who are among those supplying or selling arms to
ethnic Albanian fighters in Kosovo Province in Serbia, raided
weapons depots in the spring of 1997, after the collapse of a
nationwide pyramid scheme wiped out many people's savings and led
to general unrest. Since then, many more arms from abroad have also
been smuggled into the country, to be shipped to Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the Kosovo situation erupted, an estimate of
650,000 weapons is what we are talking about that had been taken
away from government depots,'' said Jayantha Dhanapala,
undersecretary-general for disarmament affairs, who went to Albania
last month to evaluate the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``An estimate of about 30 percent was given to us of weapons
that have leaked to other parts, not merely to Kosovo but to
Macedonia and elsewhere,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the secretary-general issued on Monday,
Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan, listed pistols, automatic rifles, machines
guns and grenade launchers among the weapons in local caches. They
also hold 20,000 tons of explosives and more than 1.5 billion
rounds of ammunition, including artillery shells.
</P>
<P>
   Dhanapala and his team met with government and opposition
leaders, including the former president, Sali Berisha, and
discussed how to persuade people to relinquish the weapons, which
would then be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. officials rejected buyback plans, which Dhanapala said
would be ``highly inflationary'' and would in effect reward people
who had unauthorized weapons in their possession. Instead, U.N.
officials are proposing a ``development for guns project,'' in
which communities that turned in weapons would get public works
projects that also provided needed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weapons are largely in civilian hands,'' he said. ``Many
of the people are unemployed, and sought the weapons as a means of
some kind of wealth which they could trade for money or goods at
some later stage. In the rural areas you had some of them burying
them underground or keeping them in trees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that the amount of guns that fell into criminal
hands is about 10 percent,'' he said. ``So most are in civilian
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhanapala said that the United Nations hopes to start a pilot
project in Gramshi, a district with a population of about 50,000
that is thought to have 8 percent to 10 percent of all weapons
commandeered in 1997. Gramshi also has a 30 percent unemployment
rate.
</P>
<P>
   In return for turning in weapons, the district has asked for
about 120 miles of rural roads, a small processing plant for
agricultural products and a training center to teach furniture
making. The area is heavily forested.
</P>
<P>
   Dhanapala now has to find money to pay for his project. He said
on Monday that he hoped for help from the poverty-alleviation
programs of the U.N. Development Program, from small-scale credit
projects at the World Bank and from country donations.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, there is imminent danger of catastrophe, he said.
Some arms depots have been mined and are unapproachable, he said.
``They could explode in the summer heat.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IF NICKLAUS ISN THERE, IS IT GOLF?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time since 1962, when he was a rookie touring pro,
Jack Nicklaus won't be teeing off in the British Open when it
begins Thursday at Royal Birkdale in Southport, England.
</P>
<P>
   After 146 consecutive major tournaments, he decided not to
enter. And Monday, he announced he would retire from the PGA Tour
after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the Nicklaus time span, consider that in 1962,
both Michael Jordan and Mark McGwire had not yet been born.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider that only two years ago, when Nicklaus was 56, he
was only one stroke off the British Open lead after a second-round
66.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you come here for; that's what you play 40 years
for,'' he said that day, then he laughed. ``Maybe I'll shoot 150
for two days.''
</P>
<P>
   He did just that, finishing with a 77 and a 73.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nicklaus approached the final green two years ago at
Royal Lytham and St. Annes and again last year at Royal Troon, a
waterfall of admiring applause engulfed the golfer who has played
Scotland's game better than anyone else. At the British Open, they
know their golf. And their golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye,'' a ruddy-faced Scotsman once said while watching
Nicklaus play at Muirfield, ``he's something to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scots like to say, ``If it's nae wind, it's nae golf.'' And if
the British Open is nae Nicklaus, isn't it nae golf?
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1979, he finished first three times, second or tied
for second six times, and third or tied for third twice. Over those
14 tournaments, he had 11 top three finishes. Something to beat
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his seconds, to Lee Trevino in 1972 at Muirfield and to
Tom Watson in 1977 at Turnberry, are as memorable as his three
victories.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicklaus won at Muirfield in 1966, he used his driver only
17 times. When he returned there in 1972 with a Grand Slam alive
after having won the Masters and the United States Open, he was
cautious again, hitting his 3-wood or 1-iron off most of the tees.
He also had awakened early in the week with a crick in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neck wasn't very good,'' he acknowledged years later,
``until halfway through the third round.''
</P>
<P>
   After 54 holes, Nicklaus was six shots back. Hitting his driver
in the final round, he took the lead after 11 holes, but on the
16th he missed a 6-foot downhill putt. Bogey. His 66 wasn't enough.
Trevino won by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always believe I played the course the right way and
didn't play well,'' Nicklaus said, alluding to his caution in the
first three rounds. ``What can I do about a guy who holes it out of
bunkers and across greens?''
</P>
<P>
   Trevino holed it four times from off the putting surface, twice
with a sand wedge he had found in a pro-shop barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not winning that British Open was a very big disappointment,''
Nicklaus said later. ``And it seems to have become bigger as the
years go by.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Nicklaus finished 65-66 but lost to Watson's 65-65 at
Turnberry in what is considered golf's classic medal-play duel.
</P>
<P>
   After being two shots behind with six holes remaining, Watson
holed a 60-foot putt from off the 15th green to tie, then birdied
the long 17th for the lead. On the 18th, he had a 3-footer for
another birdie, but suddenly Nicklaus holed a 40-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my caddie Jack was going to make that putt,'' Watson
said later. ``I just knew he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson now needed his putt, and made it. Nicklaus was second,
again.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year, Nicklaus won at St. Andrews for the second
time. He had won there in 1970 in an 18-hole playoff with Doug
Sanders, who had missed a 3-footer on the final hole of the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Andrews, to me, is the home of golf and where it all
began,'' Nicklaus said that day. ``It's my favorite place, and
where I most want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the 14th hole at St. Andrews in 1995, the golfer who has
played Scotland's game better than anyone else hit a 3-wood into
the notorious Hell bunker. After a slash with his pitching wedge
and two more with his sand wedge, he was still in it. Another sand
wedge and he was finally out. He chipped on, then three putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made many 10s,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   But when the British Open returns to St. Andrews in 2000, Jack
Nicklaus intends to play. He'll be 60 then, but don't bet he won't
shoot at least one round in the 60s. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ Placing another long-term bet on the Internet,
Microsoft Corp. Monday unveiled a new service that aims to link
buyers, sellers, brokers and lenders through an easy-to-use Web
site called HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is hardly the first to spot the Internet's potential

to work with existing players as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an outstanding proposition'' for the broker, said
Microsoft's Ian Morris, lead product manager for HomeAdvisor.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers pay nothing to have their properties listed on
Microsoft's site, along with all the contact information. Visitors
to the site can describe what they want and instruct HomeAdvisor to
send an e-mail message when new properties are listed that meet
their criteria. They can easily e-mail the listing agent or send
the listing to the agent they're already working with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it easy for agents to sell more homes faster,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor aims to make money in two ways: advertisements and
loan-origination fees when it helps match buyers with mortgage
lenders. In theory, the lenders will get enough extra business to
make it worth their while to give Microsoft a cut of the loan fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenders obviously have to believe we're going to add a lot of
value,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers are increasingly going online for mortgage
information, so smart lenders are looking for services such as
HomeAdvisor that can help them garner more of that traffic, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   HomeAdvisor includes a number of features that Morris believes
aren't available elsewhere: such as the ability to compare two
homes side-by-side; a ``defect detector'' database that helps
buyers spot problems from foundation cracks to electrical shorts;
and a tool that lets a borrower say what is most important in a
mortgage loan _ low monthly payment or short payoff time, for
example _ and ranks available mortgages accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best site I've ever seen,'' said J. Lennox Scott,
president of Seattle-based John L. Scott Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a wealth of information _ not just about properties
but about surrounding communities and nearby schools, for example,
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   And, by helping link buyers with listing agents, it's an
excellent ``connectivity'' tool and very ``friendly'' to the
real-estate industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we look forward to _ meeting more people''
through HomeAdvisor, he said. ``Real estate is a personalized
service industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is jumping aboard just yet, however.
</P>
<P>
   While several multiple-listing services around the country are
charter participants, the Kirkland, Wash.-based Northwest Multiple
Listing Service isn't among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the idea of the broker making contact with the
customer,'' president Jack Johnson said. Accordingly, Northwest
Multi-List allows its broker-members to post its entire database on
their sites, and about 35 brokers now do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``HomeAdvisor is a wonderful site,'' he said, and Northwest
Multi-List hasn't ruled out participating in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely enthusiastic about the Internet,'' he said.
``We're watching with great interest what's going on in other parts
of the country, in particular with these national real-estate
sites. We've just chosen at this point in time not to put our
information on there.''

CAMPAIGN FINANCE INQUIRY SAID TO BE MAKING SCANT PROGRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twenty-one months after accusations of illegal fund
raising arose from President Clinton's re-election campaign, law
enforcement officials concede they have no big cases to show for
their effort and express doubts that they will obtain evidence to
warrant prosecution of senior White House or Democratic Party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are increasingly pessimistic that they will
ever answer questions at the heart of the inquiry; that is, whether
there was a plot by the Chinese military behind contributions to
the Democratic Party that may have been intended to help Beijing
gain easier access to American space technology, and whether any
Democratic Party or White House officials knew of the Chinese
effort. Thus far investigators have been stymied in their efforts
to obtain the cooperation of witnesses in China.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are still people being investigated, and
conceivably a witness with crucial evidence could decide to
cooperate, breaking open the investigation. And it is even
conceivable that an independent counsel could be named to
investigate top officials. But the cases brought so far by the
Justice Department's campaign-finance unit have centered on
relatively low-level fund-raisers charged with illegally disguising
overseas contributions through straw donors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment Monday of the Thai businesswoman Pauline
Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law brings to eight the number of
people who have been charged, and officials expect more will be
charged with similar crimes in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said that despite hundreds of subpoenas and
thousands of hours of grand jury testimony, they have no evidence
that White House officials, their aides or Democratic Party leaders
broke the law, even though some investigators, from the inquiry's
early days, have sought evidence that higher-ups knew or encouraged
the acceptance of illegal contributions. Now, whether such cases
will be brought depends on the willingness of the fund-raisers to
plead guilty and testify against their superiors, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary value of that cooperation could prove only
marginally useful. So far, only one defendant, the California
businessman Johnny Chung, has cooperated with authorities. Although
he provided what was apparently a link between the Chinese military
and the Democratic Party, the officials said, it remained uncertain
whether his information would implicate any officials at the
Democratic National Committee or in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Justice Department officials are prepared to concede
that their investigative leads are drying up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This task force is on a roll with four new charges in the last
six days,'' said Bert Brandenburg, a spokesman for the Justice
Department, referring to tax charges brought last week against the
California fund-raiser Maria Hsia and fund-raising charges against
Howard Glicken of Miami, as well as the indictments Monday of Ms.
Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law, Duangnet Georgie Kronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``White-collar cases take longer than any other types of
cases,'' Brandenburg said. ``But through aggressive investigation
and prosecution, we have brought charges in mere months that
usually take years to bring. This continues to be the department's
largest criminal investigation, with more than 120 task-force
members, offices on two coasts and resources drawn from around the
country. And we are not done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans pass scathing judgment on the inquiry
and continue to demand the appointment of an independent
prosecutor, saying that the Justice Department, under Attorney
General Janet Reno, will never be able to credibly investigate the
fund-raising practices of the president's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people running this thing are people of
integrity,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who was chairman of
the Senate hearings on campaign finance abuses. ``But they refuse
to acknowledge the hopelessly conflicted situation they are in. If
they continue to travel down this road and wind up where it looks
like they are headed, it's going to look a lot like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling measure of the low fortunes of the campaign-finance
inquiry was illustrated after its top prosecutor, Charles Labella,
announced in May that he would resign to become the acting U.S.
attorney in San Diego. In trying to fill Labella's job, Reno found
few prosecutors willing to take on the challenge of leading the
inquiry already under way.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, such an assignment might be
considered a high-profile, career-making plum. But at least two
prominent federal prosecutors refused the offer. ``It's a loser,''
one prosecutor said. ``And it's going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno picked David Vicinanzo, an assistant U.S. attorney from New
Hampshire, to take command of an inquiry that critics insisted was
never given the top priority or the prosecutorial mandate that it
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation can only be described as a total disaster,''
said Michael Madigan, the former chief counsel to the Senate
committee that investigated campaign-finance abuses. He is now a
partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, the Washington law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan and leading congressional Republicans said that
prosecutors have only themselves to blame. They said members of the
campaign finance team had moved lethargically, failed to dig for
evidence against powerful Democrats and concentrated mainly on
lower-echelon fund-raisers like Ms. Hsia, Chung and Yah Lin Trie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hsia and Trie have pleaded not guilty to the charges against
them and are scheduled to go on trial this fall. Chung pleaded
guilty in March to campaign-related bank and tax fraud. He is the
first defendant to cooperate with authorities; he is scheduled to
be sentenced later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Republicans complained that the most vivid
example of the task force's failure was prosecutors' not taking
action against John Huang, the former Commerce Department official
and Democratic fund-raiser. He raised $1.6 million in contributions
that the Democratic Party later returned after questions were
raised about the origins of the money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that investigators were actively
reviewing Huang's activities, including fund-raising solicitations
made while he was an official at the Commerce Department and his
role in funneling overseas contributions to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Huang, who lives in California, has denied through his lawyers
any wrongdoing, but he refused to testify before Senate or House
committees by invoking the Fifth Amendment, the constitutional
guarantee against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the White House is stonewalling and you're having
hearings that are overtly partisan,'' Thompson said, ``it's
absolutely vital to have an aggressive prosecution going on
downtown. It was that way during Watergate. It was that way during
Iran-Contra. That was the big missing element we have seen in this
investigation. There was no pressure brought to bear on any of
these key people. So they either fled the country or refused to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews last week, Justice Department and other law
enforcement officials said that the investigation's failure to meet
the early expectations and perceptions of ineptitude were the
result of several factors, including investigators' own missteps
and changes in the leadership of the campaign- finance unit.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was first assigned to the Justice Department's
public integrity unit, which prosecutes official corruption. But
Reno, prodded by complaints from the FBI, brought in a fresh team
in October 1997, led by Labella, the federal prosecutor from San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Labella is planning to leave later this month to return to San
Diego and the U.S. attorney's office. James Desarno, the lead FBI
investigator assigned to the inquiry, was planning to accept a
promotion at his agency until the FBI director, Louis Freeh,
ordered him to remain in place indefinitely after news reports
about the move.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some prosecutors acknowledge that a battle-weariness has
slowed the pace of day-to-day operations, fed by the lack of
cooperative witnesses and the difficulty of conducting an inquiry
that must decipher the muddled and arcane laws involving campaign
finance. The House's campaign-finance investigation, led by Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., has also been stymied by a lack of cooperation
from many of its 108 witnesses, who have either left the country,
refused to be interviewed or invoked the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials also acknowledged that the inquiry was
hamstrung by sporadic feuding within the Justice Department over
the investigation's direction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, FBI officials and investigators continue to openly
question Reno's refusal to seek an independent prosecutor to
examine the vast swirl of accusations. Reno's repeated refusals
have been used to attack her image as a fair and objective law
enforcement official. Some say her obstinacy has drained the
campaign-finance investigation of its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Reno will most likely face new questions about the
inquiry's status when she appears before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

CRASH KNOCKS BOARDMAN, TOUR'S LEADER, FROM RACE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORK, Ireland _ What started as a festival day in the Tour de
France to celebrate a hero of the past, Sean Kelly, ended in
disaster Monday for a hero of the present, Chris Boardman, the man
in the leader's yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman, a Briton who is the top rider for the Gan team, was
injured about 35 miles from the finish of the race's second daily
stage after he seemed to brush the back wheel of a teammate,
Frederic Moncassin, and crashed, sliding along the shoulder of a
wide highway.
</P>
<P>
   Boardman was hospitalized with a broken bone in his left wrist
and a cut to his forehead. Boardman, 30, was wearing a helmet when
he struck his head in the fall. He was unconscious for a few
minutes before the race's ambulance arrived to treat him.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time that Boardman has been injured and
forced to withdraw from the Tour. In 1995, he crashed as he took a
curve in the rain during the prologue and broke his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Crashes are common in the Tour, especially in the early, nervous
stages. Another crash Monday decked Laurent Jalabert, the Frenchman
who is ranked No. 1 in the world; Laurent Brochard, the Frenchman
who is the world road-race champion, and Abraham Olano, a Spaniard
who is among the overall favorites. All were quickly up and back
riding.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the crash and 5 hours 45 minutes 10 seconds after
the pack set off in Enniscorthy for the 127.7-mile run to Cork, Jan
Svorada, a Czech with the Mapei team, won a mass sprint by a
bicycle length.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Rabobank, who is in
splendid form since he was third in the sprint on Sunday. Third in
the field of 186 men was Mario Cipollini, an Italian with Saeco,
who lost 3 minutes 40 seconds Sunday after he and several other
riders crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the vacated yellow jersey because of time bonuses
along the route was Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom. Second was
another sprinter, Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei, and third was
Moncassin.
</P>
<P>
   The field dropped from its original 189 riders when, in addition
to the loss of Boardman, Ludovic Auger of the Big Mat team did not
start and Erik Dekker of Rabobank had to quit partway through
because of injuries sustained in the Cipollini crash on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kelly too had to pull out of the Tour once because of a
crash, in 1987, that left him with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   King Kelly he was then, winning every bicycle race in sight
except the Tour de France, and King Kelly he remains: This was
unofficially Sean Kelly Day in the 85th Tour. Until Boardman's
crash, it was, as they say in Ireland, brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who retired four years ago at the age of 38, rode in 14
Tours and finished 12 of them. He captured the green points jersey
a record four times, won five daily stages and for a day, in 1983,
wore the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer's son, he still lives in his hometown of Carrick on
Suir, which he said in an interview before the stage is a strong
cycling town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it the home of cycling in Ireland,'' he said,
adding: ``They're very enthusiastic down there in the countryside,
more so than in Dublin. They're decorating all the shop windows,
and there's a lot of flags and banners. They're really making a big
thing about it. Of course, it's fabulous, a dream come true, that
the Tour has come to Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds were indeed huge and enthusiastic along the route despite
a cold wind and occasional showers on the Tour's final day of
racing in Ireland. French flags mingled with Irish ones, and
posters acclaiming Kelly hung from many a pole and window.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, a main area in Carrick on Suir, a village of 5,000,
has been called Sean Kelly Square, and through there the pack
streamed near noon as a crowd estimated at several times the
population cheered. Originally, the Tour was to have bypassed the
square because it was considered too narrow for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tight part of the street,'' Kelly called it. ``They wanted
to route the race just at the outskirts of town, and the people
down there weren't too happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials met with Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the
race, , and persuaded him to alter the route.
</P>
<P>
   A limestone boulder, called a jostling stone, at the end of the
square next to Jack Savage's butcher stop was uprooted from the
spot where it had rested since the 17th century. A few telephone
poles were removed, the sidewalk cut back.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kelly was standing on a podium to watch as the Tour
passed through his square. An explosion of cheers rang out for all
the riders and for King Kelly, then, now and forever.

REMNICK APPOINTED EDITOR OF NEW YORKER
</HEADLINE>

By ROBIN POGREBIN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Remnick, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who
has spent the last six years writing for The New Yorker on topics
from Alexander Solzhenitsyn to Mike Tyson, was named the fifth
editor of the magazine in its 73-year history on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment, which becomes effective immediately, was
announced by S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance
Publications. The announcement came just a few days after The New
Yorker's current editor, Tina Brown, resigned to start her own
media company in affiliation with Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the best man for the job,'' Newhouse said in
an interview on Monday. ``I think he has a combination of skills
both as a writer and conceptually as a magazine person.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse's announcement _ made Monday morning in a meeting at
the magazine in the presence of Remnick and Ms. Brown _ was met
with sustained applause by members of the staff, many of whom later
described their feelings as profound relief. ``It seldom happens
that the absolute best person on the face of the earth for a given
position gets that position,'' Hendrik Hertzberg, the senior editor
at the magazine, said.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's appointment comes after months of tension over the
magazine's financial losses, which came to a head this month with
the expiration of Ms. Brown's contract. Despite award-winning
editorial content, considerable _ if sometimes controversial _
publicity and increased circulation, the magazine has continued to
lose money in its 13 years under Newhouse. Although losses have
decreased from $30 million in 1992 to $11 million last year, recent
changes on the magazine's business side suggested that Newhouse had
had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick was by no means an obvious choice to succeed Ms. Brown.
There had been speculation that Newhouse might select someone with
a tested mass-market track record, such as Graydon Carter, the
editor of Vanity Fair, who one Conde Nast executive said was
offered the job but turned it down. Such a choice would have seemed
in keeping with the style of Ms. Brown, 44. She was a glamorous
magnet for the gossip columns who many say created _ for better or
worse _ the era of the magazine editor as celebrity and pointed up
the importance of ``buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, 39, promises to be a significant change of pace. With a
gentle and pensive manner, he is more likely to be found sitting at
a seminar at the Council on Foreign Relations than running the
gauntlet of paparazzi on his way into some black-tie benefit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even Newhouse indicated that he did not run to Remnick
as a first choice.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed the contents of a widely circulated e-mail message
sent by Michael Kinsley, the editor of the online magazine Slate.
In it, Kinsley said Newhouse offered him the job Saturday and
changed his mind on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse made his decision early Monday morning, after reading a
several-thousand word memo by Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   Looking somewhat dazed at the magazine's offices on Monday, in
rolled-up shirtsleeves and between distracted bites of a turkey
sandwich and sips of Diet Coke, Remnick said he had been thrilled
six years ago when a free-lance article of his was published in The
New Yorker under its then editor, Robert Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on this magazine,'' Remnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick said it was too soon to talk specifically about his
plans for The New Yorker, although he did say he wanted to see more
city coverage, more humor and more varied foreign correspondence.
``It would be ridiculous to start making pronouncements about major
changes and all the rest,'' he said. ``Do I have things in mind?
Yes, I do. But I want to think them through.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick said he admired what Ms. Brown had done. ``I think she
has opened up this magazine in tremendous ways, and it needed
doing,'' he said. He also said he did not buy the argument that New
Yorker readers are a dying breed, not when young people are
attending poetry readings, buying books at Amazon.com and wandering
through Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them,'' he said of the next generation. ``I want them
to understand the New Yorker as something that is part of their
worlds and their lives and their passions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at a staff meeting Monday morning, Remnick joked
about the three changes he would immediately make at the magazine:
More service pieces, such as ``America's Ten Best Pizzas''; a
weekly section called ``teens talk to teens''; and more Russia
coverage (before coming to the New Yorker in 1992, Remnick spent
almost four years covering the former Soviet Union for The
Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   In the words of his colleagues Monday, Remnick's tenure was
characterized as likely to be something of a cross between William
Shawn's New Yorker and Tina Brown's. Although Remnick has written
about Howard Stern and Mike Tyson, he has also held forth on the
Russian elections, in much the spirit of the old New Yorker's
lengthy ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good-looking and articulate and scholarly _ it's almost
unbearable,'' said Roger Angell, a longtime writer at the magazine
``No groaning or cursing or stalking the halls and saying, `This
time I can't do it, I'm not a writer.' Plus, he's a good guy. This
is highly suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Hillsdale, N.J., the son of an art teacher and a
dentist, Remnick graduated summa cum laude from Princeton
University, where he worked as one of several student newspaper
stringers in the university's Press Club. He started out as an
intern at The Washington Post in 1982 and eventually moved on from
writing gritty metro police stories to covering sports. His work
got the attention of the paper's Style section and from there
Remnick went to write for the newspaper's Sunday magazine. He was
then chosen to become The Washington Post's second man in Moscow, _
though he claims to have been ``the world's worst Russian-language
student at Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   And that move, Remnick said, changed his life. ``It changed in
this preposterously exciting, romantic, politically charged
landscape,'' said Remnick, who covered Russia during the rise of
Mikhail Gorbachev. ``It meant everything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick became known for his narrative journalism, for telling
the story of the former Soviet Union through its peasants as well
as its politicians. His book, ``Lenin's Tomb,'' won the Pulitzer
Prize for general nonfiction in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't fall into that pattern of writing voodoo Stalin
politics _ Kremlin insider stuff,'' said Ben Bradlee, the former
editor of The Washington Post. ``He got out in the country and
talked to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the amount of media interest in The New Yorker, it was
perhaps no surprise that the search process was riddled with
intrigue, however short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the names floated over the weekend were Peter Kaplan, the
editor of The New York Observer and James Truman, Conde Nast's
editorial director.
</P>
<P>
   As for other candidates he considered, Newhouse said, ``I spoke
to a number of people, in person or by phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said Remnick might be in for a rude awakening. ``Running a
weekly is an incredibly complicated management job,'' said Martin
Walker, a magazine consultant. ``Here's a guy who's been a writer
and an author, and they're two very different jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said Remnick will have his hands full, but she
recommended him to Newhouse with the belief that he was capable, in
part because _ in addition to writing _ he has already been
offering editorial guidance to the magazine for some years. ``I
knew that David can handle it,'' she said. ``David is a workaholic
like I am. He is prepared to give up his life for his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick said he intends to continue having a life. He lives in
Manhattan with his wife, Esther B. Fein, a reporter at The New York
Times, and they have two boys.
</P>
<P>
   He also described complaining about workloads as ``a weird
modern form of self-aggrandizement _ `Gee whiz, I work really hard
at something I love. That's called luck, not labor.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he would feel pressure to follow Ms. Brown as the
public face of The New Yorker out on the party circuit, Remnick
said: ``I think any editor has to do some of that, but I have to do
that in my own way. It would be foolish to try to imitate Tina. It
would be foolish to try to imitate anyone.''

HEALTH WATCH: HEART ATTACKS SURGE IN AFTERNOONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting up can be hard on a body, Monday mornings remind us. But
why should leaving work be just as hard on the heart?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that heart attacks occur more
frequently in the morning, a surge suspected to be a result of the
complicated chemical changes in the blood associated with the end
of sleep and return of activity. So when statisticians and
cardiologists at the University of Washington in Seattle combed
records of 3,690 heart attacks compiled by that city's paramedics
over 23 years, they were not expecting to find what they uncovered,
which was a similar surge of heart attacks in the late afternoon
beginning at 4 p.m. and peaking at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Though medication may be to blame _ heart medication, which is
most often taken in the morning, may be wearing off by late
afternoon _ Dr. Alfred Hallstrom is more interested in stress as an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more likely the result of what we do,'' he said. ``Most
of us are relatively sedentary at work during the day, and then
rush off, whether to drive home and make dinner or whatever.''

NAVAJO COUNCIL RULES TRIBAL PRESIDENT MUST STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ The Ethics and Rules Committee of the
Navajo Nation Council ruled Monday that Tribal President Thomas
Atcitty must resign for violating tribal ethics laws by accepting
corporate gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The panel decision is only advisory, and must be approved by the
full council. It comes five months after former President Albert
Hale stepped down for similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Morris, acting chairman of the ethics panel, said Monday
``the law is the law,'' and that Atcitty, while vice president,
should have known he was violating tribal laws when he permitted
off-reservation businesses on at least 10 occasions to pay for
golfing trips between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Atcitty, 64, on Monday reaffirmed that he will fight an ouster,
but will cooperate with the Tribal Council while the issue is being
decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to emphasize to the people, as well as all
federal, state and local governments and the private sector, that
any interest you may have vested in the Navajo Nation is not
adversely affected,'' Atcitty said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Atcitty took over as tribal president Feb. 19 after Hale
resigned to avoid removal from office for also allowing companies
doing business with the tribe _ or wanting to _ to pay his
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At an ethics panel hearing last week, Atcitty said he wasn't
aware that allowing companies to pay for golfing trips violated
tribal anti-gift laws.
</P>
<P>
   He told the committee that when he thought of taking gifts, he
thought of things like rugs and not of something ``intangible''
like a golfing trip.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendation now goes to the full Tribal
Council, whose summer session begins Monday. But Bob French,
director of the tribe's ethics office, said that, even if the
council refuses to go along, tribal law would require Atcitty to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   Atcitty's only hope, he said, is for 59 of the 88 council
members to agree to waive the law and allow him to stay on as
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Atcitty steps down, tribal law says that speaker of the
council Kelsey Begaye will step in as acting president for up to a
month, so that a special election can be held.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be revised since the tribe's primary is scheduled
for Aug. 4. The council could allow the top vote-getter in the
primary to take office in an interim capacity _ or allow Begaye to
remain in both positions _ until November's general election.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics committee also has recommended that Atcitty not be
allowed to run for a tribal elective position for five years. If
upheld, this would remove him as the front-runner in the coming
election and throw it open to the other eight candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's special prosecutor has said Navajo Nation law holds
that tribal officials cannot accept anything worth more than $100
from anyone doing business or planning to do business with the
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Atcitty has claimed that the law was intended to prevent
companies from persuading tribal officials to use their influence
to provide a favor. He said the presidency largely isn't in a
position to do so since the passage of new laws in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Those laws were passed after the then-leader of the tribe, Peter
MacDonald, was suspended as a result of allegations that he took
bribes. He was convicted later in tribal and federal courts and is
serving a 14-year term in a federal prison. &QL;

BLUSTERY WELCOME FOR OPEN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ The wind was howling at Royal Birkdale Golf
Club Monday, with players wearing ski caps and layered clothing to
try to stay warm during practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold, fitting reminder that the British Open has a
different feel from the other major championships. The year's third
major, which begins on Thursday, is synonymous with unpredictable
weather, and it is played on golf courses that require creativity
and resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in mid-July, many of the world's greatest players were
shivering, dealing with temperatures in the 50s and wind gusts of
around 35 miles per hour. That is part of what makes the British
Open special. And if the weather stays chilly and windy, it will
help those who cope successfully with the elements stay in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best players will come to the top,'' said Tom
Lehman, the 1996 British Open champion. ``If you're not hitting the
ball solid, you have no chance whatsoever, I don't care how you
putt. How do you practice for stuff like this? If you live in
Scottsdale, Ariz., where it's 110 degrees, how do you practice for
this?''
</P>
<P>
   To many players, the British Open is the major that best tests
all-around skill, because with changing conditions, the same course
can require dramatically different shots from one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Birkdale, a par-70, 7,018-yard course on England's
northwest coast, last held a British Open in 1991, when Ian
Baker-Finch defeated Mike Harwood by two strokes. But many great
players have won here, including Arnold Palmer (1961), Peter
Thomson (1954 and '65), Lee Trevino (1971), Johnny Miller (1976)
and Tom Watson (1983).
</P>
<P>
   As usual, a long list of contenders will tee off on Thursday
with a legitimate chance to win. Lee Westwood of England has
surpassed Colin Montgomerie as Europe's best player at the moment,
winning seven tournaments in the last nine months, including last
week's Loch Lomond Invitational in Scotland. Justin Leonard, the
defending champion, cannot be overlooked. Jesper Parnevik has
finished second or tied for second in two of the last four British
Opens. And David Duval and Fred Couples are having outstanding
years and will have as much confidence as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The last three British Opens have been won by U.S. players _
John Daly in 1995, followed by Lehman and Leonard. Most American
players arrive in Europe the week before the British Open to combat
the jet lag, either playing in the Loch Lomond tournament or
practicing elsewhere. Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara and Payne Stewart
played several courses in Ireland last week.
</P>
<P>
   The British Open has been a difficult tournament for Woods, who
has not finished higher than 22d in three attempts. Perhaps the
biggest challenge for Woods, along with everyone else in the field,
will be to keep tee shots in Birkdale's narrow fairways, avoiding
the double-bogey and triple-bogey holes that can ruin a round.
</P>
<P>
   The last 15 majors have been won by 15 different players, making
it difficult for anyone to predict what will happen. And the more
players who prove themselves capable of winning majors, the harder
it will be for anyone to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a major, a little more is expected of you,''
Lehman said. ``Maybe you put a little more pressure on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo, a three-time winner of the British Open, will be
putting a different kind of pressure on himself this week. Forced
to withdraw from the Loch Lomond tournament because of sharp pain
in his right elbow, Faldo still hopes to tee off on Thursday, which
would extend his streak to 45 consecutive majors, the longest
current streak. Jack Nicklaus, who has played in 146 consecutive
majors, will not play in the British Open or in the PGA
Championship next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflammation has gone down seriously,'' Faldo said. ``I am
still undergoing intensive treatment and will be doing so right up
until the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Another player who is ailing this week is Els, who said Monday
that his injured back had not completely healed and that he might
be forced to take time off after the Open.  &QL;

   BALTIMORE _ The heroic bronze figures on the Francis Scott Key
Monument are corroded, and an oar that was once in the statue's
supple-looking stone waters is long gone. But standing in front of
this beleaguered 1911 monument to the National Anthem in a quiet,
green square on Monday afternoon, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit kicked off ``Save America's Treasures,'' Mrs.
Clinton's four-day history tour and preservation pledge drive that
ends on Thursday in Seneca Falls, N.Y., at a celebration of the
150th anniversary of the first American women's rights convention.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the tour reflects the current diversity of the
historic preservation movement, once associated with battlefields,
presidents' birthplaces and blue-haired lady restorers in sneakers.
Although Mrs. Clinton is in fact visiting one site where George
Washington really slept _ his headquarters in Newburgh, N.Y. _ her
stops also include a dilapidated theater, an Indian archaeological
site, Thomas Alva Edison's laboratory and landmarks devoted to
women's rights and African American history.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, a traditional first lady-like endeavor, is designed to
raise public awareness that if history is America's future, the
bridge to the 21st century is in precarious shape.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Monday, the president appeared with his wife at the
National Museum of American History in Washington. They were
dwarfed by the original ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' The 15-stripe,
15-star flag, which looms nearly three stories high, survived the
attack on Fort McHenry in 1813-14 and inspired Francis Scott Key
but is now a fragile, muted textile in dire need of restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady shared the stage with Ralph Lauren,
the designer who launched thousands of Polo sweaters with the
American flag on them. Mrs. Clinton's campaign began with the
announcement that Lauren had agreed to contribute $10 million
toward the flag's conservation, including a state-of-the art
laboratory that will be visible to museumgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been assured that this is a philanthropic gift and not a
marketing gift,'' said I. Michael Heyman, secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The sites on Mrs. Clinton's tour include federal, state and
privately financed landmarks, all with expensive wish lists. One of
the not-so-subtle purposes of the tour is to encourage
public-private partnerships like Lauren's donation, the single
largest corporate contribution in the Smithsonian's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service alone has a $1 billion backlog in historic
structure repair, according to Randall Biallas, the chief
historical architect. The president's budget request of $50 million
for the preservation program has not yet been approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about just generous gifts, but also
encouraging kindergarteners to collect pennies to clean up the
monument in the town square,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later at the National Museum of American History, she
encouraged Americans to be ``good ancestors,'' preserving landmark
building as well as artifacts like ``historic photographs yellowing
in a county clerk's cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   An example is the contents of the Thomas Alva Edison National
Historic Site in West Orange, N.J. It was there, in his Invention
Laboratory, that the master inventor developed, among other things,
the motion picture camera, the nickel-iron-alkaline battery and the
disc photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Now a little-known outpost of the National Park Service, the
site consists not only of historic structures, including the first
building designed for motion-picture filming, but also 400,000
artifacts and 5 million pieces of paper, including original letters
and lab notes, many of which are decomposing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is the latest of several first ladies to adopt
American history and the environment as their cause: Lady Bird
Johnson campaigned for the beautification of the nation's highways,
and Jacqueline Kennedy took on the renovation and preservation of
the White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In her new endeavor, Mrs. Clinton has surrounded herself with
preservation gurus, most notably Richard Moe, president of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is sponsoring the
``Save America's Treasures'' program with the White House
Millennium Council. ``She's really into it,'' Moe said. ``We've
never had a first lady this deeply involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that historic preservation is an
easier cause than, say, health care. ``The politics are less
controversial,'' she said. ``No one is going to stand up against
`The Star-Spangled Banner' and its need for preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   In embracing preservation, Mrs. Clinton is attaching her star to
a populist design movement that has sprung from the ground up from
its inception, often against the wishes of politicians. In 1859,
for example, Anne Pamela Cunningham established the Mount Vernon
Ladies Association as a last resort after failing to persuade
either Congress or the State of Virginia to save the mansion from
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic preservation is the most important singular popular
mass movement to affect architecture and planning in the modern
era,'' said Vincent Scully, the Sterling Professor Emeritus of art
history at Yale University, who recently gave an architectural
lecture at the White House that reportedly had the Clintons
spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   Scully continued: ``Architects hate it. It's the people taking
back the way they want to live and what they want their cities to
be, instead of being at the mercy of architects, planners and
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people Mrs. Clinton will encounter is Stephen Miller
in Pittsfield, Mass., whose art supply and wallpaper store is
housed in the 1903 Colonial Theater, imbuing the neo-Baroque haunt
of Douglas Fairbanks, Ethel and John Barrymore and Sarah Bernhardt
with the scent of linseed oil and vinyl. This week the marquee
reads, MILLER SUPPLY CO. INC. WELCOMES HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's father, George, bought the place in 1952, dreaming that
one day he would restore it as a theater, drawing on both the local
community and the Berkshire-bound culture tourists. The Colonial
Theater has been waiting in the wings, mothballed and hidden, ever
since, its now abandoned rotund balconies resplendent with dusty,
peeling putti.
</P>
<P>
   Like the theater, Pittsfield has had its economic hardships.
Robert Boland, the head of The Friends of the Colonial Theater, a
private group, said about $10 million is needed to restore the
building. The state has committed $2 1/2 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Ralph Lauren in Pittsfield, and the unglamorous
nitty-gritty work of preserving landmarks falls to people like
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to see it renovated. That has always been the
intent,'' Miller said recently, leading a visitor up a hidden
staircase to the theater, its silk and linen damask curtains still
sweeping the balcony but no longer Nile green. ``There's plenty of
sweat maintaining a building like this. My hope is that Hillary
Clinton's presence will serve as a catalyst to get this off the
ground.''

`DENNIS' SEQUEL BYPASSING BIG SCREEN IN GROWING INDUSTRY TREND
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: ``Today'' in story refers to Tuesday, July(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Warner Bros., becoming the latest studio to opt
for the small screen over the big one, is rolling out a
direct-to-video sequel of ``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The project _ ``Dennis the Menace Strikes Again'' _ is Warner's
fourth direct to video release (following ``Pippi Longstocking,''
``Shiloh'' and ``Batman and Mr. Freeze: Subzero'') and underscores
the growing trend among studios to bypass the risky theater
business with video versions of easy to recognize properties for
families.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the live-action video, to be released today, is a
sequel to the studio's 1994 release of ``Dennis the Menace,'' a
solid money maker that grossed $51 million domestically and sold
more than 4 million video copies. Justin Cooper, who starred
opposite Jim Carrey in ``Liar Liar,'' plays the title character in
the sequel with supporting roles by Don Rickles, Betty White and
George Kennedy, among others. It carries a suggested price of
$19.94.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alexander, head of industry tracker Alexander &AMP;
Associates, said Warner's move should work, given the success that
rivals The Walt Disney Co., Universal and 20th Century Fox have
found so far with similar products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct to video has become a real market,'' Alexander said.
``There are a lot of people on the theatrical side of the business
that still don't give it the credibility it deserves, but consumers
will pay for the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney kick-started the direct to video market four years ago
with ``The Return of Jafar,'' an ``Aladdin'' sequel that stunned
the industry by selling more than 10 million copies. Until then,
direct to video had been a catchall for titles not good enough for
theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   Why direct to video? Studios save significantly since production
costs typically amount to less than $10 million and promotions cost
about $5 million, Alexander noted. Last year's average production
cost for a film from a major studio was nearly $40 million, while
promotional costs were almost $20 million each, according to the
Motion Picture Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``With direct to video, you're not battling for screens because
the key outlets like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart are going to put
you on the shelf if you're one of the top names like Disney and
Warner,'' he said. ``With a franchise product, you have an
excellent chance of making back your costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the relatively inexpensive costs of tape production
and distribution, studios can make as much as a $10 profit for each
video sold. Thomas Adams of Adams Media Research estimates that
last year's direct to video titles _ including Disney's ``Beauty
and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas'' and Fox's ``Casper: A New
Beginning'' _ generated $380 million in revenue or nearly double
the 1996 total.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see more direct to video even though no
individual title is blowing the socks off anyone,'' Adams said.
``It makes perfect sense for studios, since these are produced on
an economic model that allows them to make a good profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney is the dominant player in direct to video titles, with
sequels coming later this year for ``Pocahontas'' and ``The Lion
King,'' and four titles per year planned under the Disney Premieres
nameplate. Universal has sold 20 million copies of four ``Land
Before Time'' videos, and Fox sold an estimated 5 million copies of
the ``Casper'' video last year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Warner, it has three more direct to video projects due by
the end of the year: ``Scooby Doo on Zombie Island,'' ``Addams
Family Reunion'' and ``Richie Rich's Christmas Wish.'' &QL;

HOMELESS MAN SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN SHOOTING OF COUNTY
SUPERVISOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A delusional homeless man called himself a ``leader''
in court Monday, saying he ended a ``dictatorship'' when he shot a
county supervisor who voted in favor of a baseball stadium tax.
</P>
<P>
   Before being sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted
murder in the shooting, Naman said he accomplished what he set out
to do: stop shady politicians from thwarting the will of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech directed mostly at his victim, Maricopa County
Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, Naman predicted it will be a long time
before a political board tries to implement a sales tax without
going to the voters first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my way I tried to be a leader here. I still am,'' said
Naman, who has spent the past 20 years of his life living along
riverbanks, collecting aluminum cans and digging through dumpsters
for food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilcox and the other supervisors approved the county-wide
baseball stadium tax instead of taking it to a vote of the people
more than three years ago, it was tantamount to violence, Naman
said in a voice barely audible in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who have sincere faith in democracy. It's
these people who really got hurt,'' said Naman, appearing pale and
thin in oversized jail pants. ``They were the victims of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to apologize to Wilcox until she admits she was wrong
and fights ``to tear down the Bank One Ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the judge and jury for not standing up
against the stadium tax.
</P>
<P>
   During his 50-minute speech, Naman raised his voice at one point
and spewed obscenities at Wilcox. Wilcox stood up and walked out of
the courtroom on the verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Naman, who acted as his own attorney, said he never intended to
kill Wilcox, just maim her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have tracked you down, Mrs. Wilcox - you or another
leader - tracked you down at night and shot you and left before the
cops came and made a clear getaway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Dave Powell asked the judge to give Naman the
stiffest sentence possible, saying Wilcox endured extreme emotional
and physical injury after Naman snuck a .357 into a supervisors
meeting in August 1997 and shot Wilcox in the leg. The weapon was
loaded with deadly hollow point bullets that explode on impact.
Wilcox had to undergo two surgeries, including one to clean out a
potentially fatal infection caused by the bullet fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox also made a brief statement at the sentencing. Naman's
actions were premeditated and that he intended to kill her, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is a dangerous man who targeted others to shoot including
ballpark construction workers, radio personalities and Jerry
Colangelo, Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man should not be allowed to go back into society for a
very, very long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Wilkinson listened intently and politely
throughout the proceedings and did not register any expression when
when Naman criticized the judge for not taking a ``leadership
role'' against the ballpark tax.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his reasons for a lengthy sentence, Wilkinson said
Naman used a deadly weapon and endangered the lives of others
besides Wilcox.
</P>
<P>
   His ``complete lack of remorse'' also contributed to his
decision, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   When Naman used violence to try and change government, it was an
act of anarchy and cannot be tolerated in our society, Wilkinson
said. He added that Naman did exactly what he accused Wilcox of
doing: an act of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible twisting of logic in your mind,''
Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not take into consideration Naman's history of mental
problems because Naman was found not to be mentally ill and to be
legally competent to stand trial and act as his own attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A court appointed psychiatrist testified Monday that Naman is
``somewhat delusional'' but knows the difference between right and
wrong. He said Naman could be a danger to himself and others in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a throw of the dice,'' the psychiatrist said. &QL;

GILKEY'S SLUMP CONFOUNDS THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like any other baseball player in the hours before a
game, Bernard Gilkey performs a daily routine in front of his
clubhouse stall. He puts on his uniform and cap, laces up his
spikes, grabs a glove and makes his way out to the dugout with a
couple of bats tucked beneath his arm.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one piece of equipment, not of standard issue, that
the Mets left fielder chooses to leave behind: his contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to wear them, period,'' Gilkey said. ``I'm not
far enough from the pitcher where I can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the Mets apparently do not see the issue as
clearly. What they have seen is a once-dangerous hitter who is
batting .237, one season after his average was hovering in the low
.200s through mid-August before it finally ended up at .249.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Gilkey's vision is just one of the possible
explanations the organization has considered as it searches for
clues to his decline at the plate over the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey said he still sees occasional flashes in his left eye,
the result of a frightening beaning in Miami on June 12. He has
undergone numerous eye examinations since, at least one coming
after he had been cleared to play on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even before the beaning, Gilkey said, eye doctors suggested
that he try glasses or contacts. He said he is just not comfortable
wearing them and rarely puts the lenses in, on the field or off.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey may not believe that his vision is the primary reason for
his struggles, but he does not offer any other explanation. He is
just as confounded by what has happened to him as everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets signed him to a guaranteed four-year, $20.4
million deal in December 1996, Gilkey was coming off the season of
his life: a .317 batting average, 30 homers and 117 runs batted in
_ all career highs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the season and a half since, there has been nothing but
frustration and unanswered questions. This season he has only three
home runs and 25 runs batted in, and since 1996, he has batted .245
with 21 homers and 103 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently whether this was the real Bernard Gilkey,
the 31-year-old just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``And it is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey's lack of production is a problem for the Mets, who begin
a two-game series against the Atlanta Braves Tuesday night at Shea
Stadium. There are those who believe that had Gilkey approached an
average season last year, the Mets would not have fallen four games
short of the National League wild card. And it seems equally
apparent that the Mets need Gilkey to produce behind Mike Piazza
and Todd Hundley for the team to have a realistic chance at the
wild card this year. Piazza said as much after Sunday's 5-2 victory
over the Montreal Expos gave the Mets two victories in two games
since Hundley, who is Gilkey's best friend, rejoined the club.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, Gilkey's career batting average was .283.
But since April 25, when he went on the disabled list with an elbow
injury, he has hit just .203 (32-for-158). Despite a three-hit game
on Friday night, his batting average has dropped 77 points. Manager
Bobby Valentine said his biggest mistake of the first half of the
season was allowing both Gilkey, who returned on May 12, and
Edgardo Alfonzo to come back too soon from stays on the disabled
list. And now that Hundley is back, Gilkey's playing time figures
to be further reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to go through trials and tribulations,''
Gilkey said. ``It's easy to judge somebody when they're doing
well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is much more difficult to ascertain why Gilkey is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to drive the ball then, and he is not able to
drive the ball now,'' Valentine said. ``It is my opinion that his
swing is kind of upside-down. He leads with his top instead of his
bottom. He is rotating too soon with his upper body. And he
therefore leaves himself hitting the ball out in front too much,
which causes bloops to right and grounders to left. It shouldn't be
that tough mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theory, one that Valentine does not adhere to, is that
Gilkey has not been the same since Tom Robson replaced Tom McCraw
as the team's hitting coach after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, who has hit the ball better the last few days after
working with Robson on using his entire body, doesn't entirely
agree. ``I've had a few hitting instructors in my day,'' he said.
``It's easy to have a good relationship with a guy when you're
having the best year of your career. But it's not like we went out
together, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey dismisses suggestions that he may have grown complacent
because of his big contract, as well as criticism that he is
resistant to suggestions about his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look back and wonder why,'' Gilkey said. ``Not now.
It's not how you start, it's how you finish. And for me, it's not
over yet. Not by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said last week:
``He was one of the most productive left fielders in the game, when
you break down the numbers. And he's not doing it now.''

CLINTON SEEKS POWER TO LIFT INDIA-PAKISTAN SANCTIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday
for more flexibility in its dealings with India and Pakistan,
saying that current sanctions against the two countries for their
nuclear weapons programs are too rigid and limit Washington's
ability to halt a South Asian nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is not calling for an immediate lifting of
the sanctions, but only the power to lift them. This, officials
believe, would enable them to induce India and Pakistan to stop
testing or deploying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the two countries tested nuclear weapons in May, the
administration was forced under a 1994 law to impose harsh
sanctions against them. The law contains no provision that would
allow the president to lift sanctions, either in whole or in part.
Any changes in sanctions require a new law, passed by both House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is not to punish for punishment's sake, but to
influence the behavior of both governments,'' Karl Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, said at a
hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near
Eastern and South Asian affairs. ``We do not wish for unnecessary
harm to fall on the civilian populations of either country,'' he
said, ``or on U.S. businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the Senate voted, 98-0, to exempt wheat and other
agricultural exports from the sanctions because farm state
legislators said the sales ban hurt only American farmers and would
not prevent foreign farmers from profiting instead.
</P>
<P>
   A provision attached to that law would have given President
Clinton the authority, through March 1999, to waive the other
sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan. But it was dropped after
protests from Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who wrote the original 1994
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other sanctions include a cutoff of trade credits, private bank
loans and American support for nonhumanitarian loans from the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the United States voted for a World Bank loan to India
meant for child education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Arms sales and military aid to Pakistan were cut off under
separate legislation in 1990, when it was determined that Pakistan
had nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's no system to give the executive branch any
flexibility,'' said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
``We'd like it to come in the form of congressionally mandated
authority for the executive branch to respond to, or to induce,
changes of behavior on the part of India and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   What is new, Rubin said, is the administration's request for
such authority now in order to induce policy changes in India and
Pakistan, rather than simply gaining it in time to respond to
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Together with other countries, the United States is asking India
and Pakistan to stop testing, sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty without conditions, stop producing any more fissile
material, quit deploying nuclear weapons, and stop testing or
deploying missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent is not to waive sanctions now,'' a White House
official said. ``But we'd like to have the authority to do so later
once India and Pakistan have taken enough steps to warrant a
waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., chairman of the subcommittee and who
just returned from a trip to the region, said the sanctions were
imposing significant economic harm on both countries in the midst
of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic situation there was not very good before we
imposed sanctions, particularly in Pakistan,'' he said, ``and now
it is even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback has sponsored another bill that may come up later this
week. It would waive all the current sanctions for nine months, and
follow that with a graduated waiver based on a presidential
certification that India and Pakistan were making progress in
reducing nuclear tensions.

BOXING'S POPULARITY FUELED BY LATINOS
</HEADLINE>
 with Boxing) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The popularity of boxing doesn't rival that of
America's favorite sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it has its moments.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Oscar De La Hoya drew more than 50,000 fans to
the Sun Bowl for a fight he had no chance of losing last month in
El Paso, Texas, against unknown Patrick Charpentier of France.
</P>
<P>
   The second Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight, in June of 1997,
had a record pay-per-view buy rate of 1.95 million, which, at $50 a
pop, translates to almost $100 million from domestic television
revenue alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson-Buster Mathis fight in 1995, on FOX, was watched in
more than 15 million homes across the nation _ almost 1 million in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And networks report solid ratings on regular shows. For example,
HBO has had double-digit ratings for many of its biggest fights.
</P>
<P>
   Many credit a fiercely loyal core of boxing fans _ largely
Latino _ for the sport's viability but bemoan the fact they don't
seem to be reaching a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only 2 million people watched the Super Bowl, it'd be
financial disaster,'' said Nigel Collins, editor of The Ring
magazine, referring specifically to the Tyson-Holyfield
pay-per-view success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange situation. A tremendous amount of money is
being generated by a relatively small audience willing to pay
exorbitant fees for big events.''
</P>
<P>
   About 68 percent of Latino males watch boxing on television at
least once a week, according to a marketing study cited by HBO
executive Mark Taffet. Taffet, as well as several other observers,
estimate Latinos account for more than 50 percent of pay-per-view
buys.
</P>
<P>
   That growing ethnic group could fuel the sport indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is boxing officials believe
they're failing to reach non-Latinos and young people, which
precludes boxing from challenging bigger sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has been a tremendous erosion of Anglo fans. We
don't have younger men watching boxing the way they did 20 years
ago because we don't see enough compelling fights,'' promoter Bob
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   The television networks certainly aren't giving up on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   USA's decision to drop it's Tuesday night shows, the most
consistent in boxing in recent years, was a blow to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   However, the move wasn't made because of ratings, which were
solid. The move had more to do with the network's across-the-board
decision to target a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   And other networks have stepped in to fill at least part of the
void. Among them, FOX's FX and TNT are making forays into the
sport, an indication it continues to have a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to those who control the sport to take the next
step.
</P>
<P>
   Said Taffet: ``We have to adapt to a changing marketplace on a
regular basis or be left behind. That's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   WISH LIST
</P>
<P>
   Boxing has had a pathetic dearth of compelling bouts because the
sport's biggest stars tend to avoid one another. If these 10 fights
could be made in the next year and half, it would give boxing a
blast of momentum going into the year 2000. &QL; 
1. Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis: The two best heavyweights in the
world would provide the ultimate show. &QL; 
2. Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad: Oscar needs a test. This could
kick off a Leonard-Duran-Hearns-Hagler-like welterweight series. &QL; 
3. Holyfield-Mike Tyson III: OK, Tyson is no longer Tyson. Still,
the interest in this one would be overwhelming. &QL; 
4. Roy Jones Jr.-David Reid: The best pound-for-pound fighter vs.
the Olympic champion. A sure winner. &QL; 
5. Naseem Hamed-Arturo Gatti: Half the fans want to see Hamed's
antics. The other half wants to see him lose. &QL; 
6. Tyson-George Foreman (at 50): No typo here. Think about it: Who
wouldn't want to see this? &QL; 
7. De La Hoya-Ike Quartey: This could be Part II in De La Hoya's
riveting road to immortality. &QL; 
8. Roy Jones Jr.-Holyfield (or another top heavyweight): Yes, this
is a stretch but an intriguing prospect. &QL; 
9. Shane Mosley-Arturo Gatti: The classic boxer-puncher vs. the
classic brawler is a can't-miss lightweight hit. &QL; 
10. Fernando Vargas-David Reid: For a change, how about a matchup
of two future greats while they're on the rise? &QL; 
Others: Lewis-Michael Grant; Hamed-Angel Manfredy; Hamed-Johnny
Tapia; Tapia-Mark Johnson; Tyson-Andrew Golota; Mosley-Floyd
Mayweather; De La Hoya-Vargas; De La Hoya-Reid. &QL;

 &HT;    Way2Cheap bankruptcy shows debt of $1 million
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four months after closing its doors, Way2Cheap
Inc. has gone to bankruptcy court to dispose of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   In its bankruptcy filing, Way2Cheap listed debts of more than $1
million owed to 359 creditors, including banks, parts suppliers and
former employees. Assets were $90,694, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Others with a claim against Way2Cheap can file it with the
bankruptcy court, said Harry Hobbs, a trustee for the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trustee will be appointed and will go out and see what
assets, if any, there are to liquidate for creditors,'' Hobbs said.
``Once that's done, they'll file through all the claims. At this
point, all the claims against Way2Cheap would be resolved in the
bankruptcy court.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs said that with such steep debts and so few assets, it's
unlikely most claimants will get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of Austin's fastest growing small computer companies
with revenues of about $7 million in 1996, the company ran into
problems when sales were too weak to meet rising debts. In March,
the company closed its two Austin stores without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown left dozens of customers without computers. Some
ordered and paid for PCs, which they never got. Others had
computers in the stores for service and had to wait weeks to get
them back. Way2Cheap owner Chris Lott and his wife, Beth, filed for
personal bankruptcy last month, citing debts of more than $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Lotts' attorney, William Peckham, said the
couple had run up mostly credit-card debt _ some personal, some
business-related.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the filings came from sorting out the debts and
liabilities for the personal and business bankruptcies and putting
together the list of creditors, Peckham said.
</P>
<P>
   Way2Cheap had built a reputation with good reviews for its
systems in Windows magazine. In addition to store sales, the
company also sold PCs by mail.

   There are some pretty small niches in the cruise business, I
thought on receiving a flier from Bare Necessities, which sells
travel to clothing-optional fans, a k a nudists or naturists. But
when officials of this company said that their charter cruises had
been selling out their 800 to 1,100 places, I had to think again.  &QL;

referred me to a major U.S. nudist group, the American Association
for Nude Recreation in Kissimmee, Fla., which has 50,000 members
and 230 clubs. The spokeswoman for the group, Georgia Brown, says
that only a small proportion of those who take clothing-optional
cruises are ideological nudists. Most are travelers who relax by
going without clothes, and 30 percent are first-timers. So while
the brochure startled me a bit, the concept seems the same as
creating cruise charters for others with particular focuses:
golfers, for example, or people in 12-step recovery programs. I
took a look and found many new things.
</P>
<P>
   CLOTHING-OPTIONAL CRUISES: Bare Necessities Tour and Travel of
Austin, Texas, was established by Tom and Nancy Tiemann in 1990.
They have done charter cruises since, working with Holland America,
Cunard, Regal and other lines. As would be expected, the company
takes the whole ship. The 1998 Caribbean cruise was aboard the
Regal Empress in February. The big attraction was the eclipse of
the sun, but there were shore excursions to Curacao, Aruba and
Jamaica.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the coming year, the Caribbean cruise will be aboard
Carnival's Tropicale, leaving from Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 27 and
returning March 4. The prices range from $639 to $1,564 for one of
two people, plus taxes of $147.25 each.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Mediterranean cruise is scheduled for July 31-Aug. 6
aboard the Star Clipper, a 360-foot sailing vessel that takes 174
passengers. It leaves from Cannes, France, with calls at Corsica;
Sardinia; the island of Giglio and the village of Portovenere, both
in Italy; and Monte Carlo. The prices, without air fare, for one of
two people in a cabin range from $1,359 to $2,395, plus port taxes
estimated at $210. &QL;

   Christie Musick, owner of Travel au Naturel in Florida, books
smaller cruises aboard sailing vessels in the Caribbean for
male-female couples only. She says her October cruise out of
Grenada is sold out, and she is now well into the 1999 version
aboard the Yankee Clipper, a schooner. ``Some people wear all their
clothes, some wear a T-shirt, some just pants, some nothing,'' she
said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the '99 cruise, the Yankee Clipper will sail the Southern
Grenadines from Oct. 24 to 30; about half of the 64 berths are
gone. The price for one person in a cabin with two bunks is $1,195;
in a cabin with a lower bunk that will accommodate two people, the
price is $1,395 a person. All meals and an open bar, plus tips and
port charges are included, but not air fare to Grenada. Ms. Musick
books the October date because it includes a Halloween party.

   SOBRIETY CRUISES: Steve Abrams and Guy Grand, brothers who own
Sober Vacations International in California, have two cruises
scheduled for people in recovery programs. Alcoholics Anonymous
operates no tours or trips, and does not endorse any, and ``AA'' is
not supposed to be used in any advertising, according to a
spokeswoman for the General Service Office of AA in New York. But
the words ``recovering'' and ``sober'' are enough to inform
potential travelers. Abrams and Grand, in recovery from different
addictions, say that 12-step meetings are scheduled, with speakers
like Clancy I. and Dr. Paul.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brothers have been offering trips for 10 years, and have had
particular success working with Club Med to offer Sober Villages.
Their first Caribbean cruise, aboard Carnival's Fascination from
Jan. 23 to 30, leaves from San Juan, Puerto Rico. The price for one
of two people in a cabin ranges from $799 to $1,099, plus port
taxes of $121.50.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their big coup, Abrams said, is the chartering of the new
American Queen river boat, with a capacity of 400, for a six-day
trip in 2000. It will leave the Twin Cities and cruise to St. Louis
after the close of the AA World Convention in Minneapolis on July
2, 2000. The itinerary is exotic in a different way: Winona,
Prairie du Chien, Dubuque and Hannibal, and the trip is already
half sold. The prices start at $1,590.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sober Vacation finds that New York and California each
contributes 15 percent of the company's business, and that single
people form 51 percent of the clientele. The rest are families and
couples. Sober Vacations International, 31368 Via Colinas, Suite

<P>
   GOLF CRUISES: Considering the lack of turf aboard ship, it may
seem odd, but the golfing cruise is a burgeoning niche. Wide World
of Golf in Carmel, Calif., is offering a big program through
Seabourn Cruise Line, which is now merged with Cunard, both of them
part of Carnival.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Wide World of Golf has a dozen cruises to Southeast
Asia, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Europe, the East Coast and
Mexico. Lessons and lectures are given on board, and the cruises
make landfalls in places with notable links where the participants
get to play. The golfing has a price in addition to the cruise
price. For example, a cruise from Barbados to St. Thomas on the
Seabourn Legend from Feb. 13 to 20 provides chances to play at the
Mullet Bay club on St. Martin and Carambola on St. Croix. With two
rounds of golf plus the classes, the golf price is $850 each if 12
or more participate; the cruise price, for one of two people in a
cabin, ranges from $3,790 to $7,290, plus port fees of $185. Wide
World of Golf, Post Office Box 5217, Carmel, Calif. 93921; (408)
624-6667. Seabourn Cruise Line, 55 Francisco St., San Francisco,
Calif. 94133; (800) 929-9595. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The golf promoters are also looking to the millennium. Scotia
Travel, a Glasgow company, says it has chartered the QE2 for a
cruise from Southampton, England, to St. Andrews, Scotland, in time
for the British Open from July 20 to 23, 2000. The golfers will be
able to go ashore in the regular tenders, ``setting foot virtually
on the first tee.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scotia Travel said 200 of the 1,700 berths had been sold. The
price for the seven days _ the trans-Atlantic trip is not included
but will be available, the organizers say _ ranges from $2,999 for
one of two people in a cabin to $12,999. Tips and port and handling
fees are included, but not drinks. The fee to attend the match at
St. Andrews Old Course is definitely included. After the golf
tournament, the travelers will themselves be able to play St.
Andrews.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Chrysler reported second-quarter earnings of $1.51 a share,
surpassing Wall Street's projections by about 10 cents a share. The
automaker's profits were more than double the strike-ridden second
quarter of last year, attributing the sound performance to strong
sales, cost- cutting and the growing popularity of high-margin
products like the Dodge Durango sports utility vehicle.

IN INDIANA, A LESS LIBERAL BAYH SEEKS THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When Birch Evans Bayh Jr., the notable Democratic
U.S. senator of the 1960s and '70s, first learned that his son
wanted to run for public office, the elder Bayh was wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my first thought was, was that something he really
wanted to do or is that something he wanted to do just because his
father wanted to do it?'' Bayh recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   And during the son's first campaign _ for Indiana secretary of
state in 1986 _ the father said he wanted his son to make his own
way. ``If he said, `Dad, can you call so-and-so?' I would say,
`Yes, I can call so-and-so, but are you sure that's what you want
to have happen?'''
</P>
<P>
   The son, Birch Evans Bayh III, who prefers to be called Evan
Bayh, won that race and went on to be governor of Indiana. And now,
Bayh, 42, is running for the Senate seat that his father lost in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   He is favored to win back his father's seat for the Democrats.
But Evan Bayh is not a carbon copy.
</P>
<P>
   While his father, now 70, spent 18 years in office as a
prominent Great Society liberal, Evan Bayh is a fiscal conservative
who takes credit for balancing his state's budget, implementing
welfare reform and cutting taxes. While his father wrote
constitutional amendments, including the one lowering the voting
age to 18, and helped block two of President Nixon's Supreme Court
nominees, Evan Bayh has practiced what he describes as a politics
of ``pragmatic,'' incremental change, an approach that supporters
praise as savvy and critics consider overly cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes making progress a step at a time is better than no
progress at all,'' Bayh said in an interview at the Democratic
Party's campaign headquarters across from the state Capitol. ``If
by demanding revolutionary change, I run the risk of accomplishing
nothing on behalf of the public, then I'm not sure that's a
responsible course of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayh is enormously popular in Indiana, with his famous name, his
earnest manner, his good looks and his risk-averse governing style
in a state dominated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been mentioned as a prospect for higher office. Held
up as the embodiment of President Clinton's ``New Democrat''
policies, Bayh gave the keynote speech at the 1996 Democratic
National Convention. While he was edged out of prime-time airplay
by other speakers, and pundits said his performance lacked
excitement, Bayh came across as a good sport, appearing on stage
with his wife, Susan, a lawyer, and their twins, Nicholas and Beau,
then 9 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of boy the people in Indiana would like their
daughters to bring home,'' said Brian Vargus, a political science
professor at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.
``Mr. Clean, crisp, Boy Wonder, young, attractive, articulate,
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayh gets chided by more liberal Democrats, who, Vargus said,
privately ``refer to him as a Republicrat.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republican leaders consider the race for this seat,
vacated by Sen. Dan Coats, to be their toughest senatorial election
this year, they are running a well-credentialed candidate, Paul
Helmke, 49, the three-term mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana's
second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evan still comes across a little the empty suit,'' said
Helmke, a moderate Republican who won a three-way primary and has
achieved some national prominence of his own, as a former president
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. ``He looks good. He sounds good.
But there's a sense that he's trying to be all things to all
people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 26, 1955, in Terre Haute, Ind., Evan Bayh was
swaddled in politics. His mother, Marvella Bayh, was the daughter
of an Indiana governor, Matthew Welsh. His father ran twice for the
Democratic nomination for president, dropping out in 1972 because
his wife was stricken with cancer, which took her life in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   When Evan Bayh was 6, he accompanied his parents to the home of
former President Truman, where his father was seeking advice about
his first Senate race. He remembers that Truman gave him a silver
dollar and that sometime in the political discussion he blurted
out, ``I have to go to the bathroom.'' Truman rescued him from his
mother's mortified looks by saying, ``You know, son, I have to go
the bathroom, too,'' and taking him there.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House dinner with his mother and father, Evan saw
President Johnson put his feet up on the table and was escorted by
Lady Bird Johnson into the Lincoln Bedroom to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evan grew up in a very public home,'' said his father, now
practicing law in Washington. Bayh said Evan was aware that his
father was controversial because of the judicial appointments and
other liberal stances, and once heard a phone caller threaten to
kill the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bayh helped run his father's unsuccessful last Senate
campaign, against Dan Quayle in 1980, and the loss ``probably hurt
him more than it hurt me,'' the elder Bayh said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, at age 32, the son was elected the nation's
youngest governor and served the maximum two terms. Bayh, who
contended with Republican-dominated Legislatures during his tenure
but benefited from a robust economy, said his accomplishments
included creation of 350,000 jobs and doubling the state surplus,
to $1.6 billion, the largest in state history. He trimmed a deficit
in state pension plans and sliced Medicaid spending to restore the
state's fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   There were no tax increases. He did try to raise taxes on
hospitals and cigarettes, but was blocked by Republican
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say Bayh, who has been practicing corporate
law since 1996, made few major advances on issues like education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of his governorship time was devoted to dollars-and-cents
kinds of issues,'' said Jay McCann, associate professor of
political science at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Although a polished spinner of phrases, Bayh said he resisted
``generalizations'' and ``buzzwords,'' believing that most issues
were complex. He gets ideas from reading history and biographies
that he orders from a history book club. He just started Theodore
White's ``Thunder Out of China,'' because he is ``trying to learn
more about foreign policy and defense policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayh said that as senator he would work to raise educational
standards and support ``a flatter, fairer tax.'' While government
should help the disadvantaged, he said, ``personal responsibility
has to go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to find the sensible center,'' he said.

 &HT;    Commissioner may have explaining to do to constituents over
relationship with Swiss bank
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Twice in the past three years, Insurance
Commissioner Bill Nelson approved multimillion-dollar contracts
with Swiss banks accused of stealing Holocaust victims' assets,
state records show.
</P>
<P>
   And when The Palm Beach Post pointed out the contracts Monday,
Nelson said through an aide that he is considering breaking the
pacts.
</P>
<P>
   The politically-sensitive contracts come to light as Nelson
tries to assure South Florida's Jewish voters in an election year
that he is ``at the forefront'' of efforts to gain financial
justice for victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has pushed for new laws making it easier to file claims
and threatened to kick out European insurers that do not pay off
policies belonging to those who died in Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are for loans to help pay insurance claims that
might arise after a major hurricane. Nelson signed orders approving
deals between the banks and the Joint Underwriting Association, the
state-created insurer of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   The lead bank and syndicating agent is Union Bank of
Switzerland, with Credit Suisse joining a group of other
international banks. Estimated fees for the Swiss banks: $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   The same banks are banned from state business in California and
facing possible sanctions in New York by Sept. 1 if they do not
improve on a $600 million settlement offer that negotiators for
Jewish groups rejected. The assets from Holocaust victims are worth
more like $1.5 billion in today's dollars, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Nelson renewed contracts with the Swiss banks in
February 1997 even after a $20 billion lawsuit was filed against
them in October 1996 by attorneys representing Holocaust victims.
The suit was front-page news in The Washington Post and Baltimore
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time this was done to save Florida homeowners and make
sure their claims were paid,'' explained Karen Asher-Cohen, an
attorney in charge of Holocaust issues for Nelson. ``The filing of
a lawsuit is not the same thing as a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust issue with respect to the Swiss banks was ``not on
his radar'' at the time, another Nelson aide said, though
Asher-Cohen said it was more a matter of home insurance matters
being more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Asher-Cohen said Nelson is considering sanctions of his own by
Sept. 1 _ he will ask the JUA to drop the Swiss banks from their
agreement if there is no progress in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   That would break the second of two two-year contracts ending in
1999. A spokesman for the Swiss banks, Jeffrey Taufield in New
York, said of Florida's possible sanctions, ``We just think it's
the wrong thing to do in view of all the progress the Swiss banks
have made on rectifying a 50-year-old problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Florida was doing business with the Swiss banks
was a surprise to many, including Melvyn Weiss, a New York attorney
and part-time resident of Boca Raton who is one of the negotiators
with the Swiss banks on behalf of Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' Weiss said. ``Especially in a state like
Florida that has such an aged and very big Jewish population.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised and disappointed,'' said Ted Lapkin,
director of community relations for the Jewish Federation of Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Lapkin was quick not to assign any blame, but ``I certainly
would urge Commissioner Nelson to take all the facts into account
when this contract comes up for renewal. He should let the Swiss
know in no uncertain terms that Florida will not do business with
Swiss financial institutions until the issue of bank accounts is
satisfactorily resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men credited Nelson with his efforts to help settle
Holocaust insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Peppard, counsel for the Anti-Defamation League in Miami,
declined to criticize Nelson's handling of the bank contracts: ``We
believe he has acted in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 survivors of the
Holocaust in the state, mostly in South Florida. Thousands more
family members of Holocaust victims may be eligible for
compensation for bank accounts never claimed or insurance policies
never redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's political opponent in the fall election, Republican Tim
Ireland, blasted his Democratic foe on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Nelson put millions of dollars in profits into the same
banks that have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from those
died in the Holocaust,'' said Ireland spokesman Joe Saviak. ``This
is morally indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland has not made Holocaust issues a prominent theme in his
campaign, aside from an April release calling for more
international cooperation to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the bank contracts may be awkward, but Nelson's
staff say they believe Jewish voters will look at his overall
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``At all times, Bill's been a national leader on Holocaust
issues,'' said Asher-Cohen.

 &HT;    Texas mother jailed after holding knife to daughters' throats
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A woman fighting eviction from her home was
arrested Monday after she kept police at bay for more than five
hours by holding a knife to the throats of her two 13-year-old
daughters, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff, which began about 9 a.m. Monday in central East
Austin, ended about 2:15 p.m. Monday when Nailah Sankofa's
daughters left the home under a police escort and Sankofa
surrendered shortly afterward. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The incident started when Travis County Constable Jesse
Villalovos went to the home to serve an eviction notice, and
Sankofa picked up a kitchen knife. ``She held it at their (the
daughters' )throats and moved the knife back and forth in her hands
between them,'' Villalovos said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Police Department SWAT team officers surrounded the home,
sending in a hostage negotiator to talk to the woman, who had
barricaded herself in a bathroom with the two girls.
</P>
<P>
   Among those neighbors who observed the situation was Pam Wade,
vice president of the Robertson Hill Neighborhood Association.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said Sankofa, 37, was public relations coordinator for the
neighborhood group. ``She does a wonderful job,'' Wade said. ``She
is a talented writer and is trying to go back to school to get her
Ph.D. She is just down on her luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade said police should have allowed Sankofa to talk with
friends. ``I don't think Anglo police understand the situation of a
black, single mom who is down on her luck,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Police Chief Michael McDonald said the police
negotiators did a good job. ``The lines of communication between
the lady and the negotiator were always open,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Sankofa was taken to the Austin State Hospital for a
psychological evaluation and then booked into the Travis County
Jail, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were examined by Emergency Medical Services paramedics
and then placed in a foster home, according to Marla Sheely of the
Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   Sheely said her agency will investigate the possibility of
placing the teen-agers with family or friends. She said the girls
will be given counseling.

 &HT;    Judge meets with tobacco lawyers
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas _ U.S. District Judge David Folsom divided
lawyers representing opposing sides into two negotiating groups
Monday in a push get the $15.3 billion Texas tobacco settlement
finished, once and maybe for all.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be called state line diplomacy, Folsom scattered
the lawyers among three floors of the U.S. Courthouse astride the
Texas-Arkansas line. The lawyers and the judge shuttled between the
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the parties are here to try to work out all their
differences,'' Folsom said before the closed-door meetings began.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom had summoned the lawyers to Texarkana for a status report
on negotiations that have been ongoing since shortly after the
state and the tobacco industry settled the case in January. The
judge said he was not seeking to mediate the dispute himself but
clearly he was pressing the parties to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales, who participated in the talks,
said ``the court is serious about wanting to encourage resolution
of this this week. And I think we're on track to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two principal issues are stalling the tobacco settlement, the
largest recovery from a lawsuit in U.S. history. One issue involves
a challenge Gov. George W. Bush and seven Texas legislators to the
amount Folsom awarded for legal fees to private lawyers Morales
hired to sue cigarette manufacturers. Folsom awarded 15 percent of
the recovery _ as much as $2.3 billion _ to the lawyers. That
reflected their 15 percent contingency fee contract with Morales,
an arrangement the judge analyzed for its reasonableness.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue challenges how the $15.3 billion recovery will
be divided. Seven large counties and public hospital districts sued
to share the money and more than 100 smaller counties want part of
it too.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said the county hospital issue was complex, but declared
``substantial progress made on all issues'' late Monday. The
governor's general counsel, Margaret Wilson, involved in resolving
the legal fees dispute, seemed more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not make as much progress today as we had hoped,''
Wilson said, ``but we are still going to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, addressing the tobacco talks with reporters in Austin,
said his representatives had ``fleshed out'' an agreement he
accepted. ``As you know, I'm only involved with the lawsuit
regarding the legal fees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Travis County state District Judge Jim Myer mediated the
major block to the settlement, the county hospital issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the meetings said privately that Folsom
clearly was pushing for resolution of the remaining disputes, but
none was willing to predict he would get one this week. Morales
left Texarkana late Monday to go to New York for renewed
negotiations for yet another settlement with the tobacco companies
that could enhance Texas' recovery by $2 billion or so. Morales
said he would return to Texarkana on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an agreement is reached in principle with the counties
and hospital districts, Morales said, a final agreement would take
at least several days to get approval from the commissioners courts
and district boards involved.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Ten years after a white former assistant
district attorney filed a lawsuit to clear his name, a jury
declared Monday that he was defamed when three advisers to a black
teen-ager named Tawana Brawley accused him of kidnapping and rape,
creating a racial storm that roiled the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Steven Pagones, called the verdict a bittersweet
victory, for all the pain it had revived. But for the advisers, who
vowed to appeal, it was clear the verdict was just another chapter
in a case with its own life that has come to symbolize the
complexities of race relations in New York and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a battle that obviously is not over,'' said Michael
Hardy, the lawyer for the Rev. Al Sharpton, the best known of Miss
Brawley's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   After a nearly eight-month trial, the verdict was an endorsement
of a 1988 grand jury report that discredited Miss Brawley's account
and suggested that her advisers had participated in a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was also a rebuke to the advisers, Sharpton, C.
Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr., whose critics have long said
represented a brand of ardent cynicism that twisted civil rights
advocacy into a vehicle for self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the verdict against them, Hardy and Maddox left
the court with their hands clenched together in the air, as if in
victory. Maddox said the verdict proved his allegations had been
true. Sharpton, who was not in court Monday, said later in New York
City, ``I didn't believe it to be a hoax then, and I don't believe
it to be a hoax now.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate part of the trial to set damages with the same
six-person jury is to begin Tuesday. Pagones, 37, is seeking $395
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are still to deliberate on the case, the jurors did
not speak about the verdict Monday. But there appeared to be some
division on the panel, with one unidentified juror refusing to sign
the verdict sheet. The jury includes two blacks and four whites.
Because Pagones' suit is civil, only five of the six votes were
required to find liability on each of the statements the advisers
made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones has always described his decade-long fight against the
advisers as a battle to establish accountability. As he claimed
victory Monday, he repeated that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mason, Maddox and Sharpton did hurt a lot of people. They
hurt race relations,'' he said, encircled by reporters from most of
the New York City news organizations outside the courthouse in this
Hudson Valley city, a two-hour drive north from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones' wife, Niki, who married him surrounded by armed guards
because of the threats he was receiving in the midst of the Brawley
confrontation, leaned against him. ``It's been a long 10 years,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones may have trouble collecting any money from the advisers.
Maddox, 52, is a suspended lawyer. Mason, 51, is a disbarred lawyer
who is now a theological student. Sharpton, 43, says he owns no
home or other substantial property and is paid an annual salary of
about $60,000 by his organization, the National Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley, who was 15 at the time, was found apparently
dazed, with excrement and racial epithets etched on her body after
she disappeared for four days in November 1987. The grand jury
report suggested that she had concocted the story to avoid
punishment from her stepfather for being out without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury also suggested that the advisers had permitted
the case to spiral into a national cause despite indications that
Miss Brawley's account was not what it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been filed in 1988 against Miss Brawley and her
three advisers. Miss Brawley never responded, and in 1991 a judge
ruled that Pagones had won his case against her by default. A judge
will decide damages after the rest of the trial is completed.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With seven findings of defamation against Sharpton, including
two that he had made statements about Pagones that he knew were
false, the verdict presented a new challenge in Sharpton's widely
chronicled effort to give himself a broader base as he attempts to
forge a mainstream political career.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, however, Sharpton ridiculed the
suggestion that his political ambitions could be affected ``one
iota'' by the verdict, saying his base of supporters would always
stand by his actions on behalf of Miss Brawley a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors found that Maddox defamed Pagones twice and that
Mason defamed him once. But the jurors did not find defamation in
12 of the 22 statements upon which Pagones based his suit. The
jurors also rejected a contention by Pagones that the three
advisers, who are black, engaged in a conspiracy against him.
</P>
<P>
   After years of saying they would prove their allegations against
Pagones in court, the advisers never presented anything resembling
hard evidence that he was guilty of assaulting Miss Brawley or, as
they asserted 10 years ago, that he had killed a friend who they
said was also involved in an attack on Miss Brawley. The 1988 grand
jury concluded that the friend, Harry Crist, had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   One statement the jurors found Sharpton made with reckless
disregard for the truth was made on a television talk show on March
31, 1988: ``We stated openly, that Steven Pagones, the Assistant
District Attorney, did it. His lawyers say he may or may not sue
us. If we're lying, sue us, so we can go into court with you and
prove you did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones sued after the grand jury concluded that there was no
evidence he had committed any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox said that by finding no defamation in 12 of the
statements upon which Pagones sued, the jurors had agreed with the
advisers that something had happened to Miss Brawley. ``The main
thing here, was that this was not a hoax,'' Maddox said.
</P>
<P>
   In their verdict Monday, jurors seemed to focus on when some
statements were made. They found, for example, that nothing Mason
said during the most intense months of the Brawley confrontation
was defamatory. But they found that remarks by Mason in a talk at
Harvard Law School in March 1989, five months after the release of
the grand jury report, were defamatory and that Mason knew they
were false.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you're looking for someone who knows penguins, you
could do worse than have a chat with Celia Ackerman, a zoo keeper
at the Central Park Zoo. She knows the names of the 38 birds in the
penguin building and can tell you where their immigrant ancestors
came from. (They were collected, as eggs in the Antarctic, by the
people at Sea World, and shipped, after hatching, to New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Why do people seem to like penguins so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cutesy-cutesy,'' says Ms. Ackerman, who has the
wholesome, patient, competent-in-the-wild style every mother would
want for her child's camp counselor, but with this question sounds
a little exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Ohhh, they look like they're wearing little
tuxedos.' As an animal person, I don't care for it. I would rather
see respect for the animal. They look the way they do for a
particular reason. When they swim in the ocean, for the predators,
looking up, white is hard to see. Looking down from above, the
black is camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hot outside. Want to meet somebody who works where the
temperature is 34 degrees? That was the invitation from the public
relations people at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs
the Central Park Zoo, and what kind of fool would decline? The
flower gardens are thick and scented; the sea lions, whom Ms.
Ackerman also cares for, perform obligingly. In the penguin house,
behind a glass wall, the adult penguins and a few newly hatched
chicks trundle and dive (actually, plop).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman, 35, is a zoo keeper in the Polar Zone. She arrives
at 7:30 in the morning and often works an 11-hour day, washing the
habitats, thawing the fish (some of which are vitamin-packed),
caring for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of a reporter, regarding her personal life, make
Ms. Ackerman wary. Ms. Ackerman seems to have a strong bond with
the animals: Is she a religious person? Ms. Ackerman knits her brow
suspiciously. Is there anyone in her personal life? Ms. Ackerman
would rather not say.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Ms. Ackerman is not squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   How does a vitamin-packed fish get that way?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman picks up a deceased herring, gets a vitamin B
tablet and shoves it into the fish's gill. Minutes later,
accompanied by another keeper, James Ayala, Ms. Ackerman puts on
her down jacket, opens a thick refrigerator door and goes into the
manmade Arctic. When she enters, a young penguin rubs its head
against her leg. The rest wait their turn to eat. Some are eager.
With others, Ms. Ackerman has to open their bills and ease the fish
down their gullets.
</P>
<P>
   It brings to mind the food chain. The vitamins are shoved into
the fish, the fish are stuffed into the penguins and the reluctant
Ms. Ackerman has been offered up to the reporter. It takes the
penguins 40 minutes to dine, after which Ms. Ackerman turns to the
next feeding.
</P>
<P>
   She was brought up in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn, Ms.
Ackerman says; her father owned a diner, her mother was a
housewife. As a child, Ms. Ackerman watched Jacques Cousteau and
``Flipper'' and wildlife shows. A scene she found particularly
upsetting showed a pack of wolves trying to get away from people
who were shooting at them from a helicopter. The snow was deep, the
wolves floundered. Ms. Ackerman decided then, ``there were not
enough people in the world taking care of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   While in high school, she worked as a volunteer at the aquarium
and left Brooklyn College after one year, when a full-time job at
the aquarium came through.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman has worked in Central Park, where she earns
approximately $30,000, for 10 years. She says she still finds every
day exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Is Ms. Ackerman a spiritual person?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own way I am,'' Ms. Ackerman says. ``The Native
Americans, when they hunted a deer, gave thanks to the spirit of
the deer for sacrificing itself. They called the animals `brother'
and `sister.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman pauses, concerned about coming off as a New Age
flake, revering animals and their skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't thank my shoes,'' Ms. Ackerman says. ``I don't go that
far. I don't give thanks at every meal, but I do give thanks
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem on a day like today, when the weather is fine and
the Zoo is Eden, that Ms. Ackerman has the best job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Ms. Ackerman. ``On days like this, everybody wants a
zoo job. But there's also winter. We had one winter when for two
weeks it didn't get out of the teens.''
</P>
<P>
   That cold? So did Ms. Ackerman ever have a yen to take a few of
the penguins out for a stroll?
</P>
<P>
   A look from Ms. Ackerman suggests you might as well ask them to
read Sartre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to do that?'' Ms. Ackerman asks. ``There's
nothing out there that would interest them. Our penguins have
everything they need. They're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, after the visit by the note-taking mammal, Ms.
Ackerman calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep asking me what I get from the animals,'' Ms. Ackerman
says. ``When I go inside the penguin cage and clean, sometimes they
exhibit bowing behavior. They bow down to the ground and spread
their wings. It's like a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bird's been away from the nest, some times they do it.
`Hello, I'm here.' Sometimes you see birds bowing down together. It
makes me feel honored, you know, when they do that.''

kidnapping and rape. ``You'd think I'd be elated, but I'm
saddened,'' Mrs. Pagones says. ``As time goes on, hopefully I'll be
able to almost put this aside, into a part of my life where I don't

FOR THE HOMELESS IN L.A., A NEW SET OF WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the homeless on the streets of Skid Row here,
just a couple of blocks from the glass towers of downtown, a
shopping cart is much more than a basket on squeaky wheels. It is
also a rolling closet, a hope chest and an office, and sometimes a
ticket to jail since the carts are typically the property of
grocery stores and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have spent 30 days in jail for pushing a
shopping cart down the street,'' said Jeff Dietrich of the Los
Angeles Catholic Worker, a group that feeds the poor of the Row.
``It's a scandal that people are forced to push their few
possessions in shopping carts. It is far more scandalous for people
to be arrested for being poor.''
</P>
<P>
   So Monday, in front of the Central City East police station
downtown, the Catholic Worker, with two lawyers on hand, began
distributing 100 brand-new black shopping carts to the homeless.
The group had bought the carts _ $100 apiece, Dietrich said _ and
affixed a sign to each saying that it belonged to the Catholic
Worker and that the homeless were authorized to use it ``within the
County of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich said the distribution was helping not only the homeless
but also the authorities, by ``alleviating the police from having
to worry so much about shopping carts and harassing the poor.'' He
said that right in front of the Catholic Worker soup kitchen, he
had watched police officers give people tickets for having shopping
carts, make them dump their belongings out of the carts and then
give them tickets for littering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that as issues go, this isn't the most important,'' he
said. ``But harassing people over shopping carts is just part of
the continuum of mistreating the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   As several homeless people claimed their carts Monday, a group
of police officers, including Capt. Richard Bonneau, watched from
the steps of the police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic Worker people are well intentioned, but misguided
on this issue,'' Bonneau said. Many of the people who wander the
streets day and night pushing shopping carts, he said, use them for
criminal activity, ``as ladders to break into buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonneau said his officers confiscated 20 to 50 carts a week from
homeless people downtown. ``But I suspect we'll be powerless to do
anything about these,'' he said, pointing to the long line of new
carts parked in front of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Mathis, 36, who took one of the carts, said she was
``tired of getting tickets from the police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect idea,'' Ms. Mathis said. ``You can have 100
pounds of stuff in your cart, and the police say, `Get it out.' You
say, `I can't carry all this.' But they don't care. Now they have
to care.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Hosey, 59, was handed a new cart Monday, he said:
``Wow! This is a Cadillac.'' He gave a shove to his old shopping
cart _ one of those that had earned him tickets _ and added, ``Now
I got to get rid of this Chevy before it gets me in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosey said he used a cart to make a meager living on the street,
collecting bottles and cans and anything else that could fetch him
a few nickels and dimes. On one occasion, he said, he had a cart
full of glass that he was pushing toward a recycling center when he
was stopped by police and ordered to dump his cargo onto the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying the police were wrong,'' Hosey said. ``It's the
law and all. But a guy has to do something. You can't carry a
hundred pounds of glass on your back. I just thank God I got my own
cart now.''

EDITORIAL: THE BRAWLEY VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   Monday's verdict in the case against Tawana Brawley's former
advisers was a healthy one. Freedom of speech would not have been
well served if Americans got the impression that it protects the
systematic defamation the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and
Alton Maddox directed at Steven Pagones. Sharpton's decade-old dare
that if Pagones was unhappy he could ``sue us so we can go into
court with you'' has boomeranged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Miss Brawley's former advisers, the jury appeared to have
been trying to make its judgments carefully. Although the three men
appeared bent on muddying every issue by withholding Miss Brawley
from investigators, and failing to even question her themselves
about what had happened, the jury decided they had not been engaged
in a conspiracy to defame Pagones. Rather it found that Sharpton,
Mason and Maddox had willfully ignored the reality that was right
in front of them, in a manner so blatant as to fit the high
threshold of defamation law. They also found that Sharpton made two
statements about Pagones he knew were false.
</P>
<P>
   The figure upon whom the verdict will fall hardest is Sharpton,
who has evolved into a well-known figure in New York politics at
the same time his former associates were fading from view.
Ironically, his talents as a public speaker got him into the
deepest trouble. Having spoken much more on television and in press
interviews than have his co-defendants, he had more to answer for,
and the jury found him guilty on seven different counts.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has become a different sort of public figure over the
last decade, far more moderate and inclusive than in his Brawley
days. He has argued that New York voters should put that episode
behind them, and acknowledge the good things he has done since,
including publicly forgiving a white man who stabbed him after a
civil rights march.
</P>
<P>
   The Tawana Brawley episode took place at a time when some
activists, Sharpton included, seemed to believe that past
injustices gave them a right to mold the truth in any way that
served their political ends. But this verdict supports the view
that a decent respect for facts is essential to healing racial
dialogue.

UNROLLING THE NFL'S PRESEASON AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual advertising offensive to stimulate interest in
National Football League games will begin almost two months earlier
than usual and involve almost four times as many promotional
commercials as before.
</P>
<P>
   The fast start and increased exposure for the NFL's sales pitch
are a result of the league's most lucrative contracts ever with the
broadcast and cable television networks, covering the 1998-99
season. ABC, CBS, ESPN and Fox will run more than 2,200 NFL spots,
which are scheduled to begin appearing Wednesday, in all parts of
their schedules, including early morning, daytime and prime time.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, about 600 league promotional spots ran for the
1997-98 season and did not begin until Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our network partners are giving us a significant amount of
additional time'' to help ``manage an ongoing dialogue with our fan
base,'' said Howard Handler, senior vice president for marketing
and fan development at NFL Properties in New York. NFL Properties
is the in-house unit of the league responsible for the campaign
along with NFL Films in Mount Laurel, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL barrage will run in addition to the myriad commercials
that each network will run for its own game coverage. CBS, for
example, has a campaign carrying the theme ``The NFL on CBS ... The
way it should be!''
</P>
<P>
   The ratcheting up of the football spiel is indicative of the
intensifying effort to sell sports programming to viewers even
when, in the case of football, surveys show that fans continue to
anticipate coming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the competition for people's time,'' Handler said,
``it's important for us to reach out to as broad an audience as
possible to draw them into our games.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 campaign, like its two predecessors, is aimed at
reinforcing ties with so-called core fans, most of whom are men, as
well as generating attention from what are known as casual fans,
many of whom are women, children, teen-agers and twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build the connection with the players, the clubs,
the game,'' Handler said, ``so fans spend more time watching games,
visiting stadiums, playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications have reported that the NFL is most concerned
about addressing fans ages 18-34 to stem an erosion in support
among them. But Handler said that in communicating with casual
fans, the various components ``share equal importance,'' adding,
``If I had to choose, it would be the kids, because that's where
the seeds of commitment are being sown.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains the quite youthful tone and tenor of the 1998-99
campaign, which will again carry the theme ``Feel the power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we want to send through everything is that the NFL
provides a thrill ride,'' Handler said, ``an adrenaline-charged
roller coaster ride.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One completed television commercial and several that he
presented in preliminary form are infused with hip, contemporary
argot and attitude, much of it with roots in black culture.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Bruce W. Burke, vice president and creative
director at NFL Properties, one component of the campaign,
conveying ``the emotions of the game,'' is called ``Rhythm,'' and
another, about star players, is called ``Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, announcers use phrases like ``you getting
phatter'' and ``gives his props.'' Two spots focused on preseason
practice are set to a funk version of ``Summertime'' and a rap
tune.
</P>
<P>
   Those who welcome a touch of tradition with their football will
find it, too. Many of the spots feature the measured intonation and
rolling cadence of John Facenda, the longtime narrator of NFL game
footage who was described by Tripp Dixon, a director at NFL Films,
as ``the voice of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the NFL Films archives were being canvassed for work
by the narrator, who died in 1984, that could be matched to
contemporary footage for the commercials. The preseason rap spot,
for example, includes Facenda-speak about ``the legions of the
sun'' and ``Super Bowl dreams that glow in the sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the television commercials, there will be print
advertisements for the Pro Line of apparel licensed by NFL
Properties, which will run in sports magazines like Sports
Illustrated, Sport and ESPN Magazine as well as in music magazines
like Spin, The Source and Vibe.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's major marketing partners are also drawing up ambitious
plans for the 1998-99 season. Visa USA, for one, will embark on an
advertising and promotional program that includes sponsorship of
the halftime report on the football games covered by the Fox
Broadcasting Company, part of News Corp.; a ``Kickoff '98'' retail
promotion at 131 shopping malls around the country, and two
30-second commercials during Super Bowl XXXIII on Fox on Jan. 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Two other spots, set to appear in late August, will be centered
on two teammates on the San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Steve
Young and wide receiver Jerry Rice. The Visa ad agency is BBDO New
York, a unit of Omnicom Group.

HISPANIC WORKERS ACCUSE L.I. COMPANY OF DISCRIMINATION

 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Charging that they were the target of a litany
of ethnic slurs and numerous instances of employment discrimination
based on race, 21 Hispanic workers have filed a civil rights suit
against a Long Island paper products company formed by immigrants
from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn and
served Monday on officials of the American Tissue Company in
Hauppauge, the 21 workers, immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala
and Ecuador, said that as Hispanics they had been subjected over
the last several years to a hostile work environment and that
non-Hispanic employees had been given preferred treatment in
promotions and conditions of employment. When the Hispanic
employees complained, they contended, they were fired.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the plaintiffs said they had been subjected to
epithets and insults such as ``stupid Spanish'' and ``Spanish
animals.'' They also said that supervisors had called members of
their families ``dogs,'' ``dirt'' and ``mentally retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the company denied the charges, saying that as
refugees and entrepreneurs, the company's Iranian founders had
sought to hire minority workers, including Hispanics, as part of
their belief in the ``American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This dispute has nothing to do with race and human rights,''
the lawyer, George Isaacson, said, ``but everything to do with a
failed effort by a group of Latino workers to unionize the company.
They lost that battle and are suing out of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Chavez, an immigrant from El Salvador who worked for the
company for five and a half years and was a union organizer, said
that American Tissue had denied him and other workers training and
advancement and had forced them to work overtime, up to 17 hours a
day, and sometimes seven days a week. Their average salary was $5
an hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supervisor treated everyone very badly,'' Chavez said.
``For example, when workers did overtime on July 4, 1996, the
company did not pay in the right way. When I complained, I was
called into the office and was accused of being an agitator.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said that he and the other plaintiffs had been dismissed
after employees had voted 80-29 against joining Local 707 of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs took their complaint to the New York state
Division of Human Rights, which after an investigation supported
their claim that they had been victims of discrimination. The New
York-based Center for Constitutional Rights put their complaint
into the form of a lawsuit, which seeks back wages and overtime and
an end to discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit is important,'' said Barbara J. Olshansky, a lawyer
for the Center for Constitutional Rights, ``not only to vindicate
the plaintiffs' rights but also to send a message to employers that
such egregious violations of workers' basic rights will not be
tolerated.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Isaacson said he had not received a copy of the lawsuit Monday,
but denied all of the charges against the company. ``This dispute
has been going on for the last two years, and I doubt there is
anything new,'' he said. ``This company has been an American
success story for its Iranian founder, Mehdi Gabayzadeh, who came
here as a refugee. He has hired a large contingent of Latino
Americans, also immigrants from India, Afghanistan and Poland. All
the immigrants have helped to make the company a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Marin, a lawyer for the Workplace Project, a nonprofit
organization serving Hispanic workers in Nassau and Suffolk
Counties, described discriminatory employment practices against
Hispanics on Long Island as commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them cannot speak English, are fearful of losing their
jobs and are taken advantage of,'' she said. ``They are not aware
that they have rights. What's different about this incident is that
there were people who were willing to speak out and willing to file
a lawsuit. That takes a lot of courage.''

TWO GAY MEN FIGHT TOWN HALL FOR A FAMILY POOL PASS DISCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HARTFORD, Conn. _ What Mark Melanson loves about living in
the suburbs with his gay partner, he says, is that they have a lot
in common with everybody else in their suburban neighborhood,
including the elderly woman who lives next door and the nuclear
family down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're professionals,'' Melanson said. ``We take good care of
our property. The fact that we're gay doesn't even factor into the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps that is why Melanson expected to be treated no
differently from anyone else last winter when he asked for a family
discount at the town-run pools for himself and his partner, Michael
P. Antisdale.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the gay couple's request was rejected in June by the
Town Council, whose leaders say they believe the pool may lose
money if the town gives family discounts to any groups of people
who live in the same household, including siblings, roommates and
gay couples. Melanson and Antisdale have found themselves at the
center of a townwide debate.

<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Town Council is expected to consider a
proposal for an expanded discount that would apply to gay couples
and other types of households, but the measure's supporters are not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   In this Hartford suburb, usually known for its liberalism, about
100 people showed up at a Town Council meeting last month to
support the couple. Republican members, who took control of the
Council in November for the first time in more than a decade, said
they were being unfairly labeled homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Colin McEnroe, a radio talk show host who grew up in town and
moved back here about five years ago, said that the debate
reflected a failure by some residents to understand ``the changing
nature of suburban life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is not to say the traditional nuclear family is gone,''
he said. ``But the idea of one house after the other of Cleaver
families _ it doesn't really work like that anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Melanson, 36, and Antisdale, 40, wrote to the Town Council last
winter, after managers of the town-owned Cornerstone Aquatic Center
refused to give them a family membership. An individual membership
was $345 a year at the time. A family membership is $395.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who have lived in town 10 years, said the fees seemed
blatantly unfair. They said they did not understand why they should
pay more than a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Republicans on the Council, who control the board 6-3,
reduced the individual membership fee by $50. ``They just made
discrimination more affordable,'' Melanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Robert Bouvier, a Republican who serves on the Council,
said that the town did its best to accommodate the men's request.
He said he is not biased against gay and lesbian people. He
compared a husband, wife and three children living on one income
with a gay couple living on two incomes and asked, ``Who's better
able to handle the fees at the pool?'' The rationale for the
longstanding family rate, he added, is to encourage children to
learn to swim. If the town gives gay couples the same rate, Bouvier
said, ``You're putting them on par with traditional families.''
</P>
<P>
   Council Democrats support either a household rate equal to the
family rate or further study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Conaty, communications director for the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, said that the issue reflects the discrimination
that gay and lesbian families face nationwide, but that conditions
are improving. About 350 corporations and 60 municipalities,
including West Hartford, now offer partner benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Antisdale, director of marketing for Raytel Medical Corp. in
Windsor, said that he and Melanson, a senior business analyst for
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, crossed a line in
speaking out about this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no problems as a gay couple,'' Antisdale said. ``But as
soon as we raised our hands and said, `We want the same things you
want,' the answer was `No.' And the response from some Town Council
members was even like, `How dare you ask.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the men said they have been encouraged by support from
neighbors, friends and even strangers. Antisdale and Melanson said
they plan to stay in West Hartford, where they still feel they
belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both raised in middle-class families,'' Antisdale
said, ``where the expectation was we would go to college, we would
become educated, we'd get a nice white-collar job, we'd move up and
own a nice house in the suburbs. And that's exactly what we've
done.''

FIRED TEACHER TO GET 2 WEEKS' BACK PAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MACARENA HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A city teacher who was fired a month ago for asking
her sixth- graders if they wanted to accept Jesus Christ as their
saviour will receive two weeks' back pay, Board of Education
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Mildred Rosario, 43, of Manhattan, will be
compensated for the two weeks that remained in the school year
after her dismissal on June 12, said David Galarza, a board
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosario filed a grievance with her union, the United
Federation of Teachers, challenging her dismissal and seeking the
back pay. ``They took away those last two weeks with my students,''
she said Monday. ``They can't take back all the suffering my
students and I have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Rosario will not get her job back as a bilingual
teacher at Intermediate School 74 in the Bronx, she is free to
apply for a job with any other city school district, Galarza said.
Mrs. Rosario said she met with her lawyers Monday to discuss what
to do next.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began on June 8, when Mrs. Rosario led her
pupils in prayer and laid her hands on their foreheads after the
children asked about a classmate who had recently drowned. The next
day, a sister-in-law of one of the pupils complained to the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education ruled that her actions violated the
constitutional separation of church and state and fired her four
days later.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosario's dismissal has attracted national support from
groups like the Religious Freedom Coalition and from some
Republicans in Congress, including the House majority whip, Tom
DeLay of Texas.

LACKING PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ask those in boxing what ails the sport most and
they point at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters blame the television people. The television people
blame the promoters. And no one is crazy about the organizations
that rank fighters and sanction championship bouts. Some even blame
the fighters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One thing everyone agrees upon is the sport isn't giving the
public the fights it wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   What was the last truly big fight? Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield
II _ last June 28. And there's nothing on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   While boxing remains a viable money-maker, those who make their
living in the business fear the sport will continue to suffer if it
doesn't change its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll survive. It always does. The thing is, it could be a
vibrant sport and it isn't,'' said Bob Arum, one of the biggest
promoters in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its inherent violence, boxing will always have its
detractors. Others oppose the greedy promoters and handlers, who
exploit fighters for the almighty buck. The sport's governing
bodies, with questionable scoring and sanctioning bodies, create
credibility problems. And, of course, there is the strange behavior
IN the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the above has been a part of the sport since the first
pair of gloves were laced up. A sport this violent can only be made
so safe. And greed, well, that's a part that won't go away as long
as million-dollar purses are prevalent. But the inability to stage
the big fights _ a relatively new problem _ is what's turning fans
off. Where's Ali-Frazier? Leonard-Duran? Holyfield-Bowe?
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, there were eight weight classes and one
champion atop each. Top contenders had no choice but to face the
best opposition if they wanted a championship bout and a chance at
the big money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 17 weight classes and 51 ``champions'' in the
three major boxing organizations: the WBC, IBF and WBA.
</P>
<P>
   These titleholders, who once had to climb over one another to
get to the top, fight lesser opponents while the most compelling
challengers do the same in their respective organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at (IBF lightweight champion) Shane Mosley. Fighters are
saying, `I can't beat him. Why fight him? I can fight another
champion.' Well, once upon a time, they didn't have a choice. When
you have so many champions, you do have choice,'' said television
analyst Larry Merchant.
</P>
<P>
   The best, or worst, example is the welterweight division. The
champions _ Oscar De La Hoya (WBC), Felix Trinidad (IBF) and Ike
Quartey (WBA) _ could create a series of bouts to rival the days of
Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Duran and Marvin Hagler.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to date, they have yet to meet each other in the ring
(although it appears Trinidad and Quartey, under the same promoter,
will fight this year). Simply, they don't have to fight one
another. Take De La Hoya. The Olympic gold medalist from 1992 made
a reported $33 million last year without fighting any of the above,
or the dangerous Jose Luis Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one sense, who can blame him? Why take the risk of
losing a fight and marketability that has been built over many
years?
</P>
<P>
   ``When Naseem Hamed, the De La Hoya of Europe when it comes to
popularity and money-making ability, told his promoter that he
wanted to come to America to fight the best fighters, other
promoters were shocked,'' said Merchant, whose network, HBO, has
Hamed under contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a franchise player, it could jeopardize that
promoter's livelihood by taking such risks that aren't necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   TV'S INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   Many believe television has become part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, a division of Time-Warner, has a stable of big-name
fighters under exclusive contract. That means they cannot fight on
another network. One is WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, who
recently signed a seven-year deal reportedly worth $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe such an arrangement is a problem for at least two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One: Lewis, like De La Hoya, has limited incentive to face the
best challengers. He'll fight whomever is put in front of him and
collect millions.
</P>
<P>
   And, two: his affiliation with HBO and Holyfield's loyalty to
Showtime were at least part of the reason they couldn't make the
most-anticipated fight in boxing. Exclusive ties to a particular
network works counter to a free-market system, which, if promoters
would cooperate, might be the best way to deliver the best fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if each TV network had its own football team that
could play on their network,'' said Jay Larkin, head of Showtime
Sports, which has Mike Tyson under contract and admits the
limitations of that arrangement. ``What if the (NBA's) Utah Jazz
could only play on NBC and the Chicago Bulls could only play on
CBS? How would they ever get together? That's what we're faced with
in the top echelon of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``By now, we should have seen De La Hoya-Trinidad, De La
Hoya-Quartey, Holyfield-Lewis. I think the fans are pretty
disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiBella, vice president of HBO Sports, said his network has
nothing to gain by televising inferior bouts and pointed the finger
back at Arum, who had suggested television was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promoters themselves control whether fights happen,'' said
DiBella, echoing the thoughts of many. ``He (Arum) needs to stop
blaming other people. His actions are taken in his own self
interest. Ultimately, big fights happen if promoters want them to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   SANCTIONING INSANITY
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone agrees there's a problem with the sanctioning
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the big three, there are at least 13 more
for-profit organizations based in and out of the United States that
sanction fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a governing body, like the NFL or NBA, the
bodies have served a purpose. They provide a means for recognizing
champions. They rank fighters, which theoretically provides a
ladder to the top. They provide rules. And, more recently, they've
put some effort into improving fighters' safety.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ and it's a big one _ lies in the rankings, which
mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In general, rankings have less to do with the ability of the
boxers than they do with the influence of promoters and managers
who want to position their fighters for big-money bouts.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost accepted in boxing circles that promoters and
managers pay sanctioning bodies to rank their fighters, although no
one seems to have proof. Arum did admit freely he simply calls a
sanctioning organization to have one of his fighters ranked _
although not No.1 _ and it's done.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to understand why fighters like De La Hoya
end up facing No.1-ranked opponents like Patrick Charpentier, who
have no business in the ring with the world's most-talented boxers.
</P>
<P>
   And the titles themselves have become almost meaningless as the
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``title fight'' carries minimal clout, otherwise the
organizations would cease to exist. However, the WBC championship
belt _ once revered like a religious symbol _ not long ago ended up
in a trash can courtesy of Riddick Bowe and no one seemed to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute foundation of boxing is rotten,'' Larkin said.
``And you can't build anything on a rotten foundation and expect it
to stand very long.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Their life together has never been normal,
Steven and Niki Pagones were saying Monday, just hours after the
verdict had come in. Their wedding, their first child, the birth of
identical twin girls _ not a blessed event has gone by untainted by
a thought or mention of the Tawana Brawley affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lies,'' Pagones said again, this time with the force of
law.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife say they cannot wake up in the morning without
stepping past a home office in their bedroom that overflows with
the articles, videotapes and legal detritus of 10 difficult years.
The ``Tawana junk,'' Mrs. Pagones calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be more than happy to just shove it in the garbage,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   They know, of course, that putting it all behind them will take
much more than a wastebasket. ``It'll take time, I guess,'' Pagones
said. ``As time goes on, hopefully, I'll be able to almost put this
aside, into a part of my life where I don't have to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, he said. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe five or 10 years,'' his wife suggested, laughing a
little.
</P>
<P>
   A jury had just vindicated Pagones, saying that Miss Brawley's
three former advisers, C. Vernon Mason, Alton Maddox and the Rev.
Al Sharpton had defamed him a decade ago when they accused him of
raping and kidnapping the 15-year-old black teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pagones showed little joy to the friends and well-wishers
who came up to slap him on the shoulder and kiss his wife as they
sipped drinks together in a tavern down a hill from the Dutchess
County Courthouse. He managed a smile and a sincere thanks. But he
kept getting up and excusing himself, finding a corner to collect
himself, to wipe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he had heard his wife's voice crack as she spoke to
reporters. ``You'd think I'd be elated, but I'm saddened,'' she had
said, her lips quavering. Standing behind her, Pagones gently
touched his head to hers. She bucked up.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones said he was afraid he would break down, too, but years
of concealing his emotions kicked in. ``If I became emotional about
this over the past eight months, I probably wouldn't be able to see
it through,'' he said. ``I built up this protective wall, which
enabled me to deal with the press, the threats, the rude
statements. But as soon as I came home, that wall went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Pagones could not talk about the case with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He would retreat to a darkened room and unwind in a chair, or
listen to the TV news out of earshot of her and the children. Mrs.
Pagones, a lawyer at her father-in-law's firm, would ask her boss
about the case to keep up, or listen while her husband spoke on the
phone about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She left it alone,'' Pagones said. ``She did that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Pagones said, he has been having nightmares about
the case, waking his wife with terrifying screams.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have just been from the stress, he said. At home,
he and his family still feel vulnerable. ``We still get death
threats,'' he said. ``We've had people come to the house. Just last
week, some guy stalked me from New York City, a homeless guy who
told me he was going to kill me. He told me he was a pedophile.
It's very scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones mulled over what the lawsuit had accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm recognized as the person who held Mason, Maddox and
Sharpton accountable,'' he said. ``I think a lot of people will
remember this for a long time. These men have hurt a lot of
people.''

ANALYSIS: BLOW FROM THE PAST CLOUDS SHARPTON'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-BRAWLEY-TRIAL, NY-BRAWLEY-PAGONES, NY-BRAWLEY-CHRONO.) 
(nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The defamation finding against the Rev. Al Sharpton in the
Tawana Brawley case Monday struck at the heart of what is surely
the longest-lasting of the many campaigns that Sharpton has waged
in New York over the last 10 years: The campaign to establish
himself as a mainstream force in state and city politics.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharpton, the jury's finding could hardly have been worse.
Not only did it reprise and validate one of the more troublesome
accusations in his career, it did so at a time when Sharpton has
been trying, with considerable success, to erase his reputation as
a rabble-rouser and emerge as a sober influence in New York
politics. Last year he played a major role in the Democratic
mayoral primary, and he says he plans to run again for mayor in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, an unusually agile politician, argued in an interview
Monday night that the jury's finding would help him among his
supporters _ blacks, mainly _ the way similarly adverse encounters
with the legal system lifted other famous black politicians in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will do for me what the indictment did for Adam Powell:
People came out for him 5-to-1,'' he said, referring to the late
Harlem congressman charged with misusing congressional funds.
``It's not going to be an upstate jury next time; it's going to be
here in the city. I just have to sit back here and wait and take my
vitamin pills.''
</P>
<P>
   But that assessment, while echoed by many political analysts
Monday, misses the point of the way Sharpton's career has developed
in recent years. Starting with his run for the Senate in 1992, and
continuing with his mayoral campaign last year, Sharpton has been
trying to present himself as resolutely mainstream, and as the
pre-eminent black politician in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He has clipped his hair and trimmed back his rhetoric. In both
the Senate race and the mayoral one, he often took advantage of
squabbles among his rivals to present himself as the most dignified
candidate in the contest. And he has done that with the knowledge
that the 130,000 votes that he has been able to count on drawing in
any citywide election is not quite enough to put him in Gracie
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's jury finding may make that effort more difficult,
several analysts said. ``There's a serious problem with him
becoming a crossover candidate as a function of this verdict,''
said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Albanese, a former city councilman who ran against Sharpton
in last year's mayoral primary, said the finding ensured that even
after a decade, Sharpton will continue to pay a price for his role
on the Brawley case. ``Had he not been involved in that incident, I
think his ability to have a broader appeal would have certainly
been enhanced,'' Albanese said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to write Sharpton off completely, no
matter the final outcome of the lawsuit brought by Steven Pagones,
the former Dutchess County assistant district attorney whom Miss
Brawley accused of rape.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Sharpton has already accomplished a level of
political resurrection that no politician in New York City would
have thought possible at the height of the Brawley case. He is a
talented speaker, with an uncommon understanding of the New York
media and an exceptional command of politics.
</P>
<P>
   And, as his friends said Monday, this is a 10-year-old case, and
the voters whom Sharpton has been appealing to in trying to widen
his influence appreciate his emotional evolution
</P>
<P>
   ``People will look and see those statements that they found the
verdict on were made 10 years ago, and Al Sharpton is not the same
person that he was 10 years ago,''' said state Sen. Larry Seabrook,
D-Bronx. ``He has moved on with his political life. And he has
matured.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharpton argued Monday that the verdict had less political force
both because he was not found guilty of conspiracy and because the
jury could ultimately decide on a small financial penalty, which
Sharpton argued would undercut the import of the guilty finding
itself. ``This thing could end up boomeranging on him,'' Sharpton
said of Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But as of now, several analysts said Monday, it seems
more likely that Sharpton will be the one to feel the sting of the
boomerang. For one thing, as he has throughout the defamation
trial, Sharpton said Monday that he had no apologies for the
statements that got him in trouble, a position that his critics
will surely use against him. For another, Sharpton was found liable
by the jury for making more defamatory statements than any of the
other defendants. It is noteworthy, the analysts said, that
Sharpton was absent from Poughkeepsie when the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, as even Sharpton acknowledged, his best ally in
riding out the political fallout of this case may be the clock. The
next race on Sharpton's political calendar is not until 2001. ``If
Marion Barry can come back _ I mean, what are we talking about
here?'' Sharpton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a three-year-old story,'' Sharpton said. ``And if I
appeal, and the appellate court comes out against me in two years,
and then it's 2001 _ I couldn't ask for a better commercial. I win
either way.''

SOCCER GAINS A CONVERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As France Sunday stormed to its most epic triumph since Napoleon
was carving up Europe in the early stages of the 19th century, I
must admit I felt a sense of both embarrassment and enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like a person who had just awokened from the darkness of
a lifelong slumber to discover the glorious joy of living.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like I had been struck by a divine epiphany that gave me
a sudden understanding of the greatness of a sport I had always
pettily ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like the classic Ugly American.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer of ignorance is hatred, and I must sheepishly admit
that this football-basketball-baseball-boxing reared, red, white
and blue blood American born citizen had just such an emotion
toward soccer for most of his myopic life.
</P>
<P>
   But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the past month of watching so many of the World Cup
matches on television with a growing fascination that, at the
dramatic conclusion, had me totally enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   What I discovered about soccer is that it mirrored life in all
its agonizing fickleness, in its judicial injustices, in its tragic
disappointments, in its celebratory triumphs, in its infinite
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   I became entrapped into its web by its mesmerizing tentacles
after actually sitting and watching the entire 120-minute
Argentina-England overtime epic that was decided in Argentina's
favor by penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself afterward detesting the way the outcome came
about, but also found myself engrossed by the intoxicating drama of
the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   And so after that, I started observing a lot more World Cup
matches Italy-France, Croatia-Germany, Holland-Argentina,
France-Croatia, Brazil-Holland, and, finally, France-Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself entranced by the action and its total lack of
pre-game form.
</P>
<P>
   I also found myself shaking my head in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   I had spent almost an entire journalistic career mocking a sport
simply because I had been too cavalier about ever taking the time
to actually watch and understand it.
</P>
<P>
   I still have not the faintest grasp of its esoteric nuances and
its maddening subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a charm to it that can become addicting.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hockey, it does not give a winking affirmation to violent
fist fights. Unlike football, it is not a Roman gladiator theatre
of frightening blindside blocks and sledgehammer tackles. Unlike
basketball, it is not a non-stop carnival of cloyingly repetitive
goals. Unlike baseball, it is not a slow-motion skit too often
dragged out interminably by its haughty participants. Unlike
boxing, it does not sanction homicide.
</P>
<P>
   What I've come to savor most about soccer is that you simply
never know for sure what will unfold in one of its matches, as
France's shocking 3-0 win over Brazil graphically reflected.
</P>
<P>
   In the golden land that gave us Poussin, Voltaire, Flaubert,
Hugo, Zola and, of course, Bardot, France wasn't expected to emerge
victorious against the mighty defending World Cup champion
Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Cup isn't the NBA finals that always belong to
Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, come rain, shine or Karl
Malone's ominous presence.
</P>
<P>
   There are no preordained scripts, and thus Sunday Zinedine
Zidane, Fabien Barthez, Marcel Desailly, Emmanuel Petit and Didier
Deschamps and the other Frenchmen totally upstaged Ronaldo,
Rivaldo, Dunga, Bebeto, Denilson and the other men from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   I actually found myself caught up in the spectacle of the event,
and idly kept wondering to myself how I had spent an entire life
blithely, if not stupidly remaining unaware of its uniqueness and
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   I've never thought soccer would make the impact in this country
that our major sports have, but it won't surprise me if it does
sometimes during the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   The young kids in school are now playing it, and new leagues are
surfacing all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   There still are spoilsports like I too long was who will
cynically continue to put the sport down simply because they refuse
to take the time to watch it and learn it.
</P>
<P>
   If they did, they just might come to appreciate the masterful
foot artistry of its athletes, or even the physical prowess they
show with their heads, which Zidane certainly did on two occasions
against the stunned Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   They might come to realize what I have that there are compelling
reasons for soccer being the most popular on the planet.

RICHTER STILL HOPING TO MAKE A DEAL WITH RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the Rangers remained close to an agreement with
the free-agent goaltender Curtis Joseph Monday, Mike Richter and
his agent expressed hope that a deal to keep Richter in New York
could still be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been negotiating with Joseph, who played most
recently for the Edmonton Oilers, since last Friday and were
apparently closing in on a deal, according to people involved in
the negotiations. But as of late Monday, an agreement had not been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, meanwhile, has been in contact with other teams, but
his agent, Herb Pinder, said Monday that Richter would like to
continue talking to the Rangers. Pinder said that talks with the
Rangers had not broken off, and that he expected to hear from the
team again. Richter, who had not returned telephone messages Monday
night, is believed to be seeking a deal worth about $7 million a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Pinder also denied that Richter rejected the Rangers' offer last
week of three years and $15 million. ``I told Neil Smith that Mike
was not wildly enthusiastic about his offer,'' Pinder said. ``But I
would not call that a rejection.'' Pinder added that the Rangers
did not call it a final offer. Smith, the Rangers' general manager,
has said that he will not comment on negotiations with Joseph or
Richter until an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Richter did reject a five-year, $27 million offer from the
Rangers. But that was before the free-agent signing period began on
July 1, and before John Vanbiesbrouck signed with the Philadelphia
Flyers, reducing Richter's leverage with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been out of it,'' Pinder said. ``I told Neil Smith
that Mike was not wildly enthusiastic about their offer. He said
that he needed to check his other options, and I told him I thought
that was a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has explored other options, and as of Monday, Joseph
appeared to be it. ``We had positive talks with the Rangers again
today,'' Joseph's agent, Don Meehan, said. ``But nothing is going
to happen tonight. It's a long process and a complicated process.
We'll speak again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While Meehan would not reveal details of the negotiations, and
what areas of disagreement there still were, it appeared that
Joseph had not backed down from his original asking price of $6
million a year. The four-year deal Joseph is seeking is longer, and
would pay him considerably more, than the Rangers appear ready to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought a deal would be made, Meehan said: ``I
don't know. We've had some good discussions with Neil Smith, and as
always, the negotiations have been in good faith.''

 Whisper-Light Speaker/Microphone Says an Earful   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In yellow, green or red, it looks a little like one of my kids'
chewable Gummi Bears. But the Jabra EarSet is a unique combination
of speaker and microphone  that fits in your ear and connects by a
thin wire to a cellular phone or PC.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The EarSet permits hands-free communication without the
encumbrance of a headband and boom microphone common to other
headsets. It's easy to forget you even have it on because it weighs
less than an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny microphone and speaker fit into a colored gel earpiece
molded to fit most ears. The package comes with 6 washable
earpieces _ small, medium and large sizes for left and right ears.
</P>
<P>
   The directional microphone, although placed at your ear, picks
up sounds from your mouth. Because it stays fixed, it's not subject
to the sound variations that plague boom microphones when you jar
or misadjust them.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the EarSet on a demanding application _ Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a PC dictation program that comes with its own,
traditional headset.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged the earpiece's wire into the microphone and speaker
jacks of my PC sound card. I had to adjust the microphone gain on
my sound card because Jabra's earpiece had lower output than the
boom microphone, but it performed just as accurately as Dragon's
mike.
</P>
<P>
   I also used the earpiece to hold a phone conversation over the
Internet, using my PC to encode and decode speech. Again, it worked
flawlessly _ more than I can say for the Internet, which sometimes
broke up the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Jabra soon will start bundling its earpiece with Internet
telephony software from Net2Phone, a division of New Jersey-based
IDT Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jabra Corp., based in San Diego, came out with an earpiece
several years ago for the Macintosh. But the company reorganized
last year, revamped the microphone and circuitry and added the gel
earpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between (the old) product and today's is a
little like the difference between a Commodore 64 and a Pentium
II,'' said Jabra spokeswoman Julie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The PC version of the EarSet is available from some mail-order
retailers, such as TigerDirect, for $49.95. PC and Mac versions
also are available from CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   A separate model for cellular phones _ great for talking in the
car while keeping both hands on the steering wheel _ costs $39.95,
if your phone accepts a 2.5 millimeter jack.
</P>
<P>
   The price jumps to $79.99 if you need a special connector set
for nonstandard jacks with such phones as the Motorola Flip Phone.
</P>
<P>

 &LR; www.jabra.com &LR; .

 Semiconductor Equipment-Makers May Feel the Urge to Merge   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The semiconductor equipment industry is the pits, but that could be
good news for investment bankers like Tim Sullivan _ and maybe for
bottom-fishing investors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Semi equipment vendors sell the multimillion-dollar machines
that run chip assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who works in Morgan Stanley's M&AMP;A practice in Menlo
Park, explained why equipment-makers, who are holding a trade
show &UR;  &LR; this week in San Francisco, may be getting the urge to merge.
</P>
<P>
   In short, after two years of overly ambitious factory expansion,
the chip market is glutted. Chipmakers like Intel are cutting jobs,
idling assembly lines _ and canceling orders for new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, there is a tendency for smaller or
weaker (equipment-makers) to decide they need to be part of a
bigger company,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent report predicting more semi-equipment mergers,
analyst Tia-min Pang of Cowen &AMP; Co. in San Francisco named
potential buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, stronger vendors like Applied
Materials, Photronics and Kulicke &AMP; Soffa might use the slump to
gobble up smaller firms like Credence Systems, GaSonics,
Nanometrics and Tegal.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a word to the wise. The semi equipment industry is so
complex, even insiders like Sullivan struggle to keep up with the
science behind these complex machines that can create perfect
vacuums or spray on layers of metal a mere 50 atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Sullivan warns that shares of semi equipment
stocks could fall even further before any potential mergers pull
them out of the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   What investors need to know is something that puzzles insiders:
Has the industry hit bottom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to say,'' said Bill McIlvaine, managing editor of
Semiconductor Business News. ``But I can tell you it's already as
bad as 1985,'' the last time equipment-makers fell this far into
the trough.
</P>
<P>
   To study up before investing, start with  &LR; www.semi.org &LR;  and
 &LR; www.seminews.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Leaden parachutes? &LR;  The tech industry seems on the verge of
steamrolling organized labor's opposition, and persuading Congress
to increase the quota of foreign workers who can be ``imported'' to
the United States under the H-1B visa program.
</P>
<P>
   That irritates Mike Schilling, a programmer in Oakland who
thinks the H-1B issue has been cooked up by execs to hold down the
wages of software serfs like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone in the world whose wages are inflated, it's
CEOs,'' Schilling complained in an e-mail that has been working its
way around the Net.
</P>
<P>
   As Schilling sees it, even CEOs who send their firms into
nose-dives float away on golden parachutes. And with Silicon Valley
headhunters talking about an ``executive shortage,'' odds are that
even bungling CEOs will get a shot at running another firm into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So in tongue-in-cheek fashion, Schilling proposes creating a
special H-1B visa category for top brass. ``What America needs is a
CEO who's willing to work 12 hours a day for a reasonable wage and
can be cheaply deported should he not perform acceptably,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Squeaky wheel? &LR;  It took a letter to 3Com Chairman Eric
Benhamou _ with a copy to the media _ but Donna Bernett finally got
reimbursed for $191.30 in expenses she incurred before being laid
off four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What made the long wait particularly annoying was that Bernett
worked for 3Com for only 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Wheeling, Ill., woman started on January 19 as a
$3,750-a-month print advertising supervisor. On March 16, she was
fired, as part of a 7 percent layoff in 3Com's US Robotics
division.
</P>
<P>
   She promptly filed a request to be paid for 552 miles in travel
expenses and tolls. But her chit apparently got stalled in the 3Com
network until Friday, when her letter to Benhamou, and the threat
of media exposure, prompted the company to cut a check.
</P>
<P>
   3Com spokeswoman Sara Powers said she wasn't sure what caused
the delay. But she noted that 3Com tried to ease the pain of
Bernett's layoff with a severance package that included an extra
two months pay.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Eastward, ho? &LR;  Every state in the Union is trying to grab a
piece of California's tech action. The latest wannabe is Oklahoma,
which styles itself the ``Silicon Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   Touting tax incentives, fast permits and low ($150,000) housing
prices, Gary Miller, director of Oklahoma's Department of Commerce,
will be prospecting for relocation clients at this week's
semiconductor equipment trade shows in San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   So if your evening commute sends you east over Highway 580, you
might expect a little extra delay ... as all those covered wagons
full of California refugees slow down to &UR;  &LR; climb Altamont Pass.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cobol, Fortran speakers &LR; : The Department of Labor will open a
new site today, advertising jobs for Year 2000 programmers. See
 &LR; www.dol.gov &LR;  for details.

ZIDANE HEADS THE BEST FROM THE WORLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Four years ago, Romario doing what Romario does best
declared that the summer belonged to him. ``This is,'' the
Brazilian star boasted, ``the World Cup of Romario.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinedine Zidane would never claim anything like that. He's far
too reserved, too shy, more apt to flash a bashful smile eyes
averted, of course and mumble a few humble words than brag about
what he could, and would, do once the whistle blew.
</P>
<P>
   And Zidane didn't need to say a thing: Every movement, every
inspired step even the one, his staunchest supporters claim, that
forced him to the sidelines for two matches stamped the 1998 World
Cup, beyond any rational doubt, as his.
</P>
<P>
   Matserful with the ball at his feet, surprisingly deadly with
his head, ``Zizou'' was responsible for everything France
accomplished the past month: the mesmerizing triumph, sure, but
also the strides Les Bleus took in unifying this diverse,
too-often-divided nation, and in demonstrating to many, many French
just how valuable their diversity truly is.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants who grew up poor in
Marseille's rough La Castellane district, proved to be a symbol of
so many things although that wasn't the least part of his aim. All
he wanted was to play soccer, but the way he played the ease with
which he did the most extraordinary things meant so much more to so
many.
</P>
<P>
   He had a superb supporting cast Didier Deschamps, Marcel
Desailly, Lilian Thuram, Emmanuel Petit, Laurent Blanc, Thierry
Henry, at last a half-dozen others without whose efforts France's
greatest sporting achievement would have been impossible. But
Zidane was the heart, the soul, the magic of Les Bleus
</P>
<P>
   ; it is to him the greatest slice of glory shoul go.
</P>
<P>
   The manner with which he demolished foes with a serpentine run,
always twisting the ball to where defenders' legs weren't, or with
the incisive pass nobody else on the field could have imagined was
pure wizardry. In a World Cup in which magic was in short supply,
his was a welcome presence.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane's Cup was defined by two moments, one bleak, the other
sublime. With two emphatic headers in Sunday's 3-0 rout of Brazil
in the final, he took full responsibility for an attack that had
faltered during the knockout phase; it was a heroic display that
bolstered French confidence while destroying the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   The other action, stamping on an opponent during a first-round
romp over Saudi Arabia an action that gained Zidane a red card and
a two-game suspension, jeopardizing France's prospects to reach the
quarterfinals also was seen as heroic by some. Most of the 3
million Algerians in France are opposed to the African nation's
Islamic regime; many of them are from the oppressed Berber-speaking
peoples of Algeria's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Zidane was making a political statement. It was the
``Revenge of Zizou,'' according to an Algerian newspaper: By
stomping on a Saudi a devout Muslim Zidane was striking a blow
against the extemists.
</P>
<P>
   But it was that kind of Cup for Zidane. No matter what he did,
it was seen as the best. Most of it was.
</P>
<P>
   Other '98 bests:
</P>
<P>
   Best defender:
</P>
<P>
   Easy. Desailly was a rock for a French defense that surrendered
just two goals and shutout five opponents, including the defending
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Best goalkeeper:
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay's Jose Luis Chilavert was much more than a shot
blocker. Through sheer will and force of personality, he carried
Paraguay within six minutes of a possible upset over the French. He
was, in the purest sense of the term, the Cup's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Best newcomer:
</P>
<P>
   If England's Michael Owen had grown up in America, he'd have
just graduated from high school. Instead, the 18-year-old striker
is a burgeoning international star, the most exciting player to
step foot on a French field this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Best coach:
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Blazevic took a decent Croatian squad that had lost its
best player injured Alen Boksic and gave it the confidence to
believe anything was possible. As it turned out, anything was.
</P>
<P>
   Best game:
</P>
<P>
   Several to choose from, but the Spain-Nigeria thriller from the
Group of Death still stands tallest.
</P>
<P>
   Best goal:
</P>
<P>
   Many great goals this Cup. Tops was Sunday Oliseh's half-volley
bullet off the post that gave Nigeria a 3-2 win in the tournament's
best game.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest disappointment:
</P>
<P>
   Among teams, it has to be Spain. The Spaniards were thought to
be genuine contenders but choked, like always. Among players, there
were many. A tossup among Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizaretta,
whose horrendous display on Nigeria's second goal sealed Spain's
fate; Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla, whose big mouth earned
him an early trip home; and Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero,
the superstar-in-waiting who kept everyone waiting all Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Best quote:
</P>
<P>
   We'll leave it to Bora Milutinovic, the former U.S. coach, who
made Nigeria the fourth team he'd taken to the World Cup final
rounds. Asked whom he'd be guiding in 2002, he replied: ``I am
soccer coach I don't know where I am tomorrow morning. How do I
know where I be in four years?''

 Japan Ills Darken Semicon   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Jitters from the Japanese election added to the pall cast over
Semicon West, the huge chip-equipment trade show that kicked off
yesterday at Moscone Center.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigning Sunday,
analysts and executives fear that the turmoil could prolong any
economic boost for one of the industry's key regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any momentum in Japanese stabilization has gone away,'' said
analyst Clark Fuhs, vice president of Dataquest, a research firm in
San Jose. ``The exchange rate is a concern. There are some critical
levels where it starts bringing China into the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   A plunging yen makes Japanese exports cheaper, and that leads to
worries that China could devalue its currency to remain competitive
in world markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of the problems in Japan, there's no real good news
in that scenario for us or any other manufacturers,'' said Jon
Tompkins, chairman of San Jose-based KLA-Tencor. ``Demand for
chip-based products of all types are depressed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without more bad news out of Asia, chip equipment-makers
remain mired in a slump that's worse than anyone can recall.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips have always been a cyclical business, in which
improvements in making chips periodically cause too much supply,
which in turn drives down prices _ and profits. And when chip
companies make less money, they order less equipment, which puts
the equipment industry into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   But this cycle is even worse than the downturn of the early
1980s, said Jim Morgan, the veteran chief executive of industry
leader Applied Materials. ``It's among the toughest and most
unforgiving that I've seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One New York analyst who follows the industry is pessimistic,
but he said he's not allowed to use the ``r-word.'' He said his
company won't let him use the r-word ``until we're in the d-word.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The industry expects revenues for this year to be $19.7
billion, a 22 percent drop from last year's $25.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara-based Applied has asked certain employees to
consider buyouts, in hopes of shedding 1,000 jobs by the end of
this month. The company has been shutting down on Fridays as a
cost-saving measure that could continue until year end, a spokesman
said. On Friday, Applied said earnings for its latest quarter will
be lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Applied is not alone. Other chip equipment-makers, such as Lam
Research and Novellus, have laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more layoffs coming,'' said analyst Mark FitzGerald, a
vice president at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. ``People are
talking about a 15 to 20 percent head-count reduction in this
area'' at some companies.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the troubled times: Semicon West attracted
62,000 people last year, but Stan Myers, president of Semi, the
trade association that sponsors the show, expects the number to
drop this year. He won't know by how much until the show ends. It
runs in San Francisco through tomorrow and moves to the San Jose
Convention Center for Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is prime exhibit space, and we could throw firecrackers
there and not hit anybody,'' said Jerry Karls, CEO of Integrated
Circuit Engineering Corp.
</P>
<P>
   On the show floor, there seemed to be more exhibitors scouting
the competition than customers looking for new products.
``Everybody's scratching for customers,'' said Applied's Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the business conditions that border on recession _ and
which no one sees the industry pulling out of for another 12 to 18
months _ many companies tried to put a positive spin on the
technology on display.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it looked arcane: large machines that whirred, Rube
Goldberg devices that manipulate chips, signs touting new ``exhaust
control,'' ``atmospheric robot,'' ``automated wet process'' and
other intricacies of the chip-equipment business.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms tried to make their products entertaining. Mimes
donned the white suits used in chip-making clean rooms. One man was
covered head to toe in copper _ the next big material in chip
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Some chip companies are switching from aluminum to copper for
the wiring inside chips. The equipment-makers want to encourage the
shift because it also requires new machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Novellus of San Jose rented out the spacious Yerba Buena Center
for an elaborate display touting the move to copper.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Novellus complex walked through a
``de-aluminizer,'' in which steam and flashing lights pretended to
eliminate aluminum from the body. Guides in black turtlenecks and
black slacks guided them into a theater like one used in
``Clockwork Orange,'' in which flashing messages on a screen tried
to brainwash them to use copper. They donned virtual reality-type
headsets in which the message was drilled home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if they were Novellus customers, they got to go into
another wing of the building for a massive show of the latest
equipment. Novellus displayed no hint of industry panic there, only
unbridled optimism at the technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all set to rock and roll,'' said David Godwin, a
software engineer. He watched with pride as Novellus' $3 million
Sabre machine rinsed silicon wafers and spun them dry. ``This
thing's going to make us a lot of money,'' he said.

 Specialty Internet search engines allow users to cut through 
 clutter   By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Say you want to locate a news group on swing dancing, a shop in
Northern California that will do custom embroidery, or a sheet
metal supplier in the Midwest.
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could go to one of the main search engines, such as Yahoo or
Excite, and sort through mountains of information that may or may
not be relevant. Or you could take a shortcut and go to one of a
growing number of specialty search engines.
</P>
<P>
   As the amount of data clogging the Internet continues to grow,
it's ``just harder and harder'' for traditional automated search
engine technology to return focused data, said Danny Sullivan,
editor of the ``Search Engine Watch'' newsletter, based in London.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``the number of specialty engines has been growing
wherever you look, especially in the past year,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas Regional Directory Co., best known for its
industrial supply books, recently created regional search engines
on a wide variety of industrial products, services and trade
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Disney started a site for kids called Dig.com that
features individual search engines for topics such as comic books
and dinosaur trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Most search engines create their listings automatically by
having software ``agents'' crawl the Web and constantly update a
directory of site information, which is matched against the
keywords typed in by users.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Yahoo, also rely on teams of editors to manually
review sites and descriptions that are submitted by site owners.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty search engines work much the same way, but because
their focus is so narrow, they can eliminate more ``clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   You can find specialty search engines by looking in hobby and
trade magazines.
</P>
<P>
   You also can find them on standard search engines. The home
pages for the major search engines, including Excite and Lycos,
produce fairly comprehensive specialty search engine listings in
their ``computers'' category.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm looking for a Viper 330 video card, it just makes no
sense whatsoever to start out with Yahoo,'' said Charlie Woods, a
Dallas engineer. ``Digging through the sites that come up just
takes too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods uses niche engines to find computer components for work
and, on weekends, to locate parts for his Honda ST1100 motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually find the exact information I'm looking for within
the first 20 or 30 listings, instead of the hundreds of listings it
took before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gettinger, who runs a glass manufacturing company in
Hayward, also uses specialty engines for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick of typing in `glass' and getting tons of
information on artistic glass or glass plants in Canada, but
nothing I could use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of specialty search engines is that they are
sometimes no more than glorified commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Because they get fewer advertising dollars than traditional
search engines, specialty search engines often charge sites for
prominent positions in their search results.
</P>
<P>
   And some only are referral sites for companies looking for sales
leads.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers should find out how a search engine makes money
before relying on it exclusively, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users should always be on the lookout for clues as to how
commercially biased the listings are,'' said Mark Mooradian, a
director with Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites that purport to be search engines don't even refer
visitors to other Web sites. For example, Jewelry-Search.com only
refers visitors to local jewelers who have paid a fee to be
included. When you're checking out a specialty search engine, pay
attention to the kinds of sites that show up on search results. If
they include a mix of commercial and noncommercial sites and news
groups, they're more likely give you less-biased information.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just because sites are paying to be included in the
results doesn't mean a site isn't useful,'' Mooradian said.
</P>
<P>
   And many generic, advertising- &QL; 
supported search engines also charge Web sites for premium
listings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, mainstream search engines often have exclusive
licensing deals with online retailers. When users type in popular
keywords like ``books'' or ``music,'' sites like Amazon.com or
Barnes &AMP; Noble.com usually will be listed first.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said many users of traditional search engines don't know
that when a logo flashes ``try this first'' above a search result,
it's likely that a company has paid for top billing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lycos instructs users to ``check this out,'' with
``this'' being a link to business partner Barnes and Noble.com.
When someone jumps to the Barnes and Noble site from Lycos, the
search engine gets a commission.
</P>
<P>
   One search engine company has chosen to be up-front about its
commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
   Goto.com, launched in 1997, tells users exactly how much a site
has paid for placement on the Goto search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Goto even shows visitors how much sites are paying per click.
Most companies pay between one and 12 cents for every person who
clicks onto to their sites from Goto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Goto search results are organized via competitive bidding:
Those that pay more get higher billing.

 Motorola To Acquire Starfish   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Motorola said yesterday it has agreed to acquire Starfish Software,
developer of the popular Rex personal organizer as well as
technology for linking wireless devices to computers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starfish, based in Scotts Valley, will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola pending regulatory
approvals. Starfish chief executive Philippe Kahn will be president
of the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola President Bob Growney, who joined Kahn for the
announcement last night in San Francisco, said the cash-and-stock
deal values Starfish at several hundred million dollars. Exact
terms weren't disclosed because Starfish is a private company.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes as Motorola grapples with a tumultuous
reorganization brought on by weakness in its semiconductor business
and a 98 percent plunge in profits in its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Growney said Motorola will build Starfish technology into
wireless devices that exchange information with each other as well
as with a variety of information sources including personal
computers, the Internet and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complementary visions of our two companies _ to create an
environment in which consumers can literally take their world with
them _ makes this union not only logical but extremely powerful,''
said Growney.
</P>
<P>
   Starfish, which boasts about 100 employees, had been on track
for an initial public offering. But Kahn said the deal with
Motorola _ which came together in the past month _ was too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going for an IPO, we can focus on the technology
we're building and be part of the company that ships more than half
of the wireless devices in the world,'' he said. ``At the same
time, Motorola has been a little bit beaten up, so we'll take their
undervalued stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Motorola may benefit from having a nimble player
like Starfish in its stable _ a company that has a track record for
quickly deploying new technology. The Rex, a credit card-sized
organizer, is its best success to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starfish has continuously demonstrated its ability to
effectively advance technology solutions for swift market
development,'' said market analyst David Coursey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starfish owns a number of patents on technology for
linking wireless devices, which Motorola will now own.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn co-founded Starfish in 1994, shortly before he was ousted
as chief executive of Borland International. He had founded Borland
in 1982, and grew it into the world's third-largest software
company on the strength of database and spreadsheet products.
</P>
<P>
   Borland went sour in the 1990s, however, as its products were
eclipsed by other software that worked better with Microsoft
Windows.

BROOKLYN ASSEMBLYMAN ACQUITTED OF CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dov Hikind, a Democratic assemblyman from Brooklyn
who is known for his maverick politics and outspoken manner, was
acquitted Monday of charges that he took tens of thousands of
dollars in illegal payoffs from officials of a social services
group.
</P>
<P>
   But a former official of the group, Rabbi Elimelech Naiman, was
convicted of making corrupt payments to Hikind, a veteran state
legislator from Borough Park. And the rabbi was convicted of fraud
charges stemming from his activities with the group that did not
involve Hikind.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors declined to speak with reporters to explain their
decision to acquit Hikind and convict Naiman, but prosecutors and
defense lawyers said the two verdicts were not necessarily
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, they said, could have accepted the prosecutors'
contention that the rabbi made the payments with the intent to
influence Hikind corruptly in order to help the group obtain state
funds, but that Hikind did not receive the payments with corrupt
intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intent is the key,'' Hikind's lawyer, Gustave Newman, told
reporters after the verdicts were announced in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn after five and a half days of deliberations in a
two-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   As the verdict was announced, Hikind, 48, gasped loudly, then
put his head on the table and began to cry. He then embraced
Newman. Later, standing outside the courtroom with his sobbing
wife, Shoshana, Hikind thanked God, his lawyer and the jury of six
men and six women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am in a yarmulke, an Orthodox Jew, and a jury made up
of a cross section of New York, including four black people and a
Pakistani person, and I got justice today,'' he said. ``What a
great country for someone whose parents survived Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind had been charged with two counts: the corrupt
solicitation and acceptance of funds and the misapplication of
funds, each of which could have produced a sentence of up to 10
years in prison. In addition, a conviction would have meant
immediate expulsion of Hikind from the Assembly, where for 16 years
he has represented Borough Park and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, whose office
prosecuted the case, said later that he was satisfied with the
verdict to the extent that Naiman's conviction supported the
prosecution argument that government funds, which had been given to
the social services group for charitable uses, ``were diverted for
purposes that were not intended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury apparently did not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
that Assemblyman Hikind accepted the benefits conferred upon him
with the same corrupt intent with which they were conferred,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, Jason Brown and Elisa Liang, assistant U.S.
attorneys in Brooklyn, told the jury that between 1991 and 1994,
Hikind corruptly received about $40,000 of the council's funds in
return for obtaining hundreds of thousands of dollars in state
money for the group and its affiliates. The payoffs, they held,
were in the form of payments for items like yeshiva tuition for
Hikind's children, family trips to Israel and France, and expenses
for political campaigns and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Naiman, 44, exhibited no reaction as he heard the jury pronounce
him guilty of corrupt payment of funds, misapplication of funds and
a half dozen mail fraud counts. He faces a term of up to 10 years
in prison when Judge Charles Sifton of U.S. District Court
sentences him on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said, ``I'm confident this
verdict against Rabbi Naiman will not withstand appellate review.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rabbi was the employment and training director of the social
services group involved in the case, the Council of Jewish
Organizations of Borough Park. Until the investigation that led to
the trial, the council was an influential and politically connected
group that ran programs like job training and aid to the elderly
and to children, receiving millions of dollars a year in federal,
state and city funds. Candidates for public offices from president
on down courted the council, widely known as COJO, because they
believed it was instrumental in winning tens of thousands of
Orthodox Jewish votes.
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant in the case, Paul Chernick, COJO's former
operations director, pleaded guilty in April to stealing from the
group's government grants and said he had used some of the money to
make illegal payoffs to Hikind. But the jurors at the assemblyman's
trial were not told of the plea and statement, and Chernick did not
testify because his plea deal did not require him to do so, for
reasons Carter declined Monday to disclose.

 Improving Anti-Smut Software   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:  I'm using CyberPatrol Internet blocking software, but to my 
 dismay, it doesn't seem to be blocking inappropriate sites that 
 are accessed through search engines like Yahoo. Do you know of 
 any other software that will prevent my teenage son from 
 accessing sex sites this way? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Actually, CyberPatrol will block access to a site reached
through a search engine as long as it's on the list of sites for
which the software has been programmed to look for. Unfortunately,
no blocking software is going to be able to keep up with the
explosion of raunchy Web sites. (Sex is one of the top growth
industries of the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   However, you can make CyberPatrol block results of searches for
specific words, like ``sex.'' Here's how: First, go to the IRQ Chat
button in the CyberPatrol main screen and add the words you want to
block. Then, go back to the main screen and click the button for
WWW, FTP and Other. On the left side of the dialog box that
appears, click the check box labeled Apply IRQ keyword filters to
URL names.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done this, a search for ``sex'' in most search
engines will come up empty. Keep in mind, though, that you'll also
be blocked from sites about about Middlesex, England; poet Anne
Sexton; or other sites containing the naughty word.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I would like to know how to put a GIF image in my &LR; 
 &LR; signature so that it appears on all my outgoing e-mail. I use &LR; 
 &LR; Microsoft Outlook Express. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It can be done, but it takes a few steps. First, you'll
need to create an HTML file containing the image and your
signature. (The signature actually is just your name and other
personal information, not a real signature.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have Microsoft Office 97, you can use Word to do the job.
Open Word and start a new document. Choose Picture from the Insert
menu, then click from File. Locate the GIF image file on your hard
disk and insert it into the document. Then enter your signature
above or below the image. Finally, choose Save as HTML from Word's
File menu, give the document a name and save it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now open up Outlook Express. Choose Stationery from the
Tools menu to bring up the Stationery dialog box. In the area
titled, ``When composing new messages use,'' click This Stationery.
Then click Select, browse the hard disk for your new HTML document,
and select it.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Every new message will contain the image and
signature, which can be received by anyone with a mail program
capable of handling HTML. By the way, don't forget to turn off any
other e-mail signature you may have created, to avoid a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Lately, every time I boot up my computer, the time is &LR; 
 &LR; wrong. The problem is that the computer's clock is slowing &LR;   &LR; down.
What gives, and how can I fix it? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Your system's battery probably is wearing out. And if it
fails, you may have trouble booting up your PC. My suggestion is to
take the computer to a qualified technician for a battery
replacement. You can do the job yourself, but it involves finding
the right kind of battery and backing up crucial system information
before removing the old one. FYI, most batteries are under $20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Is there any way to compose and read e-mail without first &LR; 
 &LR; having to go online? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Sure. Just choose the Work Offline or Go Offline option
offered in the File menu of most e-mail programs. You then can read
any messages that previously have been downloaded, as well as
compose new messages, which will be sent the next time you go
online.
</P>
<P>
   If you use America Online, you can use FlashSessions to go
online automatically at scheduled times, download new messages
you've received and send out any you've written offline.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Travel Update: &LR;  A couple of weeks ago, I told someone they'd
need special phone plugs when connecting to the Internet in Europe.
Reader Charles Mills wrote in with this nifty piece of advice:
``Check out  &LR; www.kropla.com &LR; . It appears to be a nonprofit site
devoted to answers to every question you could ever have about
foreign phone and power plugs.''

 The Chicago Option   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Pacific Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange confirmed
yesterday that they are holding preliminary talks to form a
``strategic alliance.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boards of directors of both exchanges meet next week and
could agree to a merger between the Chicago exchange, which trades
nearly two-thirds of all stock and stock-index options, and the
Pacific, the third largest options exchange in the country.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are not only 487 jobs at the Pacific Exchange, 80
percent of them in San Francisco, but about 1,900 other jobs at
member firms.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanges reportedly have agreed to a ``lockup
agreement'' that requires them to negotiate exclusively with each
other for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The move to consolidate isn't surprising. Like the companies
whose stocks and stock options they trade, exchanges &UR;  &LR; are combining
to cut costs, share technology and gain other economies of scale to
better compete in the rapidly changing financial services world.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago exchange has had the urge to merge before. The
exchange, which revolutionized options trading by creating
standardized, listed options in 1973, bid unsuccessfully earlier
this year for the options business of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But the Philadelphia exchange decided to merge with the American
Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers. That
deal presumably put additional pressure on Chicago and Pacific to
work out a merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific has been talking about alliances and mergers for the
past decade, according to Vice President Dale Carlson. ``But these
are very difficult to pull off because you're dealing with member
organizations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After reporting record trading volume and profits for three
years, Carlson said ``our board members have said we have the
wherewithal to remain independent indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   One non-negotiable point in the current discussions, he said, is
keeping an options trading floor in San Francisco. Members also
want a long-term guarantee rather than a five-year commitment which
is all the Philadelphia exchange received in its deal with Amex.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike shareholders of public companies like BankAmerica, who
may favor a merger that stipulates moving operations and
headquarters, the 552 members who own the Pacific and predominantly
work in San Francisco must vote in favor of a merger by a
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get membership support unless an options floor
remains in San Francisco,'' said Don Abramson, a director of
Kessler-Asher, a San Francisco stock options clearing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, business leaders and politicians supported what they
knew about Chicago-Pacific discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident there will be no job loss in San Francisco
and we are equally confident there will be a stock options and
exchange floor in the city,'' said Kandace Bender, a spokeswoman
for Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also hoping that there will be no changes in the plans
to construct a new 17-story headquarters and trading floor on
Folsom Street,'' said San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Since no agreement has been reached, there are many more
questions than answers. Some observers question the long-term
viability of regional stock exchanges in an era of global markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the equities side of the business is bothering
a lot of us,'' said Dennis LoPresti, senior vice president of
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles and a former director of
the Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently expanded from seven to 10 equities trading
specialists so we are concerned if the exchange plans to spin off
its equities trading operations or merge them with someone else
like the Cincinnati or Boston exchanges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific trades the most active stocks and bonds on the New
York and American stock exchanges but its options trading business
has been growing at more than double the pace of its stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can use options to lessen the risks of owning stocks.
An option contract gives the purchaser the right to buy or sell the
underlying security at a prespecified price by a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pacific trading in Microsoft, Compaq, Sun Microsystem
and about 800 other equity options jumped 38 percent. Options now
account for more than half the exchange's business.

TAWANA BRAWLEY CASE CHRONOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-BRAWLEY-TRIAL, NY-BRAWLEY-SHARPTON, NY-BRAWLEY-PAGONES.) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chronology of the Tawana Brawley case:
</P>
<P>
   NOV. 28, 1987: Tawana Brawley, a 15-year-old high school
student, is found curled in a fetal position inside a plastic bag
behind an apartment house in Wappingers Falls, six miles south of
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that she had been beaten; ``nigger'' and ``KKK''
written on her torso; feces smeared across her body, and her hair
chopped off. She later told her family and law enforcement
authorities that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by
six white men, one of whom wore a police badge.
</P>
<P>
   DECEMBER 1987: The Brawley family hires Alton Maddox and C.
Vernon Mason as its lawyers. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has worked
with the civil rights lawyers in the past, assumes the role of
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 26, 1988: After two local prosecutors disqualify themselves
and Maddox continues to advise Miss Brawley to remain silent and
uncooperative with investigators, Gov. Mario Cuomo orders State
Attorney General Robert Abrams to act as a special prosecutor in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   FEB. 29, 1988: State Supreme Court Justice Angelo Ingrassia
empanels a grand jury of 11 women and 12 men (2 blacks and 21
whites) to determine the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   MARCH 13, 1988: Without citing evidence, Maddox and Mason say
Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones was one of a group of
white men who abducted Miss Brawley and sexually abused her.
Pagones denies the allegation, and his lawyer, Gerald Hayes, says:
``I can assure you that Steve Pagones will not only defend himself
against these liars, but we will certainly see them in court. If
there's any doubt about what I mean by that last statement, it
means that we fully intend to sue them for slander.''
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 6, 1988: Concluding a seven-month investigation, the grand
jury concludes that Miss Brawley had fabricated her tale of
abduction and sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _Miss Brawley decided not to return to her home in Wappingers
Falls on Nov. 24 and spent much of the ensuing four days in an
apartment from which her family had recently been evicted.
</P>
<P>
   _Miss Brawley, alone or with an accomplice, concocted the
degrading condition in which she was found by smearing herself with
dog feces, writing racial slurs on her body, tearing and scorching
her clothes and crawling into a garbage bag and pretending to be in
a traumatized state.
</P>
<P>
   _Miss Brawley tried for weeks to mislead doctors, social
workers, the police, reporters and community residents with faked
medical complaints and fragmentary accounts of an attack by a band
of white racists.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Brawley's lawyers and adviser, in a four-hour broadcast
over New York radio station WLIB, denounced the grand jury's report
as a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   OCT. 31, 1988: Pagones files a lawsuit against Maddox, Mason,
Sharpton and Miss Brawley.
</P>
<P>
   MAY 21, 1990: Maddox is suspended from practicing law in New
York state because of his refusal to cooperate with an ethics panel
looking into his conduct in the Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   MAY 7, 1991: Judge rules that Pagones wins his case against Miss
Brawley by default after she fails to answer legal papers. Damages
against her will be tallied after the trial is completed.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 13, 1994: Sharpton receives 26 percent of the vote in the
statewide Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   JAN. 26, 1995: Mason is disbarred by a state appellate court,
which cited him for ``a pattern of professional misconduct''
spanning at least six years.
</P>
<P>
   SEPT. 9, 1997: Sharpton receives 32 percent of the vote in the
Democratic mayoral primary in New York City, nearly forcing a
runoff with Ruth Messinger.
</P>
<P>
   NOV. 18, 1997: Pagones' defamation suit against against Miss
Brawley's three advisers begins, 10 years after it was filed. The
trial is expected to last about a month.
</P>
<P>
   JULY 8, 1998: The case goes to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   JULY 13, 1998: The jury reaches a verdict, finding Mason, Maddox
and Sharpton liable for defaming Pagones.

ESPN WEST PLANS SHELVED BEFORE DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three months before its intended launch, the ESPN
West mission has quietly been scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Fox announced a 10-year cable agreement to continue
regional coverage of the Angels and Mighty Ducks _ the two teams
that were to be the foundation of ESPN's first foray into the
regional-cable business this October.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which announced the intention to create ESPN West at the
Western Cable Show last December, ran into problems that many
industry analysts anticipated _ it had trouble making any headway
with local cable operators finding space for the channel on their
systems.
</P>
<P>
   To date, only DDS systems DirecTV and EchoStar had committed to
ESPN West because of 500-channel capacities on their small
satellite dish distribution. Systems in Orange County were ones
that ESPN West would have focused on most, but channel space for
that has recently been given, in some cases, to Fox Sports West 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said that several months ago, Fox received a call from
Disney representatives, who run both ESPN as well as the two teams,
and asked if they'd entertain an offer to continue their current
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which understands the frustration of lining up cable
systems considering the pains it went through the last two years to
launch Fox Sports West 2 even with the Dodgers as its star
attraction, was understandably ecstatic about locking in the Angels
and Ducks as programming for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both the Angels and Ducks had filed suit against Fox
Sports West and Fox Sports West 2 to have their contracts revoked _
in both cases, agreements were reached to allow the teams to leave
Fox _ the Disney-owned teams are content with this new Fox
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach this as a long-term alliance,'' Tim Mead, vice
president of communications for Anaheim Sports Inc., said of the
team in a statement. ``Unique provisions ensure that both companies
will be working toward a common goal in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   With the extended Fox deal, the Ducks will have 40 games a
season (home and road) live on Fox Sports West 2 while the Angels
will have 50 games (most at home) live on Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports West reaches 4.8 million viewers in Southern
California, Nevada and Hawaii; Fox Sports West 2 is in 2.8 million
homes in Southern California and Nevada. FSW2 has not been picked
up by several cable systems in the San Fernando Valley and nearby
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this announcement, we fully expect Fox Sports West 2 to
have 100 percent distribution in the coming months,'' Kitty Cohen,
general manager of FSW and FSW2, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN spokesman Chris LaPlaca said channel-capacity issues that
affect all new networks were a large part of why ESPN West could
not meet its October launch goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this time line, the startup needs of ESPN West didn't meet
the immediate needs of the teams, and we support the decision''
said LaPlaca. ``Disney is all about doing what helps every one of
its entities.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPlaca did not rule out a future launch of ESPN West, although
having the Angels and Ducks locked in for 10 years with the
network's chief competition should preclude any movement on ESPN
trying to go regional in Southern California market. ESPN continues
to look into regional channels in other parts of the country,
LaPlaca said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which owns the Dodgers, also has the Lakers and Kings
locked into agreements until 2010, and have three more years on a
deal with the Clippers. Fox also has USC and UCLA sports rights _
leaving little to no inventory for an ESPN West.

YANKEES NOTEBOOK: WILLIAMS SET TO REJOIN LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Bernie Williams, out for more than a month after
suffering a sprained knee, will probably rejoin the Yankees' lineup
on Friday in Toronto, according to manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie's feeling really good,'' Torre said Monday. ``To me, it
looks good for the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will join the Yankees' Class AA affiliate Norwich on
Tuesday, as the Navigators begin a three-game series in Portland,
Maine. Williams is expected to play two games, and if all goes
well, Torre said, he could rejoin the team on Thursday in Detroit
and then play on Friday. But don't rule out the possibility that
Williams could talk his way back into the lineup for Thursday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sprained his knee sliding on June 10 and was placed on
the 15-day disabled list the next day. He progressed rather quickly
in his rehabilitation through June, and the Yankees thought he
would be ready to play last week at Tampa Bay. But in the first
game of a minor league rehabilitation assignment on July 6,
Williams felt pain in his knee as he made a throw. However, doctors
think the pain stemmed from scar tissue, rather than any structural
problem, and on Sunday, Williams was given the clearance to resume
full batting practice and outfield drills.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the Yankees have been playing _ they have a 65-21
record, and are 19-8 without Williams _ he is needed to bolster a
sagging offense.
</P>
<P>
   Since Williams suffered his injury, the Yankees' batting average
has dropped from .300 to .283, and other members of the lineup have
started to sputter. Paul O'Neill, swinging more aggressively
without Williams in the lineup, has seen his average sink 15
points, and he has drawn only two walks in his last 14 games. With
the switch-hitting Williams, Torre can separate the
left-handed-hitting O'Neill and Tino Martinez in the lineup, making
it more difficult for opposing managers to use left-handed
relievers late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis, who has done a solid job in center field, could use
a rest, Torre said on Sunday. Before he got three hits on Sunday,
Curtis' batting average had dropped 26 points.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams is activated, the Yankees are expected to send
Ricky Ledee back to Class AAA Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Has a Relapse
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had hoped to activate the reliever Jeff Nelson for
Tuesday's game, but Nelson's back, the reason he was placed on the
disabled list in June, began bothering him again after he threw
batting practice on Sunday. Now Torre is wondering if it would be
better to send Nelson on a minor league rehabilitation assignment _
perhaps sometime at the end of the week _ before activating him.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis, the third player on the Yankees' disabled list, may
begin his rehabilitation assignment on or around July 23 and be
activated in the following week. Tim Raines and Darryl Strawberry
have been semi-regular players in Davis' absence, but once Davis
returns, Torre said, he will be given the bulk of the at-bats, so
that he can regain his timing quickly enough to be a factor in the
final weeks of the regular season and in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much invested in him to not do that,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Gout Is Out, Says Wells
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, hobbled by a bruised right big toe, says he does
not have gout. ``If I did, I would tell you,'' said Wells, who
expects to make his next scheduled start on Friday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush has been a sometimes valuable tool for the Yankees,
pinch-running in close games; on Sunday, he scored the decisive run
in the ninth inning. But the Yankees will probably trade Bush in
the days leading up to the July 31 deadline, because, barring
injuries, the Yankees will not have room for Bush once Chili Davis
returns from the disabled list in August. Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager, says eight teams have demonstrated
interest in Bush. Among those: St. Louis, Detroit, Toronto and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dyed blonde hair is a growing fad around the big leagues, Roger
Clemens of Toronto and Charles Nagy of Cleveland being among those
who have gone platinum. Torre said the Yankees have a rule against
facial hair. But if someone wanted to go blond, ``What can I do
about it?'' Torre asked rhetorically, smiling. ``I don't run these
guys' lives.'' The Yankees least likely to dye their hair,
according to Torre: Joe Girardi and Paul O'Neill.

COURTING D'AMATO ON A SHOESTRING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The letter was handwritten on lined dime-store
paper, suggesting a homespun spontaneity. ``Entire forests are
dying from disease,'' a Long Island teacher wrote. ``If you press
hard for acid rain legislation in this session of Congress, I may
never have to teach anything more than the beauty and wonders of
nature!''
</P>
<P>
   But the note was actually one of thousands written quite
unspontaneously at the behest of environmental groups last spring.
And like the paper plates bearing messages from immigrants, the
postcards from people with AIDS and the phone calls from opponents
of smoking, they were part of well-coordinated efforts to influence
one man: Sen &UR; . &LR;  Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to the high-priced lobbying of powerful interest
groups, D'Amato opens himself to less-familiar pressure groups come
election time. He has been getting an earful of low-budget advocacy
these days from nonprofit organizations representing immigrants,
environmentalists, tenants, gay people and a bevy of other
constituencies better known for their ties to New York Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   With phone and letter campaigns, news conferences and
newsletters, the groups are training laserlike attention on D'Amato
this year, hoping that election-year pressures will cause him to
push harder and shout louder on issues he might have ignored or
opposed were he not seeking votes. D'Amato, considered one of the
Senate's most vulnerable incumbents, is seeking his fourth term
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who I've talked to who knows him said, `You know,
this is your best year,''' said William Cooke, legislative director
for the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, which is urging
D'Amato to push acid rain legislation. ``Every six years, he's an
environmentalist.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem pointless for groups with traditionally liberal
agendas to focus on a man who revels in labeling challengers
``hopelessly liberal.'' But such organizations have clearly reaped
some benefits from their efforts. With his bloodhound's nose for
populist themes, D'Amato is more moderate, and malleable, near
election time than his hard-edge campaign oratory suggests,
officials with several groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more amenable at election time,'' said a Washington
lobbyist for a civil rights group, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``People joke that in an election year, D'Amato is
better than most Democrats. He'll be there, because he's seeking
votes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His ties to centrist and liberal pressure groups have also been
useful to D'Amato. Such alliances have allowed him to say he is
fighting against conservative Republicans for regular New Yorkers,
and not just for wealthy campaign contributors or big companies.
</P>
<P>
   But his critics and Democratic rivals accuse D'Amato of
opportunism, saying he champions liberal and centrist causes solely
to court swing voters and to whitewash what they consider a
distinctly conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's masquerading as a new-found environmentalist,'' said
Chris Ballantyne, Northeast regional director for the Sierra Club,
which has run television advertisements criticizing D'Amato this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, D'Amato bridled at suggestions that he has
shifted leftward this year, insisting that most of his current
positions are not new. ``They are matters of conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged feeling additional pressure from grass-roots
lobbyists in recent months. ``Some groups become impatient,'' he
said. ``They think that because there is an election, they will get
you to do more or less. But I work as hard as I can all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, pressure tactics may have influenced the senator more
than he admits. In one case, D'Amato voted in May for a Democratic
amendment to raise cigarette taxes by $1.50 a pack after fierce
lobbying from health care and consumer groups. In the past, he has
voted against such tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a significant effort to focus on D'Amato,'' said Joan
Mulhern, co-chairwoman of the Save Lives, Not Tobacco Coalition.
``Tobacco control is a big issue for some of his Democratic
opponents, so we thought it was an issue he would be sensitive
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because they knew he would be embroiled in a tough
re-election campaign, advocates for immigrants also made D'Amato a
major target this year in their fight to reinstate food stamp
benefits for legal immigrants. The groups mailed hundreds of paper
plates containing scribbled messages from immigrants to D'Amato _
who often supports immigrants on other issues _ hoping that the
appeal of potential Hispanic and Asian voters would turn his head.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not press this issue as hard as some groups hoped,
D'Amato spoke in favor of the measure and joined a bipartisan group
that helped break a Senate deadlock, paving the way for the bill's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, patient advocates are planning to lobby
D'Amato later this summer on legislation intended to increase
consumer protections in managed-care plans. Though D'Amato has
sponsored such legislation, he has not pushed hard enough for its
passage, the groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps that there are three Democrats who are actively
campaigning on this,'' said Richard Kirsch, executive director of
Citizen Action of New York, a nonprofit government watchdog group
active in health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   The three Democrats seeking the nomination to challenge D'Amato
are Geraldine Ferraro, the former candidate for vice president;
Mark Green, the New York City public advocate, and Rep. Charles
Schumer of Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Amato, there are some obvious risks in advocating
legislation that other Republicans strongly oppose. Success can
annoy his Senate allies, while failure can disappoint and anger the
grass-roots groups he is courting.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at the urging of environmental groups, D'Amato and
his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
introduced legislation last year intended to curb the airborne
pollutants that cause acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   The groups cheered him at the time, and D'Amato began
broadcasting television advertisements just weeks later touting his
environmentalism. But the bill has been stuck in committee, and the
environmentalists have begun complaining loudly that D'Amato is
doing nothing to advance it. ``We had been hoping that his campaign
would make a difference,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for
the Adirondack Council.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said fierce opposition to the bill from Midwestern
senators has made passage all but impossible this year. But he
pledged that the bill would be enacted eventually. ``You don't win
every one of these battles overnight,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: DON'T CALL IT JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, especially as media giants devour other media
giants, synergy has taken on the elusive shimmer of a corporate
grail. The idea has always been that various divisions of Viacom or
AT&AMP;T/TCI or News Corp. would work together to promote one another's
``product.'' An article from the magazine wing creates the book for
the publishing arm, which then segues into the movie that launches
the toy soldiers that _ sold altogether by one big mother company _
make a ton of money for the happy stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Such all-purpose, multilayered marketing of one idea or story or
superstar works for Disney's ``Lion King'' or the keepers of
Leonardo DiCaprio. But so far there is not much evidence that
synergy has been particularly good for an old-fashioned activity
known as journalism.
</P>
<P>
   A synergy collision last winter singed CBS News when reporters
were spotted wearing the Nike ``swoosh'' at the Olympics, the
unfortunate outgrowth of a lucrative financial deal between CBS
Sports and Nike. At about the same time a CBS investigator was
facing delays in her article on Nike's labor practices. Although
CBS argued that the two matters were unrelated, one media ethicist
noted: ``What next? White House and Capitol Hill reporters wearing
Archer Daniels Midland lapel pins?'' More recently, Time Warner
stretched an underreported piece on nerve gas from CNN to Time
magazine _ proving that synergy can also allow several divisions to
share one company's embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   What has reignited corporate hopes about communal creativity is
the announcement of a Hollywood ``media venture'' being created for
Tina Brown. Now set to hand the editorship of The New Yorker over
to a respected journalist, David Remnick, Ms. Brown will soon enter
Disney's huge kingdom to create a kind of movie magazine. Its exact
nature is a bit unclear, but Ms. Brown says she is planning
something that will churn out movie and television ideas for her
show-biz bosses.
</P>
<P>
   She is capable of making this project a popular success, of
course, but for the writers and news consumers this deal has ``wait
and see'' written all over it. How easy it would be to shed a
little of the complexity or even the truth to make a story into a
better television sitcom. How tempting it might become to trim any
criticism of a superstar being promoted elsewhere on the Disney
family estate.
</P>
<P>
   As the media change, however, the basic rules and purpose of
journalism do not. Fiction does not fly. News and advertising
should be kept as separate as possible. A news consumer deserves to
know about conflicts of interest. And most important, journalism's
highest purpose is to try to inform the public, more than feed the
shareholders or entertain its huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   All journalistic enterprises face a difficult challenge in
applying the traditional standards of the profession to the
exploding world of electronic communication, where commerce and
journalism intersect in new ways. Readers of The Times' electronic
edition, for example, can read a book review, then activate a link
to Barnes &AMP; Noble and order that book or some other. The same
principles that have long insulated news coverage from advertiser
interests can and should be applied in these new arenas to preserve
the integrity of journalism, in this case the independence of the
book review and news coverage of book sellers.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation, points out,
the kind of synergy Ms. Brown has described cannot accurately be
referred to as journalism because it perverts the raison d'etre and
intellectual process of news gathering. In mainstream journalism,
the news article exists to provide information to the reader or
viewer. In the upside-down world of Hollywood news, the story is
created as the first step in the development of product for movies,
a form that traditionally relies more on fiction than facts.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the synergy wars say it is already at work
``accidentally,'' which is to say with a kind of natural rather
than managed momentum. A good book or magazine article can
sometimes evolve into a good movie. (More often, it seems, a good
book turns into a lousy movie and, almost always, a good movie
turns into a lousy book.) Now a new element is being introduced, an
adaptation of the forms of fact-based journalism to an industry
where nothing, including the truth, is allowed to stand in the way
of box office.
</P>
<P>
   When something that looks like journalism is manipulated in a
corporate laboratory, how long will it take before customers begin
to equate synergy not with creativity but with simple greed and the
vertical integration of news and entertainment organizations with
mediocre and even unreliable reporting?

EDITORIAL: JAPAN'S VOTER REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   Japanese governments do not normally resign after election
losses for Parliament's less important upper house. But so emphatic
was the defeat voters inflicted on the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party on Sunday that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto decided to
quit. The LDP had expected to take about 60 of the 126 seats being
contested. It won only 44.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuke was richly deserved, and Hashimoto was right to
resign. For most of its two and a half years in power, his
government made no serious effort to revive the world's
second-largest economy, and indeed made matters worse by
introducing a national sales tax. When the prime minister finally
did cut taxes earlier this year, it was too little and too late.
Japan, once the main engine of Asian prosperity, now threatens to
drag its neighbors and itself into prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's repeated urgings to reform, reflate and
clean up billions in bad bank debt, Hashimoto spent most of his
term dithering instead of leading. Like most of his predecessors,
he deferred to powerful Finance Ministry officials, who preferred
inaction to reforms that might erode their bureaucratic grip.
</P>
<P>
   Only this month, eight years after Japan's banks began
weakening, did Hashimoto announce a credible plan for weeding out
failing institutions and reinforcing the rest. Now that belated but
important initiative could be lost in the extended transition
rituals of Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP, still the majority party in the lower house, will pick
the next prime minister, spending the next week choosing among four
uninspiring candidates. The front-runner, Keizo Obuchi, is even
more colorless than Hashimoto. Two others, Kiichi Miyazawa and
Yohei Kono, have already failed in leadership roles. The remaining
contender, Seiroku Kajiyama, is a veteran insider who at least has
called for more vigorous economic action. But there is little
realistic hope of reform policies emerging from an LDP system
designed to keep things as they are.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest aspect of this election may be the emergence of
the Democratic Party, led by Naoto Kan, Japan's most popular
politician, as a potential competitor to the LDP. Kan earned his
popularity two years ago when, as health minister, he stood up to
bureaucratic resistance to resolve a scandal over HIV contamination
of the blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP has recovered from past election setbacks and has always
come back. But with Japan now facing its worst economic crisis of
the postwar era, muddling through an additional two years to the
next election is no longer an acceptable option. World financial
markets will not accept it, and Asia's other economies cannot
afford it. Now, it appears, Japan's voters have lost patience with
it as well.

ROWLAND OPENS RE-ELECTION EFFORT WITH A PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, Conn. _ Formally starting a re-election campaign that
has been under way for a year, Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut
declared on Monday that his top priority in a second term would be
helping to rebuild the decaying cores of the state's largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   That choice as a campaign centerpiece is part of a continuing
effort by Rowland, a Republican, to chart a course that he calls
``fiscally conservative and socially inclusive.'' It also reflects
the evolution of the ever-more-moderate Rowland, 41, who went to
Congress in 1985 as a brash right-winger and won the gubernatorial
race in 1994, a year of big Republican gains.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, Rowland will face a former colleague on Capitol Hill,
Rep. Barbara Kennelly, 62, a Democrat who has championed women's
and children's issues during her 16 years in Washington. Rowland
has built a wide lead in polls and has set a state record for a
governor's race by raising $4.3 million, or more than twice as much
as Mrs. Kennelly.
</P>
<P>
   Basking in the state's rebounding economy and showing a deep tan
after nine days at the beach, Rowland cut a confident and casual
figure as he led a caravan across the state for four rallies
featuring Boy Scouts, Dixieland bands and all the other patriotic
trimmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked the bad times in the eye and we've turned things
around,'' Rowland said, sporting a gold elephant in his lapel.
``More jobs, higher wages, health care for children, better
schools, safer streets.'' Pausing for applause, he said, ``I
promise you that we are just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland began running television ads nine months ago, so
Monday's rallies were hardly a surprise. But his campaign tried to
pump up supporters by sending star-spangled postcards urging:
``Don't miss out. It's the tour that makes it official.''
</P>
<P>
   He began the day under a white tent on a wharf in this mill town
in eastern Connecticut, drove 100 miles west to the office towers
in the New York suburb of Stamford, then doubled back to West
Hartford and finished the night at an amusement park near his
hometown of Waterbury, where he once worked in his family's
insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Rowland said that he would continue to try to
cut taxes, and he hailed the state's efforts to move welfare
recipients into jobs as ``tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was making the cities his top priority because
the state as a whole is in such good economic shape. ``All of our
cities are on the way back to an economic renaissance that we've
never seen before, because of our hard work,'' he said. ``But we
can do so much more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After his address in Stamford, Rowland said he wanted to follow
through on economic development plans that had been announced for
the downtown areas of Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport and
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he wanted to promote similar projects in other
cities and urban towns, but would like them to rely on local and
private money rather than state financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a combination of universities, colleges,
private investment, federal dollars in some cases, city dollars in
some cases, waterfront development,'' he said. ``So I want to kind
of stick around for a few more years to see that come to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding later to Rowland's plans, the chairman of the state
Democratic Party, Edward Marcus, pointed to Rowland's
long-abandoned promise of the last campaign, to repeal the state
income tax, and asserted that today's pledges were no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes positions as they become convenient,'' Marcus said.
``He ignored the cities and education and the environment for three
years. Now in an election year, he's for all of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland brushed off questions about whether he would commit to
serve out a second term before seeking a higher office, or whether
he might seek a third term. (Connecticut has no term limits for
governors.)
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Rowland made only the vaguest reference to Mrs.
Kennelly or the Democratic Party. But he said he would stand by his
challenge to debate Mrs. Kennelly six to eight times before
Election Day. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Kennelly said the
congresswoman wanted to participate in debates, but said it was too
soon to discuss how many.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, Mrs. Kennelly held a news conference outside a
recycling plant in New Haven to accuse Rowland of ``putting
polluters before people,'' a charge she planned to make repeatedly
through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly had expressed frustration and even defeatism at
several recent appearances, but aides said Monday that she was
upbeat. ``The state of Connecticut will be better for this race,
and I intend to win this race,'' Mrs. Kennelly said. ``I'm going to
work so hard, you won't believe it.''

THREAT TO KYL NETS HOUSE ARREST, PROBATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Angelo Schubert's letter last year to U.S. Sen. Jon
Kyl was a desperate plea for help in bringing his Filipino wife to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the 50-year-old Bullhead City man went too far. On Monday he
was sentenced to 120 days' house arrest and two years' probation
for threatening to kill the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert, a food service worker in Laughlin, Nev., wrote the
letter in December from his home in Bullhead City. He had been
married for two years to a Filipino woman but was unable to get
permission for her to immigrate to the United States, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Schubert wrote that he ``cannot take this Pain
much longer being seperated from my wife.'' He said he was
suffering from eating and sleeping disorders, a nerve condition, an
ulcer and suicidal depression.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``If my wife is not with me by Dec. 31, 12
midnight . . . I will be forced to lay down my Life for her . . .
but I will not Die alone I will take with me all those responsible
for my Suffering . . . and especially the creators of you're
Inhuman Laws . . . one life for each day of Pain!''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which also included a pledge that ``January 1998
will go down in the History of the United States,'' sparked an
investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 4, two days after Kyl's office received the letter,
Schubert was taken into custody by FBI agents from Kingman. In a
later plea agreement, prosecutors reported that a search of his
residence ``disclosed no evidence that Angelo Schubert intended to
follow through with his threat to Senator Kyl.''
</P>
<P>
   In imposing the sentence, which followed a plea agreement
between Schubert and prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll
allowed him to leave his residence ``for work and daily
necessities.'' Schubert was also ordered to perform 150 hours of
community service. &QL;

IT'S A SUMMER DOUBLEHEADER FOR BABE RUTH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
 SPORTS-NYT  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Martens, an ESPN producer, thought Mace Brown, a former
Pittsburgh Pirate, was offering him a rare treasure recently. As a
rookie pitcher in 1935, Brown witnessed Babe Ruth's last three home
runs, slugged in Forbes Field as a Boston Brave. And, Brown told
Martens, his wife had filmed the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like the Holy Grail,'' Martens said, recalling his
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Did Brown, who turned 89 in May, have the film? No, Brown said.
About 15 years ago, the film began to disintegrate. The Browns
threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Martens did get his hands on plenty of material, though, and it
will be on display next Tuesday in ``Outside the Lines: Babe Ruth's
Larger Than Life Legacy'' (ESPN, 7:30 p.m.). He had wanted to make
a documentary about Ruth for at least 10 years, since collaborating
with Ruth's daughter, Dorothy Pirone, on a book about the Babe. And
he was not the only one on the cinematic trail of the legendary
slugger. Within a month, viewers can decide if they learn more from
ESPN's work or from HBO's ``Babe Ruth'' (Aug. 16, 8 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's is not a biography but a smorgasbord of segments that
examine Ruth's role as the first superstar, his self-marketing, his
value to the memorabilia market, his impact on the language and his
unfulfilled desire to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to look at his legacy, because the shadow he still
casts is enormous,'' Martens said. His research included placing an
advertisement in Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper, to find
any veteran who heard attacking Japanese soldiers scream, ``To hell
with Babe Ruth.'' (He didn't find any.)
</P>
<P>
   Martens' discoveries included a 1946 letter Ruth wrote to Larry
MacPhail, the Yankees' general manager, begging to manage the team;
an unpublished memoir written by Emil Fuchs, the owner of the
Boston Braves, for whom Ruth was briefly a player-assistant
manager; and an agent's itemized list of Ruth's endorsements, which
totaled nearly $500,000 over 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among those ESPN interviewed were Paul Hopkins, now 93, who
surrendered Ruth's 59th home run in 1927. ``I threw my best pitch,
a sinkerball,'' Hopkins said. ``He hit it over the fence. Gone.
Gone. Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's work is a linear one, like its Joe DiMaggio film of last
year. ``It's character analysis, biography, at times a fun-loving
piece,'' said Ross Greenburg, executive producer of HBO Sports. It
also has home movies, an HBO hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``A major portion of the film will be a learning experience,''
Greenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Martens set a similar standard. ``I've been through the Ruth
legend so many times that I wanted Robert Creamer to learn
something,'' he said, referring to the best of Ruth's biographers,
``and for the sports nut to learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER DEFICIENCIES: ABC's Bob Ley and Seamus Malin achieved
mediocrity on Sunday with their call of France's 3-0 victory over
Brazil to win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Malin provided better analysis than usual, even calling Brazil's
corner kick defense ``criminally deficient.'' In a crucial
oversight, he never explained how France, which was shorthanded for
the final 22 minutes of the second half, could play as if it did
not matter, and even score a third goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ley narrated more touches and sounded occasionally excited. But
still, his was not a riveting, consistently strong call. In a key
oversight, he did not offer a goal-scoring call when Emmanuel Petit
made the score 3-0. If you don't make goal calls _ Ley did the same
when Iran beat the United States _ you're not doing your job.

   In overnight Nielsen ratings, the France-Brazil game produced a
6.9 on ABC, or 4 million households, down from a 12.8 for the final
in 1994. On Spanish-language Univision, the game scored a 22.2
rating and lured 1.7 million Hispanic households in the United
States. In New York, the game rated a 4.9 on Channel 41, its
highest-rated daytime program ever.

   UNSEEN HOME RUN: What happened to Mark McGwire's game-winning
home run on Saturday? From 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Fox-owned Channel 5,
New York viewers saw the Red Sox-Orioles game, intercut smartly
with McGwire's at-bats from the Cardinals-Astros game. When the
Boston-Baltimore game ended early, Fox switched for 15 minutes of
the St. Louis game. But at 4 p.m., viewers of Channel 5 were
shifted to ``Police Academy.'' About 20 minutes later, McGwire won
the game. Did you see it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have station obligations, so unless the game assigned to
the market goes past 4 o'clock, we go to local programming,'' said
Lou D'Ermilio, a Fox spokesman. Why not make an exception to the
rule because of the home run race?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anticipation of home run 38 is not the same as anticipation of
No. 58,'' he said. Would Fox have done differently if the game were
played on Sept. 11? ``It's too early to tell,'' he said.

   DISNEY-FOX DETENTE: Walt Disney Co. has backed down from plans
to launch ESPN West, a regional sports channel that would have
carried the cable TV games of its Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks.
A new 10-year agreement will keep Angels games on Fox Sports West
and Ducks games on Fox Sports West 2, outlets in Rupert Murdoch's
vast regional sports empire. Disney and Fox had battled over the TV
rights in court, but those suits were ended by the new deal. Tim
Mead, a spokesman for Disney's teams, said: ``There was a need for
immediacy. ESPN West would have had to be grown into. The
powers-that-be felt this was prudent.'' And no doubt lucrative.

TENNECO SAID TO HALT TALKS ON ITT UNIT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Tenneco Inc., a leading maker of car mufflers and shock
absorbers, has halted talks to buy the European brakes division of
ITT Industries Inc., a person close to the company said late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other bidders, including the German tire maker Continental
AG and Ford Motor Co.'s Visteon Automotive Systems, are still
interested in the concern and may make an announcement sometime
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Tenneco's board met to discuss the
acquisition of ITT Automotive Europe, which is based in Frankfurt,
Germany. But after the meeting ended, ``the deal was dead,'' the
person close to the company said. Tenneco had been expected to make
an announcement early Tuesday that it was aquiring the division for
around $2 billion, this person said. Several people close to the
companies who were reached for comment expressed surprise that the
transaction was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deal with ITT,'' Barbara Posner, the vice
president of communications for Tenneco, said last night. ``We are
not acquiring their brake and chassis unit as rumored.'' She
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the companies had been in talks for more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ITT Industries, based in White Plains, N.Y., designs and
manufactures automobile products, including brake and chassis
systems and electronics for the military market. The European
automotive division has been on the auction block since March. It
is estimated that the division employs 16,700 people and has annual
sales of about $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, several companies were said to be interested in
buying all or part of the European operations, including Delphi
Automotive Systems, Visteon Automotive Systems, Siemens AG and
Tenneco. Several companies took plant tours to inspect the
operations then.
</P>
<P>
   The unit would have been a significant addition to Tenneco's
automotive line. Tenneco entered the auto parts business with the
acquisition of Walker Manufacturing, a muffler maker, in 1967. The
Tenneco Automotive division, which is based in Lake Forest, Ill.,
had 1997 sales of $3.2 billion. It not only sells mufflers, but
Monroe brand shock absorbers, too.

GEORGE DUNNE, PROMINENT JESUIT, DIES AT 92 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. George H. Dunne, a Jesuit priest who was an impassioned
critic of racial segregation and prominent in ecumenical efforts to
combat poverty and foster peace, died on June 3 in a hospital in
Los Gatos, Calif., outside San Jose, near the Jesuit retirement
community where he had been living. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne was also a student of Chinese theology and language, a
playwright and an author. But he was best known for his criticism
in the 1940s of racial segregation, particularly in Roman Catholic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was basically a prophetic voice for social justice long
before his time,'' said the Rev. Paul Locatelli, president of Santa
Clara University, a Jesuit institution in Santa Clara, Calif. ``He
talked about racism back in the 1940s. He predicted in 1933 that if
we did not develop democratic leaders in China, it would fall to
the Communists within 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunne made that prediction after spending a year as a missionary
in China.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after receiving a doctorate in international relations in
1944 from the University of Chicago, he went to work at the
Institute of Social Order, a new program at St. Louis University,
another Jesuit institution, that was meant to respond to social
problems and increase Jesuits' awareness of them.
</P>
<P>
   But as things turned out, he was transferred to California after
strongly expressing his opposition to racial discrimination at the
university. In 1946, in an article published in the influential
Catholic lay magazine Commonweal, he branded segregation a sin. (He
was later called one of the first prominent Roman Catholics to have
done so.) In that article, he contended, among other things, that
segregation constituted a breach of justice.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier he had written a play, ``Trial by Fire,'' that
described the bombing of a black family that had moved into a Los
Angeles neighborhood restricted to whites. The play was performed
in 1947 and 1948 in Los Angeles and Chicago and at the Blackfriars
Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne spent much time and energy combating prejudice: writing
articles, making speeches and taking part in numerous civil rights
demonstrations, including several led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, Pope Paul VI and the Rev. Eugene Carson Blake, the
general secretary of the World Council of Churches, named him the
first director of the Committee on Society, Development and Peace,
an ecumenical group based in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne wrote later in ``The King's Pawn: The Memoirs of George
Dunne, S.J.'' (Loyola Press, 1990) that the committee's ``stated
purpose was to focus attention upon the problems of poverty,
especially in the third world, and upon the imperatives of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the churches,'' he added, ``it proposed to quicken the
consciences first of Christians, and then of all men and women, to
their moral responsibility to concern themselves with the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other members of the committee traveled widely and held
conferences in Lebanon, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere. At a
conference in 1968 in the mountains above Beirut, participants
blamed a lack of political will, among rich and poor nations alike,
for inadequate economic growth in most emerging nations.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Paul VI sent a special blessing to that gathering, and
messages from him and leaders of the World Council of Churches
emphasized the importance of joint Christian action in the sphere
of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   After four years as director of the committee, Dunne retired
from the post. The panel expired not long afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne's chief literary work was ``Generation of Giants'' (1962),
about Matteo Ricci and other Jesuit missionaries who worked in
China during the Ming and Manchu dynasties. His view was that those
missionaries' lives had provided a lesson for the present day by
adapting Christianity and humanism to the culture of China and not
imposing Western ways on the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of the American humorist and journalist Finley Peter
Dunne and the author Dominick Dunne, Dunne was born in St. Louis,
grew up in Los Angeles and studied at various institutions,
receiving a bachelor's degree from Loyola College in Los Angeles
and a master's from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, his activities included teaching at Loyola and
at Santa Clara and serving as the president's assistant for
international programs at Geogetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne is survived by six nieces and two nephews.
