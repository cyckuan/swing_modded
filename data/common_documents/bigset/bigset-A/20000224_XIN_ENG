<HEADLINE> Fears of Instability Overstated: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian official said
here Wednesday that investors' fears of his country's instability
are overstated.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie made the remarks while delivering an
address at the Third Annual Presidents Forum which opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience of some 200 business leaders from
Southeast Asia, Gie said the chaotic days of May 1998 have made
many investors have second thoughts about whether it is sensible
to invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that fears over instability today are overstated for
a number of reasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
First, Gie said, in the past two years there has been a sea
change in the politics of governance in the country, which has
created a democratic dialogue that continues to this day in a
social climate that is remarkably calm.
</P>
<P>
He said the relatively peaceful elections last June and the
smooth election of the new president and vice president have given
the people hope for a new and more prosperous era under the
guidance of the new government.
</P>
<P>
The improving state of the Indonesian economy despite
pessimistic projections made by observers in mid-1998, he said, is
the second reason that fears of instability are overstated.
</P>
<P>
Since the election of the new government, the Indonesian rupiah
has stabilized which in turn has brought about positive impacts on
the economy such as a low inflation of 2 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) has increased substantially since
the fourth quarter of 1998, with the GDP in the fourth quarter of
1999 5.7 percent higher than the same period in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, a recovery in exports is emerging with non-
oil exports from August to December 1999 5.5 percent higher than
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Having laid the foundation of macroeconomic stability,Gie said,
the Indonesian government is now working to address the other
major issues facing the economy, especially in the area of bank
recapitalization and corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his speech, the minister called on foreign
investors to go to Indonesia and take part in the recovery which
has begun there as the latest economic data suggest.
</P>
<P>
The Presidents Forum is organized by the Business Week to
examine the best business practices that will allow companies to
embark on growth strategies as the region begins its recovery
process.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Nepal's Entry to WTO to Begin in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Formal talks on accession of
Nepal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will begin in May this
year, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will complete all formalities for membership within five
to six months, Commerce Minister Ram Krishna Tamrakar said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that it will not be long before
Nepal is granted the accession.
</P>
<P>
Following the stalemate over trade and transit agreements
between Nepal and India at the end of the 1980s, Nepal began
seeking membership in the General Agreement of Trade and Tariff,
which was later transformed into the WTO. With accession to the
WTO, landlocked Nepal can be guaranteed transit facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom, which adopted a market-oriented liberal
economic policy in the early 1990s, has been taking part in WTO
meetings as an observer since the organization's inception.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Urges Russia to Restore Power Supply to Its Western Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister R.
Amarjargal has requested Russia to immediately restore power
supply to his country's three western provinces.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Russian Acting President and Prime Minister V.
Putin, Amarjargal emphasized that the Mongolian side should not be
blamed for the sudden interruption of power supply to the three
provinces that import energy from Russia, because Mongolia has
already forwarded the payment for the power supply.
</P>
<P>
The interruption was caused by problems in relations between
two Russian organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Amarjargal also said that the power cut in the three provinces
since February 16 has caused tremendous difficulties to residents,
heating systems, hospitals, schools and other organizations there.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister mentioned in the letter that the Mongolian
Energy Board has been negotiating with relevant Russian
organizations to conclude new agreements on power supply.
</P>
<P>
However, under Russian law, the agreements would not come into
force until two to three weeks after their conclusion, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tom.com Mania Through Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Internet frenzy whirled
around Hong Kong with tens of thousands of people queuing up
outside of bank branches Wednesday to submit application forms for
shares in the Internet company -- tom.com, which is due to be
listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) here on March 1.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming response to tom.com Ltd. caused chaos at
several of the 10 HSBC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
Limited) branches charged with dealing with the initial public
offering (IPO) and extra policemen had to be deployed to maintain
order.
</P>
<P>
The lobby of the HSBC headquarters at Central was jammed with
people while about 20,000 people lined up outside the branch at
Kwun Tong and 50,000 people waited at the branch in Mong Kok.
</P>
<P>
Bank staff used bags to collect the forms after the boxes
provided were filled up.
</P>
<P>
The noon deadline for submitting the application forms was
finally extended by nearly two hours to clear the backlog.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the IPO for tom.com, which is 57 percent
owned by Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., both
controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, could be over-
subscribed for up to 2,000 times.
</P>
<P>
A total of 42.8 million shares at 1.78 Hong Kong dollars, one-
tenth of the total shares issued, have been offered to the public
with almost 1.5 million application forms distributed, equivalent
to one out of every four Hong Kong people snapping up one form.
</P>
<P>
The shares of the Internet content provider are expected to
soar to between 5 and 10 HK dollars when they make their debut on
the GEM, Hong Kong's equivalent of the U.S. Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
Tom.com plans to raise approximately 630 million to 760 million
HK dollars (80.8 million to 97.4 million U.S. dollars) through the
issue.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Hong Kong.com, the Hong Kong unit of
China.com, plans to raise about 832 million HK dollars (106.7
million U.S. dollars) by issuing 640 million shares at a price of
between 1 and 1.3 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of the shares of Hong Kong.com, due to be listed on
the GEM on March 14, will expire on March 7.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that there was high risk in investment and
advised investors to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
"A highly over-subscribed initial public offering is often
followed by a shocking diminution of shareholder value and a very
weak share price," said Stephen Vines, a financial analyst.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Financial Services Rafael Hui Si-yan of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region has warned Internet and
technology firms, in particular, that the companies which provide
false information on the stock market would be severely penalized.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Increasing in South Asia: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Narcotic
Control Board of the United Nations warned Wednesday that drug
abuse has been on the rise in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The board, in a report launched across the world Wednesday,
said, "There seems to be millions of drugs abusers in the region."
</P>
<P>
While cannabis and opium have traditionally been the main drugs
of the abuse, the abuse of heroin and synthetic drugs is rapidly
increasing, it said.
</P>
<P>
The number is particularly high along the main trafficking
routes and in major drug trafficking areas such as the
southwestern border area of Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing abuse of heroin by injection and
sharing of needles, the number of HIV-AIDS cases is rising in most
countries in South Asia, though the preferred mode of
administering heroin continues to be inhalation, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of proximity of South Asia to the world's two main
opiate-producing countries Afghanistan and Myanmar, drug
trafficking and drug abuse in the region have been mainly transit-
related, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 75 percent of the world production of opium takes
place in Afghanistan with cultivation spreading to new areas, the
report noted, saying that in 1999 production reached a record
level of 4,600 tons.
</P>
<P>
The report said a large quantity of heroin has been smuggled
out of Afghanistan and out of Myanmar and into countries in South
Asia, mainly to be shipped further to illicit markets in Europe
and North America, but also to be abused locally.
</P>
<P>
It said the supply of illicit opiate from Southwest Asia
continues and may increase as a result of record opium harvest in
Afghanistan. Trafficking in raw opium and heroin from northwestern
Myanmar has been on the rise for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The illicit cultivation of opium poppy and the production of
opiates are also taking place in various parts of India and Nepal,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board noted with satisfaction that a number of
countries in South Asia are devoting increased attention to the
prevention of the drug abuse and the treatment and rehabilitation
of drug addicts and to the involvement of non-governmental
organizations in those activities.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Company to Create 10,000 Jobs in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Leading beverage company
Coca-Cola Wednesday said it would reinvest gains from the South
African government's introduction of excise duty reduction to
create about 10,000 new jobs in the country during the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, South African Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel announced a reduction in excise tax on soft drinks and
mineral waters by one-third, from 12 cents a litre to eight cents
a litre.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Southern Africa president Doug Jackson applauded the
move.
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited about the excise tax reduction, and we
plan to leverage the uniqueness of the Coca-Cola system to create
thousands of retail outlets which will stimulate and sustain
approximately 10,000 new jobs," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson, the details of the proposed job creation
program will be finalized over the next month by the managing
boards of Coca-Cola's five South African bottlers: Amalgamated
Beverage Industries, Coca-Cola SABCO, Fortune Beverages, TJC
Holdings and Peninsula Beverages.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the majority of these new jobs will be
generated from Coca-Cola's micro-enterprise retail sector.
</P>
<P>
This sector currently accounts for 50 percent of the 180,000
jobs directly attributable to the Coca-Cola system in South
Africa, Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Budget Welcomed by Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South African political
parties Wednesday reacted favorably to the government's budget
plans on poverty relief, infrastructure and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi described
the budget unveiled by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in
parliament earlier Wednesday as "a budget of hope" which would
address equity, redress taxes and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
"I am very hopeful that we are on our way to where our country
should be economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, the government will slash personal
income tax and increase spending on education, poverty relief and
job creation in 2000/ 2001.
</P>
<P>
South African Communist Party Chairman Jeremy Cronin said he
was "very pleased" with the budget, particularly with the capital
growth and tax relief.
</P>
<P>
Cronin, however, said that while the budget favored job
creation, "the levels might be a bit restrictive and unrealistic",
and might counter the good intentions that the government had.
</P>
<P>
According to Chairman of the United Democratic Movement Sipo
Mzimela, if the tax cuts encourage people to save more, "then we
have a good policy that can lead to sound job creation".
</P>
<P>
Federal Alliance leader Louis Luyt described the budget as "an
excellent" one which should attract investors.

<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Brian Cowen, Irish Foreign
Minister, expressed confidence Thursday that the difficulties
facing the peace process in Northern Ireland would be overcome,
according to a report from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"What is now essential, and what the government is seeking
actively to do in tandem with the British government ... is to
build on the critical progress,"Cowen said in a speech to the
upper house of the Irish parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It is another sign of the new maturity in Anglo-Irish
relations that we have been able to do so quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cowen said he believed the current crisis in the peace process
would be overcome. "Quite simply, we are not going to let this go,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
UK's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson also remained
hopeful politicians in the province would be able to find a way
through the current difficulties without outside help.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the U.S. national security advisor,Sandy
Berger Thursday in Washington, Mandelson said :"Bear in mind that
what is suspended is simply on hold. Nothing has been destroyed,
nothing annulled."
</P>
<P>
"It will be as quick and simple to reactivate the executive and
institutions as it was to put them on hold,as long as we can get
people talking again and getting some renewed agreement on how we
can take forward all parts of the Good Friday Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told the
BBC Thursday he believed the prospect for persuading the armed
groups to get back into contact with the decommissioning body was
"zero" unless the institutions were re-established.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Deviates From Targets: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) team said here on Thursday that it noted large deviations by
the Zimbabwean government from programed targets in the budgetary
and monetary areas.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Assistant Director in the African Department
Paulo Neuhaus, said in a statement that the deviation had resulted
in inflation souring to about 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The mission advised the authorities to take steps to
strengthen significantly fiscal and monetary policies and to
restore equilibrium in the exchange market," statement said.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Harare, the team had held talks with
Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa, Reserve Bank Governor
Leonard Tsumba and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
The team said there is need for the Zimbabwean government to
control budgetary expenditures by adhering to the Public Finance
Management System, which was established to control the
government's commitments and cash spending.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the Zimbabwean government and the IMF was
one of a series of negotiations to secure support funds to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has been urging the Zimbabwean government to show
positive moves to comply with its demands which include cutting
down on government spending.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean government has been accusing the IMF of
having a hidden agenda, failing to appreciate some changes it has
made.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy is currently plagued by an inflation of
about 57 percent, an interest rate above 55 percent and shortages
of essentials such as foreign currency and fuel.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Launches Strategy Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC),
the country's top anti-AIDS coordinating body, on Thursday
launched a five-year national strategy in a bid to further cut
infection rate and eventually eliminate the killer disease from
its land.
</P>
<P>
The 69-page report, named The National Strategic Framework for
HIV/AIDS Activities in Uganda 2000-2005, is published and being
discussed at a two- day workshop by experts, officials and
representatives from U.N. agencies in Entebbe, near the capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The framework is aimed at reducing HIV infection rate by 25
percent by the year 2005, mitigating the health and socio-economic
effects of HIV/ AIDS at the individual, household and community
levels as well as strengthening the national capacity to respond
to the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
UAC Director Kihumuro Apuuli said in the opening remarks that
Uganda's current HIV infection rate of 10 percent, though much
lower than that of over 25 percent a few years ago, is still
unacceptably high.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is hindering social and economic development of the
country by destroying its most productive labor force. People aged
15-49, the most sexually active age group and the bulk of the
labor force, are having the highest rate of infection, he added.
</P>
<P>
The framework recommends some key priority areas in the years
to come, including strengthening of implementation and
coordination, intensifying monitoring and evaluating efforts and
information sharing. A more harmonized, coordinated fight against
the epidemic is crucial to the final elimination of the disease,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since the first case of AIDS was reported in the country in
1982, more than 500,000 people have died of it and a total of 1.9
million children have become AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
UAC has achieved commendable results since its establishment in
1992, with Uganda being the only African country where the HIV
infection rate is steadily declining.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Shift Debt Relief to Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jubilee 2000-Zambia on Thursday
called on the government to create a mechanism to assure that
resources that become available because of debt relief are
directed toward poverty reduction program.
</P>
<P>
Jubilee 2000-Zambia, part of a worldwide campaign for the total
 cancellation of the debt of poor countries, made the appeal in a
statement released after a meeting in the capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's total external debt stands at approximately 6.5
billion U.S. dollars now, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Zambia has been paying debt service of
approximately 200 million dollars annually. This figure is
substantially higher than total social sector spending in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 70 to 80 percent of Zambians live in poverty while
the country continues to pay enormous sums for debt servicing.
</P>
<P>
It now appears that Zambia will soon be receiving some
significant debt relief, both from multi-lateral and bilateral
creditors.
</P>
<P>
But the most serious question being raised both by lender
institutions and nations and by citizens in Zambia is whether the
new resources to be made available will go to effective poverty
eradication programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will now be made to put the proposal into the public
forum for further discussion and eventual implementation, so that
debt relief for Zambia will soon mean realistic steps toward
poverty eradication, it says.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Revise Budget due to Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi on Thursday said that the catastrophic flooding in
southern and central Mozambique has forced the government to
revise this year's plan and budget.
</P>
<P>
"We have to divert resources that were originally planned to
allocate to other areas", Mocumbi said. "The government's plans
for this year will be affected".
</P>
<P>
In particular, money earmarked for secondary and tertiary
roads might now have to be spent on repairing the trunk road
network, and particularly the main north-south highway, washed
away by the floods in several places.
</P>
<P>
The flood has not affected this year's harvest, Mocumbi said.
The most fertile parts of the country are in the northern
provinces, they have not suffered from flooding and are expected
to produce a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
In the south "we can still recover" only if there was immediate
 replanting once the flood waters subsided, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's top priorities, he said, remained humanitarian
 assistance for the flood victims, and reopening access roads into
the affected areas, so that relief goods could be taken in by road
rather than by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"All humanitarian assistance to Gaza and to part of Maputo
Province is now being undertaken by air," he said. "That's very
expensive and not very efficient."
</P>
<P>
"The quicker we can reopen the roads, the quicker we can end
the emergency," Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
The government had given a figure of 70 known deaths, when it
launched its appeal on Wednesday for 65.5 million dollars in
emergency aid, "but I think this is an underestimate", said
Mocumbi.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean forces have
killed and wounded 200 Ethiopian soldiers, and captured four in
addition to seizing many arms in fresh border conflict after
nine-month lull, the Eritrean News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia launched an attack at dawn Wednesday on the Burie
frontline 70 kilometers west of Assab in southern Eritrea. One
Ethiopian brigade was deployed against Eritrean positions but was
beaten back with heavy causalities, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Ethiopian offensive came as U.S. envoy
Anthony Lake and the envoy of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), Almed Ouyahia, are shuttling between the two Horn of Africa
neighbors to push for the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Last year during the visits of U.N. envoy Mohammed Sahnoun,
Ethiopia launched similar attacks on Eritrean positions, the
agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean presidential aide Yemane Ghebremeskel told the agency
that "the Ethiopia has stuck to its pattern of attacking whenever
a peace envoy comes to the region".
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the Ethiopian government wants to extract more
concessions from the peace process by creating this sense of
panic and urgency whenever someone travels to the region," Yemane
added.
</P>
<P>
So far, Eritrea has accepted the OAU peace package while
Ethiopia has objected to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia started war over border dispute in May
1998. Since then tens of thousands of soldiers from both sides
have died in conflicts.

<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has declared a state
of disaster in the three provinces of Manicaland, Masvingo and
Matabeleland South following the catastrophic effects of cyclone
Eline.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has risen to five and the damage caused is
estimated at millions of U.S. dollars, Local Government and
National Housing Minister John Nkomo told a news conference on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that an international appeal for aid has been launched
for the thousands of people left homeless and without food.
</P>
<P>
"Local resources have been channeled to affected areas, but
these are inadequate to bring the situation to normalcy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the damage caused by the effects of the cyclone, now
downgraded to a depression, has amounted to millions of U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is a member of Civil Protection International and
therefore qualified to approach individual countries for help, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working on the necessary paperwork to
put through a formal appeal for aid to the United Nations
agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We have to proceed via a declaration of disaster and then we
will be contacting the U.N. agencies because they need information
on the exact areas that are affected," he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250,000 people were said to have been rendered
homeless and would need food, temporary shelter, blankets and
water purifying aids.
</P>
<P>
"We are fearful about cholera and malaria and the people are
also exposed to snake attacks because the snakes have also moved
to high ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some government officials would on Friday make an
aerial assessment of the damage that saw homes and granaries
being washed away.
</P>
<P>
The storms and floods wreaked havoc on infrastructure such as
roads, bridges, telecommunications and power lines, cutting off
communication links between the affected areas and command posts.

NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The north-eastern region of
Rwanda is expected to face severe drought in the next three months
from March to May, Rwanda News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The drought is predicted to be caused by the persistent
off-shore westerlies that blow off Rwanda's north-eastern region

According to a special statement from the meteorological
department of the country, the rains expected in those areas will
be below average over the past 30 years.
</P>

Didace warned that unless farmers plant early and plant drought
 resistant plants, they may face even more severe conditions in

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Mugabe Under Pressure of Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- John Nkomo, chairman of the
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf),
Thursday denied reports that there is mounting pressure within the
party on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to quit.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo told the Zimbabwe News Agency if the party wanted Mugabe
to resign, the issue would have been discussed at the Zanu-pf
national congress held in December last year, not two months after
his re-election as party President and First Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"If the party had wanted the president to resign, the congress
was the opportunity to take it up. It is not true that people said
Mugabe must go, " he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the issue was raised in a discussion at the
recent extraordinary meeting of the party's central committee
called after last weekend's referendum which rejected the
government backed draft constitution.

<HEADLINE> Detained Kurdish Mayors Arraigned in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The three Kurdish mayors from a
pro-Kurdish party, taken into custody five days ago, were arraigned
early Thursday, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They were interrogated for nearly 11 hours at the Diyarbakir
State Security Court (DGM) in the day and then transferred to the
DGM Alternate Judgeship.
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for their trial.
</P>
<P>
The three defendants were detained on charges of aiding and
abetting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which had
been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The DGM will request jail terms of two to four and a half years
for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Rule Regional Governorship (OHAL), in charge of
security and stability affairs in Turkey's restive Kurds-populated
southeast, detained Feridun Celik, mayor of Turkey's biggest
Kurdish city Diyarbakir, Feyzullah Karaaslan of Bingol and Selim
Ozalp of Siirt on Saturday on charges of colluding with PKK.
</P>
<P>
The three are from the People's Democratic Party (HADEP), the
only legal pro-Kurdish party in Turkey which is already at the risk
of being banned for its alleged links with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
They were detained shortly after meeting with European officials
during which Kurdish rights were discussed.
</P>
<P>
The OHAL accused that the three mayors gave secret support for
PKK, attended meetings of the terrorist group, got instruction from
PKK and transferred some of their financial sources to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of detente by Ocalan from jail, the PKK
has announced to lay down arms and withdraw from Turkey. But the
Turkish government dismissed the PKK announcement as a plot.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Turkish court sentenced 18 members of
HADEP, including its current and former presidents, to more than
three years' imprisonment for staging a hunger strike in support of
the doomed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.

<HEADLINE> No U.S. Pressure to Raise Oil Output: Kuwaiti Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh
Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said Thursday that Kuwait and other oil
producing countries were not under U.S. pressure to increase output
to cool off soaring oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Saud said at a press conference with visiting U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson that the U.S. official has come to hold
talks on the situation in the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
"There was no direct or indirect pressure from Washington on
Kuwait," Saud said.
</P>
<P>
On a question about Kuwait's policy on oil production, the
official said this is not a Kuwaiti concern but is relevant to the
general policy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Any output changes would be decided during the OPEC meeting by
the end of next month, Saud added.
</P>
<P>
The one-year output squeeze agreement reached by OPEC members
last March expires in March this year. OPEC ministers will meet in
Vienna on March 27 to decide whether or not to release more
supplies to replenish dwindling fuel stockpiles and bring down the
high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The prices for benchmark North Sea Brent crude have recently
surged to a nine-year high of nearly 29 U.S. dollars a barrel
before standing firmly above the 26-dollar level.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Richardson, who arrived here earlier in the day on
a regional tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, said the
reason behind his trip is to explain the U.S. point of view over
the oil prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. holds that oil price should be subject to
supply and demand in order not to hurt the global economy. U.S.
officials, including President Bill Clinton, have expressed concern
over the high oil price, fearing it may lead to world-wide
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Oil business sources said in earlier press reports that
Richardson's visit to the two U.S. allies in the oil-rich Gulf was
aimed at gathering support from oil producing countries to loose
their output curbs to balance the market.
</P>
<P>
Richardson had said that he did not want to release the U.S.
strategic crude reserves on to the world market, but that oil
prices at 30 dollars a barrel were too high.

<HEADLINE> Canada Expected to Have 600,000 Millionaires in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada has more than 300,000
millionaires today and the figure could double within five years,
the Ottawa Citizen reported Thursday,citing Toronto-based
professional services firm Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
This group of millionaires were folks with neither high incomes
nor super-successful businesses.
</P>
<P>
"These were just people who had accumulated financial assets
over 30 or 40 years on fairly modest incomes," Sherry Cooper, a
chief economist with the firm, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"You can't accumulate wealth unless you save money. The rate
of return on your investment is secondary to your ability to
accumulate capital," she said, adding "Studies have shown that the
self-made millionaires are generally those that are regularly
frugal."
</P>
<P>
Every few years, Ernst &AMP; Young publishes a report for its
financial institution clients on Canada's high-net-worth market,
using figures compiled from income-tax return information provided
by Revenue Canada.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the firm reported some 225,000 Canadians
with liquid assets totalling 1 million Canadian dollars or more.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Fall in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods dropped in January, the first
decline since October, as the steep decline in orders for
electronic and other electrical equipment totally offset the
increase in orders for industrial machinery and primary metals,
the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least
three years, dropped by 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 214.8
billion U.S. dollars last month. That followed a revised 6.3
percent advance in December, the biggest gain in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Still, economists, who were predicting a decrease, have
cautioned that a drop in durable-goods orders shouldn't be viewed
as weakness in the industrial sector. Economists said the
underlying trend in orders remains firm and they expect
manufacturers to perform well this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall orders in January were 6.5 percent higher than the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
June, totaling a full percentage point. Even though those actions
made borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, the
higher rates still haven't had much impact in terms of
significantly slowing the economy. Given that, many economists
widely expect the central bank to raise rates again March 21.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment including
semiconductors, circuit boards, telecommunications equipment and
home appliances, fell by 13.2 percent last month, the largest
decrease since July 1997. In December, these orders rose by 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
And, transportation equipment orders fell by 3.6 percent in
January. Decreases in shipbuilding, tanks, airplanes and aircraft
parts more than offset increases in orders for cars and railroad
equipment. In December, transportation orders rose by a huge 23.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Transportation often is volatile from month to month because it
includes such big purchases as airplanes. Excluding transportation,
overall orders fell last month by 0.5 percent, the first decline
since October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools, jumped by 12.3 percent last month, the
strongest pace since February 1985. Such orders fell by 2.5
percent in December. Orders for primary metals, the category that
includes steel, increased by 1.7 percent in January, following a 0.
5 percent decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket goods, a good signal of current demand,
grew by a solid 2.8 percent, marking the eighth increase in the
last nine months.

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday it has cleared emergency aid worth one million euros (
about one million U.S. dollars) for victims of floods in
Mozambique and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The aid will enable the Spanish Red Cross, German Red Cross and
Doctors without Borders-Luxemborg to carry out emergency relief
operations over the next six months, the European Union Executive
said.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa has been struck by heavy rains, resulting in
widespread flooding. Mozambique and south-eastern Botswana have
been particularly badly hit. About 200,000 people have been
affected in Mozambique, and some 25,000 in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
This funding will cover the supply of materials for temporary
shelter, food distribution, basic health care and some preventive
measures to curb epidemics.

<HEADLINE> Guteeres: Giving in to Haider Suicide for E.U </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said Thursday that Far-right Austrian Freedom
Party leader Joerg Haider is an enemy of Europe and giving in to
him is the best way for the European Union to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German Sueddeutsche Zeitung,Guterres
said,"He who tries to profit from the problems of our society is
our enemy." From January 1, 2000 Portugal took over the rotating
European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was referring to Haider, Guterres said,"This is a
much more general problem. Haider is just the tip of an iceberg,"
</P>
<P>
Guterres supports the decision of 14 European Union (E.U.)
states to boycott Austria following establishment of a coalition
in Vienna with the Freedom Party of Haider under Chancellor
Wolfgang Schuessel's conservatives earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France and Belgium all supported the EU sanctions on
Austria.
</P>
<P>
50-year-old Joerg Haider founded the Austrian Freedom Party
which is based mainly on anti-foreigner sentiments. Haider's
father once served for Nazi's regime during the Second World War.
Six members of Haider's party joined in the Austrian coalition on
February 4.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a European society in which racism and other
things go against the spirit of the enlightment. Giving in to this
is the best way to committing suicide," Guterres added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prison Blood Reported Unsafe for Use in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Health Canada blames U.S.
authorities for use of prison blood infected with both HIV and
hepatitis C, the Canadian Press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official response was written in a Health Department memo
obtained under Access-to-Information legislation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of these blood products in Canada can be attributed to
a failure by U.S. blood and regulatory authorities to inform a
Canadian blood broker that blood collected at prisons was no
longer safe and as a result was no longer being used in the U.S.,"
the memo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,000 Canadian hemophiliacs were exposed to blood
products manufactured from plasma collected through U.S. prisons.
Many of the Canadian users have died, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Canadian hemophiliacs launched a lawsuit of 5
billion U.S. dollars against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for negligence despite evidence that prisons are rife with
infection-drug use and high-risk sex, the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed in WTO Ruling Against U.S. Trade Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
on Thursday expressed its disappointments in the decision by the
Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which ruled
that a U.S. tax scheme affecting hundreds of billions of dollars
in industrial and agricultural exports violated global free trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
The three-member Appellate Body upheld a dispute panel ruling
of last October and agreed with the European Union that the
Foreign Sales Corporations (FSC) provisions of U.S. tax law
constituted a "prohibited exports subsidy."
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel recommended that the United States amend the
illegal system to bring it into line with WTO regulations
governing international trade.
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed that the WTO Appellate Body has upheld the
panel's ruling," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said. "The
FSC rules are widely viewed as creating a level playing field with
European tax systems and are important to our business community."
</P>
<P>
Summers said the U.S. government will work closely with the
Europeans, the business community and the Congress to achieve a
constructive solution.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly disagree with the appellate body's ruling," U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said. "Our view remains
that the FSC is completely consistent with U.S.-WTO obligations."
</P>
<P>
The FSC program enables U.S. makers of computer software,
chemicals, machinery and many other products to shield some export
income from taxes. The tax breaks for companies such as Microsoft,
Boeing and General Motors would be worth more than 15 billion U.S.
dollars over the next five years, according to congressional
estimates.
</P>
<P>
The European Union puts the five-year price tag at 17.5 billion
dollars; the Clinton administration estimates 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program was created in 1984 to offset tax rebates European
companies get when they sell products outside the EU. It permits U.
S. companies to avoid certain income taxes by setting up export
subsidiaries on offshore tax havens such as the U.S. Virgin
Islands, Barbados and Guam.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans, on the other hand, contend the program has
reached beyond its original limits, particularly in 1997 when it
was extended to U.S. computer software-makers such as Microsoft.

LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's personal approval rating has fallen to its lowest level
since the 1997 election, according to the latest MORI poll for The
Times.
</P>
<P>
The poll comes after the forced resignation of his friend Alun
Michael as Welsh First Secretary and the row over the choice of
Frank Dobson as Labor's candidate for London mayor.
</P>
<P>
The MORI poll also shows another drop in the Government's
ratings, with 53 percent of people dissatisfied with its
performance and only 35 percent satisfied.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing discontent with the Prime Minister and the
Government has still failed to make a dent in people's voting
intentions with Labor maintaining its commanding lead over the
Tories.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of people say they would back labor in an
election. The Tories are down one point on 29 percent, and Liberal
Democrats remain unchanged on 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap At 10-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain suffered its worst
trade deficit for a decade last year as imports surged and the
strong pound started to hurt exporters, according to the latest
figures released by the Office of National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
With imports rising strongly across the board the trade gap in
goods and services almost doubled to 15.5 billion pounds in 1999 -
the second worst performance since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Only Britain's services and the recovery in the global oil
price prevented the figures from being even worse -with trade in
goods alone showing a record 26.3 billion pounds shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Higher trade deficits are usually regarded as an early warning
of inflationary pressure building up in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that domestic demand was boosting
imports while exporters faced being squeezed out of overseas
markets by the strong exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
They also expect that the Bank of England will consider selling
sterling and buying foreign currency in an attempt to weaken the
pound.

LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A record number of patients are

Between 1998 and 1999 cancellations increased by 12 percent to

Moscow "has not let pass unnoticed the insistent attempts of
the U.S. to expand its military union with Japan by way of setting
up a theater ABM system in the Asia-Pacific Region," the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia is greatly concerned lest a regional ABM system be set
up anywhere near Russia's border, the Interfax news agency quoted
the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that this is being seen as a link in the first
interception echelon of the future U.S. national ABM system," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the appearance of such a system could "
destabilize strategic stability in the region, destroy the
regional balance of power and trigger an arms race."
</P>
<P>
Russia said all these fears could be dispelled by implementing
its proposal that a global system be set up for control over the
non-proliferation of missiles and missile technologies.
</P>
<P>
It called for the formation of a multilateral security
mechanism in the Asia-Pacific Region with "equal rights and
opportunities for all of its participants."

<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday denied
alleged cruel treatment of civilians in its military operation
against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The denial was in response to a recent statement by Malcolm
Hawkes, a representative of the Moscow branch of the Human Rights
Watch organization, that Russian troops are committing outrages in
Grozny and torturing Chechen civilians, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"These assertions are nothing but a concoction not supported by
fact or any proof," said Lieutenant General Stanislav Kavun,deputy
commander of the Russian Interior Troops.
</P>
<P>
He said Hawkes' statement was based solely on verbal accounts
from unnamed witnesses, and therefore should be seen "as a
provocation whose goal is to discredit the federal forces'
operation against the terrorists in Chechnya."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday morning voted unanimously to authorize the
deployment of 5,537 U.N. peace-keepers for the Democratic Republic
of Congo, including up to 500 military observers, to monitor the
shaky peace process in the Central African country.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of negotiations, the 15-nation body decided to
authorize "phased deployment" of the U.N. peace-keepers "in
conditions of adequate security and with the cooperation of the
parties."
</P>
<P>
The resolution approved the expansion of the U.N. Mission in
DRC, known as MONUC, and extend the its mandate until August 31.
</P>
<P>
Under the six-page resolution, the U.N. force is expected to
monitor the implementation of the Cease-fire Agreement and
investigate violations of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties to the DRC conflict signed the Lusaka
Agreement on July 10 last year in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, but
repeated violations have been reported in the many-sided conflict.
</P>
<P>
The expanded U.N. Mission is expected to establish and
maintain continuous liaison with the field headquarters of all the
parties' military forces and to work with the parties to obtain
the release of all prisoners of war, military captives and remains
in cooperation with international humanitarian agencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace-keepers are also mandated to supervise and
verify the disengagement and redeployment of the parties' forces,
the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also spelt out the conditions for the U.N.
military deployment. They include: the parties respect and uphold
the Cease-fire Agreement and the relevant Council resolutions, a
valid plan for the disengagement of the parties' forces and the
parties provide "firm and credible assurances," prior to the U.N.
deployment, for the security and freedom of movement of U.N. and
related personnel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which said that the current DRC conflict "
constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the
region," reaffirmed the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence of DRC and all States in the region, and
also the sovereignty of DRC over its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in the resolution, voiced the strong
support for the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, saying it "represents
the most viable basis for the peaceful resolution of the conflict"
in the African country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated its calls for "the orderly
withdrawal of all foreign forces from the territory of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo in accordance with the Cease-fire
Agreement."
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council
that "It is our long-held position that respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of DRC and the effective
implementation of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement form the basis
for the resolution of the question in DRC."
</P>
<P>
What will be authorized by the Security Council is intended
only to assist the implement of part of the Lusaka Agreement, so "
more and harder tasks are before the international community and
parties to the conflict, and call for their concerted efforts,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict broke out in August 1998 when rebels, backed
by Uganda and Rwanda, launched an offensive to oust President
Laurent Kabila's government. It has soaked up fighting forces from
at least six African countries -- with troops from Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Angola all fighting on Kabila's side.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Appeals For End of Intolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi Thursday renewed his appeal for an end to all forms of
intolerance, in a speech delivered during a visit to a number of
tragic World War Two sites in Italian northeast city of Trieste
which remain symbols of violence and persecution.
</P>
<P>
"Every feeling of bitterness and hatred must come to an end.
Together, we must honor our dead and think of the future of our
people. The future lies in European peace," Ciampi said.
</P>
<P>
His words came during a visit to the "foiba" of Basovizza, a
mountain chasm in Istria where, between 1943 and 1945, thousands
of Italians and opponents of the Communist regime in Yugoslavia
were hurled to their deaths by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Ciampi visited the San Sabba rice farm in
Trieste, the site of Italy's only Nazi death camp and where some 5,
000 Jewish people perished.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi's visit to the city and its massacre sites is of special
significance since the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, of which
Trieste is the capital, is just across the border from the
Austrian province of Carinthia, of which far-right leader Joerg
Haider is governor.
</P>
<P>
Haider's declaration that he also intends to visit the death
camp has sparked bitter controversy here, as has the centre-right
regional government's voting of a resolution supporting the
Austrian leader in the aftermath of his xenophobic Freedom Party's
rise to power in Austria.
</P>
<P>
On February 16, the Lower House voted a resolution against the
Haider visit.

<P>
Zambia's total external debt stands at approximately 6.5

Over the past decade, Zambia has been paying debt service of

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Revise Budget due to Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi on Thursday said that the catastrophic flooding in
southern and central Mozambique has forced the government to
revise this year's plan and budget.
</P>
<P>
"We have to divert resources that were originally planned to
allocate to other areas", Mocumbi said. "The government's plans
for this year will be affected".
</P>
<P>
In particular, money earmarked for secondary and tertiary
roads might now have to be spent on repairing the trunk road
network, and particularly the main north-south highway, washed
away by the floods in several places.
</P>
<P>
The flood has not affected this year's harvest, Mocumbi said.
The most fertile parts of the country are in the northern
provinces, they have not suffered from flooding and are expected
to produce a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
In the south "we can still recover" only if there was immediate
 replanting once the flood waters subsided, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government's top priorities, he said, remained humanitarian
 assistance for the flood victims, and reopening access roads into
the affected areas, so that relief goods could be taken in by road
rather than by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"All humanitarian assistance to Gaza and to part of Maputo
Province is now being undertaken by air," he said. "That's very
expensive and not very efficient."
</P>
<P>
"The quicker we can reopen the roads, thets appeal on Wednesday for 65.5 million dollars in
emergency aid, "but I think this is an underestimate", said
Mocumbi.

TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary election
results in Iran's capital of Tehran will come out 24 hours later
than scheduled, Director General of the Election Headquarters at
the Interior Ministry Javad Qadimi Zaker said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All votes from Tehran have been counted, but the ministry's
executive board and the Supervisory Board decided to re-count 105
ballot boxes to make sure that there has been no rigging, Zaker was
quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the executive board took 50 boxes and the Supervisory
Board took another 55 ballot boxes to re-count the votes. There are
altogether 36,000 ballot boxes in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the final results will be released by late Thursday
night or Friday.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said on Wednesday the final results for Tehran will be
announced mid-Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest results of last Friday's parliamentary election
showed that 191 seats out of a total of 290 have been confirmed,
with reformists winning 137, the conservatives taking only 39, and
the rest going to independents.
</P>
<P>
Some 69 seats have to be decided in run-off elections to be held
in April because the candidates involved failed to get the minimum
25 percent of the total votes to land a seat in the 290-member
sixth Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Now the attention is focused on Tehran, where the latest results
showed that reformists of the May 23 Front may finally get 29 of
the constituency's share of 30 seats in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Conservative newspapers predicted on Thursday the former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani will be able to enter the list of 30
parliament members in Tehran, while other papers suggest he may
lose in the end.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, one of the most senior politicians in Iran, has
posed himself as a centrist but was reportedly close to the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
With reformists winning a sweeping victory in the election, the
conservatives have pinned their hope on Rafsanjani to enter the
parliament and become the new speaker.

MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of people housed in
evacuation centers, due to Thursday's Mayon eruption, throughout
Albay Province in the southeastern Philippines has reached 18,018,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
According to the records issued by the Department of Social
Welfare and Development, the evacuees, or about 3,226 families,
are from Albay's seven towns and are mostly housed in Legazpi city.
</P>
<P>
There were all in all 24 affected villages from where the
evacuees came from.
</P>
<P>
The Albay provincial board has reportedly officially declared
the province in a state of calamity, to pave the way for the usage
of the calamity fund.
</P>
<P>
The provincial board, headed by Albay Vice Governor Jesus
Calisin,unanimously approved the proposal and the calamity funds
which amount to about 3 million pesos (75,000 U.S. dollars) will
be used to purchase foodstuffs for the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
But reports said the approval of the budget for Legazpi city is
still under review, adding that Legazpi, 10 kilometers away from
Mt.Mayon, still needs the concurrence of the Albay provincial
board for its budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine Air Transportation Office (ATO)
announced also the cancellation of all commercial flights to
Legazpi in view of the worsening volcanic activity there.
</P>
<P>
"We have closed Legazpi Airport until further notice to avert
any air incidents which could occur while hazardous levels of
eruption in Mount Mayon is in progress and because of ash-falls,"
ATO Executive Director Roland Luna said.

Mayon Volcano erupted Thursday morning, sending lava fountains
and huge columns of smoke to the sky as local residents fled their
homes to evacuation centers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Security Council Edges Towards Approving Peace-Keeping Force for DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday began another round of meeting behind closed
doors to discuss the current situation in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) while African nations are lobbying to get thousands
of U.N. peace-keepers into the central African country to save the
peace process in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council, after weeks of negotiations, is very
likely to vote on a draft resolution to authorize a 5,500 U.N.
peace-keeping force to monitor the shaky peace process in the
Central African country.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are close to an agreement, very close to an
agreement," the president of the Security Council for the month of
February, Arnoldo Listre, told reporters after the Council meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Listre, the Argentine permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the Council would likely vote today although
diplomats cautioned that a vote could be delayed until later in
the week.
</P>
<P>
Despite a cease-fire agreement signed last summer in Lusaka,
capital of Zambia, by warring parties, repeated violations have
been reported from the country, formerly known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
As an initial step, the Security Council last August
authorized the deployment of 90 military liaison officers to
countries involved in the conflict: Congo and its backers --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and its opponents, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and
many have been barred from key sites, especially in government-
held areas.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to vote on the long-awaited
draft resolution, which, sponsored by the United States, calls for
military observers to monitor implementation and lay the
groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N. peace-
keeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But there is still uncertainty about when the military
observers will arrive in DRC. And the Security Council was very
vague about the deployment of peace-keepers, saying in late
January that it intends to consider preparations "at appropriate
time."
</P>
<P>
In a message to a major forum on U.S.-African relations that
opened Thursday in Washington, U.N. Secretary-General touched upon
the DRC issue, saying that the United Nations was anxiously
awaiting the adoption of a Security Council resolution which would
authorize the deployment of the peace-keeping force in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The DRC's civil war, which broke out in August 1998, has drawn
troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia who are fighting along
with the government of President Laurent Kabila against rebels
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

summit in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, Wednesday and called for the
speedy implementation of the cease-fire agreement in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from DRC, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Zambia in a joint communique reaffirmed their

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Kosovo Must Remain Part of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday reiterated Athens' position that Kosovo must
retain its status as an autonomous province inside the borders of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with visiting NATO Secretary General
George Robertson, Simitis expressed concern over the increasingly
worsening situation in Kosovo, saying that the developments are
leading to tensions which must be put under control.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that NATO's presence in Kosovo should ensure
equilibrium in the multiethnic society of Kosovo, which has seen
rising violence between NATO-led peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians
and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The local press Thursday criticized the NATO-led peacekeepers
for their failure in preserving Kosovo's bicommunal status, and
regarded this as a source of crises that are becoming increasingly
hard to control in the region.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Robertson, who arrived here Wednesday on a two-day
visit as part of a courtesy tour of alliance member states, said
that the situation in the violence-torn Kosovo town of Mitrovica
was better than in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, two French soldiers were wounded and one ethnic
Albanian sniper died in a gunfight in the northern Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that a NATO meeting would discuss Friday a
proposal for the movement of troops in the area. However, he did
not consider it necessary for the reinforcement of the NATO-led
peacekeepers at this time.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who is on his first visit to Greece, had also
discussed with Simitis EU-NATO relations in the framework of
building a European security and defense identity and the
relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He praised Athens' important and leadership role in maintaining
peace in the Balkan region and welcomed the recent rapprochement
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the NATO chief will also have talks with
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Down in January: Statistics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation fell
to 2.3 percent in January from December's 2.6 percent, with
consumer prices declining 0.1 percent, Statistics Canada reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reported figures are running counter to inflation fear
fueled by rising energy charges. Gasoline, in particular, was
already priced at a record high of 69.7 cents (about 0.48 U.S.
dollars) a liter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official inflation figures are also much lower than the
expected monthly rise of 0.4 percent and annual rate of 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, fell
to 1.4 percent from 1.6 percent in December, as compared with the
1.8 percent forecast by analysts.
</P>
<P>
Monthly rise for energy prices was reported to be 0.2 percent
in January, with the annual rate being put at 15 percent. The
monthly rise was led by a 2.4 percent hike in natural gas price
and a 2.1 percent increase in fuel oil.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Aid for Relocated Laotian Villagers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday it has made available aid worth 1.14 million euros (some
1.14 million U.S. dollars) for Laotian villagers whose relocation
has exposed them to unexpected health hazards.
</P>
<P>
The aid will enable European non-governmental organizations to
improve the availability of food, water and health care pending
more permanent solutions to the situation, the European Union
executive body said.
</P>
<P>
This funding is intended to improve the villagers' access to
clean water and sanitation facilities, as well as to basic health
care. It should also help meet basic food needs as a stepping
stone for a longer-term program to ensure self-sufficiency and
development, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 people are expected to benefit from the aid.

<HEADLINE> EU Wins WTO Case Against U.S. Export Subsidy Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday the World Trade Organization (WTO) had ruled that U.S.
subsidies to exports through the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)
scheme breach the WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
The ruling upholds an essential conclusion from a WTO dispute
settlement panel that the U.S. needs to bring FSC into conformity
with its WTO obligations by the beginning of the next U.S. fiscal
year, the EU's executive body said.
</P>
<P>
The panel's report issued last October said the U.S. would have
to withdraw the FSC scheme because it was designed as a tax haven
for American corporations to exempt substantial amount of due
taxes.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this decision," said EU Trade Commissioner Pascal
Lamy, "The FSC system, and its predecessor, have had a major
negative effect on international trade to the detriment of
European companies.... It is now for the U.S. to implement the
WTO's findings, in line with its international obligations."
</P>
<P>
The EU sued the U.S. over the FSC scheme under the WTO Dispute
Settlement Understanding in 1997. The two sides had held several
rounds of consultations but failed to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the panel issued its report in favor of the EU, the U.S.
filed a Notice of Appeal to the WTO dispute settlement body on
November 26.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, FSC subsidies have assisted U.S.
exports worth 250 billion dollars, giving U.S. companies an unfair
advantage and creating major distortions of international trade.
The U.S. budgetary cost for the subsidies is around 3.5 million
dollars per year, said the EU.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sean Elliott is practicing
harder, and he predicts he can rejoin the San Antonio Spurs in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Eliott, trying to become the first pro athlete to return to his
sport after a kidney transplant, said Wednesday that he needs more
weeks like this one, with back-to-back practices.
</P>
<P>
"Tuesday's practice was a monster," said Elliott, who went
through grueling drills that day with the reserves.
</P>
<P>
Elliott practiced again Wednesday with the full team before the
Spurs left for a three-game road trip to Charlotte, Chicago and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Neither the forward nor coach Gregg Popovich, who certainly
does not want to be locked in to Elliott's prediction for a return
in three weeks, has set a specific timetable.
</P>
<P>
Elliott, 32, resumed full practices in early February.

<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Investigations have shown that
the cause for the February 21 killing of two passengers in east
China's Shandong Province was toxic fumes emitted by the bus they
were riding in.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yingyi, assistant to the director of Qingdao Municipal
Health Bureau, told Xinhua today that a team of investigators
found that carbon monoxide emitted from the long-distance bus
also poisoned 35 women farmers who were traveling from their
hometown of Heze to another town for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that tailpipe exhaust leaked into the bus
through cracks under the seats of the two dead women, killing them
and poisoning the 35 others.
</P>
<P>
At present, five women are still in critical condition and
receiving emergency treatment in a nearby hospital, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of food poisoning or intentional poisoning has
been ruled out, she added.
</P>
<P>
Further investigations into responsibility for the accident is
still underway.

HANGZHOU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, today stressed the necessity to
care for the needs of the broad masses and serve the people
wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of east China's Zhejiang Province, Li,
also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), emphasized that the
voice of the people should be heard constantly and regularly.
</P>
<P>
Officials should be grateful to, rather than repulsed by, those
who make criticisms, and they should provide opportunities for
people to speak frankly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the voices of the broad masses should be a necessary
part of the process of decision making, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The "Three Emphases" drive, especially that at the county-level,
which calls for education in theoretical study, political
awareness, and good conduct, is of great importance to the nation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the counties and cities are very important
leadership levels, because they forms a connecting link between
the upper leadership and the townships and countryside.
</P>
<P>
Between February 21 and 24, Li inspected the cities of Yuhang,
Hangzhou, and Jiaxing, and visited enterprises and economic
development zones, and several families of local farmers.

<HEADLINE> HK SFC Criticizes Sponsor for Poor Arrangement in IPO of Tom.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC) Thursday criticized the concerning
parties in the initial public offering (IPO) of the Internet
company tom.com for failing to take necessary measures to prevent
chaos.
</P>
<P>
"SFC is disappointed that the sponsor, receiving bank and
company concerned, despite our advice through the Stock Exchange
of Hong Kong, have not prepared sufficient subscription forms in a
timely manner and set up proper arrangements for receiving the
forms," said a SFC announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The company, sponsor and receiving bank should have been aware
of the investor interest in the IPO, particularly in view of the
publicity running up to the IPO," it said.
</P>
<P>
The SFC has asked BNP Prime Peregrine, the sponsor, lead
manager and global coordinator of the IPO, to submit a report on
the case.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, an estimated 300,000 Hong Kong people
lined up outside 10 HSBC (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited) branches to submit application forms for
shares in tom.com, which is 57 percent owned by Hutchison Whampoa
and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., both controlled by Hong Kong
tycoon Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
The order at several bank branches was so chaotic that extra
policemen had to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
The SFC also said the development of a financial infrastructure
for electronic subscription at IPOs will be speeded up to obviate
the need to queue up for forms and to hand in the forms.

China today voiced its strong dissatisfaction with and resolute
opposition to the United States stance on the Taiwan issue,
stating that it has infringed upon China's sovereignty and grossly
interferred in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and the Taiwan issue is
absolutely China's internal affairs that no foreign country should
interfere in, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a
press conference when asked to comment on the U.S. State
Department's "deep concern" on "China's threat" to Taiwan
contained in a white paper issued by China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also, the spokesman expressed China's concern over reports
that the Japanese government will allow the Dalai Lama to go to
Japan for a visit.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama is a political exile under the disguise of
religion, who has been engaged in long-term separatist activities,
" he said, urging the Japanese government to honor its commitments
of not letting the Dalai Lama enter the Japanese territory so as
to avoid new disturbances in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the successor of Michel Camdessus, former
managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Zhu
said China hopes that the IMF will choose its new leader as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan's recent visit
to Mauritania, Tunis, Kuwait and Iran has been crowned with a
complete success.
</P>
<P>
Zhu announced at the conference that Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebanov will pay an official visit to China from

<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has been advised by the presidential medical
team to take a rest for two or three days as he has been suffering
from a bout of flu since Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Medical team member Dr. Mohammad Tony Soufyan was quoted by the
Antara News Agency as saying the temperature of Wahid's body had
started to reach a normal level at 36 degrees Celsius while his
blood pressure had also improved.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Marxilam Simandjutak said the president did not
feel well Thursday morning so that the medical team decided to
conduct a total check-up.
</P>
<P>
The examination showed Wahid had had a fever and his body's
temperature had increased but on the whole his condition was fine.
</P>
<P>
Another examination later indicated that the fever had vanished,
Simandjutak added.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in October last year, Wahid, 59, has often
subjected himself to a punishing daily schedule and long hours in
his attempt to introduce democratic reforms, fix the battered
economy and end several bloody communal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to extensive tours of many islands across the
country, he's also visited a large number of countries on several
whirlwind diplomatic tours.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's NITC Discusses New Economic Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's National
Information Technology Council (NITC) Thursday discussed the new
economic framework, in which knowledge is increasingly recognized
as a vital source of economic growth, determinant of wealth and
basis of competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
At its 9th meeting chaired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
the council deliberated on issues and challenges pertaining to the
shift in the k-economy, in particular on how to harness the
embedded knowledge to enhance the value chain and help achieve
Malaysia's vision of becoming an information-rich and value-based
society by 2020, NITC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also positioned the Multimedia Super Corridor and
the National IT Agenda as excellent start-ups to drive and develop
a good framework to guide Malaysia's transition to the knowledge
economy, NITC said.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia had a window of opportunity to position itself
since the k-economy was only just emerging and its transition
might not be smooth sailing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting Thursday elaborated on a new strategy to enable the
Malaysian economy to move closer to its goals of harnessing
knowledge as a commodity to be exchanged and to be used to create
new value,it said.
</P>
<P>
As knowledge-based products and services have become the
dominant force of commerce, knowledge itself would also emerge as
the new currency in the Malaysian economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The NITC announced the setting up of a k-economy work research
group entrusted with the task of identifying and developing k-
economy measures to monitor and gauge Malaysia's progress in this
area, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni held talks with his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba
on bilateral relations and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Thursday that
President Chiluba Wednesday called on Museveni in Lusaka's Pamodzi
Hotel where Museveni was attending a one-day summit on the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting had reportedly drawn nine regional leaders, most of
whose countries are militarily involved in the 18-month-long DRC
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's involvement in the conflict and the implementation of
the nearly faltering Lusaka cease-fire agreement were high on
their agenda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Museveni discussed with Namibian leader Sam Nujoma on
bilateral relations, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, accompanied by State Minister for Regional Affairs
Amama Mbabazi, left for Lusaka Wednesday morning. The summit, a
follow-up to the U.N. meeting on the same topic last month,
called for more international financial and logistic support for
the implementation of the Lusaka pact. All warring parties to the
conflict reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement they penned
last July and August.

<HEADLINE> Seminars in Macao Emphasize One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Returned
Overseas Chinese in Macao and the Association of Chinese Students
of Macao respectively held seminars on Thursday to emphasize the
One-China principle concerning the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The participants said the One-China principle is the foundation
for and prerequisite to achieving the peaceful reunification of
the country.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China
and promote the reunification of the motherland are the common
aspiration of all Chinese. The Taiwan authorities should bear in
mind the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and contribute to the unity
and prosperity of the country, rather than act as people condemned
by history, the speakers noted.
</P>
<P>
They said Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the motherland
and set a good example for settling the Taiwan issue on the basis
of the One-China principle. The Taiwan authorities should return
to the One-China stance as soon as possible and any attempt to
separate Taiwan from the motherland can only bring about war and
disaster to the Taiwan people, they warned.
</P>
<P>
The participants noted that the One-China principle of the
Chinese government has won understanding and support from more and
more countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan compatriots should not be influenced by the small number
of separatists, but should get united with the others of the
Chinese nation to build a stronger country, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Ministry Summons Turkish Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
for Asia and the Pacific Mohsen Aminzadeh on Thursday summoned
Turkish ambassador to Iran, Turan Murali, to protest a statement
made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was quoted by the media as saying in the wake of Iran's
sixth parliamentary elections that Iran will no longer support
Islamic movements in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the elections, held last Friday, have not
come out yet, but it is already known that reformists will get an
absolute majority in the 290-seat legislative body, which could
help push through President Mohammed Khatami's reform policies.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said the statement made by the Turkish prime minister
is a clear example of interference in Iran's domestic affairs and
an affront to the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
"Ecevit's statement not only runs counter to the good neighborly
relations between Iran and Turkey, but also conveys lack of
understanding of the historical and political development in Iran
on the part of Mr. Ecevit," Aminzadeh said, quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the Islamic revolution became victorious in 1979 by the
Iranian people and the same people have now made a large turnout
for the parliamentary elections to safeguard the achievements of
the revolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the Muslim people of Turkey have not the
same view that the prime minister expressed about Iran," Aminzadeh
said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Turkish officials will accurately understand the
situation, correct their wrong conducts and avoid bringing more
misunderstanding between the two nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador said he would convey Iran's protest to
the Turkish officials.

<HEADLINE> Talks with Mubarak on Mideast Peace "Excellent": U. S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis
Ross termed as "excellent" his talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak here on Thursday on the developments of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived here earlier in the day after visiting Israel
and the Palestinian self-rule areas, said he briefed Mubarak on his

talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is facing certain difficulties but the two
sides have shown desire to move forward with the peace talks, said
the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, said Ross, he discussed with Mubarak how Egypt
and the U.S. can work together to break the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian talks which ground to a halt two weeks ago due
to a dispute over a long-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a statement by U.S. State Department
spokesman
James Rubin that President Mubarak's visit to Lebanon on Saturday
was meant to show support to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla
group, Ross said that Egypt and the U.S. were partners in search of
peace and that the Mideast peace process depended on such a
partnership.
</P>
<P>
The partnership focuses on advancing the peace process as a
whole, said Ross.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, became the second biggest recipient of U.S. foreign aid
after Israel. It receives about 2 billion U.S. dollars a year, much
of which are in military supplies.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in the day.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Engineers Go to Lebanon to Repair Damaged Power Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of Egyptian
engineers left here Thursday for Lebanon to repair the three power
stations badly damaged by the recent Israeli airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Ali el-Saeedi said
the technical team led by engineer Galal Abdel Hlawa will begin
their work as soon as they arrive despite the required devices are
shipped as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary costs of the whole project are estimated at 80
million Egyptian pounds (about 24 million U.S. dollars), el-Saeedi
said.
</P>
<P>
Illustrating a detailed timetable for recovering the three
stations, the minister said that new high-tech devices will be
installed at the 40-percent-damaged Beir Nabouh station in seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
It will take 60 days to repair the 60-percent-damaged Gomhour
station, he said, adding that the last station in Baalbek was
totally destroyed, so it will take much more time because large
transformers are needed.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to revenge the killing of Israeli soldiers by the
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon, the Israeli air force staged
a massive air raids on civilian targets in Lebanon on February 8,
seriously damaging the three power stations.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with an
alleged aim of protecting its northern territories from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, an Iranian- and Syrian-backed military group, has
been spearheading a war of attrition to oust the Israeli occupation
troops and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Still Committed to Dialogue With India: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has continued to
pursue a policy of dialogue and peaceful resolution of the core
dispute of Kashmir and other issues with India since the inception
of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the concluding session of a seminar on foreign
policy here on Thursday, Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Tariq
Altaf said Pakistan-India relations are currently,perhaps, at
their lowest ebb in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi is engaged in its blind pursuit of a "hate Pakistan
campaign," he charged, adding that since October 12 India has
practically ceased any dealings with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Pakistan, however, remains prepared to
fulfill all its obligations and implement the agreements it has
entered into.
</P>
<P>
"The Lahore process, as it came to be known, was essentially an
endorsement of the ongoing dialogue process. The dialogue has been
stonewalled by India."
</P>
<P>
Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was dismissed
in a bloodless coup in October last year, met his Indian
counterpart, Atal Behari Vajpayee, in Lahore a year ago and both
promised to make efforts to solve all outstanding issues between
the two rivals through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf has
repeatedly offered to engage in a result-oriented dialogue with
India focusing on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In an interview a fortnight ago, General Musharraf made a
direct offer to meet Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
According to Altaf, the chief executive stressed that the two
sides could break the logjam and reduce tensions by addressing the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, Vajpayee shrugged off any possibility
of dialogue with Pakistan unless the latter gives up its control
over its part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"The contrast in the approaches of the two countries to vital
issues of peace and security cannot but be noticed by the
international community," Altaf said.

ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Chechen President
Zelimkhan Yandarbayev has left Pakistan after he was ordered by
the Pakistani authorities to leave the country, said Jamaat-e-

<P>
A Jammat-e-Islami leader who required anonymity said
Yandarbayev's new destination is Afghanistan, according to News
Network International, a private news agency here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Inam Haq said the Chechen
dissident has been ordered to leave after his two-week visa
expired.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbayev's stay in Pakistan caused a diplomatic row between
Russia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Moscow blamed Islamabad for organizing the trip. However,
Pakistan rejected the claim,saying Yandarbayev was on a private
tour and has met no Pakistan officials during his stay.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Government Sues Sultan's Brother Over Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Brunei government and
its investment arm, Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), have started
legal action against and frozen the assets of the sultanate's
former Finance Minister Prince Jefri Bolkiah for improper
withdrawal and use of substantial state reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
Besides Prince Jefri, a younger brother of Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah, civil proceedings had also commenced against Prince Jefri
's son, Prince Abdul Hakeem, and his former Private and
Confidential Secretary Haji Awang bin Kassim, Malaysia's national
news agency Bernama reported, quoting a Brunei government
statement from Brunei's capital Bandar Seri Begawan Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Similar action was also being taken against more than 60
companies overseas believed to be owned or controlled by Prince
Jefri, who resigned as finance minister in 1998 after the Amedeo
group of companies that he controlled reported losses of tens of
billions of Brunei dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other individuals or companies might be drawn into the
proceedings later on, which "were undertaken after efforts to find
solution through other means had failed and had not produced any
satisfactory results," according to the statement signed by
Permanent Secretary to the Office of the Prime Minister Hazair
Abdullah faxed to the news agency, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings were started following detailed investigations
into the affairs of the BIA carried out by a financial task force
since its appointment in June 1998 headed by Education Minister
and Acting Health Minister Abdul Aziz Umar.
</P>
<P>
"The claims brought against His Royal Highness (Prince Jefri)
relate to the improper withdrawal and use of substantial funds
from the BIA, which constitutes the state reserve fund, during the
period when His Royal Highness was minister of finance and
chairman of BIA,"the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said orders had also been obtained from the Brunei High
Court freezing Prince Jefri's assets both in Brunei and overseas
and those of a number of other defendants.
</P>
<P>
These included a substantial number of residential properties
overseas.
</P>
<P>
It said a related order had also been obtained in the English
High Court freezing Prince Jefri's assets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Proceedings seeking similar orders in other countries may also
be necessary," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Amedeo, a huge development consortium, collapsed in July 1998
amid reports of huge losses.

<P>
GENEVA, February (Xinhua) -- Russia supports the re-
establishment of the ad hoc committee on the prevention of an arms
race in outer space (PAROS), said a Russian diplomat here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session of the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) Ambassador Vasily Sidorov said the Russian side
supported the re-establishment of the ad hoc committee on PAROS in
order to elaborate specific practical arrangements that would
block the ways of turning the space around the Earth into a new
arena for power confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"In this respect, we express solidarity with our Chinese
colleagues, who also urge immediate re-establishment in the CD of
an appropriate ad hoc committee on PAROS with a mandate on
elaboration and conclusion of arrangement 'on the prohibition of
testing, deployment and use of weapons and weapon systems as well
as their components in outer space to prevent weaponization of the
outer space'," said Sidorov.
</P>
<P>
He told the session that his delegation was aiming at
constructive cooperation and the search for mutually acceptable
solutions for PAROS subject matters.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador also called on other delegations to show
political flexibility so that the mood for immediate start of the
work in this direction would prevail.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposed to U.S. Proposal to Modify ABM Treaty for NMD Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia is strongly against a
United States proposal to adapt the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (
ABM) treaty to allow the deployment of the national missile
defense (NMD), said a Russian diplomat here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session of the Conference on
Disarmament (CD), Ambassador Vasily Sidorov said, "the 1972 ABM
treaty indeed provides for possible changes to its provisions and
that was used by the parties to the treaty in the past. But the
substance of those changes was primarily to enhance the treaty
regime (and) to strengthen its deterrent basis."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent U.S. proposal to adapt the ABM treaty
to permit deployment of a "limited" NMD, Sidorov said that the
proposal was contrary to the key provision of Article I of the
treaty which constitutes its substance.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of such treaty transformation, a precedent might
be set in the disarmament practice, when an addition or amendment
to the agreement which limits and curbs the development of most
advanced types of armaments, would convert it into an agreement
that permits to build up military potential," the Russian
ambassador said. "We do not agree with such logic."
</P>
<P>
"If the United States implemented its unilateral plans on NMD,
the ABM treaty would be destroyed," Sidorov warned. "The structure
of treaties and agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament
would crumble along with it."
</P>
<P>
"A serious damage would be made to the whole disarmament
process as well as to the regimes of nonproliferation of WMD (
weapons of mass destruction), missiles and missile technologies,"
he stressed. "Extremely dangerous incentives for triggering an
arms race in outer space would be created."

<HEADLINE> NATO Force's Failure Leads to Kosovo Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An editorial carried by
Greece's Kathimerini daily newspaper on Thursday said that the
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo should be held responsible
for the increasingly deteriorating situation in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, which has seen rising violence between
peacekeepers, ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said, "The failure, whether intended or not, of
NATO troops in Kosovo, a military force comprising 30,000 men, to
preserve the region's bi-communal status, is a source of crises
that are becoming increasingly hard to control."
</P>
<P>
The editorial also noted that concerns have been intensified by
the fact that NATO supreme commanders are accusing Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic of being responsible for the
worsening situation in the province while NATO troops have done
nothing to prevent the expulsion of thousands of Serbs by Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO is gradually also facing the increasing discontent of
ethnic Albanians, who had originally heralded it as their
liberator, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, encouraged by NATO's anti-Serbian stance, are
increasingly tending to view the allied forces as an obstacle to
the immediate independence of Kosovo, a fact which is undercutting
the support for NATO's involvement from the people of the Balkan
region, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warned that the Balkan region has entered "a
phase of upheaval," in which the consequences are unpredictable.

<HEADLINE> German President Lauds Friendly Ties With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German President
Johnannes Rau said here on Thursday that Egypt and Germany were
bound by friendly ties in all domains.
</P>
<P>
The German people bear a great interest in Egyptian civilization
and science, and its ancient and modern history, said Rau while
meeting with local press.
</P>
<P>
Rau arrived here Monday on a five-day official visit to Egypt.
He had held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday on further promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed, among other things, an array of
regional and international issues. Rau responded positively to an
earlier proposal by Mubarak to set up an Egyptian-German business
forum to increase trade volume between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Rau also met with Secretary General of the
Cairo-based Arab League Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid on the
developments in the Middle East peace process, Arab-German
relations and the current situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of a German university in Egypt, Rau said
contacts between the two sides are proceeding well and the plot of
land for its construction has already been purchased.

<HEADLINE> Barak Denies Reported Secret Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
office Thursday denied local media reports that Israel and Syria
were conducting secret talks, saying they were not true.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Maariv reported Thursday that Israel and Syria
were engaging in accelerated secret talks through U.S. mediation,
and Barak had held marathon talks with his negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
nearly four-year freeze, broke off in January over a dispute on the
fate of the Golan Heights, a Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Israel of refusing to focus on the return of the
Golan Heights in the first two rounds of talks, insisting that
Israel make a written commitment to a full withdrawal from the
heights before the talks could be reopened. Israel has rejected the
demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the stalemate, mediation efforts led by the U.S. have
been going on. U.S. President Bill Clinton is especially eager to
see a peace treaty being clinched in the Middle East before he
leaves office next January.
</P>
<P>
Barak also wants to reach a peace agreement with Damascus which
would help him fulfil a key election promise to pull Israeli troops
out of southern Lebanon by July. Syria is the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There have been various reports in the last few days saying that
the talks would be resumed soon. Maariv reported one week ago that
Israel and Syria had agreed in principle to revive talks within two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Holding secret talks is a common political game in the Middle
East since it can relieve internal or external pressures on both
sides. The most typical was the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation
over the historic Oslo accords seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
While their public negotiations in Washington led to nowhere,
the two sides surprised the whole world by announcing that they had
reached an agreement through secret negotiations in Oslo, Norway.

<HEADLINE> Barak Defends Levy's Harsh Comments on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday defended Foreign Minister David Levy's controversial
comments on Lebanon, in which Levy threatened to launch "child-for-
child" revenge for possible guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, Barak denied that he had tried to confine
his foreign minister's speech.
</P>
<P>
What Levy had said, according to Barak, stressed just how great
the Israeli government views it responsibility for maintaining
national security, which had been threatened recently by "a wave of
hatred" across the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Levy declared in Wednesday's Knesset (Parliament) session that
if Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas attacked Jewish settlements along
Israel's northern border, Lebanon would pay "blood for blood, soul
for soul, child for child."
</P>
<P>
Levy was commenting on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's recent
statements in support of Hezbollah and "incitement" from the Arab
countries against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he had possessed information that Hezbollah had Katyusha
rockets ready to launch at the Upper Galilee area in northern
Israel. Thus, he said, he wanted his comments could be clear, "not
as a threat, but as a warning before a calamity."
</P>
<P>
Levy's commensurate revenge policy immediately sparked ruckus in
the Knesset and his speech was interrupted several times by angry
shout-out from some dovish Knesset members.
</P>
<P>
Zahava Galon, Meretz faction head in the Knesset, called on
Barak to put Levy in his place. She said that someone whose idea of
diplomacy and security is "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"
is not fit to serve in the inner-circle security cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Issam Mahoul, from the Hadash party, said: "Child for child is a
primitive, fundamentalist and dangerous expression...that not
suited to governments."
</P>
<P>
Levy's comments followed by his controversial remarks earlier in
the month that "if Israeli northern settlements burn, Lebanese soil
will burn."
</P>
<P>
These comments show that Israel faces the dilemma of violating
moral rules and bombing villages and even hurting innocent villages
or trying to endure Hezbollah's recent escalation activities in the
Israeli-occupied security zone in South Lebanon, which had killed
seven Israeli soldiers and wounded a dozen since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer zone in South Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border areas from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or Party of
God, has been fighting to end Israeli occupation there.
</P>
<P>
To avenge Hezbollah's deadly attacks in the past few weeks,
Israeli troops struck at three Lebanese power stations supplying
electricity to Beirut and other Lebanese cities, wounding at least
a dozen civilians and leading to a total damage of 200 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz
submitted a policy-changing plan to Israeli security cabinet,
asking for approval to fire back Hezbollah guerrillas hidden in
villages, which will surely cause great civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
These decisions invited severe criticisms from Arab countries
and even the United States, the major patron of Israel in the world
political arena.

<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Kaduna state
government wednesday extended its 24-hour restriction on the
movement of residents in the state's troubled capital to its
neighboring towns to curb the violence' s spill-over.
</P>
<P>
Towns near Kaduna city like Zaria, Kafanchan, Birnin-Gwari and
Kachia were ordered to observe the all-day curfew, when violence
were found in some of them, reported the Guardian, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Murder of Burundian Refugees Political Motivated: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police has
described an attack on a family of refugees from Burundi as a
politically motivated murder, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five members of the same family living at Muyovosi camp in
Tanzania's western Kigoma Region were murdered on Wednesday night
last week in a grenade attack which is believed to have been
carried out by their own compatriots, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kigoma Regional Police Commander Placid Chaka,
preliminary investigation indicated that the murder is politically
motivated "because the assailants did not take anything from the
house."
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of political divisions within the refugees in
the camps, " the police commander was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jean Batungwanayo, a 55-year-old Burundian gynecologist who was
working at the refugee camp's medical center, his wife Frazia
Murekasoni, and their three children, were attacked and killed in
their house.
</P>
<P>
Batungwanayo was a brother of Leornard Nyangoma, leader of the
armed CNDD rebel group that is fighting the government troops in
Burundi, said the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
The police in Kigoma, which borders war-ravaged Burundi, had
until Wednesday arrested 14 Hutu refugees from Burundi in
connection with the murder.
</P>
<P>
According to Chaka, the police were taking no chance after
getting reports that villains responsible for the brutal murder
were seeking to behead the bodies and display their skulls as a
sign of warning to refugees at the Muyovosi camp.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanzanian government sources said Burundian rebels are
recruiting forces from refugee camps in western Tanzania and
slipping them out of the country for training.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is hosting over 320,000 Burundian refugees who have
fled the six-year civil war in their homeland between Hutu rebels
and the Tutsi- dominated military.

HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Eline cut off the fuel
supply route from Mozambique to Zimbabwe further worsening the
fuel crisis in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe oil companies Wednesday warned that the situation,
which had in recent weeks improved significantly, could plunge to

"While limited fuel imports are arriving via Beira-Feruka

oil Companies in a statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK, India to Develop Cooperation on IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and India signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on information technology and
services cooperation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, the fifth sealed between the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and overseas countries, contemplates
an extensive range of cooperative activities, including exchanges
in commerce, industry and education, development of investment and
technology partnerships and the sharing of policy and regulatory
information.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of this MOU represents a significant step in the
buildup of closer cooperation between India and Hong Kong," said
Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting of the HKSAR
K. C. Kwong.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as the constraints of time and distance were
inexorably eroded by advances in information and
telecommunications technology, people from different parts of the
world could now aspire to work together in a seamless manner
wherever and whenever they are.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses are no longer facing competition only from their
immediate neighbors, but they are also no longer limited to
cooperation with those in their neighborhood," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
"In the globally connected world of the 21st century,
international cooperation to face up to global competition is
therefore the key to success. And this cooperative spirit is
central to the MOU that we are signing today," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has since May 1998 signed MOUs on IT
cooperation with Canada, Australia, Britain and Finland.

<HEADLINE> China to Greatly Develop Border Economies in Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
work for great economic growth in the border areas within a decade
by improving infrastructure and living standards there.
</P>
<P>
Mou Benli, deputy minister in charge of the State Ethnic
Affairs Commission, announced that his commission launched a
campaign today aiming at boosting border economies and helping the
poverty-stricken areas become rich, as part of the government
effort to develop the vast western regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
China's land border line is about 20,000 kilometers long, where
there are 135 counties including 107 ethnic minority autonomous
counties. Nearly half of the 20 million people who live in the
border areas are members of ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the border areas reported a combined gross domestic
product (GDP) of 82.6 billion yuan (about 10 billion U.S. dollars),
accounting for 1.1 percent of China's GDP. The GDP per person
there was 3,983 yuan (about 480 U.S. dollars), 36.3 percent lower
than the nation's average.
</P>
<P>
By the same year, about 14 percent of the villages in the
border areas had no roads, 20 per cent had no access to
electricity and 55 percent had no running water.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development plays a key role in the stability and
development of China's border regions", the deputy minister said.
The campaign will focus on building roads, supplying electricity
and running water, getting rid of illiteracy, improving education
and disseminating sophisticated technology in these areas, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Most Indonesian People Disagree on Aceh's  Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- About 88.5 percent respondents
disagreed on the independence of Indonesia's Aceh province and 72.
3 percent agreed on the government's plan to give the province a
special autonomy package, a survey result said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey result issued by the Center for the Study of
Development and Democracy (Cesda) said that 89.1 percent of
respondents also disagreed on the independence of Irian Jaya
province.
</P>
<P>
The Center said that the survey involved 1,247 respondents aged
above 18 years old and spreading in five big cities in the country,
namely Jakarta, Surabaya (East Java), Medan (North Sumatra),
Banjarmasin (West Kalimantan), Makassar (South Sulawesi).
</P>
<P>
There is a 3 percent margin of errors in the poll, the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Most of respondents also regarded that the main causes of the
separatist movements which have been taking place in Indonesia
were the social and economical gap between Java island and out-
side Java as well as the weakness of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Respondents however agreed and backed the government policy to
soon implement special autonomy bill in Aceh Province in a bid to
calm down separatist movement there.
</P>
<P>
Aceh is the most western province of Indonesia, which has been
demanding for independence and separating from the unitary state
of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an armed separatist group in Aceh
led by Tengku Abdullah Syafei, has been fighting against the
central government for independence since 1976.
</P>
<P>
However, President Abdurrahman Wahid has insisted that he would
not tolerate any separatist movement, warning that his side would
not hesitate to take stern measures against those trying to
separate from the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The central government has pledged to immediately implement the
special autonomy bill for Aceh Province, which has been approved
by the House of Representatives (DPR), and stage the human right
tribunal against those believed to have been involved in human
right abuse and atrocities there.
</P>
<P>
The human right trial is scheduled to be started in early March,
under which some of the Indonesian military (TNI) personnel will
be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Acehnese separatist reportedly have
surrendered to the local police.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the number of the surrenders keeps
increasing while TNI headquarters said the GAM commander has been
injured and "dying" in a gun fighting in Pidie regency couples
days ago.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no independent confirmation on the fate of
the GAM commander, news on the commander's "dying" was denied by
the GAM.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Volcano Erupts, Thousands Fleeing Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Mayon Volcano in the
southeastern part of the Philippines erupted Thursday morning,
sending lava fountains and huge columns of smoke in the sky as
local residents fled their homes to evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (
Phivolcs) said in a bulletin that at 08:26 a.m. local time (0026
GMT) an explosion type earthquake was recorded, which was followed
3 minutes later by pyroclastic flow pouring down the Bonga Gully
at the southeastern side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of Phivolcs, said the villages
along the mountain's southeastern side faces the greatest threats,
because the southeastern crater wall had collapsed in previous
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
That is why lava and other pyroclastic materials that Mayon
spewed out are dumped towards that direction, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2,462-meter Mayon Volcano has erupted at least 40 times
since 1616 and its latest major eruption was in 1993, which killed
some 70 persons.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Mayon is also one of 22 most active volcanoes in the
Philippines, a country which has more than 200 volcanoes
distributed in its whole territory.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs said it raised Mt. Mayon's alert level twice Thursday,
first early Thursday morning from Three to Four, and then at 9 a.m.
from Four to Five.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 4 means the volcano starts spewing lava from the
summit, causing lava flows down while Level 5 indicates eruption
activity, Phivolcs explained.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, no one was reported hurt yet, but residents within
the 8-kilometer danger zone of the volcano were also advised to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists warned that a more violent explosion could occur
at any time.
</P>
<P>
The volcano, lying some 300 kilometers southeast of Manila in
Albay province, on Wednesday night were seen spewing its first
fountain of lava, a blast that occurred for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists said this was among the initial signs of a
forthcoming major blast, following days of lava flow.
</P>
<P>
Ash falls were already reported in the nearby towns of Camalig,
Ligao and Guinobatan in Albay province.
</P>
<P>
As on Thursday afternoon, some 10,000 local residents have fled
the immediate area, but authorities urged thousands more living in
villages up to eight miles away from the crater to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Classes were suspended in schools in Legazpi city in Albay
province and were used as evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Philippine Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo
had arrived in Legazpi, 10 kilometers away from Mayon, on Thursday
noon to assess the conditions of the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo said there would be enough food and provisions for Mayon
refugees housed in the evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
According to Arroyo, who is also Secretary of the Department of
Social Welfare and Development, the department has stockpile of
food and resources enough for 1,000 families in 20 weeks, or about
five months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Arroyo had cautioned local government officials to
submit hasty reports, saying that releases of food and provisions
would be based on their reports.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, who landed at the Pili Airport in the neighboring North
Camarines province, motored to Legazpi City and visited various
evacuation centers, where she talked with local government
officials regarding evacuees problems.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, evacuees have complained of poor
provisions in some evacuation centers, including the lack of
toilets and water.
</P>
<P>
Albay Governor Al Bichara have reportedly ordered the
construction of emergency toilet facilities and the repair of
faucet connections and pumps in those evacuation centers.

Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, shares gave up early gains as later selling
pushed the STI down.
</P>
<P>

sharp falls suffered by the local bourses in earlier sessions.
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted that the news that Singapore's GDP grew by 5.
4 percent in 1999 was largely ignored by the market as it fell

<HEADLINE> Most Indonesian People Disagree on Aceh's  Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- About 88.5 percent respondents
disagreed on the independence of Indonesia's Aceh province and 72.
3 percent agreed on the government's plan to give the province a
special autonomy package, a survey result said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey result issued by the Center for the Study of
Development and Democracy (Cesda) said that 89.1 percent of
respondents also disagreed on the independence of Irian Jaya
province.
</P>
<P>
The Center said that the survey involved 1,247 respondents aged
above 18 years old and spreading in five big cities in the country,
namely Jakarta, Surabaya (East Java), Medan (North Sumatra),
Banjarmasin (West Kalimantan), Makassar (South Sulawesi).
</P>
<P>
There is a 3 percent margin of errors in the poll, the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Most of respondents also regarded that the main causes of the
separatist movements which have been taking place in Indonesia
were the social and economical gap between Java island and out-
side Java as well as the weakness of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Respondents however agreed and backed the government policy to
soon implement special autonomy bill in Aceh Province in a bid to
calm down separatist movement there.
</P>
<P>
Aceh is the most western province of Indonesia, which has been
demanding for independence and separating from the unitary state
of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an armed separatist group in Aceh
led by Tengku Abdullah Syafei, has been fighting against the
central government for independence since 1976.
</P>
<P>
However, President Abdurrahman Wahid has insisted that he would
not tolerate any separatist movement, warning that his side would
not hesitate to take stern measures against those trying to
separate from the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The central government has pledged to immediately implement the
special autonomy bill for Aceh Province, which has been approved
by the House of Representatives (DPR), and stage the human right
tribunal against those believed to have been involved in human
right abuse and atrocities there.
</P>
<P>
The human right trial is scheduled to be started in early March,
under which some of the Indonesian military (TNI) personnel will
be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Acehnese separatist reportedly have
surrendered to the local police.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the number of the surrenders keeps
increasing while TNI headquarters said the GAM commander has been
injured and "dying" in a gun fighting in Pidie regency couples
days ago.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no independent confirmation on the fate of
the GAM commander, news on the commander's "dying" was denied by
the GAM.

<HEADLINE> Some Chief Genocide Suspects May Be Tried in Rwanda: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is examining the
possibility of having some trials of chief genocide suspects heard
in the Rwandan capital Kigali, Tanzanian media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A chamber in the Supreme Court of Rwanda was being refurbished
for the purpose, ICTR Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said
Wednesday in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha where the U.N.
court is based.
</P>
<P>
The intention was to get the Rwandan public to be adequately
informed on trial proceedings on what had happened to their
country, the Daily News quoted the prosecutor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government also wishes to have some case hearing in
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
But ICTR is not under any pressure from anybody to do so, said
Del Ponte.
</P>
<P>
The former Swiss federal prosecutor said she was convinced that
the holding of some trials of chief suspects in places where
crimes were committed will have positive effect in pursuing
justice.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. court has handed down only five verdicts since it was
set up six years ago to try leading architects and perpetrators
involved in the 1994 genocide, in which an estimated 500,000
Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
</P>
<P>
The court has 38 chief suspects in custody in Tanzania.
Rwanda's jam- packed prisons hold 125,000 lesser suspects awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has been conducting its own genocide trials and has so
far tried1, 500 lesser suspects and executed 22 convicts.

<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) agreed on the implementation of the program on social
rehabilitation in Angola, official source said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan Planning Minister Ana Dias Lourenco
who co- signed the agreement with the UNDP representative in
Angola Mesa Zoraida, the program will help improving agricultural
production conditions and stock farming.
</P>
<P>
The program was put forward in 1998 and formalized in last
May. But it has been interrupted for two years by the
recrudescence of the civil conflicts between the Luanda government
and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
According to the program, UNDP and the Angolan government will
finance the social projects in Angola in the domain of
agriculture, stock farming, infrastructure and the development of
the small and mid-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Ana Lourenco said that the emersion of the expectation of
peace in the country has opened wide perspective for the
transition from the emergency state to rehabilitation and
development.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to 1998, UNDP and the Angolan government have
financed some 240 projects at the national level, mainly in the
provinces of Benguela, Huambo, Malange and Uige.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Deregulate Prices of Oil Products by End of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will deregulate the
prices of petroleum products before the end of this year despite
strong opposition, president's chief economic adviser Philip
Asiodu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Such deregulation is necessary because the Nigerian government
simply could not afford the large amount of subsidy to press the
petroleum price down, the News Agency of Nigeria quoted Asiodu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The presidential adviser said that the terrible economic
situation left by several decades of military misrule will be
changed as President Olusegun Obasanjo administration is committed
to rapid development of the economy and improvement in the quality
of lives of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
The progress was under way through its well-thought out program
like the poverty alleviation and economic restructuring in the
oil-producing country, Asiodu said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector will be given the greatest priority for
both poverty reduction in the rural areas as well as the general
improvement of the economy, he added.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean President Meets U.S. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki discussed with U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake the status
of the peace plan initiated by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) in Asmara on Thursday morning, the Eritrean News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not go into the details of their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lake, former U.S. National Security Adviser, arrived in the
Eritrean capital on Wednesday night in a fresh bid to find a
solution to the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia. He is
expected to travel on to Addis Ababa later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy visited the Horn of Africa region several times
last year to mediate an end to the 22-month-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government is also expecting Ahmed Ouyahia,
Algerian Foreign Minister and OAU envoy, in Asmara this Friday.
Ouyahia is currently in Addis Ababa as part of a mission to the
region to push the implementation of the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has officially accepted the OAU peace package while
Ethiopia has objected to the plan, the official Eritrean News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Asmara said Wednesday that fresh fighting had broken
out at the Burie (Assab) front on the border with Ethiopia after
some nine month lull.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government spokesperson Selome Taddesse confirmed
that there were skirmishes at the Burie front in northeast of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides declined to revealed their casualties in
the fighting which stopped quickly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this does not mean the Ethio-Eritrean war
has restarted.
</P>
<P>
During the dry season last year, a heavy round of fighting on
three fronts along the 1,000-km border line left tens of thousands
of soldiers dead in bloody trench warfare.  The two neighbors
took to arms in early May 1998 over the disputed border.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Confirms Fighting With Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
spokesperson Selome Taddesse confirmed that there were skirmishes
between Ethiopia and Eritrea at the Bure front in northeast of
Ethiopia on Wednesday morning and accused Eritrea for starting the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"The skirmish stopped very quickly, and nothing happened in
that region today," the official said on Thursday. She declined to
mention casualties on the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 2,500 troops from Ethiopia and
Eritrean troops were involved in the battle which took place near
Assab, a port city of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Selome said Eritrea was trying to leave people an impression
that Ethiopia is not willing to have political settlement of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
She said Eritrea tried to ask the world community to impose
pressure on Ethiopia as Ahmed Ouyahia, special envoy of Chairman
of the Organization of African Unity, Algerian President Abdul
Aziz Bouteflika, is here for talks with the Ethiopian government
over the peaceful settlement of the Ethio- Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that U.S President special envoy Athony
Lake arrived here last night to mediate the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Selome expressed belief that the latest skirmish between
Ethiopia and Eritrea would not have any influence over the
settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean presidential adviser Yemane Ghebremeskel was quoted
by Reuters as saying that some 1,500 troops were involved in the
fighting on Wednesday and about 200 Ethiopian soldiers were killed
or wounded.
</P>
<P>
So far there's no report about which side started the fresh
fighting after about a year of relative quite.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices jumped up by
nearly one percentage point in January, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
today show that consumer prices and retail prices in January rose
by 0.9 percent and one percent over December.

January last year and the 0.7 percent in January 1998. Retail
prices were 2.1 percent lower than the same period last year.

electricity, fuel gas prices.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that as industrial production continued to
grow at 8.9 percent in January, consumer demand will increase in
the next few months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China's taxation departments
successfully solved more than 30,000 tax evasion cases last year
facilitated by computerized taxation management and supervision
systems.
</P>
<P>
Computers have greatly improved work efficiency and curb tax
evasion crimes.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Chinese tax collectors monitored some 17 million
Chinese taxpayers. Computers were used to collect 710 billion yuan
of taxes in 1999, or 70 percent of industrial and commercial tax
revenues across the country.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments nationwide were equipped with 200,000
computers by the end of last year, with 120,000 enterprises using
an anti-forgery system to tighten tax collection.
</P>
<P>
The anti-forgery system, using a special code to read computer-
printed invoices, proved successful in preventing invoice
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, director of the State Administration of Taxation,
said the computer systems were first applied to value-added tax
invoices worth more than 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 U.S. dollars).
Jin called for more taxation officials to learn how to use the
computer systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical
industry will improve the quality of traditional medicines to
increase its overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) will continue to be used
worldwide if modern technology is adopted to develop high-quality
new drugs," said Zhu Qingsheng, director of the State
Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
</P>
<P>
China is the home of about 13,000 kinds of traditional
medicinal materials and the world's largest TCM producer and
consumer.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, Chinese herbal medicines are not selling
very well on the international market due to problems in quality,
packaging and marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Zhu is confident that traditional
Chinese medicine will find a niche on the international market as
natural therapies and medicines have become popular overseas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's administration is working on a long-term plan to
encourage basic theoretical research, new drug development and
clinical studies in Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the World Health Organization (WHO) has played an
active role in stimulating the research and application of
traditional medicines. An international conference on traditional
medicines will be held in Beijing in April hosted by the WHO and
the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

The situation deserves all costs to monitor people who were
exposed to seven months of inhaling smoke from oil fires resulted
from the burning of over 700 oil wells by the Iraqi troops which
invaded Kuwait in August 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides polluted air, there may have been unclean food and
destroyed sewage system, he added.
</P>
<P>
There is "no doubt that there are quite a good number of victims
of the invasion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have noticed an increasing number of cancer cases and
even leukemia among children. "Every year we record around 30 cases
plus or minus of lung cancer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official said they just want to understand why there
are more cases of leukemia among children and why cancer cases of
the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach are also growing.
</P>
<P>
Although a Gulf War-related syndrome was reported among U.S.
soldiers who took part in the Operation Desert Storm in 1991, no
diseases definitedly connected with the war have so far been
pronounced.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Special U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross is to travel to
Cairo on Thursday to meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
to brief him on the latest effort to revive the stalled peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has been shuttling between the sides this week,
decided to extend his stay through the weekend. He met Wednesday
for the second time with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and is to see
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat for the
second time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Relations between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and Israel took another tumble Wednesday after PNA Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini declared that if visiting VIPs
meet Israeli officials in West Jerusalem, they'll also be invited
to the Orient House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Husseini's declaration came after an embarrassing diplomatic
moment Tuesday when Israel tried to prevent a Jerusalem meeting
between him and European Parliament President Nicole Fontaine. The
meeting finally took place at a French church in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister David Levy astonished the Knesset
(Parliament) Wednesday when he threatened that if Hezbollah
guerrillas hit northern Israel with Katyusha rockets, Lebanon will
burn, and the revenge would be "blood for blood, a child for a
child."
</P>
<P>
Arab legislators said Levy's statement was "immoral incitement",
saying it marked the first time in Israel's history that the
government intends, under certain conditions, to murder Lebanese
children.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
--Hamas officials in Gaza declared Wednesday that the movement
remained unaffected and would continue its resistance, despite the
recent mass arrests of Hamas activists by the Israeli security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The arrests thwarted plans by the movement's Izzadin Kassam
military wing to blow up a large apartment building in Jerusalem or
carry out simultaneous bomb attacks in buses in the coastal city of
Netanya.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives in Iran Pin Hope on Rafsanjani to Strike Power Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Suffering a severe setback in
Friday's parliamentary elections, conservatives in Iran are pinning
their hope on former President Hashemi Rafsanjani to make a balance
between conservatives and reformists in the new Majlis
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
"Rafsanjani is indeed the best choice as next Majlis speaker as
none other parliament member can match him in experience and
competence," the conservative daily Tehran Times said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, by mentioning Rafsanjani's experience as Majlis
speaker in 1980-89 and president in 1989-97, claimed that
Rafsanjani has won a seat in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the official Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday
quoted the latest statistics as saying that Rafsanjani ranked the
28th in Tehran constituency by gaining 24.86 percent of the 2.789
million votes so far counted, less than the minimum 25 percent to
enter the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Although the reformists have seized a majority of seats in the
parliament, they are surely facing an uphill task in the next
legislature for several reasons, the most pressing one is the lack
of unity among members of the May 23 Front, Tehran Times said.
</P>
<P>
The 18 parties comprising the "May 23 Front" in support of
President Mohammad Khatami hold divergent views on some issues,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It said that there are serious differences between the two major
elements of the front, the Assembly of Combatant Clergy (ACC) led
by former speaker Mehdi Karrubi and the Islamic Iran Participation
Front (IIPF) led by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
In this light, many senior politicians believe that Rafsanjani
will be the best choice for the next speaker, who can maintain
unity in the May 23 Front, it said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's reformists have won a landslide victory in the Friday
polls, by bagging 137 seats out of the total of 191 determined.
Meanwhile, 27 top winners in Tehran constituency are from the
reformist lists, though no final result has been announced yet
about the fate of the 30 seats in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
But top reformist leaders have ruled out the possibility of
electing Rafsanjani as the future Majlis speaker since they
strongly opposed his participation in the polling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper also said that the IIPF has planned to ask
President Khatami to reshuffle the cabinet formed by reformists and
pro-Rafsanjani centralists, who maintain close ties with the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Top party officials of the IIPF held a meeting just after their
sweeping victory in the 6th Majlis elections and decided to ask
Khatami to sack at least three ministers, the daily quoted some
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are Education Minister Hossein Mozaffar,
Construction Minister Jihad Mohammad Saeedi-Kiya, and Minister of
Economy Hossein Namazi, whom the daily termed as independents.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily did not elaborate on who would replace the
three ministers.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt. Orders to Shoot on Sight Pipeline Vandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government
Wednesday ordered oil pipeline vandals be "shot on sight", the
News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The order was given to the police following complaints that the
 lingering fuel shortage in some parts of the country was caused
by pipeline vandalization.
</P>
<P>
Layiwola Sanmi, the area manager of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation in Ogun State, said Wednesday that all
efforts made by the corporation to stop the vandals had not
yielded fruit, hence its decision to approach the government and
police for help.
</P>
<P>
According to Sanmi, the "shot on sight" order was given
directly by President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, vandalization is our greatest problem," the manager
said, noting that for any line vandalized, it costs the Nigerian
national petroleum corporation between 1.2 million to 1.6 million
naira (12,000 to 16,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Attack on its Mission in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Thursday condemned Wednesday's attack on the Russian
consulate in Poznan, Poland as "a hooligan action."
</P>
<P>
Pro-Chechen protesters tore off and burnt a Russian flag, and
raised a Chechen flag over the consulate building. They drew a
swastika on the wall of the consulate, claiming they are members
of the "Free Caucasus Committee", the Itar-Tass news agency
reported, noting that Polish police did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
"This was a hooligan action, which deserves the most vigorous
condemnation, and we shall address a protest to the Polish
authorities," Tass quoted Ivanov as saying in Minsk, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived in Minsk Wednesday to attend a joint meeting of
the Collegium of the Belarussian and Russian Foreign Ministries.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were also held Wednesday before the buildings of
the Russian embassy in Warsaw and the Russian consulates in Krakow
and Gdansk.
</P>
<P>
Tass said that the protests, organized by Chechen emissaries
and several Polish anti-Russian organizations, were timed for the
56th anniversary of the start of mass deportation of ethnic
Chechens to Central Asia and Siberia during the Second World War.

<HEADLINE> NASA, Boeing Dispute Over Cost Overruns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A report released
Wednesday said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (
NASA) will keep closer tabs on Boeing Co. due to nearly one
billion U.S. dollars in cost overruns on the International Space
Station (ISS) project.
</P>
<P>
The report by NASA Inspector General Roberta L. Gross blamed
much of the overruns in the 9.8-billion-dollar contract on
Boeing's 1996 acquisition of pieces of Rockwell International Corp.
and the 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Boeing nor its Space and Communications Group promptly
notified NASA about the potential cost increases due to Boeing's
reorganization," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokeswoman Kari Allen said Wednesday that the company
had cooperated with the audit and had already instituted a number
of changes recommended in the report.
</P>
<P>
"The International Space Station is huge developmental program.
We've never done this before," Allen said. "Overruns are never
welcome in any program, but in developmental programs you
certainly can expect it."
</P>
<P>
The Boeing Co. is the prime contractor for the space station
project. With 150 other sub-contractors and other firms, according
to industry sources, Boeing has completed the U.S. laboratory
module and the Unity module, which has been in orbit since
December 15, 1998. It is also working on computer and life-support
systems for the station.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of 16 nations that has pledged to
support the International Space Station, which could welcome its
first crew as early as next year. The station, which will provide
a permanent space laboratory and habitat, is scheduled to complete
in 2004, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ISS project has been plagued by problems due to delays by
the cash-strapped Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
NASA said it is awaiting the delivery and launch of a Russian
control module, and it will launch its own control module by the
end of this year if Russia does not follow through on its
obligations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Air Strikes on Rebels in Southern Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian federal air force
continued air strikes Thursday on militants in the southern
mountains of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Sukhoi-24 front-line bombers, Sukhoi-25 attack aircraft and Mi-
24 helicopter gunships hit rebel positions in Argun and Vedeno
gorges and the area of Shatoi, the Interfax news agency reported,
quoting the headquarters of the federal forces in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 combat missions were flown a day earlier,
destroying 11 rebel strongholds, four fortified areas, two large
caliber machine-gun positions, one air defense installation, one
communication center, four fortified firing positions and two
trucks, according to preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal forces brought in more reinforcements to
the southern mountains in the wake of ferocious rebel attempts to
break across the border into neighboring Georgia, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Mi-8 helicopters flew over 200 troops and 1.5 ton of hardware
Wednesday to the border near the village of Omi-Chu, scene of
fierce fighting Tuesday, after three Russian border guards were
killed when Chechen militants tried to fight their way from the
Argun gorge into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday marked the 56th anniversary of the start of mass
deportation of ethnic Chechens to Central Asia and Siberia during
the Second World War. Security was beefed up across Russia and
especially inside the breakaway republic, amid reports of planned
terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The much-feared attacks did not materialize, but the
administrative border between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian
constituent republics is expected to remain closed.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the measures were only temporary, and the
border checkpoints could reopen as early as on Thursday afternoon,
although any new tension could postpone the reopening.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military operation against the rebels last
September following two waves of armed Chechen incursions into
neighboring Daghestan and a series of apartment bombings, also
blamed on Chechen separatists, that killed over 300 people in
Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been driven out of the Chechen capital of
Grozny and other main populated settlements. The bulk of the
remaining militants, estimated at 5,000-6,000, now concentrate in
the southern mountains.

<HEADLINE> French Senate Refuses to Recognize Genocide of Armenians by Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The French Senate has refused to
vote for a law recognizing the alleged genocide of Armenians by
Turkey during World War I.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published earlier this week, the Senate which is
dominated by a right-wing majority said that "neither the French
president nor the government want the discussion of this proposal
of law which risks thwarting the process of reconciliation" among
the nations in the southern Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
The leftwing-dominated French National Assembly has voted a law
to recognize the alleged genocide, in which Armenia said 1.3
million Armenians were killed by Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has rejected the accusation and said 300,000 people died
in the forcible deportation of the Armenians from the Caucasus to
Syria during the war.

<HEADLINE> WWF Welcomes Poland's Move on Vistula River Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) has welcomed the Polish cabinet's recent move to insist that
an independent technical expert group examine all concerns and
alternatives before it makes a final decision on whether to build
a new 250-million-dollar dam on the Vistula River.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Wednesday, WWF Director General
Claude Martin congratulated the Polish government on its
enlightened decision and repeated the WWF's offer to help
facilitate technical assistance and finance for the assessment of
alternative schemes to solve the problems of the existing
Wloclawek dam.
</P>
<P>
In response to the announcement by Polish Minister of Finance
and Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz on Tuesday night on
Polish National Radio, the WWF's Program Coordinator for Poland
Ireneusz Chojnacki said, "This decision could be a very important
turning point for Poland."
</P>
<P>
"It could make Poland the front-runner among EU accession
countries in a new approach to environmental management," he added.
"This is especially significant in the face of the European
Commission's ongoing concerns over Poland's readiness for early
accession due to their poor environmental record."
</P>
<P>
The WWF said that it had informed the president of the European
Commission of this positive development. It is calling for support
from the European Commission and other financial institutions and
bilateral donors to create a Sustainable Development Plan, in
collaboration with the Polish Government, that will provide
benefits for the whole Vistula valley.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has been endeavoring to reach a formal Memorandum of
Understanding with the Polish Environment Ministry to serve as a
basis for the development of this plan since September 1999.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Current Account Surplus Down Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current-account
surplus plunged to 25 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 from the
previous year's 40.5 billion due to increased imports caused by
its economic recovery, the Bank of Korea said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 figure was the largest in South Korea's history.
</P>
<P>
Exports led by key items such as autos, semiconductors,
machinery and heavy and chemical goods hit 145.49 billion dollars
last year while imports totaled 111.68 billion dollars due to oil
and spare parts imports, up 29 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The surplus amounted to 28.72 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the service account ended up l.01 billion dollars in
the red because of increases in overseas spending by travelers,
payment of royalties and consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
Current transfers surplus declined to 1.95 billion dollars last
year from 3.35 billion dollars in 1998 due to reduced remittances
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The capital account registered 580 million dollars of net
inflow in 1999 from 3.25 billion dollars of net outflow in 1998,
with foreign stock investment funds offsetting repayment of
various foreign loans, including those to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
South Korea borrowed 58 billion dollars from the IMF in
December 1997 after it was gripped by a financial crisis caused by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: Chinese FM Spokesman's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China today voiced its strong
dissatisfaction with and resolute opposition to the United States
stance on the Taiwan issue, stating that it has infringed upon
China's sovereignty and grossly interfered in China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at today's
press conference that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and
the Taiwan issue is absolutely China's internal affairs that no
foreign country should interfere in.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was asked to comment on the U.S. State Department's "deep
concern" on "China's threat" to Taiwan contained in a white paper
titled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue" issued by
China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government has made a solemn commitment
to China on the Taiwan issue, but has repeatedly violated the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant commitments by
selling large amounts of arms to Taiwan, while planning to provide
the theater missile-defense (TMD) system to Taiwan. The U.S.
Congress also wants to pass the so-called "Taiwan Security
Enhancement Bill."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said China is concerned about reports that
the Japanese government will allow the Dalai Lama to go to Japan
for a visit.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama is a political exile under the disguise of
religion, who has been engaged in long-term separatist activities,
" he said, adding that China solemnly urges the Japanese
government to honor its commitments it has made so far and not to
let the Dalai Lama enter Japanese territory so as to avoid new
disturbances to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the successor of Michel Camdessus, former
managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Zhu
said China hopes that the IMF will choose its new leader as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan's recent visit
to four African and Asian countries has been crowned with a
complete success.
</P>
<P>
Tang paid an official visit to Mauritania, Tunis, Kuwait and
Iran from February 15 to 23.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Zhu also announced that Russian Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov will pay an official visit to China
from March 2 to 4.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul will
visit China from February 27 to March 2 as a guest of Chinese Vice
Premier Li Lanqing.

<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- In response to a predicted German request for Turkey to free
the detained mayors of three Southeastern cities, Ankara said on
Wednesday that the detentions are internal affairs of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The mayors were arrested on the weekend for allegedly supporting
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting since
1984 for an independent Kurdish state in southeast.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the detentions could lead to a new crisis between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish police Wednesday detained 17 protestors in
Diyarbakir who were demonstrating against the detentions of the
three pro-Kurdish mayors and calling for their release.
</P>
<P>
One of the arrested mayors was from Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest
Kurdish city in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Wednesday that the results
of the recently-held Iranian elections will be instrumental in
improving relations between Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the sweeping victory of the reformists in Iran
will be conducive to a more contemporary and moderate Islam in the
country."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Peace Envoy Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
arrived here early Thursday for a visit to Egypt as part of his
ongoing tour of the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
He is due to hold talks with senior Egyptian officials on means
of pushing forward the stalled peace process, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in Jerusalem Monday, met Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak earlier in the day and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday evening, but no
progress was made towards relaunching the Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of work to be done and the best way to do that
is to get on with it,"Ross said in Jerusalem Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to resolve some of the remaining problems with regard
to the interim issues, we have to get on with the final status
negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians ground to a halt
two weeks ago after a dispute over a long-delayed Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum
caused the two sides to miss the February 13 deadline for working
out a framework agreement for the final peace.
</P>
<P>
However, Ross said the talks would continue amid a desire on
both sides to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
"What I have seen is a clear desire on the part of both sides to
find a way to move forward," Ross told journalists after a meeting
of over two hours with Arafat in Ramallah on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a key mediator in peace negotiations between the
Jewish state and other Arab states and the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov will pay a two-day official visit to Turkey starting
on February 28, Turkish Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov will reportedly be received by Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and also meet with the defense and foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The issues to be covered during Klebanov's visit range from
bilateral relations, particularly on economic issues, to regional
policies on the Caucasus and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As Russian state and private companies are very interested in
Turkey's numerous military tenders, Klebanov is expected to discuss
military bids as well as energy issues during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Turkey meets its gas demands by buying natural gas from Russia,
and this subject is also expected to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the existing pipeline through the Balkans, Russia
is constructing another pipeline, the Blue Stream project, under
the Black Sea to supply gas to Turkey.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki discussed with d the Horn of Africa region several times
last year to mediate an end to the 22-month-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government is also expecting Ahmed Ouyahia,
Algerian Foreign Minister and OAU envoy, in Asmara this Friday.
Ouyahia is currently in Addis Ababa as part of a mission to the
region to push the implementation of the OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea has officially accepted the OAU peace package while
Ethiopia has objected to the plan, the official Eritrean News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Asmara said Wednesday that fresh fighting had broken
out at the Burie (Assab) front on the border with Ethiopia after
some nine month lull.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian government spokesperson Selome Taddesse confirmed
that there were skirmishes at the Burie front in northeast of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides declined to revealed their casualties in
the fighting which stopped quickly.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this does not mean the Ethio-Eritrean war
has restarted.
</P>
<P>
During the dry season last year, a heavy round of fighting on
three fronts along the 1,000-km border line left tens of thousands
of soldiers dead in bloody trench warfare.  The two neighbors
took to arms in early May 1998 over the disputed border.

settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean presidential adviser Yemane Ghebremeskel was quoted
by Reuters as saying that some 1,500 troops were involved in the
fighting on Wednesday and about 200 Ethiopian soldiers were killed
or wounded.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Leave Religious Bigotry, Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo told the nation that Nigeria must leave the line of
religious bigotry and violence if it does want to become great
again, the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president blamed those taking part in the violence in the
northern Kaduna city as "highly unpatriotic", as they tend to deny
the country the current precious opportunity to develop.
</P>
<P>
"What have we really gained from the horror of Kaduna?
Absolutely nothing, except wanton destruction, loss of mutual
trust and belief in the merits of tolerance", Obasanjo  said in a
nationwide broadcast speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We must return to tolerance, constitutionality, decency and
good neighborliness. Extremism in religion, nationalism, or in any
other human emotion is self-destructive in addition to possibly
destroying its victim," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is beginning to regain its
confidence in our nation. We cannot afford to lose the
considerable amount of goodwill that has greeted our transition to
the democratic governance," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"We need that goodwill to sustain our efforts at reconstructing
the country and improving the economic prosperity of every man,
woman and child in this country," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports, the death toll had hit 300 by
late Wednesday during the violent clashes between the Moslems and
Christians in Kaduna over the proposed implementation of the
Islamic Sharia law, despite the deployment of troops in the Kaduna
State.
</P>
<P>
To curb the fresh violence sparkled in areas near Kaduna city,
the Kaduna State government Wednesday had extended the all-day
movement restriction to several other cities near the state's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Heavy presence of police and soldiers were seen on the streets
of Kaduna guarding a highly fragile tranquility Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Shell to Invest $8.6Bln in Nigeria in 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Shell Petroleum Development
Company has announced a planed 8.6 billion-U.S. dollar new
investment in Nigeria for the coming five years, media here
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shell is embarking on an integrated long-term program to develop
both oil and associated gas reserves in Nigeria, John Barry, the
company's development director, said in Lagos Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the investment would be expended on operation
costs while the remaining would be spent on capital projects,
Barry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the new investment, which would be funded through the
traditional joint venture mechanism, is aimed to enhance the
development in indigenous market and achieve a 40 percent
indigenous staff positioning within the next four years in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The huge investment plan of Shell would provide a significant
workload for contractors to always comply with the company's
business principles, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Shell spent 1.9 billion dollars in
Nigeria's oil industry last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- In rural Chongqing in
southwest China, which has the largest group of poor farmers in
China, the number of these farmers has been reduced from 3.6
million to one million by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has a population of some 30 million, 80 percent of
them live in the rural areas of the metropolis. Some 3.66 million
rural people, accounting for 15 percent of the rural population,
lived under the poverty line before the city was upgraded into
China's fourth municipality in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At present, 19 of the 21 poor counties in Chongqing have
eradicated poverty. Over 70 percent of the needy people have
adequate to eat and wear.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Qiya, director of the Municipal Poverty Elimination Office,
said that improvement of their life is due to financial assistance
from all sectors of society and loans.
</P>
<P>
The government of Chongqing organized 21 relief groups
providing farmers with funds, technology and information for
developing local tourist resources, herbal medicine processing and
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Local credit co-ops have granted 10 million yuan in small loans
to help 10,000 rural households develop agriculture and facilitate
farm produce processing and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Coliform Endangers Siberian Tiger's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Coliform has been blamed for
death of Duoduo and sending Meimei into a coma, two female
Siberian tigers in Shenyang in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Vets said the two tigers, brought from Harbin, capital of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, fell sick after eating
frozen meat that went bad.
</P>
<P>
Duoduo and Meimei, both in their twenties, were vulnerable to
sickness. Cold weather worsened their condition. The average life
expectancy for tigers is around 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers said that they had bought 800 kilograms of meat for
the animals before the Chinese Lunar New Year which fell on
February 5. The tigers developed diarrhea and vomiting after
eating the rotten meat on February 10.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers are among the top ten most endangered species
in the world, with only around 300 remaining in the wild. The
Shenyang Zoo has bred and raised 13 Siberian tigers. One of the
tigers had a cesarean which attracted nationwide publicity.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on U.S. Interference of Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China today voiced its strong
dissatisfaction with and resolute opposition to the United States
stance on the Taiwan issue, stating that it has infringed China's
sovereignty and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at today's
press conference that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and
the Taiwan issue is absolutely China's internal affairs that no
foreign country should interfere in.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was asked to comment on the U.S. State Department's "deep
concern" on "China's threat" to Taiwan contained in a white paper
titled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue" issued by
China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government has made a solemn commitment
to China on the Taiwan issue, but has repeatedly violated the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and relevant commitments by
selling large amounts of arms to Taiwan, while planning to provide
the theater missile-defense system to Taiwan. The U.S. Congress
also wants to pass the so-called "Taiwan Security Enhancement Bill.
"
</P>
<P>
All the acts have encouraged the separatist activities of Lee
Teng-hui and the elements for Taiwan's independence, and are
obvious factors leading to the tense situation in the Taiwan
Straits, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the United States is really concerned with
peace and stability in the Taiwan region, it should stick to the
one China policy and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. The U.
S. should also halt all arm sales to Taiwan and prevent the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Bill from becoming law, added Zhu.

Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Tang paid an official visit to Mauritania, Tunis, Kuwait and
Iran from February 15 to 23, during which he held talks with
foreign ministers and met with leaders of the four countries,

Tang exchanged views with leaders and officials of the four
countries on strengthening cooperation in political, economic and
cultural areas. They also touched upon such issues as the
establishment of a new international political and economic order,
the Middle East peace process, the Persian Gulf situation, and the
issue of Iraq, and reached broad-based consensus, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The four countries all expressed that they attach importance to
developing relations with China, and that they are willing to
deepen cooperation and coordination with China at the United
Nations and on other international occasions to protect and
develop the rights of developing countries, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The visit has promoted friendship and understanding between
China and the four African and Asian countries, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Schoolchildren in China Overworked: Survey (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- "It's me who carries the
heaviest schoolbag/It's me who has the most homework/and it's me
who is the first to get up and the last to go to bed." So reads a
popular song set to new lyrics by primary and middle school
students in China.
</P>
<P>
An official survey shows that a half of primary and middle
school students are overworked and do not get enough sleep.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the National Committee for Young Pioneers' Work and
the China Juvenile Research Center conducted a survey among a
group of urban and rural students aged between 6-14 years on hours
spent on homework and in the classroom and how many hours they
slept each night.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that 67.2 percent of urban children and 45.
6 percent of rural students aged between 6-8 spent more hours on
homework a day than the half an hour regulation; 36.8 percent of
students in the city and 26.3 percent in the countryside aged
between 9-12 spent more hours than the one hour regulation; 20.6
percent of junior high school students in cities and 20.1 percent
of their counterparts in the countryside spent more hours on than
the hour and a half regulation.
</P>
<P>
These students also spent more hours in schools than what is
required according to relevant state standards.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 46.9 percent of these students did not
get the required nine-hour sleep per day, 26.1 percent slept eight
hours a day, 12.6 percent seven hours a day and 8.2 percent less
than seven hours.

<HEADLINE> Schoolchildren in China Overworked: Survey (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 1998 survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in
10 provinces revealed that primary and middle school students
stayed at school for an average of 8.8 hours a day. It took two
hours for 80 percent of primary school students to finish their
daily homework but for junior high school students it took more
than two hours.
</P>
<P>
For senior high school students, homework was escalating due to
the increasing pressure to get high grades and pass the national
examination for entering university or college. There is also
enormous pressure on teachers as well.
</P>
<P>
Another survey by the China Juvenile Research Center and the
Beijing Normal University indicates that only 8.4 percent primary
school students surveyed like school, while 10.7 percent of junior
high school students are of the same opinion. Extra-curricular
activities such as scientific experiments, working on the computer
and reading are the three most enjoyed activities for these
students.
</P>
<P>
Some experts pointed out that many schools and parents are
pushing their children to the limits to perform even better at
school, depriving them of their necessary sleep.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that it is wrong to deprive children of sleep so
they can spend more time on homework and studies, and call for an
end to the practice.

</P>

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches All-out Effort to Stop TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (
WHO) and its partners are making an all-out effort to control the
further spread of tuberculosis (TB) in the Western Pacific Region,
WHO Regional Director Shigeru Omi said Thursday in a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Omi made the remarks as TB experts and high-level government
officials from the region were holding a meeting in Manila from
Monday to review and finalize a strategic plan to stop TB in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is scheduled to conclude Thursday, will also
identify resource requirement and specify international agencies
to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to Omi, almost 30 percent of the global tuberculosis
burden is in the Western Pacific Region and 70 percent of the
patients are in the 15 to 54 age group, the most productive
segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
Omi said the regional notification rate of new infectious cases
per 100,000 population increased steadily from 17 in 1993 to 24 in
1998, prompting the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific
declared 1999 as a year of the TB crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Omi noted that the disease poses a serious health problem not
only in developing countries but in newly industrialized and
developed countries as well due to lack of political commitment
and increasing movement of people.
</P>
<P>
He warned that tuberculosis will continue to spread unless
drastic measures are taken now with greater political commitment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he stressed, the number of TB/HIV co-infection cases,
although still low regionwide, is expected to rise over the next
few years, particularly, if no significant action is taken.
</P>
<P>
WHO aims to reduce TB cases in the Western Pacific Region by
half from 2000 to 2010 through appropriate control measures using
the DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) strategy.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, WHO declared tuberculosis as a global emergency and,
in 1998, launched the STOP TB initiative to push TB control
further up on the political agenda. However, only limited progress
was made in controlling the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Implementing the Vietnam-China
Land Border Treaty signed here in December 1999 is one of the
three goals outlined by Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien
to boost the bilateral ties in 2000, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two remaining goals, Nien said, are to accelerate the
negotiations for an agreement on the delimitation of the Bei Bu
Gulf, to raise two-way trade value to 2 billion U.S. dollars and
carry out agreements reached during the visit to Vietnam by
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji in last December.
</P>
<P>
Nien outlined these goals during his interview with Vietnamese
Communist Party's daily Nhan Dan in anticipation of his three-day
official visit to China from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is his first tour abroad since Nien took the post of foreign
minister in late January.
</P>
<P>
Nien stressed that Vietnam and China enjoy four fundamental
advantages to strengthen mutual trust and boost bilateral
friendship and comprehensive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he is optimistic about achieving
above-mentioned targets.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-combatants Invade Farms for Land Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ex-combatants in
southern Masvingo Province Wednesday invaded four more farms,
bringing the number of farms invaded over the past week to seven,
the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Masvingo Provincial War Veterans' Association Chairman
Munyaradzi Mhike confirmed the invasions and said the
ex-combatants would invade more farms in the province.
</P>
<P>
Mhike pointed out that the invasions should not be misconstrued
to be a threat to the white farmers.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the ex-combatants' action was an
expression of the need to resolve the land imbalance and the
urgent need to have land redistributed.
</P>
<P>
Although he could not give details of the exact number of
ex-combatants involved in the invasion, the Herald is reliably
informed that there are about 400 of them.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that at least 100 ex-combatants are believed
to have earlier invaded the three unnamed farms.
</P>
<P>
With the rate of invasion already sending chills down the
spines of the white farmers in the vast province, Masvingo
Provincial Governor Josaya Hungwe Wednesday travelled to Harare to
give a "comprehensive report" on the issue to Vice-President
Joseph Msika.
</P>
<P>
With all 1.6 million hectares of land identified for
designation in Masvingo Province contested in court, the
ex-combatants had hoped that a new constitution would provide a
lasting solution to their problems.
</P>
<P>
Their hopes were dashed when the majority of voters rejected
the draft constitution in a national referendum held two weeks
ago.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 12 Injured In California Prison Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 23 (Xinhua) -- One inmate was killed and
12 were injured when guards opened fire Wednesday to stop what
officials called a race riot at the Pelican Bay maximum security
prison in northern California.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the riot broke out in two prison yards at 9:30 a.
m. local time when about 200 black and Hispanic prisoners attacked
each other with a variety of crudely fashioned weapons, including
knives. The fighting lasted half an hour.
</P>
<P>
A California Department of Corrections spokesman said that in
addition to those injured by gunfire from the guards, there were "
multiple inmates with stab wounds." The injured were taken to
local hospitals by a fleet of 16 ambulances.
</P>
<P>
Guards opened fire to stop the riot when repeated bursts of
tear gas had failed to stop the melee and when they thought a
prisoner's life was threatened by another prisoner, spokesman
Steve Green said.
</P>
<P>
The riot was fueled by racial disputes between the black and
Hispanic inmates in a recreation yard at the prison that houses
some of the state's most dangerous inmates in northern California.
</P>
<P>
A special state investigative team was flown in from Sacramento
to examine Wednesday's riot, CNN reported.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's death was the first time since May 1997 when an
inmate had been killed during a prison disturbance in California.
</P>
<P>
The prison, which opened in 1989, is situated on 270 acres of
forest land 20 miles on the rugged northern California Coast south
of the Oregon state line.
</P>
<P>
Built for 2,280 inmates, according to local officials, the
facility now houses 3,400. About 1,200 are in permanent lockdown
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Many inmates were sent to Pelican Bay after being involved in
violence at other California prisons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The construction of No. 4
reactor of South Korean Uljin Nuclear Power Plant was completed in
North Kyongsang Province Thursday after seven years and seven
months.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear reactor is the second one built with South Korea's
own technology which brings the number of the country's nuclear
reactors to 16.
</P>
<P>
South Korea now has four nuclear power plants with 16 reactors
with a total capacity of 13.72 million kilowatt. The four plants
are located in Youngkwang, Kuri, Wolsung and Uljin, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 16 nuclear reactors now account for 29 percent of power
generating facilities and supply over 40 percent of the country's
electric power.
</P>
<P>
Of 14 more nuclear reactors South Korea has decided to build
before the year 2015, four are under construction.
</P>
<P>
"Reactors are the most ideal energy source for a country like
ours that lacks natural resources," said Prime Minister Park Tae-
joon at a ceremony marking the 16th reactor's completion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrialist Predicts Death Of Wired Phones In 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 23 (Xinhua) -- In 5 years most people
will be using wireless telephones for both voice communication and
Internet access, not traditional telephone lines, Irwin Mark
Jacobs, chief executive officer of high-flying mobile phone
technology company Qualcomm Inc. said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"More and more we are going to see a situation where a wire
telephone hooked to a wall will become an object of some surprise,
" Jacobs said at conference held here on the topic of growth
company stocks.
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Qualcomm, which holds a patent on so-called
CDMA wireless chips, currently has about 50 million subscribers
that use its technology and could add 20-30 million by 2001,
Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
The technology of CDMA, or code division multiple access, takes
information contained in a signal and spreads it over a wide
bandwidth. More than 75 companies have so far been licensed to use
Qualcomm's technology.
</P>
<P>
"Just 15 years ago people said we would be lucky if there were
over a million subscribers by the turn of the century," Jacobs
noted.
</P>
<P>
But growth has come at a much higher rate due largely to
falling per-minute prices for cell phone usage, Jacobs pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Qualcomm is now working to develop technology for wireless
communication through airlinks to antennas that let electronic
devices like phones, computers and printers communicate with each
other and the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a trade
deficit of 8.3 billion U.S. dollars with Japan in 1999, up from
the previous year's 4.6 billion, the Commerce, Industry and Energy
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said South Korea saw a trade surplus of 23.9
billion dollars, a drop of 15.1 billion dollars from 39 billion
dollars in 1998 and that Japan was blamed for the drop.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade deficit with Japan declined every year
until 1998. It fell to  13.1 billion in 1997 from 15.7 billion in
1996 and then to 4.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the Middle East, the country saw deficit growing to 8.3
billion dollars from 4.8 billion dollars due to the rise in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the nation's surplus with the United States and the
European Union rose.
</P>
<P>
It posted a surplus of 4.6 billion dollars with the United
States last year, up from 2.4 billion dollars in 1998 while its
surplus with the European Union rose to 7.6 billion from 7.2
billion dollars.

<P>
By late 1999, the amount of outstanding loans for housing
climbed to 23.3 billion yuan in Shenzhen, 8.3 billion yuan more
than the figure at the beginning of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China will start the second
stage of dredging the Dianchi Lake, the sixth largest of China's
fresh water lakes.
</P>
<P>
The project, approved by the State Development Planning
Commission, will invest 147 million yuan. Some 2.25 million cubic
meters of silt will be dredged from the bottom of the Lake. The
project is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, on a high plateau in southwest China's Yunnan
Province covers an area of 307 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's water has become murky because of
industrial and domestic waste discharged into the Lake over the
past 20 years. Algae is also causing problems.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Provincial Environmental Department launched a clean-
up project in March last year. The 250-million-yuan (30 million U.
S. dollars) project has resulted in the removal of 4.2 million
cubic meters of silt on a 2.8-square-kilometer area. The depth of
the lake increased by one meter when the dredging project was
completed.

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China is intensifying its
drive to crack down on illegal drug dealing to improve domestic

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector,

<HEADLINE> Zambia Builds up Security Along Border With Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has deployed troops
along its border with Angola following recent attacks on villages
by suspected Angolan rebel forces, the Post newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian troops are now in full control of the border areas,
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Newstead Zimba was quoted
as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimba, who is also chief government spokesman, said that his
government is taking measures to ensure Zambians living along the
Angolan border are safe.
</P>
<P>
"That area is flooded and the situation is unclear, the army
has been deployed there," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said that his
country shall not allow the Angolans to fight in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Sampa told the press that the situation at the Zambian border
with Angola has returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zambian security personnel had been deployed
along the border and that the "bandits" who attacked the Zambian
villages two weeks ago had since deserted the area.
</P>
<P>
Sampa said the appeal by the Angolan government to fight the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels
from the Zambian territory had not been accepted because it would
just escalate war in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambian villagers in Chavuma area have reportedly been
attacked by suspected UNITA rebels, leaving most villagers in fear
while others have fled their homes.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Kills 2, Leaves 250,000 Homeless In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Eline's heavy rains and
strong winds in the eastern and southern districts of Zimbabwe on
Wednesday killed two people, swept away at least eight major
bridges and left some 250,000 people homeless and without food,
the daily Herald reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tropical storm is sweeping Zimbabwe from neighboring
Mozambique two days ago.
</P>
<P>
There are 130,000 affected families and it is suspected that
hundreds of people will have to be rescued from shrinking islands
of higher ground and trees.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Department of Civil Protection Madzudzo
Pawadyire Wednesday said the government started to use its
strategic grain reserve to help the people in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo
said in a statement on Wednesday that there was a big risk of
flooding in the Zambezi Valley in north Zimbabwe owing to the
opening of floodgates at Kariba Dam on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The combined effects of the water released from Kariba Dam and
the substantial rains this season are likely to increase the risk
of flooding downstream," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the communities to move to higher ground before
Saturday until the river subsides to its usual level.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Meteorological Services said the tropical
cyclone had now changed to a tropical depression and had weakened
in intensity.
</P>
<P>
This could result in the amount of rainfall decreasing,
although there are chances that it could still get heavy.

<HEADLINE> Scores Bring Tension Among Children, Parents, and Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Though the Ministry of
Education has been carrying out regulations to lessen the
schooling burden of students in primary and middle schools in
China, the score-oriented educational system has still made it
hard to win applause from teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education stipulates that all the primary and
middle schools abolish the usual practice of deciding students'
position in the class only by their scores, and grades are to
become confidential when the new term begins this March.
</P>
<P>
However, score-oriented education in China may make it hard for
quality-oriented and talent-inspired education to go onto the
stage, said officials with the Fuzhou Educational Administration,
south China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
It has been a routine ever since the founding of New China in
1949 that scores is the crucial factor in deciding the students'
enrollment into the high schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
About 35.1 percent of the 950 children and 42.7 percent of the
964 parents under the recent survey in north China's Tianjin agree
that scores, not behavior, nor lack of independence, decide on the
relationships among the two generations.
</P>
<P>
The scores has also been the decisive factor in the
relationships of teachers and students. Teachers in Fuzhou seem to
be always critical to their students, those with low grades in
particular, said the students under the poll.
</P>
<P>
Those children also said they feel suppressed, for neither the
parents nor the teachers seem to care at all about their minds,
the only criterion in judging an outstanding student is his or her
school transcript. There exist no heart-to-heart contact and
exchange of attitudes among students and teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
A survey among Beijing primary school pupils shows that 46.8
percent admit that they are afraid of some of their teachers, and
52.5 percent said that they feel anxious when they are required to
go to the teachers' office.
</P>
<P>
The uneasy feeling has discouraged the children to speak their
unhappiness and true feelings out to the adults. And anxiety about
scores has even caused some extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
Xu Li, a high school student in east China's Zhejiang Province
beat his mother to death when his mother warned him again and
again that he had to increase his position in his class among the
top ten from the 18th last semester.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the city educational administration point out
that in the older generation's mind, strict requirements and
authority maintenance all the time are the only means to help the
children enter the higher educational institutions and turn into
well-behaved youths.
</P>
<P>
However, parents and teachers can succeed in nurturing the
children into good-mannered ladies and gentlemen only by their own
doings, not by sermons and poker faces, said psychologists.
</P>
<P>
If they want children to say "sorry" to them when the kids do
wrongs, and to say "thank you" to them when they get help from the
adults, the older generation should show the young with their own
conduct. Good school transcripts do not necessarily bring the
adults a good boy or a girl, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Sector Appeals to Overseas Developers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Overseas real estate
developers are competing for China's vast market and expect to
profit well from their investments.
</P>
<P>
According to Song Chunhua, vice-minister of construction, more
than 5,000 overseas real estate enterprises, or 20 percent of the
country's total, have participated in real estate development in
China.
</P>
<P>
Song said that more than 4 billion yuan in overseas investment
pours into China's real estate development every year. Overseas
real estate developers enjoy a series of preferential policies
which include exemption from investment regulatory taxes, easy
access to raising of funds, and the freedom to remit their gains
abroad after paying relevant taxes.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the investment structure of China's real
estate sector has greatly improved due to the introduction of a
new housing reform policy. Most of the overseas funds have been
channeled into construction of residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the real estate industry will shift its focus
from key cities to small and medium-sized cities and towns, and
from coastal areas to China's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
China's housing construction is expected to grow at an annual
rate of 15 percent in the next century. By 2005, China will build
an additional 1.5 billion sq. m of housing in urban areas, 3.5
billion sq. m of housing in rural areas, and renovate 2.9 billion
sq. m of rundown houses.

<HEADLINE> Senior Myanmar Official for Introducing Law on SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar official
Wednesday stressed the need to promote small and medium
enterprises(SMEs) in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session here of a workshop on AFTA
process and AICO scheme, Brigadier-General Abel, Myanmar minister
at the Office of the Chairman of the State Peace and Development
Council, said that the SMEs have the potential to play a
significant role in the framework of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA),
liberalization of services, ASEAN Industrial Cooperation(AICO)
scheme and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA).
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for his country to promulgate its own
SME policy and law.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that Myanmar's SMEs are not as developed as in
other ASEAN countries, and are not regionally competitive, the
minister pointed out that they can increase the growth of the
country's economy and supplement imports.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that Myanmar's SMEs, as in other countries,
face many problems such as lack of technology, finance,
information and human resources development, and called for
seeking ways and means to minimize and eliminate these problems.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal year 1998-99, he noted, Myanmar has only 453
enterprises employing more than 100 workers, accounting for 0.8
percent of the total enterprises in the processing and
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 0.26 percent is in the private sector, a negligible
number in the cooperative sector and the rest in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
He added that enterprises employing less than ten workers
accounted for almost 95 percent of the sector, of which almost 92
percent are in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, which began Wednesday, is sponsored by
the Myanmar Institute of Strategic and International Studies and
Sasakawa Peace Foundation of Japan with the support of National
AFTA Unit.

<HEADLINE> TB Still Taking Heavy Toll in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has some 80,000 TB (
Tuberculosis) patients and 8,000 to 11,000 of them die every year,
according to Dirgha Singh Bam, Director of the National
Tuberculosis Center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day world conference on TB that began
Wednesday, Bam said that TB is still a major health problem in the
world, especially in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and TB coexist in a vicious circle, as poor individuals,
poor communities and poor countries have the highest rates of TB
that impoverishes those with the disease, according to experts who
presented their working papers at the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, about three million cases of TB occur
each year in the South Asia countries, representing 40 percent of
cases worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Closely followed DOTS (Direct Observation Treatment Short
Course) will go a long way toward putting a lid over the growing
number of TB patients, said the experts at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Since Nepal adopted DOTS strategy in 1996, 55 percent of the
total population has been covered and the cure rate is more than
85 percent,which is very encouraging experience, according to Bam.
</P>
<P>
About 120 representatives from 18 countries worldwide are
participating in the conference, which aims to raise awareness
about TB control and to empower individuals and organizations with
skills, motivation and knowledge to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized by TB. Net, a three-year old global
TB network based in Nepal which maintains an Internet resource
center for TB control.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Meets China's NPC Vice-Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark met here Thursday with visiting Vice-Chairman of China
's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee Zhou
Guangzhao and the NPC delegation headed by him.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhou conveyed Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
cordial regards to Prime Minister Helen Clark and expressed the
hope that Ms Clark would visit China again at a time convenient to
her.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark, who visited China in 1997 in the capacity of
opposition leader, recalled her meeting with Premier Zhu during
the trip. She asked Vice-Chairman Zhou to convey her best wishes
to Premier Zhu and said she would like to visit China again.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sino-New Zealand relations, Zhou noted that New
Zealand was one of the earliest west countries to recognize the
People's Republic of China. The diplomatic ties between China and
New Zealand, he said, were established as early as 70s when the
New Zealand Labor Party was in power.
</P>
<P>
He highly appreciated the development of friendly relations and
exchanges between the two countries and between the two
parliaments in particular in the past decades, and hoped to see
the relations steadily growing in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Clark noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to New Zealand last September was very successful. She said
she was very glad to have a meeting with President Jiang during
his visit.
</P>
<P>
She said the new government with the New Zealand Labor Party as
its main ruling party values relations with China and will work
for closer New Zealand-China ties.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Vice-Chairman Zhou had separate meetings with New
Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff; Minister
of Research, Science and Technology Pete Hodgson; and Opposition
Leader Jenny Shipley. He and his delegation attended a
parliamentary luncheon hosted by Jonathan Hunt, speaker of the New
Zealand Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation is scheduled to leave here for Auckland, the
biggest city in the country, before leaving for home on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Trade Position Better in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected slump in
imports brought New Zealand's trade position unexpectedly into
balance in January, according to preliminary figures released here
Thursday by Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Imports in January were 1.78 billion NZ dollars (872.1 million
U.S. dollars), well down from 3.15 billion NZ dollars (1.54
billion U.S. dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
Matching that were estimated exports of 1.78 billion NZ dollars
(872.1 million U.S. dollars), down from 2.05 billion NZ dollars (
one billion U.S. dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
It is a good news for New Zealand's current account deficit
which has been projected by the Treasury and Finance Department
and the Reserve Bank to blow out to around 7.5-8.0 percent of GDP
in March, a level considered horrendous and unsustainable by
economists.
</P>
<P>
Just after release of the figures, the New Zealand dollar
firmed to 48.94 cents of the U.S. dollar while it opened at 48.59
cents of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The official statistical department was unable to say whether
the drop in January's imports was sustainable.
</P>
<P>
It said it will release a more definite figure for exports on
March 9th.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Concerned With SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Xu Gui, a team leader of the
Ciyaobao Coal Mine in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, is busy gathering information about his fellow workers'
job satisfaction these days.
</P>
<P>
As a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), Xu
will forward the opinions and proposals of industrial workers to
the Ninth NPC Third Session, which begins March 5.
</P>
<P>
Xu, 47, has worked in the coal mine for 30 years. He solicits
the opinions of coal miners during the day and writes his
proposals at night.
</P>
<P>
Based on the comments he received, he suggested at two previous
NPC sessions that the No. Two Power Plant in Ningxia be built and
some small local coal mines be torn down, and all of his ideas
have been accepted.
</P>
<P>
"At the upcoming session, I am going to put forward suggestions
on reforming the state-owned enterprises (SOE), and how the sector
can play its part in the development of western China and protect
the lawful rights and interests of workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals he is to put forward include the establishment
of a social security system, legalization of orderly market
competition, and creation of a favorable environment for getting
state-owned enterprises out of financial trouble.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Secretary Heralds Enactment of MTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang welcomed the enactment of the Mass Transit
Railway (MTR) Bill by the Legislative Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"From the perspective of enhancing Hong Kong's financial
markets, the listing of MTRC, a high quality and heavily
capitalized company, will add diversity and stability to the stock
market. A successful public offering will clearly help buttress
Hong Kong's status as an international financial center," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
The MTR Bill provides the legislative framework to replace the
MTRC as a statutory corporation with a limited liability company,
to be known as MTR Corporation Limited, and to award the MTR
franchise to that company.
</P>
<P>
It also sets out the regulatory framework for the privatized
entity, which serves to balance and safeguard the interests of
both the users and investors.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the bill is an important step towards the
planned privatization of a minority share of the MTR Corporation (
MTRC) later this year, as announced in the 1999 Budget speech.
</P>
<P>
"The MTRC has built up over the years a reputation, both
locally and internationally, as a government-owned statutory
corporation providing efficient and high quality railway services,
" said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
"It is also one of the very few railways in the world operating
profitably and on prudent commercial principles with no subsidy
from Government. The privatization of the MTRC will offer a prime
opportunity for Hong Kong citizens to participate in the success
of this solid, well managed company with strong growth potential"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of private ownership will strengthen market
discipline in the running of this world-class railway, on top of
the keen competition from other transport modes that MTRC faces,
promoting even higher levels of efficiency, said a spokesman for
the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Privatization will also provide MTRC with the flexibility to
raise equity financing from capital markets through the issue of
new shares. Such enhanced access to capital markets will expand
the range of financing alternatives for MTRC to improve and
develop the railway network, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> HK Officials Welcome Enactment of Bourses Merger Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial
Secretary Donald Tsang welcomed the enactment of the Exchanges and
Clearing Houses (Merger) Bill by the Legislative Council Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that it is an essential step for the proposed merger
of the exchanges and the clearing houses, which is an integral
part of the market structure reform announced in the budget speech
last year.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to see that the merger proposal has received
support from all quarters, including members of the two exchanges,
the financial market, legislators and the public at large," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The next step will be the implementation of the merger
scheduled to take place on March 6. The international financial
community has been watching this swift development with envy. I am
glad that Hong Kong has once again demonstrated our ability to
respond quickly to competition and challenges," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, a new holding company, known as the Hong Kong
Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEC), will be set up as a result
of the planned demutualization and merger of Hong Kong's stock
exchange, futures exchange and clearing houses.
</P>
<P>
HKEC will be a public listed company owned by private investors
and the government, but the government's role would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the market reform is to enhance the Hong Kong stock
market's competitiveness to meet the challenge of an increasingly
globalized market place driven by advancement of technology and
the emergence of a growing population of sophisticated investors,
Hong Kong officials said.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to increase transparency and efficiency,
open up the field to more players and ultimately attract more
companies to list in Hong Kong, officials said.

<HEADLINE> 2ndlead: Mayon Volcano Erupts, Top Alert Level Declared (EDS: Updates with top alert level declared.) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The maximum alert level of 5
has been declared on Mayon Volcano at 09:45 a.m. local time (0145
GMT)Thursday following the sighting of magma in its crater and the
upheaval of pyroclastic flow, said the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs said in a bulletin that at 08:26 a.m. local time (0026
GMT) an explosion type earthquake was recorded, which was followed
3 minutes later by pyroclastic flow pouring down the Bonga Gully
at the southeast side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
But so far, there was no report on damages or casualties, the
Phivolcs added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some 4,000 residents from towns near Mayon Volcano's 7-
kilometer permanent danger zone have flied to evacuation centers
due to the increased volcano activity.
</P>
<P>
The alert level on Mayon Volcano was raised to the top level of
5 only hours after Phivolcs assigned level 4 over Mayon early
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Phivolcs, alert level 4 means that the volcano
will start spewing lava form the summit, causing lava flows down
the southeastern flanks of the mountain while level 5 indicates
eruption activity.
</P>
<P>
Mayon Volcano, lying about 300 kilometers southeast of Manila,
began to show unstable signs since June 22, 1999 and its latest
major eruption was in 1993, which killed some 70 persons.
</P>
<P>
Mayon volcano, which reaches up to around 2,462 meters above
sea level and has 250 square kilometers in area, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Mayon is one of 22 most active volcanoes in the Philippines,
a country which has more than 200 volcanoes distributed in its
whole territory.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Closes Tax Loopholes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Board of
Investment(BOI) has introduced new rules to close tax loopholes in
its incentive system in a bid to help raise revenue, the official
Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules appropriate minimum investment limits will
be imposed on all incentive categories to ensure that BOI
incentives are available only for priority sector investment
activities, BOI Chairman Thilan Wijesinghe said.
</P>
<P>
"The BOI hopes to work closely with other government agencies
to ensure revenue collection happens in a systematic and
coordinated manner and to prevent abuses," Wijesinghe was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a Revenue Protection Unit comprising full-time
officers of the BOI, Inland Revenue and Customs departments is to
be set up to strengthen the revenue enforcement laws and prevent
abuse of concessions.
</P>
<P>
Wijesinghe said the new agency will take action to ensure that
revenue due to the government will be collected on a systematic
basis,disputes are expeditiously resolved and computerized
monitoring systems are in place.
</P>
<P>
While incentives for regional industrialization will continue,
a tax holiday of five years and eight years will be granted only
to industries located within a designated industrial park or
export processing zone.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year tax holiday will remain for projects with a total
investment of over 3.5 billion rupees (48 million U.S. dollars) or
flagship projects.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Ruling Coalition Breaks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean ruling
coalition was dissolved Thursday morning as the United Liberal
Democrats (ULD) declared an end of partnership with the ruling
Millennium Democratic Party (MDP).
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to completely give up the road to the ruling
coalition and be newly born," said ULD President Lee Han-dong at a
press conference attended by ULD founder and honorary chairman Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The declaration demonstrated an end to a ruling coalition
government system that was made by an agreement between President
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil before the 1997 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two Kims agreed to change the nation's
constitution by 1999 to create a parliamentary cabinet system.
</P>
<P>
"It was the common goal of the coalition government and a
promise to the people to open a new era of hope through the grand
reconciliation of industrial and democratic forces. But the
promise was completely broken," said the ULD president.
</P>
<P>
ULD cabinet members, including Prime Minister Park Tae-joon,
will individually decide whether to resign or stay in the ULD, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the breakup, the South Korean presidential
office expressed deep regret over the ULD's declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the ULD to maintain the spirit of cooperation in
state affairs as one of two axis that have realized the power
shift and the overcoming of the economic crisis," Presidential
spokesman Park Joon-young said.
</P>
<P>
The breakup came after non-governmental groups put ULD honorary
chairman Kim Jong-pil on a unqualified-politician list for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The ULD has repeatedly attacked its coalition partner MDP,
saying that the latter is abetting the non-governmental groups'
smear campaign against the ULD leader.
</P>
<P>
The breakup is believed to turn the parliamentary elections
into a battle between the ruling MDP and three opposition parties -
- the Grand National Party GNP, the ULD, and a GNP splinter, which
has not been named after it dropped out from the GNP last Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhang, who works in this
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, is addicted to
buying welfare lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased if I get some small prize--even as little as
fifty yuan (6 US dollars)," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
To date, about 800 computer lottery ticket sales outlets have
been set up in Shenyang, which has a population of 6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
While Zhang limits herself to only a couple of tickets per week,
some citizens are spending big bucks in hopes of collecting the
top prize.
</P>
<P>
A man surnamed Dai, who sells lottery tickets, said that every
Wednesday, before the winning number is chosen randomly by
computer, long queues of hundreds of people form outside his
office window.
</P>
<P>
And some people see the lottery as something more than a chance
to make a fortune. An elderly couple bought a lottery ticket with
the number 650628 -- the date of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
"We don't care if we win, we just want to recall some beautiful
memories," they said.
</P>
<P>
The lottery is designed to help develop local social welfare
services.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Postpones Petro Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
deferred on Wednesday night a proposed hike in the prices of
petroleum products across the country till the middle of next
month due to pressure from its allies, local media reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed price hike for products like diesel, kerosene and
cooking gas, which was expected to be announced in the parliament
on Thursday, has been deferred by more than two weeks, the Times
of India quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has suggested the price hike as a measure
to save subsidies on petroleum products, which are surging rapidly
due to the rising crude oil prices in the international market.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), or Indian
People's Party, met a strong opposition from some of its allied
parties on this issue, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Those against the price hike argued that such a step would
severely hit the ordinary people and have a cascading effect on
the prices of items of daily use.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested the government mobilize alternative
resources to prevent an immediate hike in petroleum prices, said
the Times of India.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the ruling alliance on Wednesday, the
government changed its mind and decided to postpone the price hike.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India quoted a senior government official as
saying that the ruling coalition should remain united in the face
of attempts by the Congress and other opposition parties to put
the government on the mat.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees Strong Recovery in 1999: MTI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore economy enjoyed a
strong and firm economic recovery in 1999 and is expected to
maintain the growth momentum in 2000, Ministry of Trade and
Industry (MTI)said in its 1999 national economic survey released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Singapore economic output expanded by 5.4 percent in 1999,
after an anemic 0.4 percent growth in 1999, with all major sectors
except the construction and business services improving in the
year compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The growth was largely led by the 6.7 percent expansion in
external demand and propped mainly by growth in manufacturing,
transport &AMP; communications, wholesale &AMP; retail trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, manufacturing sector, riding on the strength of the
global electronics demand and the regional recover, staged a
strong turnaround to grow by 14 percent. The whole sale &AMP; retail
trade sector reversed the 4.1 percent decline in 1998 to see a 7.1
percent recovery and the transport &AMP; communications sector also
enjoyed a 7.1 percent growth on the back of the 5.5 percent growth
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The hotels &AMP; restaurants sector expanded by 3.7 percent last
year helped by the recovery in visitor arrivals and improving
consumer sentiments while the financial services sector registered
flat growth in 1999 following a 8.1 percent fall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the construction sector suffered from a 12 percent
contraction in 1999 in a sharp contrast with the 4.4 percent
growth in 1998 while the business services sector edged up
marginally by 0.1 percent, sharply slower than the 5.1 percent
growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The other economic indicators also testified to a good
performance in Singapore's economy in 1999, with total investment
commitments in manufacturing sector reaching 80 billion Singapore
dollars (about 4.8 billion U.S. dollars) and total business
spending commitments in the services sector hitting 1.6 billion
Singapore dollars (about 952 million U.S. dollars), total external
trade rebounding by 8.1 percent,new job gains totaling 41,900 in
the labor market, labor productivity growth rebounding by 5.8
percent while business cost index falling 12 percent in the
manufacturing sector and 3.9 percent in the services sector.
</P>
<P>
The MTI said the outlook for the Singapore economy is bright in
view of the favorable external environment, citing the return to
normality of the global economic conditions, the continued strong
growth in the U.S. economy and the firming in the EU economic
growth, the gradual recovery of the Japanese economy and the sharp
rebound in the crisis-hit countries as well as strong global
electronic demand and the revival in intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
It also noted a number of risks to the global economy,
including the fragile recovery in the Japanese economy, the
stronger specter of inflation, the economic slowdown in the U.S.
and the moderation in the economic recovery of Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account all these factors, the MTI said it
maintains its 2000 GDP forecast of 4.5 -6.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Promoting Regional SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar official
Wednesday called for promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
in Southeast Asian countries to develop the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session here of a workshop on ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) process and ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO)
scheme, Brigadier-General Abel, Myanmar minister at the Office of
the Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, said the
success of AFTA depends on the private sector, adding that without
the active participation of the sector, ASEAN Vision 2020 cannot
materialize.
</P>
<P>
He noted that ASEAN's private sector, including SMEs, account
for more than 90 percent of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need for expanding area of
cooperation in the AICO projects, saying that new ASEAN member
countries should be given opportunities in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Up to December 1999, there were 74 AICO projects reportedly
participated by the original five ASEAN member countries not
including Brunei.
</P>
<P>
The AICO, initiated in the past by ASEAN, was newly phased in
1995 with the agreement of the ASEAN member countries to make it
more effective in bringing ASEAN industrial development and
cooperation to a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
The AICO scheme, based on the principles and concepts of the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme for the AFTA,
minimizes tariff dissimilarities and offers qualified
participating companies the immediate benefit of the CEPT tariff
rates in the range of zero to five percent.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Bold Measures, adopted by ASEAN leaders
to provide special incentive and privileges to attract foreign
direct investment into the region for a two-year action program,
the ASEAN member countries agreed to waive the 30 percent national
equity requirement under the AICO scheme in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, which began Wednesday, is sponsored by
the Myanmar Institute of Strategic and International Peace
Foundation of Japan with the support of the National AFTA Unit.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Calls for Anti-Racism Charter for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Europe should introduce a binding
common charter within this year to drive the ghost of racism out
of the continent by force of law, Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi said in Trieste, Italy, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Racism can never be tolerated inside the European Union (EU),
which is not just an economic and political body but above all, an
upholder of common values, Ciampi said.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he said that the charter enshrining liberty,
democracy and respect for all human races should become the
foundation of a future European constitution.
</P>
<P>
Noting that racial hatred has left Europe with a bloody mark in
history, he asked people never to forget that and to ensure
tragedies will never be repeated.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi will visit the San Sabba rice farm near Trieste, the
site of Italy's only Nazi death camp built by German fascists
where over 5000 Jewish victims were killed.

WELLINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The 30th America's Cup is
being marred by perfect summer weather.
</P>
<P>
For the second time in the series, racing between Team New
Zealand and Italian challenger Prada was postponed Thursday due to
a lack of consistent wind on the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Race 3 is expected to go ahead Saturday, the fifth scheduled
race day.
</P>
<P>
Team New Zealand has a 2-0 lead in the best-of-nine series.
</P>
<P>
Race committee chairman Harold Bennett decided to postpone the
race Thursday when the crews had been on the water for almost 2 1/
2 hours after the scheduled start time of 1.15 p.m. local time (
0015 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The breeze peaked around eight knots but was considered too
inconsistent to allow match racing.
</P>
<P>
The series opener was postponed last Saturday for 24 hours
because the breeze didn't exceed four knots, until the both teams
left the water.
</P>
<P>
Team New Zealand won the opening race by 1 minute, 17 seconds
last Sunday and, after a non-racing day Monday, returned Tuesday
to clinch a victory by 2 minutes, 43 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Team New Zealand swept the series 5-0 against Dennis Conner's
Young America at San Diego in 1995, becoming only the second non-U.

JINAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which ranks third in the country in terms of gross domestic

overseas investors, to engage in state projects.
</P>
<P>
Wang Renyuan, director of the Shandong Provincial Economic and

<P>
In a major step, the province has announced more than 70 major

These projects, which will involve new and high technologies,
all have bright prospects, according to Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Poland's central bank on
Wednesday decided to raise the interest rates of three kinds of
businesses by one percentage point respectively starting on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second interest rate hike in less than four months
in order to contain inflation, curb loans and boost bank savings.
</P>
<P>
The Polish monetary policy committee announced Wednesday that
the bank's discount rate will be lifted from 19 percent to 20
percent, lombard rate from 20.5 to 21.5 and intervention rate from
16.5 to 17.5.
</P>
<P>
Economists here hold that the worsened economic indexes in
January have triggered the rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the central bank raised its basic lending rates
by 2.5-3.5 percentage points. However, the long-time slack economy
continued to deteriorate, leading to a current account deficit
exceeding 1 billion U.S. dollars in January as against 11.7
billion dollars for the whole year of 1999.

<HEADLINE> EU, Mexico to Sign Free Trade Deal Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILAMOURA, Portugal, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The European
Union (EU) and Mexico have agreed to sign a free trade deal next
month, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be signed during a special EU summit in Lisbon on
March 23-24 and is expected to be implemented on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after talks between negotiators from
both sides in the southern Portuguese resort town of Vilamoura.
</P>
<P>
Under the free trade deal, tariffs will be removed on 95
percent of two-way trade by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, whose country holds the
EU's rotating presidency, said he was convinced that the European
Parliament would approve the deal so that it could come into force
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said her government is
trying to persuade the Senate to ratify the deal before the
proposed signing date.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese media, which described the agreement as the "most
ambitious deal" ever signed by the EU with a single country
outside the bloc, said the deal was based on mutual political and
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
With the trade deal, EU could increase its influence in Latin
America and put itself in a better position to compete with the
United States and Canada with which Mexico will implement the
North American Free Trade Agreement in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the EU will also begin talks in April with the
southern American trade bloc Mercosur, which groups Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and Bolivia as associate
members.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the EU has concluded a free trade deal with South
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Pledges to Play Bigger Role in Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest city
in southwest China, has drawn up a series of measures to pave the
way for the surge of economic development planned for the country'
s vast western region.
</P>
<P>
A municipal office in charge of economic development in western
China was recently set up to carry out this work.
</P>
<P>
Bao Shuding, mayor of Chongqing, said in a government work
report to the municipal people's congress that the city would
invest 240 billion yuan in 107 key infrastructure projects in the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
At present, 50 projects are underway covering the fields of
transport, environmental protection at the Three Gorges Dam
Project, harbor construction and information. Work on the
remaining 57 will start either this year or next.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing plans to build a high-tech system with information,
bioengineering, environmental protection and optical-electric
integration as its pillars in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
Lei Hengshun, director of Southwest China Development Research
Institute of Chongqing University, said Chongqing is in a unique
position to aid western expansion: It ranks first among 10
provinces and autonomous regions in western China in both tertiary
trade development and direct foreign investment usage, and second
in per capita gross domestic product, and it has formed an
economic zone among Chengdu, Chongqing and Yibin City.
</P>
<P>
Yu Ronggen, president of the Chongqing Academy of Social
Sciences, said development of western China offers a golden
opportunity for Chongqing to solve its four toughest issues:
invigoration of state industrial enterprises, resettlement of dam
area residents, improvement of poor people's living standards and
ecological construction.
</P>
<P>
The first international conference on the development of
western China will be held here in June.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ji Shuchun, a 52-year-old
farmer, celebrated the fifth anniversary of his lung transplant
this week at Anzhen Hospital in Beijing.
</P>

Ji suffered from fibrosis, a lung disease that makes normal
breathing difficult. Doctors said a transplant was his only hope.
</P>
<P>
He is pleased with the results of his dangerous operation,
saying that this year is the first since 1995 that he has not
needed regular blood transfusions.

<HEADLINE> Price Cuts Bring Spending Surge in Telecom Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
sector witnessed an increase of 38.7 billion yuan (4.7 billion U.S.
dollars) in consumer spending last year after the government cut
certain fees twice.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the State Development Planning
Commission(SDPC) show that the average initial charge for
telephone installment has dropped from 1,010 yuan to 690 yuan,
falling 31.7 percent, and the average registration fee for mobile
phones has decreased from 800 yuan to 500 yuan, plummeting 37.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the reduction of fees, new users of telephones in China
grew at an average monthly pace of 2.4 million, while the amount
soared to 3.7 million after the reduction.
</P>
<P>
An official in the price regulation department of the SDPC said
further fee reductions might help with the expansion of the
telecommunications market and the stimulation of domestic demand.
Adjustment of telecom fees in rural areas is also underway, he
added.

<HEADLINE> INTERFET Withdraws From East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations-sanctioned
International Forces for East Timor (INTERFET) ended a five-month
peacekeeping operation on Wednesday and handed over to U.N.
peacekeepers, according to reports reaching here from Dili,
capital of East Timor, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
INTERFET commander Major General Peter Cosgrove took the salute
at a low-key farewell ceremony outside his temporary headquarters.
He said the force had been lucky to have achieved its task with
relatively little violence.
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove sailed out of Dili harbor around midday, shortly after
the INTERFET's flag was lowered for the last time.
</P>
<P>
The 19-nation force, sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council,
landed in East Timor on September 20 last year after pro-Indonesia
militias went on a spree of violence and destruction.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 people are known to have been killed and thousands
of buildings burned or damaged, before INTERFET troops restored
order.
</P>
<P>
INTERFET has been replaced by a 23-nation United Nations
peacekeeping force led by Lieutenant General Jaime de los Santos
of the Philippines, although 80 percent of the U.N. force of
around 9,000 troops will transfer from INTERFET.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony for more than 400 years. On
August 30 last year, more than 400,000 East Timorese took part in
a U.N.-sponsored ballot and overwhelmingly voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. expects to administer the former Portuguese colony for
two to three years leading to independence.

TIRANA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia has put its army on
alert at the border with Kosovo in response to increasing tensions
in the neighboring Yugoslav province, according to reports from
the Macedonian capital Skopje.
</P>
<P>
A Macedonian Defense Ministry spokesman said his government is
closely following the developments in Kosovo, where the situation
might well get out of control.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Macedonian Army at the Kosovo border has
increased its numbers and length of patrols to strengthen
inspection in the border area, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Macedonian Army deployed in Kumanovo near the
Kosovo border has raised its degree of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, tensions have intensified over the past three weeks
due to Serb-Albanian confrontations in the ethnically divided town
of Mitrovica in the north. The city has been the scene of clashes
between ethnic Albanians and KFOR peacekeepers and armed violence
between hostile Serb and Albanian communities.
</P>
<P>
The unrest in Mitrovica has left nine people dead and about 20
wounded.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Discovers Richer Natural Gas Reservation in North Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Danish energy business
estimates that over 100 billion cubic meters of natural gas are
still buried under the continental shelf in the Danish North Sea
area, far more than previous estimates, the Danish newspaper
Politiken reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Half a year ago, the Danish Oil and Natural Gas Incorporation (
DONG) and Danish Underground Development Group estimated the
Danish North Sea to contain a natural gas reservation of about 70
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
After some re-calculations, however, the two companies now
revised their estimates, saying the reservation under the Danish
North Sea continental shelf remains about 100 billion cubic meters,
almost 50 percent above the previous figure.
</P>
<P>
The new finding means that Denmark will continue to increase
its natural gas production for many years and will have to export
the product to foreign countries due to a saturated domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
For this, Denmark is poised to speed up the construction of
natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea to facilitate the export
to Poland. DONG's Vice President Povl Asserhoej said that the
construction, at a cost of about 2.5 billion Denmark kroner (about
338 million U.S. dollars), will hopefully be finished within three
to four years.
</P>
<P>
Denmark began tapping natural gas in the North Sea 30 years ago
when the estimated reservations were about 160 billion cubic
meters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not Ready for Asian U-19 Soccer Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia was not fully
prepared for the pre-qualifying round of the Asian under 19 soccer
championships, according to the national team director of the
soccer Association of Indonesia (PSSI) Mohammad Zein.
</P>
<P>
Zein was surprised upon learning that the competition would
start in April in Sichuan, China. Indonesia is in Group 6 with
China, Chinese Taipei and Myanmar. The championships final will
take place in Tehran from November 12 to 26.
</P>
<P>
"I have read the notification from Asian Football Confederation
(AFC) about the pre-qualifying round. I have no further comment on
this. We have to begin training on March 1. We hope that the U-19
team will be here (Jakarta) on February 27 or 28," Zein said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have the team lineup Friday at the latest. But we can'
t expect much from this. Whatever will be. We can't withdraw from
participating in the competition," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zein said PSSI would select the players from clubs which are
now competing in the sixth Indonesian Soccer League and from
students training centers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that U-19 coach Rudy Keltjes had observed several
talented players from eastern Indonesia who competed in the pre-
qualifying round for the 15th National Games.
</P>
<P>
Zein said that Keltjes, who is still with Persipura Jayapura
club in Irian Jaya, would be in Jakarta early in March.
</P>
<P>
"We have no chance for overseas trials. Maybe we will compete
with local clubs to test our skills," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that PSSI would ask AFC to delay the pre-qualifying
round until May.
</P>
<P>
"We will send a letter to AFC to ask for the delay. AFC had
earlier told us that it must have the list of the champions in
each group by June at the latest. It's our fault. If we had an
official in AFC, we would be informed sooner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zein said he would announce Tuesday the players names to
compete in the senior Asian Cup final in Lebanon from October 12
to 29.
</P>
<P>
He said players would undergo selection in March and their
number would be reduced to 24.
</P>
<P>
"The training program will start effectively in June," he added.

The number of loss-making large and medium-sized state-owned

<HEADLINE> EU Waiting for WTO Ruling on U.S. Tax Plan Concerning Export Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
waiting for a ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Thursday on the legality of a U.S. tax plan which has been found
to constitute a prohibited export subsidy under certain WTO
agreement.
</P>
<P>
A WTO dispute panel report issued last October provides that
the U.S. will have until October 1, 2000, to withdraw the Foreign
Sales Corporations (FSC) scheme because the U.S. scheme is
designed for American corporations to set up companies in a tax
haven as a vehicle of U.S. exports and in this way exempt
substantial amount of due taxes.
</P>
<P>
The European Union filed the case against the United States
over the FSC scheme under the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of consultations were held between the EU and
the U.S. on December 1997, February 1998 and April 1998. However,
the talks failed to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the WTO panel released the report in the EU's favor in
October last year, the U.S. filed a Notice of Appeal to the WTO
dispute settlement body on November 26.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO's legal procedure, the report of the WTO's
Appellate Body is expected on February 24, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that the FSC scheme exempts U.S. companies from
taxes that would otherwise have to be paid on their export sales.
This constitutes a subsidy on U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
The WTO Subsidies Agreement establishes that subsidies that are
contingent on export performance are in themselves illegal and
must be immediately withdrawn as they are the most trade
distorting and harmful type of subsidies.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Border Killing of Elephants Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's
Yunnan Province and Laos joined hands recently to uncover a cross-
border case of elephant killing.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that three Laotians went to the Shangyong
Preserve in Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province early last year, and
killed three wild Asian elephants there. They then took off with a
pair of elephant tusks.
</P>
<P>
The gang confessed that as they were cutting off an elephant
tusk on March 2 last year in the Shangyong Preserve, a Chinese
patrol team appeared and they fled.
</P>
<P>
The dead bodies of two other elephants, a male and a female,
were found by a forest ranger in Shangyong Preserve on May 21 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the report, police in Xishuangbanna conducted a
two-month investigation and concluded that the suspects had come
from Laos, and they asked for the help of their counterparts in
Laos, after which the arrests were made.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts to End Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China will continue working
with Australia to stop illegal immigrations and the notorious "
snakeheads" who smuggle Chinese people overseas, according to a
China Daily report today.
</P>
<P>
China and Australia have successfully cooperated over the past
year on the immigration problem and the repatriation of stowaways,
said Guo Xiqin, deputy director of the Frontier Administration
Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 1,300 illegal migration cases from inland China were
found by Chinese frontier police and more than 9,000 stowaways
were captured.
</P>
<P>
The frontier police arrested more than 800 illegal immigration
organizers, colloquially called "snakeheads", last year.
</P>
<P>
Eight boasts carrying 544 Chinese illegal immigrants were
captured in Australia last year and all of them were repatriated
to China, according to Andrew Metcalfe, deputy secretary of the
Australian Department of Immigration and Multiculural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Australian deputy secretary arrived in Beijing on Sunday
for talks with Chinese government officials on areas of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale publicity campaign was launched in China and
Australia informing people that stowaways were victims of
snakeheads and would gain nothing by illegal immigration.

<HEADLINE> Football Legend Matthews Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Stanley Matthews, the first
knight of English football, has died aged 85.
</P>
<P>
The former Blackpool and Stoke winger died after a short
illness at North Staffordshire Nuffield hospital.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the private hospital in Newcastle under Lyme
said: "Sir Stanley Matthews died peacefully this evening after a
short illness related to health problems that had first seriously
affected him three years ago."
</P>
<P>
Former England manager Bobby Robson paid tribute to his friend
before England's match with Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the greatest players the game has ever seen,"
Robson said. "He ranks alongside players like Pele, Maradona and
Cruyff - and he was one of ours.
</P>
<P>
"He was a lovely fellow and a great friend of mine. It's a
tremendous blow on a nostalgic evening."
</P>
<P>
"He had immense skill - great skill off the ball, a beautiful
dribbler. I'm very sad at the news."
</P>
<P>
The crowd at the start of the England vs Argentina friendly in
Wembley observed a minute's silence in memory of Matthews, whose
death was announced shortly before the match. English players paid
tribute by wearing black arm bands. Matthews was the first
Englishman to be named European Footballer of the Year, a feat he
achieved twice.
</P>
<P>
He scored his only international hat-trick in England's 1937 5-
4 win over Czechoslovakia but the highlight of his long career
came in the 1953 FA Cup Final, which will always be remembered as
"the Matthews Final".
</P>
<P>
During a remarkable 33-year career he won 54 England caps - and
played in another 30 wartime internationals - and he remains the
only man to have played in the old First Division as a 50-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Matthews' funeral will be arranged by Stoke City football club
and his distraught family, the club said.
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said the former player had been devastated by
the death of his wife last year but often visited the ground to
sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
"He was a massive ambassador for Stoke City football club and
he will be sadly missed by supporters, staff and our players and
indeed footballers worldwide," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone at the club is truly gobsmacked and devastated," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Moves into Second Round at London Tennis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia advanced into the second round of the London indoor tennis
tournament with a straight victory over Andrei Mdevedev on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, champion in 1988, did just enough to beat his
friend 6-3, 6-4. His baseline play was altogether too consistent
for the French Open runner-up from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, third seed and world number 11 Tim Henman of Britain
slumped in the first round to Argentine baseliner Mariano Zabaleta.
</P>
<P>
Henman, a finalist in Rotterdam last week, was a shadow of that
player in his 7-6, 7-5 first round defeat at the London Arena.
</P>
<P>
Henman started in fine form and overpowered Zabaleta with some
accurate serving and solid volleys. After losing the first point
of the match on his serve he won the next 18 to take command of
the set.
</P>
<P>
But Zabaleta hung on and as the match wore on Henman began to
wilt. He failed to convert two set points at 5-4 and tell-tale
cracks began to appear in his brittle forehand.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine, who beat Henman in their only previous encounter
on clay in Hamburg last year, grew in confidence and sealed the
tie-break with some classic counter-punching.
</P>
<P>
Henman was well and truly on the ropes in the second set and
was lured into playing at the Argentine's pace and on his terms.
Henman wasted two more break points at 5-5 as Zabaleta briefly
wavered. The Argentine was soon back on track, though, and pounced
on his opponent's serve in the next game.
</P>
<P>
Two sloppy errors and a double fault gave Zabaleta two match
points. Henman saved the first with an ace but moments later he
floated a forehand long to hand his opponent the match.
</P>
<P>
The result was Henman's second consecutive first round exit at
the tournament. In 1999, he was beaten by Slovak Jan Kroslak.
</P>
<P>
Henman was joined at the exit by eighth seed Hicham Arazi who
fell 6-4, 6-3 to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in a bad-tempered
affair.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan never settled and eventually received a warning
from the umpire for unsportsmanlike conduct after a series of
verbal outbursts, racket and ball abuse.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Cedric Pioline -- conqueror of Henman in the
Rotterdam final last Sunday -- advanced with a 7-5, 7-6 first
round win over Alberto Martin.
</P>
<P>
The French world number 10 was not troubled by the Spaniard and
set up a second round against American Jeff Tarango who beat Swede
Jonas Bjorkman 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Tarango was a late replacement for British wildcard Jamie
Delgado who withdrew with a wrist injury.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Beats Czechs in Soccer Friendly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Robbie Keane scored a decisive
goal three minutes from time to give Ireland a 3-2 win over Czech
Republic in a soccer friendly in Dublin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Keane pounced on a loose ball to fire the winner against the
highly rated Czechs, who won all 10 of their qualifiers en route
to the European championship finals.
</P>
<P>
Striker Jan Koller scored both goals for the Czechs, who led
twice in the first half and are ranked number two in the world
behind Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht's Koller stabbed home from close range in the fourth
minute and got his second in the 35th minute when he headed in a
Karel Poborsky cross.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, who missed out on Euro 2000 qualification after a play-
off, had levelled after 16 minutes, with a goal initially credited
to Niall Quinn.
</P>
<P>
But the decisive touch appeared to come off Czech defender
Karel Rada as the two men contested a Mark Kennedy cross.
</P>
<P>
There was an element of good fortune about the second Irish
equaliser two minutes before halftime. Goalkeeper Ladislav Maier
collided with Rada as he went for a cross, leaving defender Ian
Harte to roll the ball into an empty net.

CHARLEROI, Belgium, February 23 (Xinhua) -- European
championship co-hosts Belgium were held on Wednesday to a one-each
draw by visiting Portugal in a warm-up game.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto from Portugal's Real Sociedad club chipped in at the
80th minute a rebound off the near post to equalize an earlier
goal scored by Branko Strupa for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
The goal was the fifth the English premier Derby County striker
scored in five games he capped for Belgium.
</P>
<P>
It was the second draw game by the Belgian eleven since Robert
Waseige took over the helm of the national squad from George
Leekens last September.
</P>
<P>
Waseige's team tied co-hosts the Netherlands 5-5 away, beat
Italy 3-1 away, blanked Morrocco 4-0 at home and lost to England 2-

<HEADLINE> Heskey Shines in England vs Argentina Friendly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Emile Heskey produced an eye-
catching display up front in his full debut as England impressed
in their "friendly" against old foes Argentina at Wembley on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Keegan's side, which included a number of fringe players
keen to cement a Euro 2000 place, had the better of the rematch
with the team that knocked them out of the last World Cup in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, rated by Keegan as the second best team in the world
behind Brazil, rarely threatened and England did much to dispel
the memories of their last performance, an awful 1-0 defeat by
arch rivals Scotland, with a spirited, inventive display.
</P>
<P>
Heskey's pace and power proved dangerous throughout - and the
Leicester youngster eclipsed some world-class players on his full
debut.
</P>
<P>
Many pundits had questioned the inclusion of Heskey alongside
Alan Shearer up front, but he was given a standing ovation when he
was replaced with 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cole, one of five England substitutes to come on, tested
Pablo Cavallero 10 minutes from time with his first touch but it
was a rare second half opening for the hosts.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Kily Gonzalez went closest for the visitors with a
low shot saved by David Seaman after 56 minutes and another that
fizzed past a post in the 76th.
</P>
<P>
Both sides wore black armbands following the death of England
great Sir Stanley Matthews at the age of 85.

<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Nigerian Information Minister Dapo
Sarumi urged Nigerians, the bar association and the Christian
associations to initiate legal challenge to the controversial
religious code's implementation in the country, which is secular
by constitution.

He was quoted by reports reaching here as saying that "it will
not be politically wise for the executive arm to initiate such a
process because it would be accused of bias."
</P>
<P>
According to Sarumi, the federal government sent troops to
Kaduna after it was discovered that the mob was moving toward one
of the country's four oil refineries in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
Uneasy calm was reported Wednesday in Kaduna, capital of one of
Nigeria' s most important states, where the movement of people

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Woman Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Planning Rima Khalaf, the only woman minister in
the cabinet of Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, resigned
Wednesday over alleged personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah Bin Hussein, in a royal decree, accepted her
resignation, and appointed Minister of Trade, Industry and Supply
Mohammed Halayka concurrently as acting minister of planning.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency Petra carried a brief news
dispatch for Khalaf's resignation but did not give any reasons.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from reporters, Minister of Information
Saleh Kallab said the woman minister resigned over personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Khalaf had tried but failed to extend the
service years of an employee in her ministry, who had exceeded the
retirement age of 60.
</P>
<P>
She was the third minister to resign in the 11-month-old
Rawabdeh government after former Minister of Youth and Sport
Mohammad Mamsar and former Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi.
</P>
<P>
Mamsar resigned last July after failing to persuade Kuwait to
take part in the ninth Pan-Arab games held last August in Amman.
The Gulf emirate boycotted the games to protest against the
participation of Iraq which had invaded it during the 1990 Gulf
Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi gave up his portfolio of transport last December over
policy differences with Prime Minister Rawabdeh, whom he accused of
meddling too much in daily affairs of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
After Rawabdeh took office, his government has been under fire
from the public and opposition parties for a series of social,
economic and administrative reforms, including a measure to levy a
10 percent sale tax, which increased state revenues but triggered a
price hike in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
However, he survived a major cabinet reshuffle in January when
seven ministers were asked by King Abdullah to leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh saved his post as the kingdom is emerging from a
decade-old economic recession since the Gulf Crisis, for which the
kingdom was isolated by Arab countries for its sympathy with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan registered 1.5-2 percent economic growth in 1999, rare
and amazing since the Gulf Crisis.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Paraguay, to Tighten Bilateral Trade Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Paraguayan and Brazilian
governments have agreed to exert tight controls on their bilateral
trade to eradicate smuggling in their border zone, official
sources said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the two countries agreed this week on a plan of
action that includes a tighter control in Brazil on the
commodities being sent to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to implement "integrated controls" in several
points of the border to make trade "transparent", added the same
sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks held here were about the double taxation to firms
interested in investing in Paraguay, corruption in the border
customs posts, and "money laundering," triangulation of
merchandise, "piracy," and commercial counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Tax Minister Everardo Maciel told the Paraguayan
delegation that an agreement to give important tax incentives to
the Brazilian investors who want to reside in Paraguay is about to
be signed.
</P>
<P>
Paraguayan Communications and Public Works Minister Jose
Alberto Planas said that the National Development and Foreign
Trade of Brazil granted a 190 million dollar "tied credit" to
Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
This money will be used for the paving of important roads,
purchase of machinery for this ministry, equipment for the police,
two helicopters, patrol cars and ambulances. Also 80 million
dollars will be for the ministry and 22 million for the police.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Refuses to Recall Diplomat in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities rejected
Thursday the U.S. demand to recall no later than Saturday an
official of the island country charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
"Present your alleged evidence. Do not fear debate. You have
the possibility of rectifying and apologizing," said Cuban
Congress President Ricardo Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
Press reports identified the Cuban official as Jose Imperatori,
a member of the Cuban Interest Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We have not recalled (the official), nor will we recall him,"
said Alarcon during the celebration of the 105th anniversary of
the second independence war of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said that the Cuban diplomat has
until 13:30 local time Saturday to leave, or he will lose his
diplomatic immunity, and will be subjected to the U.S. laws, and
if there are reasons for his arrest, he will be detained.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service official Mariano
Faget was arrested in Miami under charges that he was spying for
Cuba and had links with Imperatori.
</P>
<P>
"It is about time for the United States to stand up and refuse
to be blackmailed" by the Cubans of Miami that oppose the
government of Fidel Castro," said Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Cuban Parliament described Castro's foes
as "criminals without scruples" and annexist mafia."
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said that the Cuban government will insist in the
return to the island of boy Elian Gonzalez, survivor of the
wreckage in which his mother died last November and who was taken
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government of Cuba will soon renew its demand
for the United States to withdraw from Guantanamo, in the eastern
tip o the island, where it has a military base.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Pledges Continued Effort to Join United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
indicated it will go ahead with plans to join the United Nations,
even if a people's initiative on the issue fails to collect the
necessary 100,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
After a special cabinet session on Thursday, the government
said that it had decided to launch a comprehensive consultation
process within Switzerland in order to present draft legislation
to parliament by the end of the year, according to Swiss Radio
International.
</P>
<P>
UN membership for Switzerland was massively turned down by
voters in 1986. Since 1998 a pro-UN committee has been collecting
signatures to try to force another national referendum on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
Joining the world body has been an objective of the Swiss
government for many years, but until recently the cabinet has been
wary about debating the subject in the light of the over 70 per
cent of voters who said no in 1986.
</P>

Opponents argue that the considerable Swiss annual contribution
is enough and that there is no need to get more involved with the

<HEADLINE> Zambian Finance Minister on Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Thursday
 reaffirmed the need for the country to be considered under the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) so that it can benefit from
its debtors.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said here that the government
is doing everything possible to meet the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) laid down benchmarks so that Zambia could be considered
for the HIPC by July this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Jubilee 2000-debt cancellation conference held
here Thursday, Kalumba said that the Zambian government has been
forced to change the law in order to meet the benchmark of selling
the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
He told the participants drawn from various local and
international organizations that apart from ensuring the speedy
disposal of the ZCCM, the government is striving to ensure good
governance, gender equality, transparency prevailed in the country
in order for it to join the HIPC.
</P>
<P>
Under HIPC, Zambia stands to benefit through the cancellation
of up to 90 percent of its 6.5 billion U.S. dollar debt it owes
both the Paris Club and its multilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of the External Resources Management at the
Ministry of Finance and Economical Development, Patrick Malambo,
also delivered a speech at the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that although one of the benefits for the countries to
join the HIPC is the cancellation of debts of up to 90 percent,
Zambia's cancellation will only amount to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
accumulated before 1983, when it graduates to the HIPC program
sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
Malambo emphasized Zambia's fulfilment of the International
Monetary fund (IMF) set benchmarks, which include the speedy and
complete sale of the mining giant, ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Zambia had defaulted in the past in its
debt services due to poor government debt management, but now the
situation has improved and there would be a more constant approach
to debt management.

<HEADLINE> Europe Invests in L.America More than US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILAMOURA, Portugal, February 24 (Xinhua) -- European
Commissioner for Foreign Relations Chris Patten said here Thursday
that there are more European than United States' investment in
Latin America
</P>
<P>
Patten quoted a document recently published by the United
Nations that the growing investments of European firms in Latin
America last year surpass those of the United States, which used
to be the main investors in that zone.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects a growing confidence of Europe in the political
and economic changes in that region," said the European official,
stating the idea that Latin Americas is in reality one of the
European Union priorities.
</P>
<P>
"I want to underscore that the development of the relations
between the two parts is a true priority for the European Union,
now and in the coming years," said Patten.
</P>
<P>
Paten said of the meeting being held this week here between the
representatives of the European Union, the San Jose Group, the
Andean Community, Mercosur, and the Group of Rio, that he has big
expectations about the launching of the negotiations between the
European Union and Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the European Union and Southern Common
Market (Mercosur),  agreed Wednesday to start talks about a free
trade agreement that includes aspects of political, technical,
commercial, and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Officials also announced that negotiators from the EU and the
Mercosur will meet for the first time in April in Buenos Aires and
Santiago de Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur includes Latin America's strongest economic
performers: Argentine, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and also Chile
and Bolivia as associate members.
</P>
<P>
Free trade will enrich the Europeans by 6 billion dollars a
year and the Mercosur side by 5 billion dollars, according to EU.
</P>
<P>
EU exports to Latin America stand at about 52.4 billion dollars,
well above EU imports of 38.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources said the EU is eager to expand trade with
Latin America, fearing it could lose ground to the United States,
which is seeking to crate a Pan-American free-trade area by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Fall Sharply But Tech Shares Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Blue chips stocks on Wall
Street fell sharply on fears of higher interest rates Thursday but
the technology shares hit the new high.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 133.10 at 10,092.
63, after dropping briefly below 10,000 in earlier trading. The
index is now down 14 percent from its record closing high of 11,
722.98 on January 14.
</P>
<P>
At midafternoon today, the Dow fell as much as 233.00 at 9,992.
73. The index fell below 10,000 on April 6, after finishing above
the 10,000 milestone for the first time on March 29, 1999 and it
traded below the five digital again on October 18.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also fell 7.26 at 1,353.43.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index continued to plunge the day after the Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his warning of higher
rates. In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee
Wednesday, Greenspan said while he was not aiming at stock prices,
he had to be concerned about how the run-up on Wall Street
translated into more consumer spending and a broader increase in
demand for goods and services. His comments pushed the Dow index
79.11 points lower that day.
</P>
<P>
But the technology stocks rose 67.32 at 4,617.65 today in
defiance of Greenspan's warning for the second day in a row. The
index surpassed the record closing high of 4550.33 points set
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
June, last year in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy. But
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee last week that those
increases have had little impact.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.06 at 583.57. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.63 at 935.62 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.13 at 554.04.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,014 down, 1,049 up and 442
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Directive on Foreign Police Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the 10-million-U.S.-
dollars program would improve U.S. capacity to provide police
overseas in coordination with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The president's decision is aimed at two related goals. The
first is to improve coordination of U.S. efforts. The second is
to enhance the ability of other countries, the U.N. and regional
organizations to plan, mount and sustain operations in support of
the rule of law," Albright told a press conference on the
directive.
</P>
<P>
She added that the province of Kosovo in Serbia, East Timor and
Sierra Leone were places where trained civilian police were needed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has instructed the State Department to create a leading
office responsible for issues associated with our participation in
the criminal justice component of peace operations, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The office will be responsible for developing policy, setting
priorities and coordinating U.S. agency activities.
</P>
<P>
"This step recognizes the foreign-policy importance of
preventing security vacuums from arising in post-conflict
situations," she added.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Algerian FM Find Much Common Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Algeria must continue
to work towards bolstering dialogue between the two shores of the
Mediterranean, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and his
visiting Algerian counterpart Youcef Yousfi agreed in talks here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also signed two agreements in order to give
greater continuity and regularity to bilateral relations, a
statement from the Italian Foreign Minister said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Dini, in expressing his satisfaction over the positive outcome
of the negotiations, stressed the central role these agreements
will have in combating illegal migration and regulating authorized
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Both Dini and Yousfi also agreed on the need to expand the
agreement to take into account seasonal employment.
</P>
<P>
During today's talks, the minister added, Dini voiced his
satisfaction over the progress made in following up the
commitments made during Bouteflika visit, in particular towards
Italy's participation in Algeria's development and privatization
plans, collaboration in such sectors as energy, agriculture and
the food industry, training, management, heavy industry and
construction.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the Mediterranean, the two diplomatic chiefs found
common ground on the importance of the Mediterranean Forum, which
meet next in march, and Dini expressed the hope that the
conditions will exist for Libya's participation.
</P>
<P>
Yousfi expressed the hope that collaboration with Italy will
serve as an important element in bolstering Algeria's relations
with the European Union.

<HEADLINE> EU, CAN Agree on Future Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VILAMOURA, Portugal, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union,
(EU) and the Community of Andean Nations (CAN) have agreed in
principle to negotiations aiming at an economic and commercial
association between the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came about Wednesday at the end of a two-day
ministerial meeting between the EU and the CAN in the Portuguese
tourist city of Vilamoura, according to a joint communique issued
Thursday by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Gunner Wiegand, advisor to the European Commissar for Foreign
Affairs Christopher Patten, said that the EU acknowledged the CAN
request for the strengthening and stabilization of the commercial
system and the relations between the two blocs.
</P>
<P>
The EU-CAN meeting was presided over by the European Trio (
Portugal, France, and Finland) and by the European Council general
secretary, the Spaniard Javier Solanaa, and the foreign ministers
of the South American block (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela.)
</P>
<P>
Wiegand said that the process of negotiations that the EU will
start soon with the Community of Andean Nations will follow the
advances with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), made up of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The agreement foresees a technical study for a precise
diagnosis of the existing difficulties and the solution outlook,
added Wiegand.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the CAN said about particular situations that they
support democracy in Ecuador and peace in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
European Union and Latin American nations are seeking to deepen
economic and political ties during the three days of talks which
began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Community of Andean Nations or the Group Andino is composed
by Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes New Sanctions Bill Against Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate,
contrasting the Clinton administration's gesture to improve
relations with Iran through unconditional dialogue, Thursday
approved a bill aimed at stepping up sanctions against Teheran,
saying it would require the president to step up efforts to stop
Russia and other countries from supplying so-called weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 98-0 to pass the bill, which was based on a
bill approved 419-0 in the House of Representatives last September
with a slightly different version. And the House is expected to
adopt the Senate revised bill and sent it to the president.
</P>
<P>
The White House threatened to veto the bill once the House
adopts, saying it complicated international nonproliferation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The bill contrasted the administration's effort to improve
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The State Department Tuesday made a gesture for unconditional
dialogue with Iran after a newly elected Iranian parliament is
prepared to hold its first session. Spokesman James Rubin welcomed
the result of the Iranian parliamentary election last Friday,
hoping the newly elected reformist members of parliament would
lead the country to rapprochement between the two nations after
more the 20 years of hostility.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill directs the president to submit reports to
Congress every six months identifying foreign persons or countries
that transfer weapons material or technology to Iran and
authorizes him to impose sanction if he so chooses.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Congress approved a bill that required the president
to impose sanction against Russia and others that supply missiles
or weapons to Iran. The bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Senate bill makes some changes and just asks the
president to impose sanctions on countries he chooses.
</P>
<P>
After the 1998 veto, the administration moved on its own to
announce sanctions on seven Russian entities suspected of
transferring weapons technology to Iran. In 1999, three more
Russian groups were added to the list.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Majority leader Trent Lott said this had not done
enough to stop the flow of weapons technology. He said that with
enactment of the bill, "we hope the administration will use it to
our country's advantage and impose sanctions."

<P>
Speaking to reporters at the State Department, Albright said
the U.S. is "obviously very pleased" that France decided to
augment their forces in Mitrovica, where the civilians clashed
with the peace-keeping troops.
</P>
<P>
"I think that clearly the situation in Mitrovica poses a
challenge for us, and it's very important for KFOR to make clear
that it is in charge, because it deters violence, and it sends a
very strong message," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently has about 5,700 troops in Kosovo. "
The United States has the largest number of troops in the area, so
we do believe -- or in Kosovo as a whole -- that we are definitely
doing our part," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't exclude the fact that there may have to be some
Americans, and -- but I think, in the first instance, we are
looking to others to plus-up their forces," she added.
</P>

French Defense Minister Alain Richard announced Wednesday after
meeting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen that France is
deploying about 600 to 700 troops to the area it controlled in

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Regional Strategy Sought in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The first Regional Summit
Against Drug Trafficking and Corruption was inaugurated Thursday
in the Costa Rican capital by President Miguel Angel Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is sponsored by the legislative assemblies of the
five Central American countries -- Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras,
El Salvador, and Guatemala -- besides Panama and Belize, with the
goal of proposing two treaties, one to fight corruption, and the
other to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It is planned with the second one to extend to all Central
America a treaty of joint patrolling between the countries of the
region and the United States, similar to the one in force with
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
U.S. South Command sub-head General Alfred Valenzuela tried to
show in the middle of graphs and maps how the drug produced in
South America, especially in Colombia, travels by Central America,
the Caribbean, and the Pacific, toward the consumers markets,
especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela presented figures according to which almost 15,000
young U.S. citizens lost their lives in 1998 because of drug
overdoses, saying that there are 14 million consumers of illicit
drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred tons of the 500 metric tons of the estimated
production of cocaine in Colombia in 1998 went to the U.S. market,
said Valenzuela, adding that the production of the South American
country has increased .
</P>
<P>
The U.S. army wants to reinforce its participation in the war
against drugs through logistic support, with planes and
helicopters, as well as with information, operating from regional
bases, like the one it has in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has proposed a plan to combat drug trafficking that
has a cost of 7 billion dollars, of which 3.5 billion would have
to come from abroad.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has proposed the Congress of his
country support that plan with 1.6 billion dollars, which has not
been approved yet.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strategy is clearly directed to reinforce its presence
in the region, to establish here its bases of operation that will
be used to combat drug traffic, but that will also operate with
more facilities after having surrendered last December the
military installations it had in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The United States Army Southern Command itself, which during
decades had its base in the Panama Canal Zone, had to be installed
in Miami, so the U.S. government still seeks facilities to operate
in Central America.

<HEADLINE> US Drug Czar Ends Colombia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. drug czar
Barry McCaffrey ended Thursday his visit to Colombia with a trip
to the modern installations of the army against drug trafficking
in the southern jungles.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Tapias and
other high ranking officials accompanied MacCaffrey in this trip.
The U.S. drug czar arrived Tuesday to fine-tune with President
Andres Pastrana the details of an economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
These resources will be used to eradicate illegal crops in this
Andean country and the new antidrug campaign will be launched from
the Tres Esquinas Base, located in the limits between the El
Caqueta and the Putumayo departments.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Joint Intelligence Central for the control of drug
trafficking in the Colombian southern jungles was bilaterally
established a few weeks ago in this base.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey's visit to the South American country comes as U.S.
Congress debates the Clinton administration's proposed 1.6 billion
dollar counternarcotics package for Colombia and its Andean
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that cocaine production increased by 20
percent and heroin production up 23 percent last year in Colombia.
U.S. officials say the South American country now supplies 90
percent of the world's cocaine and the majority of the heroin sold
in the United States.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- the United States, fearing
to derail peace process in the Middle East, on Thursday criticized
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy for his threat to "burn" the
soil of Lebanon if Hezbollah guerrillas attacked the north of his
country.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of comment is inappropriate. We don't need rhetoric

diffused. Such comments make our efforts extremely difficult," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was the strongest criticism on Israel from the Clinton
administration since violence erupted over past weeks between
Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The United States has
also criticized Israeli attacks on civilian infrastructure in
Lebanon, but only after violent protests at the U.S. embassy in
Beirut.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Says All N. Irish Parties Be Disarmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the National Press Club, McGuinness said that the
pro-Britain Unionists Party, which has 150,000 weapons at its
disposal, should also be disarmed, not only the Irish Republic
Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his irritation at the charges that IRA's
refusal to start decommissioning is the cause of recent setbacks
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is in deep crisis, and it's in deep crisis
for one reason only: the action of Peter Mandelson in suspending
the power-sharing government established under the Good Friday
agreement," McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
Parties involved in the conflict in Northern Ireland signed the
Good Friday Accords in 1998 but still disagree on the
implementation of the accords.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, British secretary for the Northern Ireland affairs,
announced earlier this month suspension of the self-rule coalition
government in the province, citing reasons that IRA, a
paramilitary group under Sinn Fein, failed to begin
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"The Good Friday agreement was not implemented in one of its
most vital areas: the setting up of a power-sharing government.
The unionists blocked that government for 19 months of those two
years," McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Mandelson of bearing much of the responsibility for
the setbacks though his decision to dissolve the local government
despite Sinn Fein's having brought forth "a new and significant
proposal."
</P>
<P>
"What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,"
McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness told reporters that the Good Friday Accords, which
established the basis for peace in the province, assert that it is
the "collective responsibility" of all participants to work
cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"It (the agreement) does not guarantee that decommissioning
will occur within two years. It requires that the political
parties, Sinn Fein included, use good-faith efforts to have it
occur. Nobody except the unionists is challenging Sinn Fein's
good-faith efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
"People think that the only guns that are causing problems are
the guns of the IRA," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns," he said,
referring to the weapons held by the Unionists and the British
troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness served as education secretary of the local
government in Northern Ireland that was suspended by the British
government two weeks ago because of the disarmament issue.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: United Nations Takes A Critical Step Forward in Ending  DRC Conflict  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday unanimously gave a green light to the deployment
of 5,500 peace-keepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
in order to monitor the Central African nation's shaky peace
process in what has been described as Africa's first world war.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for
the maintenance of world peace and security, voted 15-0 to adopt a
resolution in what has been seen as a gesture to heed the repeated
and collective appeals from the international community, including
African regional leaders in particular, to send peace-keepers into
the war-torn DRC at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted after weeks of negotiations, spelt out
conditions for the U.N. military deployment -- the respect for the
Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, the preparation of the disengagement
of forces and the guarantee of security and the freedom of
movement for U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demonstrates the readiness and determination of
the international community, including the Security Council, to
offer a hand in promoting the peace process in the country, which,
formerly known as Zaire, is located in "the heart of Africa."
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the DRC conflict, which has drawn
six African countries, is a highly complicated and sensitive issue.
The U.N. deployment, if completed, is designed only to assist the
implementation of part of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, signed
by warring parties on July 10 last year in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
While the further deployment of forces is a good step, more
and harder tasks are laying before the world community and the
parties to the conflict, which called for concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
First, the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and the strict adherence to the Lusaka Agreement
constitute the sound basis for the political settlement of the
current crisis in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Repeated violations of the cease-fire by almost all parties
has stalled one of the agreement's most vital aspects: the
deployment of U.N. peace-keepers in the African nation.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which sponsored the resolution and financed
about 30 percent of the U.N. peace-keeping operations in DRC,
refuses to bring in peace-keepers until there are improved
security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Second, it is highly imperative for all warring parties to
engage in unconditional cooperation to end the many-sided war in
DRC despite their deep distrust and profound hatred.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation, a must among warring parties and between the
U.N. peace-keepers and the warring factions, can create a required
atmosphere conducive to the implementation of Lusaka Agreement,
which includes the orderly withdrawal of all foreign troops from
the DRC soil, as is demanded by the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Aside from its international ramifications, the conflict in
DRC has triggered a human rights catastrophe. According to a
recent U.N. assessment, DRC is host to 960,000 refugees from nine
neighboring countries. Overall, some 12.7 million people -- or 21
percent of the population -- face varying levels of food
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, any delay in the long-awaited cooperation among
warring parties will create further crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Third, it is also crucial that an open, inclusive and
democratic national dialogue on the future of DRC get under way as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
For DRC, the Lusaka Agreement has established a process of
dialogue that African leaders hope will lead to national
reconciliation in the country. They recently appointed a
facilitator, Ketumile Masire, to achieve this end. But as Masire
pointed out, the outcome of his efforts relies on the willingness
of the Congolese people to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
In short, the Security Council has taken a critical step to
help DRC to come to a peace that its people so desperately need.
However, the situation on the ground is so complicated that it
would not only be naive but dangerous to rely on its settlement by
external forces.
</P>
<P>
The DRC conflict broke out in August 1998 when rebels, backed
by Uganda and Rwanda, launched an offensive to oust President
Laurent Kabila. It has soaked up fighting forces from at least six
African countries -- with troops from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola
all fighting on Kabila's side.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming development took place. The Security Council adopted
the resolution well after the end of a one-day special summit in
Lusaka, which attracted seven African regional leaders, including
those from DRC and other countries involved in the 16-month
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The summit concluded with a joint communique which reaffirmed
the African leaders' strong commitment to the Lusaka accord and
reiterated their determination for its full implementation.
Acknowledging that some violations of the agreement have occurred,
the summit undertook to ensure that such violations are addressed
promptly through the established mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
For now, the immediate challenge in DRC is for the warring
