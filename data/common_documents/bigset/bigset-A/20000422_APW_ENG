Progress Reported in Elian Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department spokeswoman said Attorney General
Janet Reno worked with outside intermediaries in Miami Friday on a possible
agreement that would transfer custody of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives
to his father immediately. Both sides reported some progress late in the
evening. Details of the plan have not been worked out, said Justice spokeswoman
Carole Florman. Florman would not identify the intermediaries other than as
members of the Miami community. She said they were in contact with Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez and his family, who have defied Reno's order to
transfer Elian.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors interviewed President Clinton Friday
-- and Vice President Al Gore earlier this week -- as part of a long-running
investigation into alleged fund-raising abuses in the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign. Clinton's interview with the Justice Department Campaign
Finance Task Force was conducted under oath and lasted four hours, said a White
House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Attorney General Janet Reno
established the task force to investigate allegations that illegal foreign and
corporate donations were made in the 1996 presidential campaign.

Nations Talk on Afghanistan Threats

<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Leaders of four former Soviet republics in
Central Asia on Friday signed a security pact intended to help contain the flow
of drugs and preventing radical Islamic groups from expanding their influence
across the region. Citing Afghanistan as the ''main source of fanaticism and
extremism in the region,'' Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov said: ''We have
found ourselves exposed to a powerful ideological expansion.'' Karimov spoke
after signing the treaty with presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan,
Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan. The pact calls
for expanding cooperation between the countries' security agencies and envisages
joint military action if one is attacked.

Congo Diamond Pillaging To Be Probed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended that the
Security Council consider creating a panel of experts to investigate the illegal
pillaging of Congo's natural resources. Congo has accused Rwanda and Uganda of
backing rebels in the country so they can have access to Congo's diamond and
gold mines. The Security Council, already concerned at how diamonds have fueled
Angola's war, asked Annan in a January resolution to suggest ways to curb the
exploitation. Annan replied back on Thursday with a suggestion that the council
create a panel of experts to launch a six-month investigation and make
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Analyst: Credit-rating upgrade could come with debt reform  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York could earn its first credit upgrade
from Moody's Investors Service in a decade if state leaders
institute meaningful reforms to its borrowing practices this year,
a Moody's analyst says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kurtter of Moody's Investors Service said the state's
highest-in-the-nation accumulated debt of about $36 billion and its
frequent use of so-called backdoor borrowing are ''important''
factors in the state's current poor credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's gives the state's bonds an A2 rating, tying New York
with Louisiana for the worst rating among the 40 states it rates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has become insistent that the Legislature
institute debt reform measure in the 2000-01 state budget. The
process of adopting a new budget for the fiscal year beginning
April 1 came to a screeching halt this week, with legislative
sources blaming Pataki's hardened stance on debt reform as one
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has proposed a borrowing reform package which includes a
cap on new general obligation and revenue bonding to 3.5 percent of
the state's personal income. New York's debt load is currently 6.4
percent of personal income.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's package would also eliminate the non-voter-approved
bonding called ''backdoor'' borrowing and require bonded money to
be spent only on capital projects and not to balance budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the current strength of the state's economy and its
current financial position, adoption of this debt reform proposal
could be a significant positive credit development for the state,''
Kurtter, who was once a fiscal staffer in the New York state
Legislature, wrote in a ''special comment'' on debt reform in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the state's credit rating would save taxpayers
millions of dollars because it would cost the state less in
interest charges to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   Another chief Wall Street credit-rating agency, Standard &AMP;
Poor's, upgraded New York's credit rating twice in recent years.
But its latest rating of A-plus is still two notches below the
national average of state debt ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's has declined to raise the state's credit rating,
however. Kurtter last year cited the state's heavy reliance on debt
financing, its overall debt load and projected future budget
shortfalls as the reason Moody's would not boost New York's credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Republicans in the state Senate and Assembly members
have all proposed debt-reduction programs. Kurtter said there
''appears to be a growing consensus that debt reform is needed'' in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Pataki's Budget Division, said
the Moody's report is affirmation of the value of enacting debt
reform measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear signal from Wall Street that the governor's
debt reform plan could produce a credit-rating upgrade for New
York,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, state Assembly Republican Leader John Faso
called debt the ''silent thief'' of state taxpayer dollars. He said
that the cost of debt service alone on all that borrowing has grown
from $1.9 billion in 1992 to $3.4 billion this year. Debt service
is the amount of principal and interest the state pays each year on
its outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prominence of debt reform at the state budget
bargaining table, Pataki and legislative leaders have also agreed
to put a $3.8 billion bond act before voters this November. It
would fund improvements in roadways, bridges and mass transit and,
if approved, represent the single largest bonding act in New York
history.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of Pataki's debt reform plan would need to be
approved by voters in the form of amendments to the state
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general made $6.2 million in 1999  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and
wife Silda Wall reported an income of $6.2 million last year,
thanks in a large part from the sale of properties in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $5.9 million Spitzer earned from selling eight
cooperative apartments in Central Park South in February 1999 is
going to pay off the $9 million debt he incurred in his 1994 and
1998 campaigns for attorney general, spokesman Darren Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also reported making $142,492 as attorney general in
1999, according to federal and tax returns made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spitzers also made $123,162 in income from rental
properties, also on Central Park South, and another $44,000 from
capital gains on improvements made to the apartments that were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Spitzers earned $465,840 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They reported paying $1.3 million in federal taxes and $665,214
in state taxes last year.
</P>
<P>
   The couple made $16,056 in charitable contributions by check and
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Silda Wall, like her husband a Harvard-educated lawyer, did not
work outside the Spitzer home last year. The couple has three young
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer borrowed about $4 million from J.P. Morgan Bank during
his failed 1994 bid to win the Democratic nomination for attorney
general. He borrowed another $5 million for his 1998 campaign
against Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco, Dopp said.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1998 campaign, Spitzer acknowledged that his real
estate developer father, Bernard, had lent him money to pay off the
1994 debts. Spitzer had insisted that the loan did not violate any
state campaign finance laws -- campaign contributions from relatives
are limited to $100,000 or less -- because the loan was obtained
following his loss in the four-way Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Dopp said a portion of the $5.9 million from the apartment sale
will go toward paying off Bernard Spitzer and the rest would be
used to repay bank loans. While the money will not be enough to
retire all debts, Dopp said it would ''substantially reduce'' the
amount the attorney general owes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is determined to pay off the campaign debts with his own
resources,'' Dopp said. ''He is handling this by selling his own
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   A specific breakdown of the repayment structure was not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Giuliani courting upstate voters next week  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hitting a key electoral battleground,
Hillary Rodham Clinton plans a three-day foray across upstate New
York next week while Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani is looking to
spend at least two days in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, after a Monday night fund-raising event in New
York City with President Clinton and Vice President Gore, will head
upstate on Tuesday. Over three days she plans stops across a swatch
of the Southern Tier and western New York, aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor plans to address a Republican dinner in
Saratoga Springs on Friday and to be in Buffalo the next day for a
forum for Senate candidates being hosted by the Independence Party,
the New York arm of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, it was still unclear if Clinton would attend the
Independence Party's Senate forum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she
is concerned about the influence of Lenora Fulani, a former leader
of the leftist New Alliance Party, in the Independence Party and
Fulani's backing of Pat Buchanan as the Reform Party's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been criticized by some Republican leaders for not
spending more time in upstate New York, a region traditionally
friendly to Republicans, but resentful toward New York City
politicians. Upstate traditionally provides about 45 percent of the
voting in statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   That situation only got worse for the GOP when Giuliani canceled
a trip to Rochester and Buffalo to speak to Republican women last
week because it conflicted with the New York Yankees' rescheduled
home opener. Giuliani went to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral campaign aides have said he does not plan to slight
upstate. They said Friday that he plans to give Law Day speeches on
May 1 at Syracuse University and at the University of Rochester and
to be at the Rochester Institute of Technology on May 3 for a
college forum edition of Chris Matthews' MSNBC ''Hardball''
television show.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans her own nationally televised college forum of
sorts next week, when she will be at the State University of New
York campus in Buffalo for a Wednesday night town hall meeting
hosted by CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The meeting will be broadcast live by
the cable network from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. and by WNEQ, the Buffalo
area's public television station.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans a second nationally televised town hall meeting on
NBC-TV's ''Today Show'' on May 11 from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Mariners lost three starting position players
and starting pitcher Freddy Garcia in Friday night's game against
the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Mike Cameron was knocked out with a bruised knee.
He was hit by a foul ball from Dan Wilson while standing in the
on-deck circle in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore was moved from left to center and Stan Javier was
inserted in left by Seattle manager Lou Piniella at the start of
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Garcia left the game with a sore right knee in
the third. He was injured when he attempted to cover first on
Johnny Damon's ground ball to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost their third starter when John Mabry pulled his
right groin muscle while trying to field Jermaine Dye's hit in the
third. He came out in the top of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Designed hitter Edgar Martinez had to leave the game in the
fifth because of a sore left quadriceps muscle. He was hurt in the
third after he had an RBI groundout.

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Oilers 2  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Once again, Brett Hull scored a series-clinching
goal for the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, whose goal ended Stanley Cup finals last season, blasted
in a slap shot with 5:03 remaining Friday night to give Dallas a
3-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers and wrap up the first-round
Western Conference series in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton had tied the game at 2 just 1:07 into the third period
when Jim Dowd's shot from behind the goal caromed off the skate of
Dallas captain Derian Hatcher and into the net before goaltender Ed
Belfour knew what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Hatcher was the surprising offensive hero with the
goal that put Dallas ahead 2-1 with 7:15 left in the second period.
His score came 87 seconds after Todd Marchant had tied it at 1 by
stuffing his own rebound past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk set up Hull's third goal of these playoffs by
leaving the puck in the high slot. Hull, who has more career
playoff goals (80) than any player participating in this
postseason, wound up and drilled it to the right of Edmonton's
Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   By winning in five games, the Stars got the next-best thing to a
sweep: three home victories and a split on the road. They
desperately wanted to avoid another trip to Edmonton's raucous
Skyreach Centre and will get some extra rest before learning their
second-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third straight year Dallas has eliminated the Oilers
from the playoffs. Edmonton has lost 12 straight games at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won their seventh straight knockout game since 1998.
Belfour, celebrating his 35th birthday, made 24 saves as he upped
his record to 14-2 in games that can end a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Salo, who also stopped 24 shots, fell to 1-8 in the playoffs --
with all the games against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers did not lead in any of the three games at Reunion,
but they made this one interesting by matching the Stars
shot-for-shot, hit-for-hit and nearly goal-for-goal. Both teams
even had about the same number of missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas broke through first with a goal by Jamie Langenbrunner on
the Stars' sixth power play. His point-blank shot came during a
5-on-4 advantage, but at the time it was more like 5-on-2 because
Bill Guerin was barely out of the penalty box and Jason Smith had
lost his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano and Nieuwendyk both had two assists. For Modano, the
two points give him 84 in his postseason career, breaking the club
record set by Brian Bellows. Modano broke Bellows' career franchise
goals record this season.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Oilers were without Doug Weight for more than
20 minutes in the late second period and early third because of
back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was without defenseman Sergei Zubov, who skated Thursday
and was thought to have had a 50-50 chance of playing. He probably
will return for the second round, as could forward Jere Lehtinen.

<HEADLINE> Report: Philippine Army Shells Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The military began shelling a
rebel camp in the southern Philippines Saturday in an assault on
Muslim extremists who claimed to have beheaded two of 29 hostages
abducted a month ago, a radio report said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station DXRC said the Abu Sayyaf rebels reported that the
military pounded their camp in Basilan province with Howitzer
cannons and mortars.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado would not confirm or deny the
report. ''I hesitate to comment on operational matters because it
might endanger our people,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf said they beheaded two male teachers on Wednesday
because the government had ignored its demands for the release of
the hostages, including the freeing of Arab terrorists held in
jails in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded the release of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind
of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, and
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to blow up New York
City landmarks. They also demanded the release of two Abu Sayyaf
members being held in a Basilan jail.
</P>
<P>
   The demands were rejected by the Philippine government and by
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station, which had been off the air because of Easter
holidays, made a special 2{ hour broadcast early Saturday to report
the alleged military assault.
</P>
<P>
   The station said residents of Maluso town could hear explosions
from nearby Sumisip, where the rebel camp is located. It said four
helicopter gunships were seen over the area.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado said any decision to attack the camp would be made by a
local crisis committee that is negotiating with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If people in the area heard explosions or gunfire, ''then there
must have been a go-signal from the crisis committee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as human shields after
attacking an army outpost. Some of the hostages have since been
freed.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. It has been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians,
including the abduction of foreign missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Peter Forsberg's first goal of the playoffs was
the first-round series clincher, leading the Colorado Avalanche
past the Phoenix Coyotes 2-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado wins the best-of-seven series 4-1 and advances to the
Western Conference semifinals, against either Detroit or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg shoveled a perfect pass to Sandis Ozolinsh for the
tying goal late in the second period, then scored the game-winner
at 5:43 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   After a turnover by Phoenix's Juha Ylonen, Adam Foote took a
shot from the left circle. Forsberg, stationed in front of the net,
deflected it past goalie Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Burke had 29 saves, and Colorado's Patrick Roy had 19.
</P>
<P>
   It was Colorado's seventh straight victory at the Pepsi Center,
including its last four regular-season games. The Avalanche haven't
lost here since March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes lost their 10th straight playoff series, including
when the franchise was in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored in a ragged first period that saw Colorado
outshoot Phoenix 11-4. Roy stopped Mikael Renberg on a breakaway
after a turnover early in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick made it 1-0 at 12:31 of the second
period with his second goal of the series, beating Roy from the
right point after stealing the puck at the Phoenix blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after emerging from the penalty box, Ozolinsh tied it.
He streaked down the right side on a 3-on-1, took Forsberg's pass
and scored from the right circle at 18:25. It was Ozolinsh's third
goal of the series and gave him points in all five games.
</P>
<P>
   Roy had several acrobatic saves in the third period, including
stops of Jyrki Lumme and Roenick in the waning minutes.

<HEADLINE> Report: Laptop Had Sensitive Info.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A laptop computer missing from the State
Department since January contained highly sensitive information
about U.S. intelligence gathering, The Washington Post reports.
</P>
<P>
   If the laptop was stolen for information about weapons
technology, the theft would be one of the most serious losses of
U.S. classified information ever, the Post said Saturday, quoting
an unidentified source familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   The computer vanished in January from a State Department
conference room, and its disappearance was reported in early
February to the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security,
officials told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the missing computer contained thousands of highly
classified documents about arms proliferation issues, including
sensitive secrets about how the United States collects intelligence
and sources of the information. The computer also reportedly
contained information about the spread of missile technology and
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Post that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
is ''furious'' about the security lapse. She reportedly is
considering transferring responsibility for top-secret information
from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research to the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security.
</P>
<P>
   The missing computer has security officers at the State
Department and some members of Congress asking why such
super-secret data was stored on a portable computer, rather than on
a fixed desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer held ''code word'' information, a classification
higher than top secret.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House International Relations Committee,
Republican Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, has scheduled hearings
on security at the State Department.

<HEADLINE> Russia' Putin Off to Powerful Start  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A string of victories in parliament have
solidified President Vladimir Putin's authority and appear to be
setting the stage for a calmer, more conciliatory era in Russia
after the frenzied confusion of the Boris Yeltsin years.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office as acting president in December, Putin has
persuaded once-combative lawmakers to do two things they
steadfastly refused to do under Yeltsin: approve the START II
nuclear disarmament treaty and fire Russia's top prosecutor.
Lawmakers also approved the nuclear test ban treaty on Friday at
Putin's urging.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks invincible. The president's powers are already great,
and now it seems the legislative branch is ready to support him --
or afraid to oppose him,'' said Alexei Chaplygin, an analyst with
the Center for Civil Society Studies, a Moscow think tank. ''It's
very popular to like Putin now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin could just be enjoying a honeymoon after
his election by a wide margin last month. He could face more
bruising debate, for example, when he finally presents his plan for
the crucial and touchy issue of restoring Russia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, observers predict Putin will probably have little
trouble getting what he wants -- whatever that turns out to be.
While he talks of stamping out corruption, reviving Russia's global
clout and trimming taxes, he is vague about how he would realize
those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has a key advantage that his predecessor lacked: majority
support in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma. The
Communists and their allies who dominated the Duma for years lost
their majority in December parliamentary elections, and were
replaced by centrists who generally back Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Putin has done so far is clean up after Yeltsin. It
was Yeltsin who signed START II in 1993 then fought with the Duma
for years over ratification, and Yeltsin who first tried to fire
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were all Yeltsin's issues. Does that mean Putin will
continue Yeltsin's policies? Who knows,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk,
deputy director of the Institute for USA and Canada Studies in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   One policy Putin appears determined to pursue is nuclear
disarmament. As soon as the Duma ratified START II, talks began in
Geneva on further cuts of warhead stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin is treading cautiously. He insists Russia will pull
out of any arms control pact if Washington follows through on
amending the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to build a limited
anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia will ensure its security as it sees fit,'' said
chairman of the Duma's defense committee, Andrei Nikolayev. ''The
ratification of START II has created a unique situation for
maneuvering by the Russian president,'' both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism may prove the strongest common ground between Putin
and parliament. Legislators of all political stripes embrace
Putin's goal of restoring Russia's international influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a strengthening of cooperation could only have come about
because of nationalism. The Duma still has a very nationalist
majority. Putin will use that nationalism and that majority to
exercise pressure on (Russia's) international partners,'' Kremenyuk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is seen as a cool-headed consensus-builder, unlike the
temperamental, fervently anti-communist Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met almost no resistance with his request Wednesday that
the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, fire top
prosecutor Skuratov. The house generally supports the government,
but defiantly refused Yeltsin's repeated requests to fire Skuratov
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The council, which is made up of regional governors, appears
eager to stay in Putin's favor. Analysts say the governors are
worried that Putin will slash regional leaders' powers if they
prove too unruly.
</P>
<P>
   Even Skuratov, who says Yeltsin's inner circle was trying to
remove him to thwart his investigation into alleged Kremlin
corruption, seemed unfazed by dismissal at the hand of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Skuratov warned that Putin may not tackle high-level
graft because of his close ties to Yeltsin's scandal-marred
administration. Putin has promised to fight corruption, which
plagues every facet of Russian life and is a key obstacle to
economic progress.

<HEADLINE> Amato Asked To Lead Italy Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Giuliano Amato, given the nod to form a new
government, is moving quickly to put together a coalition solid
enough to last until elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   His center-left coalition hopes by then it will be better
positioned to fend-off an anticipated stiff challenge at the ballot
box from conservatives led by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi asked Amato, who was
a Socialist premier in 1992-93, to try to form Italy's 58th postwar
government after majority leaders pledged to back an Amato-led
coalition in the required vote of confidence in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition leaders, after meeting Friday night with Amato,
predicted a government would be formed by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   After officials backed by Berlusconi routed Premier Massimo
D'Alema's candidates in regional elections on April 16, D'Alema's
coalition partners agreed that the premier had to go. They decided
to find a new man who could keep the coalition going till spring
2001, when parliamentary elections are due to be held.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, a former Communist who governed for 18 months, obliged,
resigning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smelling ballot-box victory, Berlusconi's camp lobbied Ciampi to
call elections immediately, but were turned down by the president,
who said he believed Amato's support was solid.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, who had been treasury minister, was widely credited for
helping Italy rein in its budget deficit. He wasted no time in
trying to win over leftist allies, including Communists wary about
pension-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi could have called a special election, but that would have
blocked a referendum on reforming the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Amato pledged to work to reform the system in which a quarter of
parliament's seats are divvied up by all parties winning any votes
instead of by direct election. The system is blamed for a slew of
often bickering tiny parties that slow up the legislative progress
and sometimes bring down governments.
</P>
<P>
   An opposition leader, Roberto Maroni, criticized the choice of
Amato, saying it set Italian political history back 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the minister's former ties to the Socialist
Party led by Bettino Craxi, the former premier who, tainted by
corruption scandals in the early 1990s, was in self-exile in
Tunisia when he died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amato's integrity was never questioned during the scandals.

<HEADLINE> Reno Working on Elian Transfer  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno worked with
outside intermediaries in Miami Friday on a proposal that would
transfer custody of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his
father immediately. All sides reported some progress late in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Miami home where the 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck
survivor has lived since last Thanksgiving, Ramon Saul Sanchez,
head of anti-Castro Democracy Movement, emerged at 11 p.m. EDT and
told a crowd of Cuban exiles there had been progress in the talks,
but urged the demonstrators to stay in case they need to reform a
human chain to prevent the government from forcibly removing Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''These parties are still working out the details of such a
plan,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said. She would not
identify the intermediaries other than as civic leaders of the
Miami community.
</P>
<P>
   All evening, both the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez in
Washington, and his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami, met with
their lawyers to discuss the proposal. Working through the evening
at the Justice Department, Reno relayed proposals between
intermediaries and the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the boy's Cuban father insisted that any deal
contain an immediate transfer of custody of Elian to him, but the
Miami relatives have defied Reno's order switching custody. They
have cared for him since he was found nearly five months ago
clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic after a boat carrying his
mother and other Cubans capsized, killing her and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives are backed, in the street outside their home, by
crowds of exiles vowing to prevent a transfer that would mean the
boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said in an interview, ''The plan is to
have both families in a secure compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the plan called for Juan Miguel Gonzalez and
Elian, Lazaro and his daughter, Marisleysis, to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington -- either Wye
Plantation, a center on Maryland's Eastern shore that has been used
for Mideast peace conferences, or Airlie House near Warrenton, Va.,
according to a government official, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The intermediaries' plan called for formal custody to transfer
immediately from the Miami relatives to the boy's Cuban father, but
it was not clear that the relatives had accepted that provision,
this official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point was the length of the joint occupation of
the compound. The intermediaries proposed the stay by all family
members last until a court appeal is completed, in late May at the
earliest. But the official said that Juan Miguel Gonzalez faxed a
counterproposal back in late evening that called for a much shorter
joint stay, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner and other
officials waited in Reno's Justice Department office past midnight
for a reply from the relatives to the father's counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   During the evening, Gonzalez traveled from his temporary home in
the Maryland suburbs to the downtown offices of his lawyer, Gregory
Craig, to review proposals forwarded by Reno. He went home before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The insistence of the government and the father on immediate
transfer has been the sticking point in the negotiations, because
the Miami relatives have demanded continued discussion of whether
Elian should be turned over. The relatives lost a U.S. District
Court battle. An appeals court has ordered Elian to stay in this
country until it hears the case, but did not bar Reno from
switching custody.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night outside the father's temporary Maryland home, the
Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches, who
has been assisting him, said the relatives in Miami are ''getting
closer'' to action he would find acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers assembled at Lazaro Gonzalez' Miami home Friday night. A
fax machine was carried in, then back out when they went to a local
restaurant. At mid-evening, the crowd of Cuban exiles outside was
read a letter to Reno that suggested resistance on the key issue.
In it, the relatives' pediatrician, Armando Acevedo, wrote that it
would be ''harmful ... (and) inhumane'' to remove Elian from their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Florman said the sketchy plan presented to Reno by the
intermediaries called for ''a cooperative resolution that would
include an immediate transfer of Elian to his father's care.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on the intermediaries' plan began even before Reno met
Friday afternoon at the Justice Department with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, but it was not clear whether any mention was made of it
in their 15-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   During the emotional session, the father said he had a very good
25-minute telephone conversation with his son on Thursday, the
government official said. He also asked Reno to give him a date
certain when he would get his son back.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement afterward, Reno said she told him ''that
I could not commit to a particular course of action or timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, in a separate effort to resolve the wrenching custody
battle, no progress was made at a secret meeting Friday in Miami
between mediators from the Justice Department's Community Relations
Service and Lazaro Gonzalez and his daughter, Marisleysis, who
helps care for Elian, according to a source familiar with the
session held at a church.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, also attended by a local radio station owner, was
an effort by the government to reach out to the relatives, but the
great-uncle and his daughter said they would not turn over the boy,
this source said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually out of options, Reno also awaited word Friday from her
law enforcement agents in Miami on the best time for them to remove
Elian from his Florida relatives. Justice officials said key
federal marshals and immigration agents were being positioned
outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Florman said earlier Friday that the attorney general was
''looking to our law enforcement officials to determine the best
timing and methods'' for removing Elian from Lazaro Gonzalez's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the great-uncle's house, dozens of exiles prayed; others
bore 6-foot wooden crosses representing Jesus' crucifixion on Good
Friday. Most of them said it would be a mistake for the federal
government to try to remove Elian by force.
</P>
<P>
   Before word of a possible deal emerged late Friday, federal
officials had said an operation to retrieve Elian was possible this
weekend but was more likely next week, because of the time required
to prepare it and a reluctance to risk violence over Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was on the verge of ordering law enforcement agents
to pick up Elian, Reno replied, ''If I were going to do something
like that, I certainly wouldn't tell you.''

<HEADLINE> Medical Accounts May Help Healthy  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medical savings accounts are tax shelters for
the wealthy or a panacea for uninsured Americans, depending on who
you talk to. With a government test of the accounts set to end this
year, Congress must decide which description fits and whether to
extend the plan to more Americans.
</P>
<P>
   MSAs, as they are known, allow people to set aside
tax-deductible savings to pay routine doctor bills. Account holders
get companion health insurance policies -- as protection against
expensive care -- that have high deductibles but can cost less than
being in a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   They are available to self-employed people and small companies
that offer them as an employee benefit under a pilot program
established by Congress in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Heine, a self-employed mother of three, was going without
insurance because she couldn't afford the premiums when she decided
to try an MSA. Now she pays $144 a month -- less than half of what
she would have paid for major medical coverage -- and squirrels
money away for her children's checkups and dental bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have kids, that really helps a lot,'' said Heine, a
single mom from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and specialty insurance firms believe MSAs are a
sure way to provide low-cost health coverage to millions of
Americans who don't have medical insurance and will help more break
free of managed care organizations. With the accounts, consumers
are free to choose their own doctors without a middleman or
gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   MSAs can be especially beneficial to healthy people with low
doctor bills, marketers say. Not only are premiums lower, but any
money not used for medical expenses can be rolled over and
accumulate toward retirement. Account holders can invest the money
in mutual funds or stocks and not pay taxes on their earnings so
long as they don't touch them until they're 65.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals are allowed to shelter up to $1,462 from taxes,
families up to $3,375. This makes MSAs attractive to lawyers and
other well-heeled, self-employed people, said Bill Raynor, MSA
manager at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't use the money, it grows, it's tax-deferred,''
said Raynor. ''They will use this as a 'medical IRA.'''
</P>
<P>
   MSA opponents say the accounts will siphon off the healthiest
people from traditional insurance plans. When left with a pool of
people more likely to file claims, those health plans will raise
premiums and insurance will become less affordable, said Ron
Pollack, president of Families USA, an advocacy group for universal
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''MSAs appeal disproportionately to the healthy,'' said Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   There are no studies tracking the incomes or health status of
people who have opened MSAs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their appeal, MSAs have not taken hold. Currently only
self-employed people and workers at small companies are allowed to
have the accounts. The Internal Revenue Service estimated that
fewer than 45,000 people had MSAs as of last year, far below the
750,000 that Congress was willing to let try the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of those people were previously uninsured, the
IRS reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Golden Rule Insurance Co., a leading MSA provider,
put the number at closer to 100,000. Company president Jack Whelan
said more people would sign up if Congress removed limits on
contributions, allowed large companies to offer MSAs to employees
and ease other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress didn't get it right the first time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Rule has lobbied hard on behalf of MSAs. Last September,
as GOP House leaders were crafting health care tax breaks that
would open MSAs to all Americans, Golden Rule gave $100,000 to a
Republican congressional campaign committee. Whelan said the
contributions are part of how the company participates in the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal on MSAs is part of a broader House-passed bill
that would give Americans some rights when dealing with health
plans, a popular issue with patients concerned that HMOs scrimp on
coverage to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The matter now rests with a congressional conference committee
working to combine the House bill with a similar Senate-passed
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan believes MSA expansion has a good chance of making it
into the final bill because both Republicans and Democrats are
concerned about the 44 million Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton has promised to veto the bill if it
expands MSAs, and it is uncertain whether lawmakers will fight to
keep the provision in the bill. However, consumers who have opened
MSAs will be able to keep them even if Congress decides to kill the
program.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs New Alzheimer's Option  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third medication to treat Alzheimer's
disease, Novartis Pharmaceuticals' Exelon, has received approval by
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Four million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's, which has no
known cause or cure. It afflicts mainly the elderly, robbing them
of their memories and ability to care for themselves and eventually
killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Exelon, whose approval was announced Friday, works in the brain
the same way as the other two Alzheimer's drugs, Aricept and
Cognex. They inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain
chemical vital for nerve cells to communicate with each other. The
longer acetylcholine remains in the brain, the longer those cells
can call up memories.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs offer modest relief for mild to moderate Alzheimer's
symptoms. While the products have not been compared directly,
Exelon's effectiveness is believed to be ''pretty much in the same
league'' as Aricept and Cognex, said FDA official Dr. Russell Katz.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 weeks of therapy, 81 percent of Exelon patients had
stable or slightly better symptoms than patients given a dummy
pill, Novartis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Katz noted that Exelon's label bears a strong warning about
a significant risk: It can cause nausea and vomiting severe enough
that patients lose weight. In clinical trials, 26 percent of women
and 18 percent of men who took high-dose Exelon lost at least 7
percent of their initial body weight.
</P>
<P>
   The nausea and weight loss did end once affected patients
stopped the drug. Katz noted that Alzheimer's patients need
options. ''We just don't know who's going to respond to which
drug'' until they try one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exelon, known chemically as rivastigmine, will be in pharmacies
by the end of May, with a wholesale price of $130 for a month's
supply, Novartis said.

<HEADLINE> Va. Goes To Court Over Census Data  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virginia wants a federal court to allow the
state to use raw Census 2000 numbers for drawing new congressional
districts without first going to the Justice Department for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia statute, signed into law April 9 by Republican Gov.
Jim Gilmore, would have the state use unsampled, or raw, numbers to
redraw congressional and legislative lines once results from this
year's census are released.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed April 10 in U.S. District Court, asks a
three-judge panel to rule that the Virginia statutes do not violate
the federal Voting Rights Act. Under the act, states with a history
of voting rights discrimination, including Virginia, must obtain
prior approval from the Justice Department before changing affected
state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important because redistricting needs to be done in a
timely fashion prior to the 2001 election cycle. Virginia has
historically used an actual count, rather than speculative
guesswork,'' said David Botkins, spokesman for state Attorney
General Mark Earley.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau would not comment on the lawsuit. Justice
Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman said lawyers are reviewing the
case but refused further comment.
</P>
<P>
   This year's census is under way now. On Thursday, temporary
workers will start going to homes to gather information from people
who did not mail back forms.
</P>
<P>
   Raw census data is due to be released by Dec. 31. Data adjusted
using the statistical method known as sampling are due to be
released by April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Court decision mandated that the federal
government use nonsampled data for the purposes of reapportioning
congressional seats. States will determine which set of numbers to
use for drawing new political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say about 1.6 percent of the population was
missed in 1990, largely minorities and inner-city residents who
tend to vote Democratic. Using statistical methods will provide a
more accurate count of the population, they contend.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling for fear it could redraw
political lines to their disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Sparks, spokesman for the advocacy group Census 2000
Initiative, said the Virginia suit will be watched closely by other
states also looking to avoid having to obtain the Justice
Department's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political court battles that usually take place after the
census is over have now started even before Census 2000 is
completed,'' said Sparks, who supports sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should Virginia prevail and be allowed to put its law into
place, there's no question that civil rights groups in Virginia
will challenge the constitutionality of the new state regulation.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 11, Diamondbacks 5  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jeff Kent drove in five runs with a bases-loaded
double, a solo home run and an RBI single as the San Francisco
Giants routed the Arizona Diamondbacks 11-5 Friday night for just
their second victory in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard hit a three-run homer and got a fourth RBI when
reliever Russ Springer walked him with the bases loaded. Bill
Mueller added a solo homer for San Francisco and starter Russ Ortiz
(2-2) helped his cause with a single and a double.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener of a three-game series, the Giants scored seven
runs off Todd Stottlemyre (3-1) in 3 2-3 innings. Five Arizona
pitchers allowed 16 hits and walked nine.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Stinnett, who hit two homers off of Ortiz on April 15 in
Arizona's 7-4 victory at San Francisco, hit another one against him
in the second inning, a 438-foot drive to left. Jay Bell also
homered off Ortiz leading off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz allowed four runs and 10 hits in seven innings. He struck
out five and walked four, including a bases-loaded walk of Andy Fox
in the sixth. Arizona stranded 11 runners, leaving the bases loaded
in the first and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, off to their worst start since 1983, scored three
apiece in the third and fourth innings while stopping Arizona's
three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz led off the third with a single, then Benard walked. They
advanced on Mueller's sacrifice, then Stottlemyre loaded the bases
by walking Barry Bonds. Kent doubled to deep center to clear the
bases and make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Rich Aurilia singled with one out and Ortiz hit a
ground-rule double with two outs to put runners at second and
third, then Bernard homered to right field to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Kent led off the fifth with a homer, then J.T. Snow reached base
on an error by Erubiel Durazo. Springer got two outs, then walked
Doug Mirabelli, Ortiz and Benard to make it 9-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Diamondbacks designated right-handed reliever Darren
Holmes for assignment to make room for closer Matt Mantei, who was
activated from the disabled list (biceps tendinitis). Holmes will
be released if he isn't traded within 10 days. ... If the Giants
had lost, their 4-12 start would have been their worst since 1951,
the year of their miracle comeback to win the pennant on Bobby
Thomson's ''Shot Heard 'Round the World.'' ... Arizona's Tony
Womack, who missed Monday's game to attend the funeral of his
grandmother, will miss Sunday's game to attend the funeral of his
father-in-law. ... The crowd of 40,929 was Arizona's second-largest
of the season.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Question Clinton, Gore  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
were each interviewed for four hours this week in the government's
long-running investigation into alleged fund-raising abuses in the
Democrats' 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman said the vice president is not a target of the
Justice Department Campaign Finance Task Force. A White House
official said Clinton also is not a target of the investigation.
The president was interviewed Friday, Gore on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president and the vice president cooperated fully with the
task force and voluntarily agreed to be interviewed this week,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused comment on the subject of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was asked whether the president sticks by his earlier
assertions that he has done nothing wrong. ''All of his statements
still stand,'' the spokesman replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters on his campaign plane returning to
Washington from Michigan that he couldn't discuss the substance of
the task force interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a legal proceeding that customarily is protected from
open discussion, lest it somehow interfere with the success and
fairness of the undertaking. That's just pretty traditional,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would encourage the Justice Department to end its
investigation before Election Day in November, Gore said: ''I don't
think it's for me to encourage or discourage the conduct of this
investigation in any particular way. I don't think that's my role.
That's for them to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno established the task force to
investigate allegations that illegal foreign and corporate
donations were made in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has taken heavy criticism from Republicans for opting for
the task force instead of recommending an independent counsel. The
federal prosecutor she put in charge of the probe in 1997 and FBI
Director Louis Freeh both recommended an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been questioned five times under oath involving various
investigations during the Clinton administration. ''I volunteered
to cooperate fully, as I have from the beginning of their
investigation,'' he said of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I, of course, answered every question fully and completely,''
Gore said, adding he didn't know whether he would be asked for
further interviews. ''There are no outstanding -- there are no
requests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he did not discuss his interview with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department task force has indicted 24 people,
including several Clinton-Gore donors and organizers of an April
29, 1996, event at a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president attended the gathering but says he didn't
know it was a fund-raising event. On various occasions, he has said
he thought it was community outreach, finance-related and keeping
donors happy -- ''donor maintenance'' in political terms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's role in the fund-raiser has continued to dog his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether he worries that the investigation will harm
his campaign for president, he said: ''I have no feelings about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman, said the Justice
Department has assured the vice president's private attorney, Jim
Neal, that Gore is ''not a target'' of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was questioned Tuesday in the dining room of the vice
presidential residence by Robert Conrad, head of the task force.
Clinton's interview took place in the Treaty Room in the private
White House residence with a prosecutor and four FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors also are investigating whether the White
House tried to obstruct investigators by failing to surrender
e-mail messages related to 1996 campaign fund-raising allegations,
including the Buddist temple event and Gore's use of White House
telephones to solicit contributions.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Environment Record Examined  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Sometimes the debate surrounding Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's environmental record seems as hazy as the smog
that blankets this city on a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to Texas' bad air quality, and particularly
Houston's crown as the nation's smog capital of 1999, as prime
indicators that the Republican presidential candidate is soft on
environmental issues and a friend of polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bush and his supporters argue that the state's air
is improving and the governor has been behind major air-quality
improvement initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The truth may not be as clear as either side suggests. But it is
evident, according to polls, that Bush is publicly perceived as
weak on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a March poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the
Press, people chose Vice President Al Gore over Bush by 55 percent
to 30 percent when asked which candidate would do the better job on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to simplify the debate over his record early in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to ask the question, 'Is the air cleaner since I
became governor?' And the answer is yes,'' Bush has said often.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign regularly cites the latest Environmental Protection
Agency data, which show Texas led the nation in reduction of toxic
emissions for 1995-97, a 14 percent reduction of 42.6 million
pounds. The state's reduction was more than the 38.8 million pounds
of all other states combined, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists note that Texas also led all states in
total emissions with 831 million pounds during that period. And
they point to an upward spike in ozone violations since Bush became
governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the EPA and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission show there were 679 eight-hour ozone violations in
Texas' eight major metropolitan areas in the 1995-99 period, up
from 508 in 1990-94.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no argument that air quality in Texas has improved
over the last 10 years, but it's improved along with the rest of
the nation since the federal Clean Air Act was put in place in
1990,'' said Ken Kramer, director of the Sierra Club's Texas
office.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' progress has flattened in every major metropolitan area
except El Paso, Kramer said, which explains why Houston vaulted
ahead of Los Angeles as the nation's smoggiest city. Aggressive
anti-pollution measures in Los Angeles have led to sharp drops
since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by a conservative California think tank, released
Monday by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry to bolster Bush's environmental image
during Earth Week, acknowledged that progress in reducing
ground-level ozone -- a key ingredient in smog -- has stagnated under
Bush's watch.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the report by the Pacific Research Institute
for Public Policy pointed out that Texas improved in the other five
major pollution categories tracked by the EPA between 1988 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had significant gains and we have a plan in place in
which we are offering to seek 90 percent reductions in pollution,''
said Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has an impetus to seek reductions beyond improving Bush's
image. If Houston, Dallas and Beaumont do not meet national air
quality standards by 2007, the federal government may withhold
billions of dollars in highway money.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also trumpets his support for a 1999 law that
forces grandfathered power plants -- those built before the state's
1971 clean air laws -- to come into compliance with current
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   During Bush's GOP primary fight with Arizona Sen. John McCain,
television ads aired by a group called Republicans for Clean Air
said Bush had led state efforts to ''clamp down on old coal-burning
electric power plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads, paid for by Bush supporters but not his campaign, may
have overstated the governor's leadership. For two years, he had
backed an industry-supported voluntary system of permits for all
grandfathered plants, a position that still draws strong criticism
from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's endorsement of the mandatory program for power plants,
which was added to the bill by a Democrat, came in the waning days
of the 1999 Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, he was a Johnny-come-lately to that provision, and
he only publicly endorsed it after it was a fait accompli,'' Kramer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's voluntary program is now law for 760 other grandfathered
non-utility plants, but only 74 have volunteered so far, according
to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's original stance on the grandfathering issue gave
environmentalists more fodder to accuse him of being too cozy with
industry.
</P>
<P>
   His top donor over his political career has been the Houston
energy company Enron and its chief executive, Kenneth Lay,
according to the book ''The Buying of the President 2000'' by the
private Center for Public Integrity. Enron has one facility that
benefited from the voluntary permit program.
</P>
<P>
   Two other top donors have been responsible for toxic emissions.
Pilgrim's Pride Corp. and the Sterling Group were sixth and eighth
on the list, respectively, each having given more than $230,000
over Bush's career.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters ignore fire because no one could drive truck  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A group of Queens firefighters decided not to
respond to a call because no one had taken a specialized training
course to drive a fire engine, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Department Peter Ganci described the incident as
''disappointing,'' and said Friday that the matter was under
investigation. He did not comment on whether any disciplinary
action would be taken against the four firefighters and one fire
lieutenant from Engine Company 303 in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have five members of the New York City Fire Department with
a fire to respond to, and for whatever reason, contractually or
otherwise, they felt it was not necessary for them to respond,''
Ganci said. ''For me, that was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganci stressed that most city firefighters have driven fire
engines during their careers, but the department prefers to use
drivers who have undergone specialized school training.
</P>
<P>
   The incident -- first reported Friday by Newsday -- occurred
Wednesday when the company's engine driver, known as a chauffeur,
was injured, Ganci said. A fire department source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the driver had hurt his back sliding
down the firehouse pole to respond to a call earlier that day and
went on medical leave. That driver had taken the specialized
course.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lieutenant called the dispatcher to take the unit
out of service because no one else there had taken the driving
course, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganci said the department had asked another driver -- who had
taken the course -- to go to Engine Company 303, but he had not
arrived by 3:29 p.m., when a fire at 107-33 159th Street was
broadcast, with a warning that there was a ''victim suffering
serious injuries which may lead to the decease of that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Engine Company 303 should have responded to the
fire because it was in their area, but instead, the dispatcher sent
nearby Engine Company 275, which got to the scene in three minutes
and 20 seconds, the source said. The fire was put out with only
minor damage done to the building.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was apparently started by a boy playing with matches.
He was the one referred to in the fire report as supposedly
suffering serious injuries, but it turned out he had fled to a
neighbor's house. He was burned, but not badly.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters did not violate any regulations, but the
incident raised questions about their judgment, the department
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials defended the firefighters' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you drive a rig and you're not trained and you kill two
people, how does the department explain that?'' Capt. Peter Gorman,
president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, told Newsday.
Gorman did not return several telephone messages for comment
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 10, Royals 2  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jay Buhner hit a three-run homer as the Seattle
Mariners beat the Kansas City Royals 10-2 on Friday night despite
losing four starters to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Freddy Garcia, Mike Cameron, Edgar Martinez and
John Mabry all left the game with injuries, but the Mariners still
had enough to hand Kansas City its seventh straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner hit his fifth homer of the season in the sixth inning,
while Dan Wilson doubled in two runs in the fifth off Chad Durbin
(1-1) to put the Mariners ahead 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud doubled twice as Seattle scored 10 or more runs for
the fifth time in six games and the first time at Safeco Field this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Mariners placed their No. 1 starter,
left-hander Jamie Moyer, on the 15-day disabled list because of a
strained muscle in the back of his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The news got worse for manager Lou Piniella in the first four
innings. Cameron, Seattle's center fielder, bruised his left knee
when he was hit by a foul ball off the bat of teammate Dan Wilson
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the Mariners' No. 2 starter, left in the top of the
third with a twisted right knee while attempting to cover first
base.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry pulled his right groin while trying to field Jermaine
Dye's hit in the third and Martinez, the Mariners' designated
hitter, suffered a sore left quadriceps in the third when he had an
RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez (2-0) pitched four innings after Garcia left,
allowing no runs and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the third on Carlos Febles' RBI
double that ran Febles' hitting streak to 15 games, longest in the
majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the Mariners scored three runs.
Alex Rodriguez walked with the bases loaded. Olerud and Martinez
then had RBI groudouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners' Mark McLemore played center field for the
first time in his 12-year career when Piniella moved him there in
the third. He also played left and second in the game. ... Piniella
had two position players, utility player Charles Gipson and catcher
Joe Oliver, left on his bench. ... In their seven consecutive
defeats, the Royals have not held the lead at the end of an inning.
... During Febles' 15-game hitting streak, he's hitting .367
(22-for-60) with five RBIs and nine runs scored. ... The Mariners
recalled RHP Brett Tomko from Triple-A Tacoma to take Moyer's place
as Saturday's starter against the Royals. ... RHP Jay Witasick will
start for the Royals on Saturday after missing his a start because
of arm fatigue and soreness in his right biceps. ... OF Shane
Monahan, who played in 60 games for the Mariners in 1998, was
released. Monahan played eight games at Tacoma this season.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Border Hiking Trail Complete  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY HARKAVY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The idea was as much philosophical as
recreational: Build a hiking trail linking Maine and eastern
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The intent was to strengthen ties between Maine and the
provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, encouraging people to think
beyond boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Brennan came up with the concept six years ago, while
running for a third term as governor. Though he lost the election,
his failed campaign gave birth to a project that would not die: the
International Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers who developed the trail are declaring it complete
effective today -- Earth Day 2000 -- fulfilling Brennan's goal of
finishing the project in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it remains a work in progress, a case can be made
that the 650-mile trail from Katahdin, the tallest mountain in
Maine, to Cap Gaspe, Quebec, is, in fact, complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's arbitrary,'' said Dick Anderson of Freeport, president of
the IAT. ''When do you announce it's complete? It's hard to figure
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a guidebook, you can walk from one end to the
other, and we've put up 16,000 blazes,'' he said, quickly adding
that the trail probably needs a total of 40,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-by-6-inch blue and white aluminum blazes are the only
bilingual trail markers in North America, Anderson said. They
combine the letters IAT, for International Appalachian Trail, and
SIA, for Sentier International des Appalaches, the French
equivalent. The IAT even plans to put out an 800-term glossary
designed to help hikers who speak either language converse in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   More than 450 miles of trail have been located, cleared and
blazed. About 175 miles now are along country roads, the biggest
stretch over 80 miles from Baxter State Park to Bridgewater, both
in Maine. Trail officials are working to relocate those sections to
mountains and forests.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts have been hampered by lack of public lands as well
as landowner opposition and concerns about whether hikers and
logging operations can co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says the IAT has been negotiating with key landowners,
including Canada's Irving Timberlands, for easements -- legal
provisions allowing public use of privately-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope we'll eventually be able to work out a way to do it,''
said Anderson, a former commissioner of Maine's Department of
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a brief stretch along U.S. 1 between Bridgewater and
Monticello, the road walks avoid busy highways. Many offer scenic
views of old potato farms and spruce-fir forests, the dominant
terrain along most of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives people an opportunity to stop at the post office or
the grocery store,'' Anderson said. ''Some through-hikers say it's
good to be on a public road for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are continuing work on other sections. This year's
goals include building additional campsites and adding about 5,000
more blazes.
</P>
<P>
   When first planned, the IAT was heralded as an extension of the
Appalachian Trail, the 2,150-mile footpath between Maine and
Georgia. That characterization was dropped amid concerns from the
Appalachian Trail Conference, which is not involved in the IAT.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people want to think of it as an extension, that's OK. But
we're not going to use that word anymore,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they choose to call it, the IAT has enabled a handful
of hardy hikers to make a long walk in the woods even longer.

   John Brinda, a college student from Bellingham, Wash., made
history in 1997 when he became the first person to hike from Key
West, Fla., to Springer Mountain, Ga., then along the entire
Appalachian Trail, and finally to Cap Gaspe, a 4,400-mile journey
that took nine months.

duplicated Brinda's feat the following year.

new sections in Canada that offered stunning mountain and river
views.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 11, Athletics 9  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cal Ripken Jr. homered and singled to
drive in four runs as the Baltimore Orioles, after nearly blowing
an eight-run lead, hung on to beat the Oakland Athletics 11-9
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles No. 9 hitter Mike Bordick had two RBIs to take over the
league lead with 22.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson (2-0), who had a four-hit shutout at Minnesota in
his previous outing, followed up with a solid 5 2-3 innings. Ponson
allowed three runs on six hits, including Matt Stairs' two-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin got three outs for his first save, just the second
for Baltimore's bullpen in its last five chances. After consecutive
one-out walks to Ramon Hernandez and Eric Chavez, Timlin hit
pinch-hitter John Jaha with a pitch to load the bases. Timlin, who
led the AL with nine blown saves last year, then got Rich Becker to
pop out and Miguel Tejada to line out.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore had an 11-3 lead heading into the bottom of the eighth
and withstood a six-run burst Oakland to win its fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   The A's got RBI singles from Chavez, Frank Menechino and Tejada,
an RBI double from Becker and consecutive runs on a passed ball by
Charles Johnson and wild pitch by Mike Trombley. Buddy Groom got
the Orioles out of the inning when he induced a groundout from
Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares had another tough outing, giving up six runs, nine
hits and three walks in 5 2-3 innings. Olivares has given up at
least four runs in each of his last three outings and hasn't been
able to get out of the sixth inning in two of four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick's RBIs total is one more than Oakland's Jason Giambi,
who had an RBI single in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 3-1, the Orioles scored three times in the sixth,
getting RBI singles from Ripken and Bordick, whose two-out hit
chased Olivares. The inning's third run scored when Tejada, trying
to complete a double play, threw wildly from shortstop to first for
an error.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs brought the A's back, homering for a third straight game
when he drove a 2-0 offering from Ponson into the right field
bleachers to make it 6-3 in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltimore struck for five more runs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields beat out an infield single, B.J. Surhoff walked
and Albert Belle followed with an RBI single. Harold Baines added a
run-scoring single before Ripken connected off Doug Jones for his
fourth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken has 1,583 RBIs, tying Al Kaline for 29th on the career
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles pulled away from a 1-1 tie with two runs in the
fifth. Will Clark drew a leadoff walk, Johnson doubled and
Bordick's groundout scored Clark before DeShields had a run-scoring
single.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff also singled in the first to score the game's first
run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Orioles, who had 15 hits, have reached double figures
in hits in nine of their 15 games. ... Before the game, the A's
signed Tejada to an $11 million, four-year contract. ... The A's,
who fell to 7-10, haven't had a winning record in April since 1996
(13-12). ... The Orioles (10-5) already have surpassed their
victory total from last April, when they went 6-16. ... Baltimore
RHP Scott Erickson, who had surgery in early March to remove bone
chips from his right elbow, is being sent out on a rehab
assignment. He is scheduled to report to Single A Frederick on
Tuesday in his first outing since arthroscopic surgery.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Coleman Back in Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Back in the playoffs after a five-year
absence, Derrick Coleman claims he doesn't care who the Charlotte
Hornets play.
</P>
<P>
   But when he steps out onto the court tonight against the
Philadelphia 76ers -- the team he left two years ago to sign with
the Hornets -- Coleman is sure to have extra motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there will be a 'Philly factor','' Charlotte
coach Paul Silas said. ''But deep down I have to believe he still
has an extra incentive to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was excused from Thursday's practice, but returned
Friday and had what Silas called a ''good intense workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's a sign of how he'll play in the best-of-five
series is unclear. For now, Coleman said he isn't looking at the
series as a revenge match.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't worry about that, it's just the game of basketball,''
Coleman said. ''I look forward to being back in the playoffs and
I'm excited about it. I'm just going to get ready for Philadelphia,
and, hey, see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Hornets are hoping for is Coleman keeping his emotions
in check. He was ejected in the second quarter of the last meeting
between the teams when called for a flagrant foul on Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time in four regular-season meetings that the
Sixers beat Charlotte, and the Hornets think they could have won
the game if Coleman had been in it at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Derrick was having his way when he got kicked out,'' Silas
said. ''If we'd had him, we would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Philadelphia is hoping guard Allen Iverson won't be
slowed by his inflamed right elbow and broken left toe.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson's ailments kept him out of the 76ers' finale, but he
participated in back-to-back practices on Thursday and Friday for
the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of his effort to iron out the kinks before the
playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I was rusty, and yesterday was my best practice
of the year as far as my rhythm goes,'' Iverson said Friday. ''But
practice time doesn't mean anything. I'm anxious to get on the real
floor. You don't win the NBA championship on the practice floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia coach Larry Brown thinks Iverson's long layoff -- he
didn't practice at all for more than two weeks -- should help him
play through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully he'll be better,'' Brown said. ''If not, we have
other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte guard Eddie Jones, responsible for trying to contain
Iverson, is certain Iverson will be healthy. Iverson had various
ailments during the four regular-season meetings between the two
teams, but still averaged 24.8 points against Jones' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a guy is hurt, he won't be on the court,'' Jones said.
''Everybody is nicked up and has bangs and bruises, but I think
they are kind of overexposing his a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets have accepted that Iverson will score against them;
his 28.4 average ranked second in the NBA this year. Instead of
trying to stop him, they plan to have Jones slow him while their
big front line of Anthony Mason, Derrick Coleman and Elden Campbell
focuses on disrupting the rest of Philadelphia's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he is hitting his outside jumper, there's nothing you can
do,'' Silas. ''But if you can slow him at all, I think you have a
chance because you have an opportunity to contend other guys'
shots.''

<HEADLINE> Hal Sutton Leads at Greensboro  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Hal Sutton's golf game looks invincible
these days. He claims otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   One month after holding off Tiger Woods to win the Players
Championship by one shot, Sutton will take a commanding five-shot
lead into today's third round of the $3 million Greater Greensboro
Chrysler Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's 8-under-par 64 Friday included 11 birdies, but the PGA
Tour's second-leading money winner insisted he can be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a great deal of respect for the game itself and all the
guys that play the game,'' said Sutton, who finished at 13-under
131 through 36 holes. ''There are many, many capable players on
this tour.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sutton's closest competition is Barry Cheesman, who has
missed 111 of 178 cuts in his career and never won on tour. He
moved into contention with a 66 and is at 8-under 136.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other players are tied for third at 138, seven shots
behind Sutton. That group included defending champion Jesper
Parnevik, who shot a second straight 69, and Brian Henninger, who
shared the first-round lead with Scott Verplank.
</P>
<P>
   ''In no way would I ever, ever allow myself to have that feeling
that I don't think I can be beat,'' Sutton said following his best
round of the season. ''That is possible, by many folks. A lot of
people can beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mistaking Sutton likes his position and chances
over the weekend at Forest Oaks Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all aspire to have the lead,'' he said. ''That's what we
want. That's what we come here for. I just hope I'll be up for the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton needed only 24 putts on the speedy greens, including
birdie putts of 35 and 50 feet in carding a 5-under 31 over his
final nine holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was almost looking like I did last year,'' said Parnevik,
one of Sutton's playing partners. ''He holed some monster putts. It
was fun to watch. Anytime anyone shoots 64 it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing what can happen when the putter is working,''
Sutton added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Verplank followed his first-round 66 with a 74 to
fall back into the field.
</P>
<P>
   Verplank, who lost a playoff here to Trevor Dodds in 1998, was
at 7 under until a double bogey on No. 15 and a bogey on his final
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesman, 116th on the money list, started the day at 2 under
and four shots behind the leaders. But he fired a 6-under 30 on the
front side to move atop the leaderboard before Sutton teed off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to win out here, everybody wants to win out
here,'' he said. ''I don't live or die with it. If I don't win this
week I am going to play next week. If I win this week I'm going to
play next week. I figure if I go out and play good enough it's
going to happen some time. Maybe this will be the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheesman closed the front nine with a 5-iron to 4 feet on the
221-yard par-3 No. 8 for birdie, then nailed a 2-iron to 5 feet for
an eagle on the par-5 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He got to 9 under when he chipped in from 30 feet on No. 12, but
missed a 3-foot birdie putt a hole later and then bogeyed when he
missed another short one on the 14th hole.

<HEADLINE> Kings Optimistic Before Playing LA  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Sacramento Kings finished the season on a
downer, losing seven of their last eight games, including the final
four. They dropped into the No. 8 slot in the Western Conference
playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as they prepare for their first-round matchup with the
top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, Lakers star Kobe Bryant believes the
Kings appear to put the slump behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody who knows Sacramento knows they don't really
care about that, they just come out and play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kings guard Jason Williams supported that theory, saying,
''There's no question we never lose our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will need more than confidence to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a 67-15 regular-season record -- second-best in
franchise history -- and homecourt advantage throughout the
playoffs, the Lakers are favored to win their first championship
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   History is against the Kings, too. In 156 opportunities since
the 16-team playoff format was adopted 16 years ago, the 1994
Denver Nuggets and 1999 New York Knicks are the only eighth-seeded
teams to beat a No. 1, eliminating Seattle and Miami, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Lakers enter the best-of-five series that
begins Sunday at Staples Center a bit wary, and the Kings come in
with some optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know this team, we'll have to play well to beat them,''
first-year Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''We have not yet found
a way to stop (Chris) Webber.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber, the NBA's sixth-leading scorer, averaged 27 points and
11 rebounds in four games against the Lakers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the heart and soul of their team,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal agreed, saying, ''He's a dominant power
forward. I think if we shut everyone else down, we'll be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has been even more dominant. A virtual lock to win his
first NBA Most Valuable Player award, he scored an NBA-leading 29.7
points per game and averaged 35.3 points and 13.3 rebounds against
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't stop Shaq, you just do your best to keep him busy,
make him work hard,'' Sacramento's Vlade Divac said. ''To beat the
Lakers, we need to have a perfect game. We need to take care of the
basketball, that's a real key for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their late-season slide, the Kings (44-38) had their
best record since 1982-83, when they went 45-37 while playing in
Kansas City. Sacramento's success was mainly due to a run-and-gun
attack that resulted in a league-leading 105.0 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings gave the Lakers a tough time, beating them once and
losing three times, but by just three, one and seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Transition baskets,'' Bryant said when asked why the Kings had
success against the Lakers. ''Our defensive floor balance wasn't up
to par. We're going to have to nip that in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers believe they have put some bitter playoff memories
behind them, and the atmosphere certainly appears different under
Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls to six championships in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In their three previous playoffs since O'Neal and Bryant joined
them, the Lakers were beaten 4-1 by Utah in the second round in
1997; 4-0 by the Jazz in the 1998 Western Conference finals' and
4-0 by San Antonio in the second round last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a little more serious and we're better prepared,''
O'Neal said. ''We're playing a young, flashy, exciting team. We're
ready to get it started. I just hope we can bring our 'A' game
every night. If we can, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 at Staples Center won't be played until Thursday night
before the series shifts to Sacramento.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno worked with outside
intermediaries in Miami Friday on a proposal that would transfer custody of
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his father immediately. All sides
reported some progress late in the evening. Outside the Miami home where the
6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor has lived since last Thanksgiving, Ramon
Saul Sanchez, head of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, emerged at 11 p.m. EDT

backing rebels in the country so they can have access to Congo's diamond and
gold mines. The Security Council, already concerned at how diamonds have fueled
Angola's war, asked Annan in a January resolution to suggest ways to curb the
exploitation. Annan replied back on Thursday with a suggestion that the council
create a panel of experts to launch a six-month investigation and make

<HEADLINE> Jurors Rule in Favor of Disney Exec  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge will decide how much the Walt
Disney Co. must pay the estate of a late executive after a jury
ruled the company improperly coerced the dying man into signing
over millions of dollars in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury ruled 8-0 in favor of Robert Jahn's estate.
</P>
<P>
   The estate alleged Disney officials visited the AIDS-infected
Jahn just weeks before his death in May 1994 and forced him to sign
over $2.2 million in stock options, life insurance and deferred
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors rejected Disney's argument that Jahn gave up the benefits
to avoid being fired for taking kickbacks from vendors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a moral victory. This is the appropriate verdict. And I
hope this corporation gets the message. It shouldn't conduct
business like this,'' Larry Sackey, an attorney for Jahn's estate,
said after Friday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson will decide later how much
Disney owes Jahn's estate.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had argued that Jahn relinquished his benefits orally in
December 1993 and in a written agreement in April 1994 to avoid
being exposed as a crook. In exchange, he kept his salary and
medical coverage, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney attorney John Quinn interpreted the ruling as favorable
to the company, because even though jurors ''found that the written
contract was unenforceable as a legal matter, they correctly
concluded that Mr. Jahn's promise to Disney to release his
non-medical benefits was valid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the case is over,'' Quinn said, adding that he
believes Disney won't owe the estate anything.
</P>
<P>
   Jahn was a senior vice president at Disney Motion Pictures &AMP;
Television Co., in charge of making trailers and TV ads for Disney
films.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jahn's estate denied he ever took kickbacks, but
said he was on his deathbed and didn't have the strength to fight
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, Quinn accused Jahn of bilking the
company out of $5.7 million by allowing subcontractors to overbill
for services. Lawyers also said Jahn funneled more than $300,000
through a companion by forcing one of the vendors to hire the man
at an inflated salary.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Shells Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The military launched an assault
Saturday in the southern Philippines against Muslim extremists who
claimed to have beheaded two of 29 hostages abducted a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''A rescue operation is going on,'' said chief of staff Gen.
Angelo Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate report on the condition of the hostages,
who have been held since March 20. The group, Abu Sayyaf, said its
members beheaded two male teachers Wednesday because the government
had ignored its demands, which include the freeing of Arab
terrorists such as the man behind the 1993 bombing of the World
Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said the decision to attack the rebel camp in Basilan
province was made by a provincial crisis management committee that
has handled the hostage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have reports of rebel casualties, and on our part, we
don't have any casualty,'' Reyes said. He refused to give other
details, saying it would jeopardize the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station DXRC said the rebels reported that the military
pounded their camp in Basilan province with Howitzer cannons and
mortars.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station, which had been off the air because of Easter
holidays, made a special 2{ hour broadcast early Saturday to report
the military assault.
</P>
<P>
   The station said residents of Maluso town could hear explosions
from nearby Sumisip, where the rebel camp is located. It said four
helicopter gunships were seen over the area.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded the release of Ramzi Yousef, mastermind
of the World Trade Center bombing, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks. They also
demanded the release of two Abu Sayyaf members being held in a
Basilan jail.
</P>
<P>
   The demands were rejected by the Philippine government and by
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 people from two
schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as human shields after
attacking an army outpost. Some of the hostages have since been
freed.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. It has been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians,
including the abduction of foreign missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.

<HEADLINE> Strut Collapses on Qantas Plane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The landing gear of a Qantas Airways
Ltd. jet collapsed as it was preparing to take off from Rome's
international airport, the company said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A Qantas spokeswoman said all 303 passengers and 19 crew aboard
Qantas flight 16 disembarked safely after the landing gear failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747, bound for Melbourne, was moving down the runway
when the strut gave way, causing one of its four engines to slam
into the tarmac, according to a passenger who described the
accident to Sydney's 2UE Radio network.
</P>
<P>
   The Qantas spokeswoman said the passengers were evacuated after
fuel leaked to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company would send a team to Rome to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The malfunction is the latest in a series of minor mishaps for
Qantas. In the most serious, a Qantas jet carrying 391 passengers
and 16 crew overshot the runway during a landing at Bangkok airport
on Sept. 23. No one was injured.

<HEADLINE> NHL Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars wrapped up their
first-round playoff series in five games. So did the Colorado
Avalanche and, surprisingly, the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Pronger, Al MacInnis and Pierre Turgeon made sure St.
Louis' series -- and season -- didn't end.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger snapped a third-period tie with a power-play goal,
MacInnis scored his first goal of the playoffs, and Turgeon added
two assists Friday night as the Blues beat the San Jose Sharks 5-3
to extend their Western Conference best-of-seven matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their top players were certainly their top players tonight,''
Sharks defenseman Brad Stuart said. ''They did a good job of coming
out and throwing everything at us early.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is trying to avoid becoming the first Presidents'
Trophy winner to bow out of the playoffs in the first round since
the Chicago Blackhawks in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's other NHL playoff games, Pittsburgh edged Washington
2-1 in the Eastern Conference, while Dallas got past Edmonton 3-2
and Colorado beat Phoenix 2-1 in the West. All three of those
best-of-seven first-round series ended 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto plays host to Ottawa in tonight's lone game. Their
series is tied 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 seed Pittsburgh upended Washington, which was seeded
second, by winning the teams' fourth straight one-goal game with
some help: Jaromir Jagr's cross-ice pass was accidentally deflected
into the net by Washington defenseman Calle Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, the NHL's regular-season scoring leader despite missing 19
games, managed only one shot on goal through two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do you want me to say -- that I was so lucky? You have to
be lucky to win,'' Jagr said. ''If they would have scored a goal
and we would lose you guys would have said that we got outplayed
and we didn't have a good team. It happens. It's hockey. Of course,
we were lucky. We're going to take it. I'm going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The early exit maintained Southeast Division champion
Washington's pattern of disappointing postseasons -- with the
exception of 1998, when it reached the Stanley Cup finals before
losing to Detroit. It also continued the Penguins' penchant for
ousting the Capitals. Pittsburgh beat Washington for the fifth time
in six postseason meetings over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh will face the Philadelphia Flyers, who eliminated
Buffalo in five games, in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Louis, Ricard Persson's goal gave the league's top
regular-season team a 3-0 lead just 7:13 into the game. But the
Sharks, who will be home for Game 6 on Sunday, rallied to tie at
3-3, before MVP candidate Pronger put the Blues ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, in the penalty box for 24 minutes in the first four
games, had only one minor infraction. MacInnis had been shut out on
21 shots the first four games, and Turgeon had been minus-3 with
only two points the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Ladislav Nagy, a 20-year-old rookie, and MacInnis had the Blues'
first two goals, while Scott Young added an empty-net goal with
33.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ricci had a goal and an assist and Vincent Damphousse had
two assists for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
Penguins 2, Capitals 1
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Wright scored his second goal of the series in the first
period for Pittsburgh. Sergei Gonchar scored for Washington, which
lost at home for only the ninth time all season.
</P>
<P>
Stars 3, Oilers 2
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, whose goal ended the Stanley Cup finals last season,
blasted in a slap shot with 5:03 remaining as Dallas eliminated
Edmonton from the playoffs for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Oilers had tied the game at 2 just 1:07 into the
third period when Jim Dowd's shot from behind the goal caromed off
the skate of Dallas captain Derian Hatcher and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher put Dallas ahead 2-1 with 7:15 left in the second
period. His score came 87 seconds after Todd Marchant tied it at 1
by stuffing his own rebound past Dallas goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was set up when Joe Nieuwendyk left the puck
for Hull in the high slot. Hull, who has more career playoff goals
(80) than any player participating in this postseason, wound up and
drilled a shot to the right of Edmonton's Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I'm supposed to do,'' Hull said. ''That's my job.
I live to score goals.''
</P>
<P>
Avalanche 2, Coyotes 1
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg's assist tied the game and his first goal of the
playoffs put Colorado into the West semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg, who missed the first 23 regular-season games after
surgery on his left shoulder and sat out the playoff opener with an
injured right shoulder, shoveled a perfect pass to Sandis Ozolinsh
to make it 1-1 late in the second period. Forsberg scored the
winner at 5:43 of the third by deflecting Adam Foote's shot past
Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has won seven straight home games.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix lost its 10th consecutive playoff series, dating to
1987, when the franchise was in Winnipeg.

Philippine Military Shells Camp
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- The military launched an assault Saturday in
the southern Philippines against Muslim extremists who claimed to have beheaded
two of 29 hostages abducted a month ago. "A rescue operation is going on," said
chief of staff Gen. Angelo Reyes. There was no immediate report on the condition
of the hostages, who have been held since March 20. The group, Abu Sayyaf, said
its members beheaded two male teachers Wednesday because the government had
ignored its demands, which include the freeing of Arab terrorists such as the
man behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.

Increased Hurricane Damage Expected
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- An analysis of weather patterns over the past century
indicates that increased storm activity over the last five years should continue
for the next 20, a top hurricane forecaster says. Such storms are expected to
cause damage five to 10 times worse than ever before in the Gulf and Atlantic
Coast states, said Bill Gray, who spoke Friday on the final day of the National
Hurricane Conference. The next 15 to 20 years should resemble a stretch of
hurricane bombardment from the late 1920s through the 1940s, when relatively
high salt content in the Atlantic altered the circulation of ocean currents in a
way that pushed up the average water temperature.

Reno Working on Elian Transfer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno worked with outside
intermediaries in Miami Friday on a proposal that would transfer custody of
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his father immediately. All sides
reported some progress late in the evening. Outside the Miami home where the
6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor has lived since last Thanksgiving, Ramon
Saul Sanchez, head of the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, emerged at 11 p.m. EDT
and told a crowd of Cuban exiles there had been progress in the talks, but urged
the demonstrators to stay in case they need to reform a human chain to prevent
the government from forcibly removing Elian.

interviewed for four hours this week in the government's long-running
investigation into alleged fund-raising abuses in the Democrats' 1996
re-election campaign. Gore's spokesman said the vice president is not a target
of the Justice Department Campaign Finance Task Force. A White House official
said Clinton also is not a target of the investigation. The president was
interviewed Friday, Gore on Tuesday. "The president and the vice president
cooperated fully with the task force and voluntarily agreed to be interviewed
this week," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement.

Report: Laptop Had Sensitive Info.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A laptop computer missing from the State Department since
January contained highly sensitive information about U.S. intelligence
gathering, The Washington Post reports. If the laptop was stolen for information
about weapons technology, the theft would be one of the most serious losses of
U.S. classified information ever, the Post said Saturday, quoting an
unidentified source familiar with the case. The computer vanished in January
from a State Department conference room, and its disappearance was reported in
early February to the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, officials told
the newspaper.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- Leaders of four former Soviet republics in
Central Asia on Friday signed a security pact intended to help contain the flow
of drugs and preventing radical Islamic groups from expanding their influence
across the region. Citing Afghanistan as the "main source of fanaticism and
extremism in the region," Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov said: "We have
found ourselves exposed to a powerful ideological expansion." Karimov spoke
after signing the treaty with presidents Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakstan,
Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan and Emomali Rakhmonov of Tajikistan. The pact calls
for expanding cooperation between the countries' security agencies and envisages
joint military action if one is attacked.

Coyotes 2-1 on Friday night. Colorado wins the best-of-seven series 4-1 and
advances to the Western Conference semifinals, against either Detroit or Dallas.
Forsberg shoveled a perfect pass to Sandis Ozolinsh for the tying goal late in
the second period, then scored the game-winner at 5:43 of the third period.

<HEADLINE> Teens Shot on Good Friday Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMAYO, N.M. (AP) -- In one photo, high school sweethearts
Richard Martinez and Karen Castanon are kissing. The engraved
wooden photo frame reads: ''This moment will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-olds had been dating since their freshman year at
Los Alamos High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were inseparable,'' said Louise Maestas, the boy's aunt.
Today, she and other family members are mourning the loss of both.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the two were shot to death as they made a Good Friday
pilgrimage to a church believed to contain healing dirt in this
small northern New Mexico village.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies were found several miles apart -- his before dawn on
a highway about 30 miles north of Santa Fe; hers hours later in a
remote, hilly area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't recall there being an incident like this'' during the
annual journey, said state police Capt. Carlos Maldonado.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no suspects in the deaths, classified as homicides.
Patrols were beefed up along the pilgrimage routes.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we are making a public plea for anyone to come
forward with any information,'' said state police Sgt. Royleen
Ross-Weaver. ''We suspect there were people (other pilgrims) in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   At the slain boy's home in the tiny community of La Villita,
northwest of Chimayo, Raymond and Gerri Martinez sat in their son's
bedroom Friday night, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son was perfect,'' Gerri Martinez said. ''He didn't have
any enemies. He was the light of our life. ... My baby didn't
deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   The father described his son as a good student and athlete who
liked hunting and fishing and helped coach a local girls' softball
team. He also was deeply religious and was to have played the part
of Jesus in a Good Friday observance at the town's parish church.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a beautiful kid. Now he's gone,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom is adorned with sports jerseys, football helmets and
photographs of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people each year journey to El Santuario de
Chimayo, a tradition that dates back almost two centuries. Good
Friday is the most popular day for the pilgrimage. Last year, an
estimated 65,000 visited the village's Roman Catholic church during
Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims had packed the small adobe church by midday Friday.
Many arrived carrying wooden crosses or lilies. Some had walked
only a mile or two; others had been on the road for two or three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is a room with a small hole whose dirt is thought to
possess healing power. The room is filled with crutches and canes
left behind by visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Gonzales of Santa Fe said she has been coming to the
church since she was a child with eczema on her knees and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents brought me the holy dirt for the bleeding and
itching. I rubbed the dirt on my skin, and it made the itching
stop,'' she said. ''It's not about the dirt making miracles, but
the faith you must have to make it come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pilgrim Marlene Martinez of Albuquerque, who is not
related to the victim, said she was shocked by the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's supposed to be a holy day,'' she said. ''That was really
sad.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Linked to Wash. Slayings  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- An alleged serial killer has been
definitively linked by DNA and other physical evidence to the
slayings of nine women and authorities say that total is expected
to climb to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Further lab tests are expected to tie Robert Lee Yates Jr. to
the slayings of three other women shot to death from 1996 to 1998,
Sheriff Mark Sterk said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence here is growing stronger and stronger,'' Sterk
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional charges are expected to be filed after more precise
DNA tests are completed in a few days and police reports are
available, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to rush through it,'' county prosecutor Steve
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators today planned to continue searching the home of
Yates, a 47-year-old father of five, located in an upper
middle-class neighborhood in this eastern Washington city.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's spokesman Dave Reagan described the house as ''not
neat'' -- the disruption perhaps caused by the family's abrupt
eviction Tuesday morning by deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are staying in a motel while their home is
searched, and have refused to talk with reporters. They aren't
likely to be allowed back in for months, Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Yates had a jailhouse visit from his wife, Linda,
their first contact since his arrest Tuesday, Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, an aluminum smelter and Army National Guard helicopter
pilot, so far has been charged with first-degree murder in just one
death, that of 16-year-old Jennifer Joseph in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are looking for possible links to Yates in
six other killings in Washington dating to 1990, Sterk said. In all
cases, the victims were involved in prostitution, drugs, or both.
</P>
<P>
   All victims had been shot, with most of the bodies dumped in
remote areas on the edge of this city of 189,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not offered a motive in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Yates' lawyer, Richard Fasy, said Friday he could not yet
comment on the allegations and had spoken to his client just once
in jail, and only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Yates is being held in lieu of $1.5 million cash-only bond at
the Spokane County Jail.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Federal agents seized Elian Gonzalez from the home
of his Miami relatives before dawn today, firing pepper spray into
an angry crowd as they took away the crying and screaming
6-year-old boy for a reunion in Washington with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 agents in several white vans arrived at the home
shortly after 5 a.m., using rams on the home's chain-link fence and
front door to get inside and look for the boy, who was being hidden
in a bedroom closet by his great-aunt and Donato Dalrymple, one of
the fishermen who rescued him on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom, an agent in green riot gear and goggles pointed
an automatic rifle at Dalrymple holding the frightened child, an
image captured by an Associated Press photographer and broadcast
around the world. Agents then took Elian out of Dalrymple's arms.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a woman and man brought Elian out of the
home and put him in one of the vans, which sped off. Maria Elena
Quesada, who was at the home, said Elian was screaming ''Help me!
Help me! Don't take me away!'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., Elian was on a government plane headed for an airport
near Washington and a reunion with his father, a government
official said, requesting anonymity. Juan Miguel Gonzalez was told
about the raid as soon as Elian was safe and will meet his son at
the airport, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was unhurt and was given a physical by a government doctor
before he got on the plane, the official said. On the plane were
the female immigration agent who carried Elian from the house, a
psychiatrist, a flight surgeon and the immigration agent who
commanded the operation.
</P>
<P>
   They were explaining carefully what is happening to him, the
official said. Elian was described as subdued and calm on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   He has been given a play kit including toys, Play-Doh, an
airplane, a map and a watch, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   After daylight, the boy's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez came out
of the house and spoke in a screeching voice to the crowd in words
sprinkled with patriotic references to freedom and the land of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a 6-year-old crying, 'Don't take me, don't take me.'
... This is not America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They broke the rear window and put a gun to Elian's head,''
she said. ''Whatever happens after this, let them pay the
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a Justice Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the government had hoped for a reunion
and had ''gone to extraordinary lengths to reach such a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We again negotiated throughout last night in good faith to try
to reach a cooperative resolution,'' the Justice official said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said ''we
were in the middle of negotiations when they battered the door.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're angry and disgusted,'' he said. ''We were in
communication with the mediator handling negotiations and
discussion with the government when they knocked the door down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a swift and violent step in the international custody
dispute over the little boy rescued off the Florida coast nearly
five months ago. His Miami relatives have sought to retain the
temporary custody they were granted in November, while the U.S.
government has sought to reunite the boy with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assassins!'' yelled some of the approximately 100 protesters,
some of whom climbed over the barricades in an attempt to stop the
agents. The agents, wearing Immigration and Naturalization Service
shirts, were armed with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world is watching!'' yelled Delfin Gonzalez, the brother
of the little boy's caretaker and great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, was bleeding from one ear after the raid. He said he was
knocked out by an agent using a rifle as a club.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were animals,'' said Jess Garcia, a bystander. ''They
gassed women and children to take a defenseless child out of here.
We were assaulted with no provocation''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of the raid, the crowd in Little Havana quickly
swelled to about 300. Several tried to rip apart and burn an
American flag. No serious injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The raid came amid reports of progress to immediately transfer
custody of the boy from his Miami relatives to his father. Attorney
General Janet Reno was at her office early this morning engaged in
an extraordinary, long-distance negotiation that began Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All of that ended early today.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez said he and several others tried to form a human
chain in front of the door but were forced back at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Dalrymple held Elian in his arms as the agents arrived.
He said agents told him ''give me the boy or I'll shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They took this kid like a hostage in the nighttime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was first proposed by civic leaders in Miami
serving as intermediaries. Proposals and counterproposals flew
through the night by telephone and facsimile machine between the
Miami house, the Justice Department and the Washington office of
the father's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
insisted that any deal contain an immediate transfer of custody of
Elian to him, but the Miami relatives have defied Reno's order
switching custody.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have cared for him since he was found clinging to
an inner tube in the Atlantic after a boat carrying his mother and
other Cubans capsized, killing her and 10 others. They and the
hundreds of Cubans who gathered for days outside their home do not
want the boy returned to a Cuba ruled by Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The deal under discussion called for Juan Miguel Gonzalez and
Elian, Lazaro and his daughter, Marisleysis, to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington -- either Wye
Plantation, a center on Maryland's Eastern shore that has been used
for Mideast peace conferences, or Airlie House near Warrenton, Va.,
according to a government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for formal custody to transfer immediately from
the Miami relatives to the boy's Cuban father, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point was the length of the joint occupation of
the compound. The intermediaries proposed that all family members
stay until a court appeal is completed, in late May at the
earliest. But Juan Miguel Gonzalez called for a much shorter joint
stay, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner and other
officials waited in Reno's Justice Department office past midnight
for the relatives' reply to the counterproposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get a
political asylum hearing for Elian. An appeals court has ordered
Elian to stay in this country until it hears that case, but did not
bar Reno from switching custody.
</P>
<P>
   Reno met for 15 minutes Friday at the Justice Department with
Juan Miguel Gonzalez. During the emotional session, the father said
he had a very good 25-minute telephone conversation with his son on
Thursday, the government official said. He also asked Reno to give
him a date certain when he would get his son back.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, Reno said she told him ''that I could not commit
to a particular course of action or timetable.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Global Warming  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To celebrate Earth Day today, President
Clinton announced two new initiatives to combat global warming,
warning that if ignored, rising temperatures will mean more violent
storms and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   He also chided the Republican-led Congress for not passing more
environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the science on climate change has grown stronger, and
the need for American leadership has grown greater, some in
Congress have buried their heads even deeper in the sand,'' Clinton
said in his weekly radio address. He called on lawmakers to approve
his $4 billion package of tax credits for energy-efficient homes,
cars and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1990s were the hottest decade on record, and the first
three months of 2000 were the hottest here in 100 years,'' the
president said. ''Scientists say that the temperature rise is at
least partly due to human activity, and that if left unchecked
climate change will result in more violent storms, more economic
disruptions and more permanent flooding of coastal areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was issuing an executive order requiring that
federal agencies reduce the amount of gasoline used in their
vehicle fleets by 20 percent in five years. This, he said, will cut
oil consumption by 45 million gallons a year.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced new incentives to cut pollution and
greenhouse gases. Federal workers now will be able to set aside up
to $65 tax-free every month to pay for public transportation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez and father reunited  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Seized by armed agents before
dawn, Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father today after a
frantic and forceful end to a five-month standoff between the
government and the Cuban boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are together,'' said Myron Marlin, the Justice Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents seized Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives before dawn today, firing pepper spray into an angry
crowd as they took away the screaming 6-year-old boy for the
reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son met at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington,
the secured base used for the president's travels.
</P>
<P>
   After the lengthy standoff, it took federal agents just three
minutes to enter the Miami home and take Elian away from the
relatives who had been caring for him since his rescue at sea and
are fighting to keep the boy from returning to his native Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., more than 20 agents in several white vans arrived at
the house and used rams on the home's chain-link fence and front
door to get inside.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was being hidden in a bedroom closet by his great-aunt
and Donato Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who rescued him on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedroom, an agent in green riot gear and goggles and
holding an automatic rifle confronted Dalrymple clutching the
frightened child, an image captured by an Associated Press
photographer and broadcast around the world. Agents then took Elian
out of Dalrymple's arms.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking female immigration agent carried Elian from
the home and put him in one of the vans, which sped off as pepper
spray was fired to keep the distraught crowd back.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the agent had a soothing message for
Elian -- worked out in advance: ''This may seem very scary. It will
soon be better.'' The boy was told he would be taken to ''papa.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Quesada, who was at the home, said Elian was
screaming ''Help me! Help me! Don't take me away!'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez was told about the raid as soon as Elian
was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very tearful, very happy,'' said Joan Brown Campbell, a
former official of the National Council of Churches who talked to
Gonzalez before he left for the airport. ''This is a moment he'd
waited for for a very long time. And he's glad the boy is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., the boy was on a government plane headed for the
Washington area and the reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to act was made by Attorney General Janet Reno,
President Clinton said during a brief question and answer session
in the White House Rose Garden. ''She managed this, but I fully
support what she did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she tried to reach a negotiated solution until the
final moments but the relatives ''kept moving the goal post and
raising the hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the boy would stay in the United States pending further
court action over the question of asylum, as the federal appeals
court ruled -- a statement confirmed by Gonzalez's lawyer, Gregory
Craig.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Gonzalez has made a commitment to remain in the United
States during this appeal, and he will live up to that
commitment,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was given a physical by a government doctor before he got
on the plane, a government official said earlier, speaking on
condition of anonymity. A psychiatrist was among those on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was described as subdued and calm on the flight. He was
given Play-Doh, a toy airplane, a map and a watch.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana today, Cubans wept in happiness. In an official
statement read over state radio stations, the government urged
Cubans to ''maintain calm and avoid public displays'' over the
event
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, under a brilliant, clear sky, crowds began to
gather in Little Havana as the city awoke to the realization that
Elian was gone. By midmorning, drivers on one highway demonstrated
with a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed off 35 blocks around the home after dawn as people
at a street intersection burned debris and yelled at a line of
officers in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have our office in full mobilization,'' said Lt. Bill
Schwartz, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The siege appeared to catch the family completely off guard.
After daylight, the boy's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez came out of
the house and shouted to the crowd in words sprinkled with
patriotic references.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agents broke down the door yelling, '''Give us the
(expletive) boy. We'll shoot. We'll shoot. We'll shoot,''' as she
begged them not to take him or let him see the guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can this boy be OK when he had a gun to his head?'' she
said. ''I thought this was a country of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno said, ''the Miami relatives rejected our efforts,
leaving us no other option but the enforcement action.'' She also
said the gun was not pointed directly at the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzalez and Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the Miami
relatives, said they were in the middle of negotiations and had
been put on hold by the mediator when the agents arrived. ''We're
angry and disgusted,'' Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a swift step in the international custody dispute over
the little boy rescued off the Florida coast nearly five months
ago. His Miami relatives have sought to retain the temporary
custody they were granted in November, while the government worked
to bring father and son together.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assassins!'' came the cry from a crowd of about 100
protesters, some of whom climbed over barricades trying to stop the
agents. The agents, wearing INS shirts, were armed with automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, was bleeding from one ear after the raid. He said he was
knocked out by an agent using a rifle as a club.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were animals,'' said Jess Garcia, a bystander. ''They
gassed women and children to take a defenseless child out of here.
We were assaulted with no provocation''
</P>
<P>
   Miami police executives, including the chief, had some notice of
the raid but officers at the scene had only a moment's notice, said
Schwartz, the department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The raid came amid reports of progress in talks to transfer
custody of the boy immediately to his father. Reno was at her
office early this morning engaged in a long-distance negotiation
that began Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   All of that ended in failure early today.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez said he and several others tried to form a human
chain in front of the door but were forced back at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Dalrymple held Elian in his arms as the agents arrived.
He said agents told him ''give me the boy or I'll shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They took this kid like a hostage in the nighttime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Juan Miguel Gonzalez insisted that any deal
contain an immediate transfer of custody of Elian to him, but the
Miami relatives refused.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have cared for Elian since he was found clinging
to an inner tube in the Atlantic after a boat carrying his mother
and other Cubans capsized, killing her and 10 others. They and the
hundreds of Cubans who gathered for days outside their home don't
want the boy returned to a Cuba ruled by Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that was under discussion called for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Elian, Lazaro and Marisleysis to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington, with formal
custody being transferred immediately to the father, a Justice
Department official said. The two sides couldn't agree on the
custody issue or how long they might live together pending the end
of the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get a
political asylum hearing for Elian. An appeals court has ordered
Elian to stay in this country until it hears that case, but did not
bar Reno from switching custody.

<HEADLINE> State making more rest stop space available for tired truckers  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's Department of Transportation is
changing the rules on parking at the rest stops it maintains so
tired truckers can park their rigs overnight and get some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT is circulating a proposed regulation waiving the current
three-hour time limit for nighttime parking at its rest stops and
scenic overlooks for commercial truckers. The state instead wants
to let those truckers spend up to eight hours parked overnight at
rest areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change is designed to encourage truckers to adhere to
federal and state restrictions on how many hours they can operate
their trucks. Generally, those rules call for truckers to work up
to 15 hours -- up to 10 of them behind the wheel -- following eight
consecutive hours of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want them parking along ramps of highways and the
shoulders of highways,'' Michael Fleischer, a spokesman for the
state DOT, said. ''We want them to find a safe, accessible way to
take an eight-hour rest. It is safer for the truckers and safer for
the motoring public.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour parking rule at rest stops after dark was imposed
because they were intended to be places where motorists could get
out of their cars and stretch their legs or admire the view, but
not treat them as overnight campgrounds, state DOT officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the state Motor Truck Association, Bill Joyce, said
the proposed change in DOT policy was something his group has been
lobbying for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of it is there is just not enough spaces,'' Joyce said.
''People (truckers) are out on the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules limiting hours of permissible driving often put commercial
truckers in a bind, according to Joyce. They must stop to get their
mandated rest, but they were sometimes being made to operate their
rigs -- in violation of the rules -- by police officers rousing them
out of rest areas if they exceeded the three-hour parking limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would wake them up and chase them out,'' Joyce said.
''But the problem is when they made them move, the trucker was
technically violating the federal hours of service rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce said that in the absence of the state embarking on an
ambitious program to create new rest stop spaces for overnighting
truckers -- Fleischer said some additional space is being built,
often in conjunction with constructing state police satellite
offices -- the DOT rule change is a sensible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's utilize the facilities we have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules limiting the hours commercial truckers can be on the
road date to 1937. The American Trucking Association has called for
the addition of thousands more rest stop parking spaces around the
country so long-haul truckers can safely park their rigs and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT will accept public comment on its proposed rule change
for next month and a half. It could be in place as early as June.

<HEADLINE> Poll: 84 Percent Believe in Miracles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Better than eight of 10 Americans believe that
God performs miracles, and almost half believe they have
experienced or witnessed one, a Newsweek magazine poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Saturday, reported that 84 percent of
Americans have faith in divine miracles, and 79 percent believe in
the reality of miracles described in the Bible. Also, 48 percent
have personal experiences with miracles, and 63 percent said they
know of people who have.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Woodward, author of recently released ''The Book of
Miracles,'' writes in the magazine's edition on newsstands Monday:
''Miracle stories, ancient and modern, do two things: They explain
the ways of God to the faithful, and they are the means by which
believers experience the presence of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly, the poll showed, those who believe in miracles
are Christians, 90 percent of whom are believers. Almost all
Evangelical Protestants -- 98 percent -- are believers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent of respondents said they have prayed to God
or a saint for miracle, mainly for a cure or recovery for a loved
one in a health crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For the poll, Princeton Survey Research Associates interviewed
752 adults by telephone on April 14. The margin of error is plus or
minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> AP Photographer Gets Elian Removal  </HEADLINE>
By AMANDA RIDDLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The scene in Lazaro Gonzalez's bedroom could hardly
have been more dramatic: a federal agent wearing green riot gear, a
helmet and goggles was carrying an automatic rifle when he
confronted a man holding a frightened Elian Gonzalez in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling moment was captured in a series of photos Saturday
by an Associated Press photographer and transmitted to newspapers
and broadcasters around the world. The attorney general was asked
about the image at a news conference where she defended the
approach to taking custody of the 6-year-old Cuban child.
</P>
<P>
   AP free-lance photographer Alan Diaz said Elian was crying and
yelled to him, ''Que esta pasando?'' -- What's happening? -- moments
before a federal agent burst into the bedroom room where he was
being held.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were among several shot by Diaz and distributed by
the AP throughout the night and into the morning. They included one
showing Elian's second cousin, Marisleysis, breaking down after the
boy was removed, and one of his great-uncle Lazaro being comforted
by family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   When the pre-dawn raid began, Diaz was with another photographer
and an NBC cameraman on the lawn next door to the house of Elian's
great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of federal agents, ''All of a sudden hell broke
loose,'' said Diaz. ''All I recall is the NBC guy saying, 'They're
here, they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and the cameraman jumped over the chain-link fence in front
of the Gonzalez home and walked into the house. An associate of the
relatives directed Diaz to the room Elian had been sharing with
Marisleysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''A family friend grabbed me and he said, 'Go to the room, go to
the room,''' Diaz said. But Elian wasn't there. The photographer
then knocked on the door of Lazaro's bedroom, and his wife, Angela,
opened it. Elian was in a closet, held by Donato Dalrymple, one of
the two fishermen who had rescued him at sea on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple said that amid the noise and commotion from the agents
breaking into the home, he had run to the boy and taken him into
his arms, retreating to Lazaro Gonzalez's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz recalled that when he arrived in the bedroom, Elian ''was
crying and he was asking me, 'What's happening?' and all I said
was, 'Nothing's wrong.' I mean, what was I going to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, federal agents entered the room and seized the
boy. Elian continued to cry and ask, ''What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ''They went to the closet and I shot (the photograph of) them
grabbing the baby,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno
was asked whether the photograph had raised the question of
excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the beauties of television is that it shows exactly
what the facts are,'' Reno said. ''And as I understand it, if you
look at it carefully, it shows that the gun was pointed to the
side, and that the finger was not on the trigger.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Agents Didn't Fire at Waco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A simulation of the deadly 1993 Branch Davidian
siege showed that flashes caught on videotape were most likely
sunlight reflecting off debris, not government gunfire as claimed
in a wrongful death lawsuit, according to a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   Vector Data Systems, the British firm that conducted the March
19 simulation at an Army base in Texas, submitted its report
earlier this month to U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr., who is
presiding over the Branch Davidian lawsuit, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported Saturday, citing unidentified informed
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Vector found that flashes produced by sunlight reflecting off
debris lasted considerably longer than flashes produced by gunfire,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   That finding would support the government's claim that similar
flashes seen on a 1993 infrared tape of the siege were the result
of sunlight reflecting off the crumbling complex, not gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for Branch Davidian survivors and relatives,
Michael Caddell, insists he does not have to prove government
gunfire caused the deaths of more than 80 members of the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell says he plans to show the government was negligent in
not having fire equipment at the 1993 siege that ended in a deadly
blaze at the compound outside Waco, Texas. And he said his own
experts will contradict the conclusion that the flashes were
reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started several hours into an FBI operation intended to
end a 51-day siege. The government has long contended the Davidians
themselves set fire to the retreat and caused their own deaths,
whether by fire or gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Vector was hired to conduct the test by Special Counsel John
Danforth who was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to
oversee an independent investigation into the standoff and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's appointment followed revelations that the FBI,
contradicting a position it had taken for six years, used
potentially incendiary devices on the last day of the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Struggle Over Florida Nursing Home  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Nelson Mongiovi's mother died in a nursing
home a year ago, but nearly every day he and his wife return to
visit other residents they know.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they find their friends lying in wet beds, or having gone
without a drink of water or without the necessities of human
dignity, like underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he and his wife, Gerri, blew the whistle on a
scandal at the Rehabilitation and Health Care of Tampa home,
leading to a change in federal law that bans nursing homes from
getting rid of Medicaid patients solely for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Mongiovis have no sympathy for nursing homes that
complain they are hurt by skyrocketing insurance rates and a
barrage of lawsuits.

   ''I don't think there is anything frivolous about any lawsuit in
the nursing home industry,'' said Mongiovi. ''It's the only
recourse the public has. If it wasn't for the lawyers, who would we
turn to? The nursing homes? If they hear you don't like it they
say: 'Hey, get out.'''
</P>
<P>
   The industry warns that homes could close unless something is
done to curb lawsuits in Florida, which has 10 percent of the
nation's nursing home residents but produces 40 percent of the
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would give the nursing homes some relief from
lawsuits was filed in the state House this year but has not had a
hearing. Gov. Jeb Bush has not committed to calling a special
legislative session on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine nursing homes across the state were informed this
month their insurance policies would not be renewed by a company
that no longer wants to underwrite the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen other insurance companies already have left the market,
leaving just five carriers, said Ed Towey, a spokesman for the
nursing home lobbying group Florida Health Care Association.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of insuring a nursing home bed in Florida is
more than $6,200 a year, eight times the national average, the
lobbying group says.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the insurance problem is the industry's general
financial state. Five major nursing home companies which operate
about 20 percent of Florida's nursing home beds have filed for
bankruptcy in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 1,600 of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes
have filed for bankruptcy since last fall, according to the
American Health Care Association. The highest rates were in Nevada
and New Mexico, where nearly half the homes owned by big chains and
affiliated with the association filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that it's too easy to sue nursing homes in
Florida. Plaintiffs can win unlimited punitive damages and don't
have to go through mediation before taking the case to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The average lawsuit settlement in Florida is $278,000, more than
twice the national average, according to the industry's figures.
Nursing homes blame trial lawyers -- especially attorney Jim Wilkes
of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes, who has won multimillion-dollar verdicts and has become
an outspoken antagonist of the industry, said if there is a crisis
it's one of the industry's making.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a bunch of drunk drivers losing their insurance and
calling up the Legislature and asking them to change the blood
alcohol levels because they are getting too many tickets,'' Wilkes
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no notices of homes intending to close because
of bankruptcy filings or the insurance shortage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the state's most recent ''watch list'' of 81 homes that
fell below state standards includes 32 owned by companies that have
filed for bankruptcy or reported financial problems to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have homes closing left and right,'' said Pete
Buigas, the top nursing home regulator for the Agency for Health
Care Administration. ''As far as what to expect, who knows. We want
to be prepared for the worst.''

<HEADLINE> The Boy Who Tugged on Heartstrings  </HEADLINE>
By HELEN O'NEILL, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began on Thanksgiving Day, when a small boy was plucked from
the ocean by fishermen. It climaxed on Easter weekend with armed
government agents sweeping in to pluck the child from his relatives
and carry him into the night.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the strange, astonishing saga of Elian Gonzalez
united an exiled community, wound its way through the courts, left
the U.S. government hamstrung and grabbed the attention of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, a little boy with an adorable smile who, by the
time of his sixth birthday on Dec. 6 had already witnessed more
trauma and upheaval than many people see their entire life. He'd
seen his mother die at sea. He'd clung to an inner tube for more
than a day. Just weeks later he was sharing birthday cake with
relatives he barely knew -- and heading to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   America became transfixed. So did Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians talked about the child's right to stay in the United
States. Parents everywhere agonized over the father's right to be
reunited with his son. And Cuban-Americans hailed Elian as a
mystical figure -- the child protected by dolphins for a special
destiny: a life of freedom in America instead of Communist-ruled
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In both countries, crowds -- and emotions -- swelled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Liberty for Elian! Liberty for Elian!'' they cried in Cuba in
December at one of the largest demonstrations on the island since
Fidel Castro came to power 41 years ago. Castro appeared on
television with Elian's classmates, even as lawyers for Elian's
Florida relatives filed a request for political asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finish this tragedy'' once and for all, Elian's grandmothers
pleaded when they arrived in the United States in January. But it
would be many months, many demonstrations, and many more legal
arguments before the father would see his son. During those months,
it seemed, little Elian became every parent's son, every uncle's
nephew, every child in a bitter custody battle, every politician's
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican weighed in, suggesting it could provide a quiet
place for the father and the boy to be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians weighed in, suggesting everything from asylum
for the father and child, to a guarantee of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fishermen who rescued Elian weighed in. ''I just
think that he could have a better life here and that his father, if
he really loves him, should sacrifice that for him,'' said Donato
Dalrymple.
</P>
<P>
   And Elian himself told the world, in a homemade video widely
criticized as exploitative even the result of manipulation, ''Papa,
I don't want to go to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Barricades went up near the small house in Little Havana where
Elian lived with his relatives, where die-hard believers held
all-night vigils, praying for the child to remain. Some vowed to
give their lives for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they chanted, even as they wept, even as Elian became a
global celebrity, cameras capturing every expression of innocence
and glee as he played in his yard, courts ruled Elian belonged with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Still the relatives and their Cuban supporters remained defiant,
clinging to hopes that their ''miracle'' child could stay with
them, refusing to hand him over when deadlines ran out, filing
appeal after appeal. Finally, a federal appeals court gave them a
victory by ruling the boy should stay in the United States for now.
But it did not block the transfer of custody to the father, Juan
Miguel, who agreed to stay in the United States until the court
case wound up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Miami relatives pleaded for more time, and the world
watched and debated: Where did Elian truly belong?
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who adopted Elian as a personal
crusade, and who flew to Miami to negotiate with the relatives, had
one answer. Elian belongs with his father, she said, vowing to
protect the ''sacred bond'' between father and son. But it wasn't
until this weekend that it became clear just how sacred Reno
considered that bond.
</P>
<P>
   Reno gave the order and the federal agents moved in. On the
weekend of Easter, the feast of Resurrection, the child who tugged
at America's heartstrings -- and challenged its courts and its
beliefs -- was finally delivered into the arms of his father.
</P>
<P>
   There was immediate criticism of the move, particularly because
the federal agents were armed. But President Clinton reminded the
country that Elian is not an icon, not a mystical symbol, just a
little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was in the end about a little boy who had lost has mother
and had not seen his father in more than five months,'' Clinton
said.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Arrested in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A journalist probing the 1998 killings of
five dissidents by intelligence agents was arrested Saturday, the
latest attempt by Islamic hard-liners to curb Iran's liberal press.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar Ganji's arrest came as newspaper editors and publishers
complained to the culture minister Saturday after Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, condemned the reformist press as
''enemies'' of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic hard-liners, who control the judiciary, have been
cracking down on the liberal press that has flourished since the
1997 election of reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who rarely speaks out directly on the power struggle
with hard-liners, made one of his strongest condemnations yet
against opponents of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who say that reforms are against the principles of the
revolution are pushing society toward ruin and creating the grounds
for dictatorship,'' Khatami told a meeting of education officials
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every leading reformist journalist has been summoned to
court for questioning in recent weeks, with conservatives in the
clerical regime feeling hard-pressed after reformists' overwhelming
victory in February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ganji was arrested in court, where he had been summoned to
answer charges that his articles violated Iran's press laws, said
his lawyer, Gholam-Ali Riyahi.
</P>
<P>
   Court sources said Ganji was taken to the Tehran's Evin prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the price I have to pay to pursue the case of the
murders,'' Ganji told reporters as he headed into court. ''But the
future is bright. No one created the reforms and nobody can stop
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganji, who wrote for several dailies including Fath and
Sobh-e-Emrooz, had been reporting on the killings of five
pro-reform dissidents, which the Intelligence Ministry later blamed
on ''rogue agents.''
</P>
<P>
   His articles suggested the killings were ordered by senior
hard-liners in the ruling Islamic establishment. He also repeatedly
called on those behind the murders to come forward or be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The two judges who ordered Ganji arrested also cited his
attendance at a controversial conference about Iran held in Berlin,
Riyahi said. That conference, attended by several pro-reform last
week, provoked outrage in conservative circles after state-run
television broadcast footage of an Iranian woman dancing and other
participants chanting slogans against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Minister Mohajerani told a news conference that editors
and publishers from 22 papers had came to him Saturday to complain
about Khamenei's use of the word ''enemy'' referring to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, a hard-liner who holds the final say in the
government, told a large crowd in a Tehran mosque Thursday that 15
to 20 newspapers were ''bases of the enemy'' and were undermining
the principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani said he would try to arrange a meeting between
Khamenei and the journalists. ''I know and I am sure that none of
them are enemies and they see the leader as a kind father,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the judiciary upheld the conviction of editor
Mahmoud Shams on charges of ''insulting religious sanctities.''
Shams, of the reformist Asr-e-Azadegan daily, was sentenced to 2{
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Saeed Hajjarian, a close aide of Khatami and a
friend of Ganji, was shot in the face and badly wounded. Reformist
newspapers and officials have blamed the assassination attempt on
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami wants to ease the political, cultural and social
restrictions imposed by the clergy's rule, but the hard-liners say
that would dilute the ideals of the Islamic revolution. The
reformists have little power to stop the conservative clergy, which
control the judiciary, the military and the broadcast networks.

<HEADLINE> Tutsi Becomes President of Rwanda  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Paul Kagame took the oath Saturday as this
central African country's first Tutsi president, calling on
Rwandans to shun ethnic divisions and vowing to create a nation
that all its citizens could call home.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people witnessed Rwanda's chief justice
swear in Kagame at Amahoro Stadium, where six years earlier
minority Tutsis sought refuge from murderous Hutu mobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the first time in the history of Rwanda that a change of
power had taken place without bloodshed,'' said Kagame, 42, who was
dressed in a dark suit and wore his trademark sunglasses. ''Rwanda
will become a nation that every Rwandan will want to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagame's ascent to power mirrors the life of many Tutsis in
Rwanda, which won its independence from Belgium in 1962. An
estimated half million of them grew up in exile after being
persecuted for their ethnicity at home, only to return as a
victorious rebel force that stopped the 1994 genocide and defeated
an extremist Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at our past, you will see that we've made a
giant step forward. It will serve as a base for our future,''
Kagame said. ''Unity is the foundation for everything so that all
Rwandans understand that they share life and death. Nobody has the
right to chase them away anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutu and Tutsi dancers from all regions of the country performed
as a symbol of the unity Kagame said he will pursue.
</P>
<P>
   He made a passionate appeal to Rwandans in exile to return home
and rebuild the nation, particularly those Hutu refugees still in
neighboring Congo, where they fled in fear of reprisals for the
1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that Rwandan troops will stay in Congo as long as
those opposed to his government use it as a base to attack Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia and other senior
African officials attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus died at
the hands of former Hutu soldiers and militiamen during the 90 days
of killings from April to July 1994. The killings were stopped only
after Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front captured Kigali and formed a
government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   The RPF set up a transition government in July 1994 that
included Hutus and Tutsis. Pasteur Bizimunga, a Hutu and RPF
member, was named president, largely to dispel the impression that
the Tutsis were really in charge. Kagame became both vice president
and minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hutus and Tutsis from seven major parties participate in
parliament and government, and the country is run under a
power-sharing formula. But Kagame's RPF is the strongest political
force in Rwanda, and critics often charge it does not tolerate
opposition at home or criticism from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bizimungu resigned amid accusations of incompetence
and squabbling with parliament and the RPF.
</P>
<P>
   Senior RPF officials insist the government is dedicated to
democracy and national reconciliation -- but in due time. In
September, Rwanda will hold local elections -- the second since the
1994 genocide -- to elect leaders in more than 1,000 communes.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame is known as a man respected by his troops and supporters
who does not tolerate indiscipline.
</P>
<P>
   The father of four neither drinks nor smokes, is a soccer fan
and plays tennis whenever he can.

<HEADLINE> Producer Alexander Cohen Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alexander Cohen, a Broadway producer for nearly
60 years and the man who brought the Tony Awards to national
television, died Saturday of complications from emphysema. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful, prolific showman, who was never shy of voicing his
opinions, Cohen was a product of the golden age of Broadway when
one man could put on a play or musical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Angel Street,'' Cohen's first production, was one of his
biggest hits, opening in 1941 and running 1,295 performances.
Patrick Hamilton's Victorian thriller, which starred Vincent Price,
was later made into the movie ''Gaslight,'' with Charles Boyer and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   His last show, ''Waiting in the Wings,'' a Noel Coward comedy
starring Lauren Bacall and Rosemary Harris, currently is playing at
Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Cohen produced scores of shows including the
legendary 1964 Richard Burton ''Hamlet,'' directed by John Gielgud;
''The Homecoming'' by Harold Pinter; David Storey's ''Home,''
starring Gielgud and Ralph Richardson and Peter Shaffer's ''Black
Comedy'' with Geraldine Page, Michael Crawford and Lynn Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Among his biggest successes were a series of small, intimate
entertainments, usually featuring one or two performers. They
included Michael Flanders and Donald Swann in ''At The Drop of a
Hat,'' ''An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May,'' ''Beyond
the Fringe,'' ''Good Evening'' featuring Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore and revues starring Yves Montand, Maurice Chevalier and
Marlene Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was as executive producer of the Tony Awards that Cohen
made his biggest mark in the theater, opening Broadway up to a
national audience. In 1967, the awards ceremony, which began 20
years earlier, was televised live on ABC from the Shubert Theater
and featured numbers from the best musical nominees.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Cohen and his wife, writer Hildy Parks, produced
the show, which often revolved around a theme, such as the renaming
of a theater or a salute to a composer.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also produced other television extravaganzas including
three ''Night of 100 Stars'' telecasts in 1982, 1985 and 1990, as
well as several Emmy Awards telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The producer was not without his flops, too. Among his more
notable --and expensive -- clinkers were Jerry Herman's ''Dear
World'' with Angela Lansbury, ''A Time for Singing,'' a musical
version of ''How Green Was My Valley'' and ''I Remember Mama,''
Richard Rodgers' last musical.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Cohen is survived by a daughter,
Barbara Hoffmann, and two sons, Christopher and Gerry.

<HEADLINE> New Monkey Species Found in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Two squirrel-sized monkeys have
been discovered in a remote corner of Brazil's Amazon, an
international conservation group said Saturday, a region rich with
biodiversity due to the dozens of rivers there.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation International, a Washington-based international
conservation group, announced the findings of Marc Von Roosmalen, a
scientist from Brazil's Amazon National Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The two monkeys, which were discovered in northwestern Brazil,
about 1,600 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, are the Callithrix
Manicorensis, or Manicore Marmoset and the Callithrix Acariensis,
or Acari Marmoset.
</P>
<P>
   An average adult of both species measures 9 inches with a
15-inch tail and weighs around 12 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The Callithrix Manicorensis has a silvery white upper body, a
light gray cap on its head, yellow to orange underparts and black
tail. The Callithrix Acariensis has a snowy white upper body and
under parts, a gray back with a stripe running to the knee and a
black tail with a bright orange tip.
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys are named after the Manicore and Acari Rivers, the
Amazon River tributaries near where they were found. Residents of
the region keep them as pets.
</P>
<P>
   Formal scientific descriptions of the pair will be published in
the upcoming edition of the scientific journal Neotropical
Primates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond differences in coloration, the two have genitalia that
are markedly different from other related species. Roosmalen said.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the abundant biodiversity in the region to the
dozens of rivers that crisscross it, creating natural barriers that
tend to isolate the species. Monkeys that may share a common
ancestor developed into separate species over several million
years.
</P>
<P>
   Roosmalen said he found the two while searching for the habitat
of another small monkey. That monkey, whose discovery was announced
in 1997, turned out to be the world's second smallest.
</P>
<P>
   ''These findings remind us of how much we have yet to learn
about the Earth's diversity of life,'' said Russell A. Mittermaier,
president of Conservation International and a co-author of both
scientific descriptions. ''Even among our closest relatives, the
primates, which have been closely studied, there are still new
species to be discovered.''

<HEADLINE> 'Soprano' Gets Into Club Free  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Jamie Lyn Sigler, better known as Meadow
Soprano in HBO's ''The Sopranos,'' showed up at a nightclub, she
got in free -- as did her boyfriend, brother and three others that
accompanied the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Hush owner Eddie Dean gladly let them in. But he says he felt
duped after Sigler and her boyfriend slipped out the backdoor a few
minutes later, leaving the others.
</P>
<P>
   That was a few weeks ago. When they showed up again last week,
Dean offered no freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time we told her she could come in with her boyfriend,
but the others had to pay,'' Dean told the New York Daily News.
''She didn't like that, and they all left.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sigler's HBO representative told the newspaper that the
actress never asked to get in free and that her friends paid
reduced rates that night.

<HEADLINE> Hodges Waited For Another Hit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- British director Mike Hodges has waited 29
years since his hit film ''Get Carter'' to have another movie in
wide release, but he says he doesn't mind the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy it is getting a release in the United States at
all,'' said Hodges, 68. His latest film, ''Croupier,'' opened this
weekend, two years after it was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the films considered Hodges' best were never widely
distributed, including 1974's ''Terminal Man'' and ''Black
Rainbow,'' a 1990 movie starring Jason Robards and Roseanna
Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' latest film is a thriller about a detached writer who
avoids risk and, despite never gambling, takes a job in a casino to
make ends meet. Croupiers are the casino workers at the card tables
or roulette wheels who never risk their own money.
</P>
<P>
   The character eventually gets drawn into a robbery plot by a
mysterious gambler.

<HEADLINE> Eric Burdon Protests Garbage Dump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- The former lead singer of the
British rock band the Animals is rejuvenating his '60s protest
music to rally against a proposed garbage dump near Joshua Tree
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Burdon, whose songs include ''We Gotta Get Out of This
Place'' and ''House of the Rising Sun,'' was among several singers
expected to perform Saturday night at the Rockin' for Joshua Tree
benefit concert in Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The event was to raise money to fight the Eagle Mountain
Landfill, which -- if built -- would be one of the country's largest
garbage dumps. Environmental groups have sued to stop the project,
which would be surrounded on three sides by the park.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution ''is a worldwide mega-problem, and with such a problem
you can only begin in your own back yard,'' the 58-year-old Palm
Springs resident said. ''That's why I'm fighting this. This is my
own back yard.''

   MIAMI (AP) -- ''They're here! They're here!'' a cameraman shouted
in the darkness. Then, suddenly, all was chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, before a team of federal agents went in, I hopped a
fence and ran inside the modest home where Elian Gonzalez had lived
since he was rescued from the ocean on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, family members screamed. I heard the door slam shut
behind me. ''Go to the room -- go to the room,'' someone said,
directing me to the bedroom Elian shared with his cousin
Marisleysis. I rushed in and fumbled for a light switch. Elian
wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   I banged on the bedroom door of Elian's great-uncle Lazaro.
Angela Gonzalez, his wife, opened the door. Elian was in a closet,
cradled by Donato Dalrymple, one of the two fishermen who had
rescued him. Dalrymple clutched Elian in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was crying, asking adults, ''Que esta pasando'' --
''What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing's happening, baby. Everything's going to be all
right,'' I said. What else could I say to the child whose saga I
had chronicled for almost five months.
</P>
<P>
   As a 43-year-old freelance photographer of Cuban descent, I had
developed an unusual relationship with the Gonzalez family and the
6-year-old child whose life I had been capturing on film for AP.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, I had taken hundreds of photos of Elian:
dragging his bookbag as he walked to school; playing in the yard;
at the circus. Nothing compared to the intensity of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   When it began, I did what I always do: I started shooting
photos. And I worried what the agents might do if they saw me,
camera focused, ready to capture their every move.
</P>
<P>
   We waited. Angela watched the locked bedroom door. Thirty
seconds passed. Agents banged on the door, then broke it down and
burst into the room, guns raised.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happening?'' Elian asked again, through tears.
</P>
<P>
   I was nearby. ''Back off,'' the agents told me.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Border Patrol agent, wearing green riot gear and goggles
and holding an automatic rifle, confronted Dalrymple, who was
clutching the frightened boy.
</P>
<P>
   I stood, back against the wall, shooting photographs as agents
grabbed the boy. As they left the room, I started to follow. ''Back
off!'' an agent screamed. I stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, agents had pinned Lazaro on the couch. He
was in a rage, crying, wanting to go after the child.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking female agent picked up Elian and rushed from
the house, placing him in a waiting white van. The doors slammed
shut and the van sped down the street with Elian inside.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Slaying Probe Old-Fashioned  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A special task force spent three long
years trying to track a serial killer who preyed on the city's most
vulnerable women, its costs ballooning to $2.2 million as the
deaths continued to mount.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money threatened to sidetrack the investigation. In
January, budget cuts forced city police to pull all five of their
detectives from the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives had samples of the killer's DNA from many of the
crime scenes, but no description of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane County Sheriff Mark Sterk held an extraordinary public
meeting two months ago and asked the public for fresh tips. He even
wrote to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, asking him to donate
software to help analyze 10 years of homicide files; according to a
sheriff's spokesman, Microsoft said no.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to advances in DNA technology and carpet fibers from
a white Corvette, authorities believe they finally have their man.
Robert Lee Yates Jr., a 47-year-old father of five, was arrested
Tuesday and charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like we've arrested the person responsible for up to
18 homicides in our community,'' a beaming Sterk announced the day
after the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, a factory worker and National Guard helicopter pilot, is
charged in one death, that of 16-year-old prostitute Jennifer
Joseph, whose body was found Aug. 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, investigators on Friday released the names of nine
women whose slayings they say are definitively linked to Yates by
DNA and other physical evidence, though they're not disclosing what
that evidence is.
</P>
<P>
   Further tests could tie Yates to the slayings of three other
women, Sterk said, and investigators also are looking for possible
links to six other killings in Washington, dating to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Yates' lawyer, Richard Fasy, said Friday he would not comment on
the allegations for at least several days. He had spoken to Yates
just once in jail, and only briefly. Yates is being held in lieu of
$1.5 million cash-only bond at the Spokane County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, detectives scoured the records of ex-convicts,
looking for likely suspects, and walked the city's red light
district, showing pictures of possible suspects to anyone who would
look. Photos of the victims were displayed on city buses and on a
billboard overlooking a street where prostitutes in this Eastern
Washington city of 189,000 often pick up customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 tips poured in. Some suggestions focused on the
Seattle area's unsolved Green River killings of at least 49 women
in the early 1980s; Spokane detectives say they have no evidence to
link the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators encountered Yates as early as Sept. 24, 1997, when
officers stopped him in his white 1977 Chevrolet Corvette for a
traffic violation, according to court documents filed in support of
the Joseph murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Officers later interviewed a prostitute who said she had seen
Joseph get into a Corvette with a white middle-aged man, court
documents say.
</P>
<P>
   An officer also contacted Yates more than a year later after
seeing him pick up a prostitute, court documents say. Yates told
the officer he had picked the woman up to give her a ride home; the
woman told police she agreed to perform a sex act on Yates for $20.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just one of many, many names that had apparent
potential,'' sheriff's Capt. John Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives interviewed Yates again last September, and said he
sweated profusely as they questioned him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, they tracked down a woman who had bought Yates'
Corvette. She allowed detectives to remove carpet fiber samples,
and on April 5, lab tests showed those fibers closely matched
fibers investigators had found on Joseph's shoes and on a towel
near her body.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives obtained a warrant to search the car and found a
button matching one missing from Joseph's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of blood smears found in the Corvette produced a
match with a DNA profile generated through samples from Joseph's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no reason to narrow the investigation down to Yates
until we had something from the fibers,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives began round-the-clock surveillance after Yates
returned to Spokane on April 16 from a two-week Army National Guard
camp at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma. He was arrested early Tuesday as
he drove to his job at a Kaiser Aluminum plant.

<HEADLINE> White Farmers Beaten in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Ruling party activists seized and beat
two white farmers Saturday, holding them until police negotiated
their release, amid high tensions over Zimbabwe's farm occupation
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At a funeral for a farmer slain by squatters, a minister lashed
out at President Robert Mugabe and accused him of sparking violent
takeovers of white-owned farms by squatters.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer, Martin Olds, was killed on Tuesday, the second white
farmer killed in clashes with black militants and Mugabe
supporters. Later Tuesday, Mugabe delivered a speech describing
white farmers as ''enemies of the people'' who had resisted a
government program to hand over white-owned land to landless
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian minister Paul Andrianotis told some 500 mourners at
Olds' funeral that it was Mugabe who was ''a criminal and an enemy
of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Most mourners at the funeral in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's
second-largest city, were white but included the slain rancher's
black farm workers. Eulogies praised the 42-year-old rancher's
loyalty to friends, colleagues and his workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bindura district north of the capital Harare, two white
farmers were assaulted Saturday by ruling party militants,
according to the Commercial Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Bindura farmer Ian Miller and his manager Keith McGraw were
forced to march, hopping in a squatting position, from their homes
to their workers' village on their farm about 50 miles northeast of
Harare. There the militants questioned them about their political
views and beat them, said Tim Henwood, head of the farmers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Police mediated and won their release, then escorted them back
to their homesteads. Both men were slightly injured, Henwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is pure political intimidation,'' Miller later told the
South African Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Police have previously mediated in several standoffs since the
farm occupations began in February, although their actions have
been limited and they have even allegedly stood by while white
farmers were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has ruled out using the police to evict the squatters
from the 1,000 or so farms they have seized, despite court orders
that police should do so. He says the squatters are veterans from
the country's war of independence protesting inequitable
distribution of land.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the former colonial ruler, demanded Saturday that
Mugabe's government work to resolve the crisis before it will
provide any more funds to help a fair redistribution of land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice is the government of Zimbabwe's,'' Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who is to meet a Zimbabwe delegation
Thursday, said. ''The crisis can be resolved this week if the
government of Zimbabwe chooses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Zimbabwe achieved independence, Britain has spent $70
million to help distribute white-owned lands to landless blacks.
But Britain froze the funding after complaining that much of the
land went to Mugabe cronies. In a legacy of colonial rule,
one-third of the country's productive farmland in the hands of
4,000 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition party, the
Movement for Democratic Change, said Mugabe was ignoring the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mugabe is embarking on a state of lawlessness and anarchy,''
Tsvangirai said at a rally in Murambinda, 155 miles east of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has accused white farmers of backing the Movement for
Democratic Change, in a bid to thwart his program to seize
white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of a war veterans group, vowed Wednesday
his followers would remain on the farms until a new round of talks
was held with white farmers' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's opponents say he has allowed farm occupations to
continue as a ploy to win support from impoverished blacks as his
own popularity diminishes ahead of parliamentary elections expected
to be called in May.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Elian Raid Was Right Thing  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was sound asleep when he got
the pre-dawn call: little Elian Gonzalez was on a plane, bound for
a reunion with his father. The president was heartened upon hearing
the news, and returned to bed.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later came another call. It was Attorney General
Janet Reno. The president thanked her. ''I'm very pleased with the
way she handled it,'' he told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's pre-dawn wresting of the 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck
survivor from his relatives in Miami capped a tense week for
Clinton. He stood in Reno's protective shadow, away from the
intensity of the custody dispute around Elian, while Reno called
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was, in the end, about a little boy who had lost his
mother and had not seen his father in more than five months,''
Clinton said. ''So I think she did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the drama unfolded amid a family reunion of his
own. His wife, daughter and other family members waited Friday at
the White House for the arrival of Clinton's brother, Roger. They
were supposed to be going to the woodsy presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md. for the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
   But at 8:30 p.m. EDT Friday, the president was in the Oval
Office, getting a status report from Reno on negotiations to
reunite Elian with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Roger arrived
shortly after that, so Clinton walked over to his residence to have
dinner with his family and watch a movie, said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta fielded updates for
Clinton. At 2:15 a.m. Saturday, he told Clinton that if the talks
did not progress, federal officials were prepared to take custody
of Elian. Clinton encouraged more negotiation, but approved a raid
on the Gonzalez home if the negotiations failed, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three hours later, Podesta reported that the talks had
failed, Lockhart said. At about 5:30 a.m., Podesta called again to
say Elian was out of Miami; then Reno called at 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   That done, the president decided to get more sleep. He arose
three hours later, got dressed and, with eyes still puffy and shirt
collar unbuttoned, went before television cameras to give full
credit to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''She made the decision. She managed this. But I fully support
what she did,'' Clinton said. ''And it was clear from our long
conversations that we were in agreement about this.''
</P>
<P>
   At an air base across town, Elian was in his father's embrace
for the first time in months, and hugging his brand new baby
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejoined his own brother and, with the rest of his
family, headed for Camp David about 3 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Banker, Opera Chief George Moore Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- George Moore, a former leading U.S. banker
and head of the Metropolitan Opera, died at his home in southern
Spain. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was buried Saturday in the Guadiaro cemetery close to the
Sotogrande sea resort where he had resided for nearly three
decades. He died early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was strictly private attended only by his surviving
relatives and close friends, said an official at the resort.
</P>
<P>
   Born April 1, 1905 in Hannibal ,Mo., he started work as a youth
selling honey and as a delivery boy for a delicatessen. After
studying at Yale, he jointed the Farmers Loan and Trust Company
which later merged with First National City Bank of New York, which
became Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Moore rose to run the bank's domestic division and later its
overseas operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He retired
from the bank in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he became president of the Metropolitan Opera
Association and is attributed with having whipped it into shape
financially.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, he is remembered for having helped promote Algeciras
port, located close to his Sotogrande residence.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, two sons and two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Elian, Dad Still Long Way From Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that Juan Miguel Gonzalez has regained
custody of his son, he faces what could be a long legal battle to
return with his family to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is scheduled to
hear arguments May 11 on whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez can seek
asylum without his father's permission and whether the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service should have interviewed the
boy to determine his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that the case could end in a matter of weeks
or continue for months.
</P>
<P>
   The court has already indicated that Elian has the right to seek
asylum because immigration law does not specify when a child is too
young to have such a right.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent is a 1985 case of a 12-year-old Russian boy who
successfully sought asylum over his parents' objections. The court
that decided that case, however, indicated that 12 was likely about
as young as a child could be to file such a petition.
</P>
<P>
   If, after oral arguments, the appeals court decides Elian can
speak for himself, the question becomes whether he has been unduly
influenced by his Miami relatives who want to keep him in the
United States or by his father, who wishes him to return to Cuba,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neal Sonnett of the American Bar Association's
coordinating committee on immigration law suggested that although
the Miami relatives say the boy wishes to remain in the U.S., now
that he is with his father, ''Elian might say, 'I love my Daddy and
I want to go back with my Daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's
Children and Youth Law Clinic, contends ''children of tender years
are incapable of making major life decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no indication that he would, there is also the
possibility that the father, who is in the United States with his
second wife and another, younger son, could change his own mind and
seek asylum for himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, if the appeals court determines Elian cannot speak
for himself, legal experts said the question then becomes: Who
speaks for him, Lazaro Gonzalez, his great uncle in Miami, or his
father?
</P>
<P>
   With such a ruling, the father undoubtedly will petition the
court to replace Lazaro Gonzalez as the boy's chief guardian, the
legal experts said. The father's attorney, Gregory B. Craig, has
said all along that only the father has the legal right to speak
for his son, and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has said likewise.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way the three-judge appeals panel decides,
either side -- the father or the uncle -- could ask that the case be
heard by the full panel of appeals court judges.
</P>
<P>
   Further prolonging the proceedings, that ruling could then be
appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not beyond the realm of possibility. Unquestionably, this
case is of significant constitutional magnitude,'' Perlmutter said.
''It's a very challenging and profound question that goes to the
heart of our whole view of family life as a civilized western
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the father's representatives say he will keep his son in
the United States during the appeals process, and Attorney General
Janet Reno has accepted that as a firm commitment, a lingering
question is whether Cuban emissaries with diplomatic immunity can
whisk the father and son away nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency order bars the shipwreck survivor from being taken
out of the United States until the Miami relatives' appeal is
resolved, but the order may not be enough to stop diplomats from
the Cuban Interests Section in Washington from spiriting the child
back to Cuba, Sonnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We managed to snatch him from a house in three minutes, and it
seems to me, if he were back in the Cuban Interests Section and
they arranged a private plane at 3 o'clock in the morning, what's
the United States going to do, fire on the plane?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pledged Saturday to ''take every step necessary to ensure
that Elian does not leave the country while the court of appeals
injunction is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   On her order, the U.S. Marshal Service was providing heavy
security for the father and son at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that the two would be at the base ''for a short
period'' and then move ''somewhere else in the Washington area.''
Meissner said there are no plans for the them to move to the home
of a Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md., where the father has been
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Craig insisted his client would not attempt to flee
with the boy and would allow the case to take its course through
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel has made a commitment to stay in the United States
during this appeal, and he will live up to that commitment,'' Craig
said.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco funds lower than expected, projects not threatened,officials say  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The good news is, fewer people are smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is, as a result, there's less tobacco settlement
revenue flowing into New Jersey state coffers to fund anti-smoking
efforts and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials are not worried. There's still plenty of
money for all the programs they want to fund, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''All things considered, the point of the settlement was to get
people to stop smoking,'' noted Peter McDonough, Gov. Christie
Whitman's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, the state received a check for $138 million, the
latest installment in a deal in which New Jersey will get an
estimated $7.6 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But back when the settlement was reached in February, the April
payment was projected to be $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit? So-called volume adjustments, which allow the
industry to reduce payments when cigarette sales decline, as they
have steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The volume adjustments allow for a slightly lower payment than
the projection, with projection being the operative word,'' said
Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all understood it was a moving target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State policy planners took into account possible fluctuations in
the tobacco settlement payout when they set out a preliminary
budget for the variety of initiatives for which the fund would pay,
McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   For this year and part of next year, those initiatives include:
</P>
<P>
   -- $30 million for anti-smoking programs,
</P>
<P>
   -- $70 million for expansion of subsidized health care for low
income families,
</P>
<P>
   -- $50 million to help reimburse doctors and hospitals owed money
by defunct HMOs,
</P>
<P>
   -- and lesser amounts for programs aiding senior citizens,
biomedical research, children and hospitals that treat the
uninsured working poor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, starting next summer, $100 million per year of the
tobacco settlement money is planned to help fix or replace
crumbling school buildings around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike constitutionally dedicated revenues, the tobacco funds
flowing into the state's general treasury are not legally tied to
any one program. They are mixed together with other general sources
of revenue, so there's plenty of money to cover the program costs
in this robust economy, McDonough explained.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case the settlement fund takes a true nose dive, the
governor added $50 million to the upcoming budget as a reserve to
cover the tobacco-funded programs, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Fran Rappa, a spokesman for the state Treasury
Department, said the proposed budget for the fiscal year that
starts July 1 had estimated that the April payment would come in
around $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized there may be a volume reduction. So the impact is
not as great as it would appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement was always about reducing smoking, and youth
smoking especially,'' said Shatzkin. ''So in effect, some of
measures the settlement was based upon could be coming home to
roost.''

<HEADLINE> Building Flies Old Georgia Flag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- The Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce has found a
way to avoid the controversy over the Confederate flag and still
stay true to its state: It's flying an old Georgia flag, one that
pre-dates the addition of the Confederate battle emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate emblem was incorporated into the Georgia flag in
1956, only two years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled segregated
schools unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-1956 version also displays the state seal on a blue
field on the left side, but on the right side -- where the current
flag has the Confederate emblem -- are three horizontal bars, two
red and one white.
</P>
<P>
   The ''current state flag is offensive,'' said Richard Tucker,
chamber president. ''It's offensive to some of our members, and
it's offensive to some of our businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce in Gwinnett County, an Atlanta suburb
where blacks make up 5 percent of the population, had its grand
opening Thursday. Tucker said he received more than three dozen
positive comments about the flag in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to alter Georgia's flag have fizzled since a losing
battle in 1993, but a new movement for change has gained momentum
since a tourism boycott in South Carolina prompted the state Senate
there to vote to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse
dome. That bill awaits a vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi is the only other state that includes the
Confederate emblem on its official state flags.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanians Protest Imprisonment  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The best-known Kosovo Albanian
imprisoned in Serbia appealed Saturday for reconciliation between
Serbs and Albanians in the volatile, U.N.-administered province.
</P>
<P>
   ''Revenge leads nowhere,'' Dr. Flora Brovina, a prominent
pediatrician and women's rights activist, told reporters making a
rare prison visit on a government-sponsored tour. ''I just wish the
situation would calm down in Kosovo. My message to all people is to
reconcile.''
</P>
<P>
   Brovina was sentenced in December to 12 years imprisonment for
supporting the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army. She urged
her fellow Albanians ''not to forget times when Serbs helped us
when times were difficult for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brovina was among more than 2,000 ethnic Albanians arrested in
Kosovo during the 18-month Serb crackdown on the KLA and taken back
to Serbia proper before the 78-day NATO bombing campaign forced
Yugoslav troops and police to withdraw and hand the province over
to U.N. and NATO administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Many others are believed held secretly by the Serbs, and Kosovo
Albanians insist there can be no peace in the province until all
are returned.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent Kosovo Albanian inmate, former student leader
Albin Kurti, insisted he had been jailed ''because of my political
activity'' and not terrorism -- of which he was convicted last month
by a Serb court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are political prisoners here,'' said Kurti, who was
sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. ''I do not recognize Serbia's
laws. I am imprisoned by the fascist regime of Slobodan
Milosevic,'' referring to the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   During the tour of the prison, located in Milosevic's hometown,
Pozarevac, reporters were escorted by a senior government official,
Dragoljub Jankovic.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic refused to comment on the prisoners' remarks. He said
that 979 people from Kosovo are currently jailed in Serbia, most of
them ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have opposed the severity of the
sentences handed down to many of the Albanian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in justice but I did not expect such a long term,''
Brovina said. ''What have I done to be sentenced to 12 years in
jail?''
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic said the ethnic Albanians are all treated well. Kurti
said he was mistreated earlier, during the pretrial investigation,
but not in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups also say authorities have taken bribes from
Kosovo Albanians to speed the release of relatives held in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovic insisted the government was not cooperating in any such
activity and blamed ''corrupt'' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''One could conclude that for some people, ethnic Albanians are
a profit-making merchandise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mohawk tribe leaders sign new casino deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State and federal officials want to take a
close look at whether an uncommon deal struck between the Mohawk
Indians and a gaming firm can allow gambling on any Mohawk site in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to need to look at this very closely to see what
all the implications are,'' said Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov.
George Pataki. McKeon said Saturday that the state needs more
detail on the agreement from the Mohawks as well as from U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs officials who also must approve Indian
casino plans.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could be worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between the St. Regis Mohawk Indians on New York's
northern border and Park Place Entertainment aims to allow the firm
to build, develop and manage any Mohawk casino in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohawks would receive a $3 million loan and a large
percentage of the profits from any casino, according to copies of
the agreement given to The New York Times by people who deal with
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The state doesn't have details on the agreement yet, McKeon said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki still hasn't given his approval to the tribe to build a
$500 million casino in the Catskills. The state Legislature may
also have to agree. On April 6, the federal Interior Department
approved a four-year-old proposal in which the Catskills
Development Group had planned to donate 30 acres to the federal
government in trust for the Mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Mohawks' new agreement with the largest gambling
company in the world will be federally approved isn't known. The
federal approval was based on a specific site -- in Monticello -- and
with a different partner.
</P>
<P>
   Investment analysts who follow the gambling industry said the
rights to the Mohawk casinos could be worth billions of dollars,
but some industry analysts doubted that Park Place would ever build
a Mohawk gambling hall because it would undercut the company's
heavy investment in Atlantic City, N.J. It owns three casinos
there.
</P>
<P>
   According to the deal, Park Place agreed to begin building an
unspecified ''gaming facility'' within 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal and federal officials were unavailable Saturday for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Accuse Kabila's Army  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels Saturday accused
President Laurent Kabila's army of fresh attacks in southern Congo,
one day after African leaders involved in the 20-month war pledged
to respect a fragile peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Kin-Kiey Mulumba, a spokesman for the Rwandan-backed Congolese
rebels, said government troops had attacked rebel positions at
Ikela and Opala, two strategic towns 430 miles east of the capital,
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Mulumba had no details or casualty figures. But Rwandan army
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said fighting broke
out Friday when government troops or their Zimbabwean allies
sneaked behind positions held by Rwandan troops outside Ikela,
attempting to surround them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear violation of a cease-fire, and we are forced
to respond,'' Mulumba said.
</P>
<P>
   Ntuaremba Onfre, the Congolese official responsible for
relations with the 100 U.N. liaison officers and military observers
now in Congo, said in Kinshasa that cease-fire violation claims
were ''false information designed to inflame the situation.'' There
has been no shooting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia rejected
a proposal by former Botswana president Ketumile Masire to hold a
national dialogue in July to chart Congo's future political course.
</P>
<P>
   Masire, Yerodia said, should ''keep his ideas in his pocket''
and accused him of diplomatic meddling.
</P>
<P>
   The national dialogue was included in a peace accord signed last
year. Yerodia said the government was disappointed the conference
had not taken place already.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, presidents from Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique
and South Africa meeting in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, reaffirmed
their commitment to a cease-fire and a withdrawal of foreign troops
from Congo, which is supposed to be supervised by a 5,500-strong
U.N. observer mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda back the rebels. Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola
back Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   A new cease-fire took effect in Congo on April 14. Despite
initial reports of fighting, U.N. observers and a joint military
commission -- made up of warring sides -- have said it was generally
holding well.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is yet to obtain the green light from the
government in Kinshasa for the deployment of U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is
expected in Congo early next month to seek additional security
guarantees for U.N. forces, which are to deploy within a designated
18-mile buffer separating the warring sides.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Regroup  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIRI-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian paratroopers and riot police
clashed with scattered rebels in southern Chechnya on Saturday, but
major fighting has quieted down while the militants regroup, a top
Russian commander said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no open war today. The militants are scattered,''
Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev told reporters in the Chechen city of
Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops who entered Chechnya in September took about
two-thirds of the republic in the first months of the war. But they
have stalled in trying to oust the rebels from the Vedeno region in
the mountainous south.
</P>
<P>
   The militants have scaled back operations in the past two days
to redistribute their forces, the military command said Saturday.
Chechen field commanders are working to organize small militant
groups into bigger units, the military said, according to the
Interfax news service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scattered clashes have continued and Russian warplanes
have flown 20 combat missions since Friday while continuing
artillery strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels with grenade launchers attacked a Russian checkpoint in
the town of Shali, drawing Russian fire, Interior Ministry
spokesman Mikhail Solomatin said Saturday, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops have regrouped in the Vedeno and Shatoi gorges
and are conducting ''special operations,'' said Troshev, the
Russian commander. Riot police units and paratroopers are also in
action there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, controversial pro-Moscow Chechen leader Bislan
Gantamirov was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Russian army
in a ceremony in Gudermes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry gave no reason for the unusual move, which
came just days after Gantamirov quit as the head of a
Kremlin-backed Chechen militia, saying his force had been sidelined
by Russian police. The Defense Ministry insisted Saturday that
Gantamirov remained chief of the Chechen militia.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov was convicted of embezzling funds meant for
rebuilding Chechnya after the 1994-6 war, then was pardoned and
tapped by the Kremlin last year to lead a pro-Russian police force.
</P>
<P>
   Another pro-Moscow Chechen leader, Malik Saidullayev, held a
rally in the southern mountain village of Chiri-Yurt on Saturday to
urge Chechens to oppose the rebels. He distributed 60 tons of flour
and meat to the remote village.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, a trio of European Union ambassadors visited two
refugee camps in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. EU
envoy to Russia Gilbert Dubois, Portuguese Ambassador Pacheco
Luiz-Gomes and French Ambassador Hubert Colin de Verdiere also met
with Ingush President Ruslan Aushev.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has come under international criticism for the war.
Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya after an invasion of
neighboring Dagestan by Chechnya-based militants.

<HEADLINE> 30th Annual Earth Day Celebrated  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Politicians, celebrities and activists
celebrated the 30th anniversary of Earth Day on the National Mall
Saturday and issued new calls to combat global warming at the
source.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking on radio, blamed the Republican
Congress for failing to recognize what he called the global warming
threat and failing to act on legislation promoting clean and
efficient energy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential contender,
unveiled policy initiatives aimed at curtailing the flow of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These heat-trapping gases,
mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, are believed by
scientists to be contributing to a risky warming of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed tougher requirements for power plants to reduce
air pollution, while giving the industry the flexibility to meet
the new goals. He called for approaches like emissions trading,
which allows coal-burning plants that pollute more to buy credits
from cleaner-burning plants until the dirtier plants can meet
tougher pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to stand against apologists for pollution -- those who
believe in the old politics of environmental irresponsibility,''
said Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   David Hawkins of Natural Resources Defense Council praised
Gore's proposal for targeting carbon dioxide and mercury, which are
not controlled at power plants now, along with trying to reduce
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Hawkins said he is
interested to see how Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush responds.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Chris Paulitz called
Clinton's proposals ''small ideas to help the environment'' and
criticized Gore's book ''Earth in the Balance,'' which he said
highlighted Gore's ''extremist ideas'' on the environment that
would assure that gas prices would be raised 50 cents and our
economy would crumble.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Earth Day 2000 is ''Clean Energy Now'' and the
multimedia stage and nearby exhibit tents were outfitted with an
array of high and low technologies which use non-polluting energy
sources, including wind, solar, natural gas, biofuels, and propane.
</P>
<P>
   Power-generating propellers twirled in the chilly breeze and
shiny government trucks presented a flashier image for electric- or
natural-gas powered vehicles. Visitors ambled across the Washington
Mall from the Capitol to the Washington Monument in a rock-festival
atmosphere, complete with music from David Crosby and others.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was on the mind of many speakers. Gaylord Nelson, the
former Wisconsin senator widely given credit for starting Earth Day
in 1970 who wore one of the few ties at the event, encouraged
participants to ask every presidential candidate for an annual
state-of-the-environment speech to keep attention focused
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had 30 years of learning, experimenting, rehearsing for
the future,'' he said. ''If we don't (address environmental
issues), we'll flounder around for another 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest applause -- and squeals -- came for Leonardo DiCaprio,
star of the movie ''Titanic,'' who acted as host for the afternoon
of big-name entertainment and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''All Americans can be proud of the tremendous progress we've
made since the first Earth Day 30 years ago,'' said President
Clinton, setting the stage for the celebration in his weekly radio
address. He called global warming the most critical environmental
challenge now facing the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we value our coastlines, or farm lands and our vital
biodiversity we must build a national consensus to reduce our
emissions of greenhouse gases...,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will shortly issue executive orders to:
</P>
<P>
   --Require that federal agencies reduce the amount of petroleum
their cars, vans and trucks burn by 20 percent over five years. He
said this can be done with existing technology, including the wider
use of electric-power, natural gas and ethanol as power sources.
</P>
<P>
   --Subsidize all or some of the commuting costs of federal workers
who use public transportation between home and work by up to $65 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The president rapped the Republican Congress for allegedly
denying global warming threat and blocking proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the science on climate change has grown stronger, and
the need for American leadership has grown greater, some in
Congress have buried their heads even deeper in the sand,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ''deeply disappointed'' that this year's
Republican budget resolution ''fails again to support America's
environmental priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I call on Congress to reverse its opposition and work with us
to pass my $4 billion package of tax credits for energy-efficient
homes, cars and appliances; to invest in clean energy research; and
to help us promote clean technology in developing countries,''
Clinton said. He also called for an end to opposition to improving
the fuel economy of cars and trucks.

<HEADLINE> Legal Battle Ahead for Elian, Dad  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that Juan Miguel Gonzalez has regained
custody of his son, he faces what could be a long legal battle to
return with his family to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to stay at least until a federal appeal in his
custody battle with Miami relatives is settled.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta is scheduled to
hear arguments May 11 on whether 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez can seek
asylum without his father's permission and whether the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service should have interviewed the
boy to determine his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that the case could end in a matter of weeks
or continue for months.
</P>
<P>
   The court has already indicated that Elian has the right to seek
asylum because immigration law does not specify when a child is too
young to have such a right.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent is a 1980s case of a Ukrainian boy who
successfully sought asylum over his parents' objections. The court
that decided that case said 12-year-old Walter Polovchak was
''presumably near the lower end of an age range'' of maturity to
claim rights separate from his parents.
</P>
<P>
   If, after oral arguments, the appeals court decides Elian can
speak for himself, the question becomes whether he has been unduly
influenced by his Miami relatives who want to keep him in the
United States or by his father, who wishes him to return to Cuba,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neal Sonnett of the American Bar Association's
coordinating committee on immigration law suggested that although
the Miami relatives say the boy wishes to remain in the U.S., now
that he is with his father, ''Elian might say, 'I love my Daddy and
I want to go back with my Daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's
Children and Youth Law Clinic, contends ''children of tender years
are incapable of making major life decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there's no indication that he would, there is also the
possibility that the father, who is in the United States with his
second wife and another, younger son, could change his own mind and
seek asylum for himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Barring that, if the appeals court determines Elian cannot speak
for himself, legal experts said the question then becomes: Who
speaks for him, Lazaro Gonzalez, his great uncle in Miami, or his
father?
</P>
<P>
   With such a ruling, the father undoubtedly will petition the
court to replace Lazaro Gonzalez as the boy's chief guardian, the
legal experts said. The father's attorney, Gregory B. Craig, has
said all along that only the father has the legal right to speak
for his son, and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has said likewise.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which way the three-judge appeals panel decides,
either side -- the father or the uncle -- could ask that the case be
heard by the full panel of appeals court judges.
</P>
<P>
   Further prolonging the proceedings, that ruling could then be
appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not beyond the realm of possibility. Unquestionably, this
case is of significant constitutional magnitude,'' Perlmutter said.
''It's a very challenging and profound question that goes to the
heart of our whole view of family life as a civilized western
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the father's representatives say he will keep his son in
the United States during the appeals process, and Attorney General
Janet Reno has accepted that as a firm commitment, a lingering
question is whether Cuban emissaries with diplomatic immunity can
whisk the father and son away nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency order bars the shipwreck survivor from being taken
out of the United States until the Miami relatives' appeal is
resolved, but the order may not be enough to stop diplomats from
the Cuban Interests Section in Washington from spiriting the child
back to Cuba, Sonnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We managed to snatch him from a house in three minutes, and it
seems to me, if he were back in the Cuban Interests Section and
they arranged a private plane at 3 o'clock in the morning, what's
the United States going to do, fire on the plane?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pledged Saturday to ''take every step necessary to ensure
that Elian does not leave the country while the court of appeals
injunction is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   On her order, the U.S. Marshal Service was providing heavy
security for the father and son at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that the two would be at the base ''for a short
period'' and then move ''somewhere else in the Washington area.''
Meissner said there are no plans for the them to move to the home
of a Cuban diplomat in Bethesda, Md., where the father has been
staying.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Craig insisted his client would not attempt to flee
with the boy and would allow the case to take its course through
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel has made a commitment to stay in the United States
during this appeal, and he will live up to that commitment,'' Craig
said.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Loses Europe Parliament Seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French far right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen was
stripped of his last elected post on Saturday, losing his seat in
the European Parliament as the result of a court ruling that banned
him from public office after he was convicted of assaulting a
Socialist politician.
</P>
<P>
   The decree announcing the end of Le Pen's mandate as a European
lawmaker was signed by Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
published in the official state bulletin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the leader of the far right National Front party
was stripped of his seat on a regional council in the southern
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region. Le Pen has repeatedly said his
conviction is politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, France's highest court upheld a conviction
against Le Pen for assaulting Socialist politician Annette
Peulvast-Bergeal. Television footage showed Le Pen shoving
Peulvast-Bergeal in the chest during a scuffle with protesters at
an election campaign in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen was banned from public office for one year. The fiery
71-year-old, who has said he will run for president in 2002, also
received a three-month suspended sentence for the attack on
Peulvast-Bergeal, a Socialist opponent of Le Pen's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Before a recent slump, the National Front consistently won about
15 percent of the vote in national elections. The party blames
immigrants, particularly from North Africa, for high unemployment
and urban violence. It has been widely accused of racism and
anti-Semitism.

<HEADLINE> Reno Defends Force in Taking Elian  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was just past 4 a.m. Saturday and Attorney
General Janet Reno, at her desk wearing a telephone headset, could
wait no longer to decide whether to order armed agents to seize
Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Reno already had decided that the meticulously planned operation
would take place in Saturday's pre-dawn hours. Surprise meant
everything, and conditions were just right for the officers. The
crowd in front of the Lazaro Gonzalez home in Miami was as thin as
it was going to get.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations were recounted by Justice Department aides,
who were sitting on chairs, sofas and the floor around Reno's desk,
the attorney general looked around the room to see whether all
agreed to proceed. They did, according to officials who described
the scene but would not be quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a Miami mediator asked for five more minutes.
When nothing happened, the attorney general turned to Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, and gave the order to move.
</P>
<P>
   While it had been a long night for Reno, it was just as taxing
for mediators in Miami more than 900 miles away. The mediators knew
the negotiations had been snagged during the night, but they were
upbeat -- confident that an agreement was not impossible. The
lightning raid shocked them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no need for violence,'' said mediation team member
Tad Foote, president of the University of Miami. ''It's a terrible
thing that's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-assembled mediation group had formed after Carlos de la
Cruz, who helped resolve a black tourism boycott of Miami in 1995,
called Carlos Saladrigas, president of ADP Totalsource employment
service Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz, chairman of the University of Miami's board of
directors and president of Eagle Brands snack foods, had said he
didn't like the way the Cuban-American community was being
portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, de la Cruz, Saladrigas and prominent attorney Aaron
Podhurst met, called Reno and asked if she thought it would help if
they tried to negotiate behind the scenes. The negotiations took
place with Podhurst as Reno's direct telephone contact.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami family had signed a letter agreeing to live with
Elian and his father at a temporary, neutral home in the Miami
area, with Elian's father Juan Miguel having temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
   Around 4 a.m. Saturday, Reno told Podhurst, working from his
home, that the living quarters couldn't be in Florida. The Justice
Department insisted on a site near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While Podhurst waited on the phone for Reno's message to be
relayed, the raid began. ''I was totally surprised and shocked when
the government seized the boy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Miami family, former U.S. attorney Kendall
Coffey, was sleeping on the couch at the Lazaro Gonzalez' house. De
la Cruz had just come back from a coffee run to a nearby all-night
shop when agents snatched the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In Reno's office, there were moments of unbearable tension and
moments when nothing was happening. One staff member brought back
pizza. Another had time to read ''Voyage To The Bunny Planet,'' a
book Reno was planning to read at Monday's Easter Egg Roll at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Reno was alternately subdued and passionate. She
cajoled and argued with Podhurst. One official said she used words
like ''At some point we're going to have to do enforcement. We
don't want to do it. We have to know, will they bring the child? We
have to have the child.''
</P>
<P>
   She also warned, ''You're running out of time. There's no more
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno aides had prepared separate statements for her to read, one
if a deal had been reached and one for a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the final decision was made, Reno went around the
room to get everyone's opinion. Everyone was nervous and silent for
a moment. They all nodded their approval. Nobody was opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The aides watched the raid on television. ''They've got the
kid,'' someone yelled.
</P>
<P>
   In a government van, agents pointed out the city lights to Elian
and gave him a toy plane to show him how he would be going to see
''papa.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS agent who was in the van with Elian reported back, ''This
is one tough little kid. I was shaking. He was not.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Blast Near Algeria Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Agriculture Minister Said Berkat
narrowly escaped injury in a bomb attack in northern Algeria, local
newspapers said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The papers also said six people, including two soldiers, were
killed in recent violence in the North African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Berkat, who was on an official visit to the Blida region 30
miles east of Algiers, had just left Magtaa Lazrag when the bomb
exploded on Friday, La Tribune newspaper said. A civilian security
guard was injured when the homemade device went off, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Algerian soldiers killed three members of an armed
Islamic group in a mountainous region around Teffaha, 280 miles
west of the capital, Le Matin newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, two soldiers were killed when they stopped at a
roadblock set up by Islamic militants in Lakhdaria, 50 miles east
of Algiers, the daily Liberte said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also said Islamic militants on Wednesday cut the
throat of a woman and kidnapped her 20-year-old daughter in El
Marsa village in the Chlef region, 130 miles west of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been gripped by an Islamic insurgency since 1992,
when the army canceled elections that the now-banned Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed in the violence since
then.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to bring about national reconciliation, President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika offered a peace plan that gave insurgents
partial amnesty if they handed in their weapons by Jan. 13 and were
not guilty of rape, murder or bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proposal, attacks occur almost daily.

<HEADLINE> Amato Assembling Italy Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Premier-designate Giuliano Amato was hard at work
Saturday assembling a new government, working the telephones and
firing off e-mails to potential cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he wants to have a list of ministers ready to
present to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Wednesday. Both Monday
and Tuesday are national holidays in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Amato is expected to ask the lower house of parliament for the
required vote of confidence on Thursday, then go to the Senate on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The center-left coalition claims it has the necessary votes to
win approval for what would be Italy's 58th postwar government.
</P>
<P>
   Amato was at his office Saturday morning and planned to leave
later in the day for an Easter holiday on the Tuscan coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi on Friday asked Amato, the treasury secretary, to form a
new government following the resignation of Premier Massimo
D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
   Amato has said he will present a list of ministers shorter than
that of D'Alema, who had 26 ministers in his government, along with
a host of deputies.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema quit after his coalition suffered a humiliating defeat
in regional elections at the hands of conservative forces led by
media baron Silvio Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, an ex-premier, unsuccessfully lobbied Ciampi for a
snap general election. Ciampi, however, was unwilling to do so to
allow a May 21 referendum on ending chronic instability in Italy's
electoral system to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Amato hopes to put together a government that can last until
scheduled elections next spring, allowing time for his fractured,
demoralized center-left coalition to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old professor of constitutional law did a brief turn
as premier for the Socialist party in 1992-93. He was widely
credited for helping Italy rein in its budget deficit and is well
respected in international financial circles.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists were then under the leadership of the late
Bettino Craxi and were badly tainted by corruption scandals.
Amato's own integrity has never been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Amato has said that unemployment and electoral reform would be
his top priorities as premier this time around.

<HEADLINE> Hardened by decades of political fights, Florio takes his lastchance  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EWING, N.J. (AP) -- For Jim Florio, the race for U.S. Senate
represents a last chance in a political career spanning four
decades and he is on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is a last chance not because of age. The former governor is
62 but at a recent breakfast for retired UAW workers here he
appeared as tireless as someone half his age.
</P>
<P>
   This is Florio's last chance because of the nature of the task
at hand: to resurrect a political career vanquished by Gov.
Christie Whitman 1993, over the objections of the leaders of his
own Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   No one running for federal office this year can match Florio's
experience, dating to his 1969 victory in a state Assembly race.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's opponent in the primary, financier Jon Corzine, is the
most untested of this year's newcomers, but is nonetheless seen by
many as the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has the endorsements of both U.S. senators -- Robert
Torricelli and the retiring Frank Lautenberg -- and of Democratic
State Chairman Tom Giblin. He has won endorsements in most major
Democratic counties in central and northern New Jersey covering 70
percent of the registered Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Florio is taking the fight to his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, a former Navy boxer, has not only displayed a variety of
attack moves, he appears to relish it. At a recent news conference,
he was asked if he was depressed by Corzine's advantage in party
support and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Depressed is hardly an appropriate term,'' Florio said. ''I
think Mr. Corzine has a lot of problems, problems that his friends
and his allies that are bought-and-paid-for will not be able to
cover up for him or help him with forever. At some point, he must
stand up for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, at a campaign event at Thomas Edison State
College, Florio taunted Corzine for refusing to debate him
directly, insisting on a format in which they gave separate
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get to this point, you can memorize 15 minutes on
anything,'' Florio said when it was his turn at the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you want to send down there to stand up for you and
your children and the values that you all have: amateur or
professional, knowledgeable or not knowledgeable, forceful or not
forceful. That is the set of choices that people have. I am not
going to need any on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio gets agitated about what he calls Corzine's cash-driven
''hostile takeover'' of the Democratic Party. If the millionaire
Corzine is going to flood local politics and state airwaves with
his own money, Florio is going to try to convince voters to
mistrust him for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concern is that we are seeing a sea change in the way that
politics operates,'' Florio said after meeting with UAW retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having Wall Street generically come and acquire a party
in the way that they acquire a company. It is mind boggling,'' he
said, referring to millions Corzine has spent already to help
Democrats in local and state races, including grants of $25,000 to
Democratic county committees.
</P>
<P>
   ''You buy off the competition, you give a golden parachute to
somebody to make them your friend, whatever you have to do to
acquire the company. That's the mentality we are talking about
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this occurs, this will not be our party for Democrats. It
will be a fully owned subsidiary,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Quinnipiac Poll in late March concluded that only 17
percent of registered Democrats were bothered by heavy spending
from a wealthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jim McQueeny said it is disingenuous of Florio
to attack Corzine for funding local organizations. ''(Corzine) is
doing the party-building he never did,'' McQueeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree the backlash against Florio's decision to raise
income and sales taxes in 1990 wrecked the Democrats hold on power
in Trenton to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florio, who single-handedly tore down the Democratic Party
right down to the local office holders, is now criticizing somebody
for trying to build the party up,'' McQueeny said.
</P>
<P>
   But McQueeny said Florio commands a solid base among traditional
Democrats in the unions and working class, perhaps as much as 40
percent of the primary vote. The fight on June 6 will be for the
final 10 percent Florio needs for victory, while Corzine must work
his way up from anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Since Corzine has made reference to his positive role as
chairman of Goldman Sachs, Florio and his staff have made the
investment firm a target, attacking a financial world where assets
are the only values.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Florio has attacked Goldman Sachs -- and
by proxy Corzine -- for financing oil ventures for a genocidal
regime in Africa, shielding an asbestos company from paying sick
workers and funding mergers that threw thousands out of work.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own flank, the 1990 tax increases, Florio has
practiced his answer. After his UAW speech, he opened the floor for
''questions,'' only to ask himself one about the taxes and then to
spend 20 minutes answering it.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed Gov. Thomas Kean for leaving him with a $600 million
deficit, and explained the common sense behind raising taxes as a
part of a philosophy he learned from his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rent money would go in the coffee can on the shelf, the
Chase &AMP; Sanborn coffee can, because she said you gotta pay your
bills,'' Florio said. ''It was her value system, and it is my value
system.''

<HEADLINE> Photo Captures Moment of Elian Raid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a video age, the most striking image of the
raid to seize Elian Gonzalez was a still photograph that showed a
federal agent in riot gear pointing an automatic rifle as the
6-year-old boy cowered in the arms of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, one in a series transmitted worldwide by The
Associated Press, was taken by free-lance photographer Alan Diaz in
the bedroom where Elian was hiding in a closet with Donato
Dalrymple, a fisherman who helped rescue him from sea in November.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, the picture dominated the special live
TV coverage on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an image that will endure in our memories,'' CNN's
Miles O'Brien said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, that photo was joined by pictures that depicted Elian
in a smiling reunion with his father, stepmother and half-brother
at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Those were supplied to the
networks by the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   The three top broadcasters and three cable news stations had
mostly continuous coverage of the story from before 6 a.m. until at
least noon. The exception was ABC, which was more reluctant to
break away from children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz had hopped a chain-link fence when he heard a commotion at
the Gonzalez house and was directed into the room where the boy was
being held.
</P>
<P>
   He and an NBC cameraman, Tony Zumbado, had been waiting on the
lawn next door to the home of Elian's great-uncle when the raid
began. The family had arranged with television networks to have
cameras nearby to record any raid.
</P>
<P>
   Zumbado said later he was kicked in the stomach during the
commotion and his sound man was dragged away from the house by a
federal agent.
</P>
<P>
   Everything happened so quickly that he was unable to shoot any
video from inside the house, Zumbado said. Cameras outside captured
the oft-repeated image of a female agent carrying Elian to a white
van, which drove away as onlookers threw chairs and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   The quick action forced broadcasters into the unusual position
of showing and extensively discussing a still photograph --
something the networks usually shun as a relic from the pre-TV age.
</P>
<P>
   ''That picture, seen from a lot of points of view, has disaster
written all over it,'' said CBS's Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:20 a.m., a demonstrator outside the Gonzalez house was
holding a copy of the picture while standing behind CBS reporter
Byron Pitts. It was emblazoned with the words, ''federal child
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz's color picture was used on the front page of the Chicago
Sun-Times' early Sunday edition, under the headline, ''Elian
Seized.'' The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also used the picture on
its Sunday front page.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph drew sharp reactions from visitors to The
Associated Press' Web site. Some visitors said they felt the
picture reflected the agents' actions too negatively and would be
taken out of context by those who opposed the raid. Others praised
the picture and the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC all reported the
raid within a half hour after it took place. ABC didn't begin
continuous coverage with Elizabeth Vargas until shortly before 7
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CBS and NBC, ABC doesn't have a Saturday morning network
newscast. But spokeswoman Su-Lin Nichols said ABC decided to air
only brief reports in the immediate aftermath so as not to inflame
a tense situation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, who arrived at 6:50 a.m., was the only one of the top
three network anchors on the air Saturday morning. Rather had
interviewed Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Using views from helicopters, TV networks followed demonstrators
as they milled around Miami streets during the day Saturday,
capturing occasional skirmishes and small fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites of leading newspapers and other news operations
carried the raid as their top story Saturday. Several offered video
clips and Diaz's photos, and a few sites gave visitors the chance
to take an unscientific poll on whether the government acted
properly.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for example, said more 200,000 people weighed
in. It said 58 percent of respondents to its instant poll approved
of the federal action and 42 percent disapproved, and that 56
percent agreed the agents should have carried guns and 44 percent
said no.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said the response rate for an instant poll during the first
eight hours of a news event surpassed that surrounding the Clinton
impeachment and the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Princess
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald's home page, as the local newspaper, listed
areas where officials had blocked traffic. The Herald newspaper did
not put out a special edition. Instead, its reporters worked until
an 8 a.m. deadline to report the raid in their regular early Sunday
edition, which hit the streets Saturday afternoon. The newspaper
planned to devote 12 pages to the story in its later Sunday
editions, said Martin Baron, executive editor.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliated, Spanish-language El Nuevo Herald distributed
25,000 copies of an eight-page color special section at 3:30 p.m.
El Nuevo planned to devote its front pages and 14 inside pages in
the Sunday paper to the story.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the raid, Marisleysis Gonzalez took NBC
reporter Kerry Sanders on a tour of her house. She said she was
saving a helmet left behind by one of the federal agents as
''evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They broke Elian's bed,'' she said, bursting into tears.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cult Leader Kin Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The oldest daughter of the former leader of the
cult that gassed Tokyo's subways in 1995 was arrested Saturday on
suspicion of illegal possession of a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Miwa Matsumoto, 21, the daughter of Shoko
Asahara, after she was brought in for questioning about her
involvement in a minor road accident in Tokyo early Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   She was found carrying a fruit knife with a 3.7-inch blade
wrapped in a towel, said a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained her on suspicion she violated Japan's strict
Firearms and Sword Possession Control Law because she had no
legitimate reason to be carrying such a knife, the spokesman said.
He said he didn't know what penalty she could face if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Asahara is on trial for allegedly masterminding the Aum Shinri
Kyo cult's 1995 nerve gas attack, which killed 12 people and
injured thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
   Matsumoto had disappeared from a cult facility northeast of
Tokyo in January, the same month that Asahara's seven-year-old son
was briefly kidnapped by six cult members, including another of his
daughters, Kyodo News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kyodo quoted Matsumoto as telling police she had been carrying
the knife for protection since the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's accident, Matsumoto was a passenger in a van that
collided with a car in central Tokyo. The van was driven by a
female cult member who was not arrested, police said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani, protesters blast decision to take Elian  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dozens of Cuban-American protesters marched
Saturday outside Cuba's mission to the United Nations, ripping the
Clinton administration and accusing Attorney General Janet Reno of
sending ''stormtroopers'' in to seize Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani echoed the angry complaints of
demonstrators, saying this was ''one of the saddest days that I've
seen,'' and also using ''stormtroopers'' to describe the federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They trampled the wishes of his mother this morning with guns
and with stormtroopers,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine that the American administration has lost its
way so much,'' the mayor said. ''I couldn't imagine that something
like this could happen in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki had a similar reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very upsetting and offensive that people with machine
guns and fatigues would break down a door to take a child out of a
home in America,'' the Republican said. ''This is something that
would happen in the Soviet Union or Castro's Cuba, not in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the mission on Lexington Avenue, a crowd of under 100
demonstrators chanted anti-Castro slogans, waved Cuban flags and
expressed disgust with the Clinton administration over the pre-dawn
raid at the Miami home of the child's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration started peacefully, but wound up with one some
protesters burning flags and crossing police barricades. One man
was arrested for assaulting a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let Elian be part of the American dream, not Castro's
nightmare,'' read one of many signs held by the demonstrators. ''Is
anyone listening to what Elian wants?'' asked another sign that
featured a picture of the youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kind of storm trooper tactics are the kind of thing
that's done in Cuba,'' said Rafael Ocasio, 42, of Queens. ''Clinton
is a hypocrite. He says he's upholding the law, but there is no law
in his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocasio said the image of the cowering child in a closet beside a
rifle-toting soldier ''will stay frozen in my mind for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Another demonstrator, Juan Guitierrez of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, said he planned a trip to Washington to
express his anger over the decision to grab the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''America and all the world witnessed this despicable act,''
Guitierrez said. ''The Clinton administration sent storm troopers
into the house of a humble family.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is a beacon of democracy for all the people of the
world. At 5:15 a.m., that beacon went out.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden decision to take custody of the 6-year-old boy early
Saturday morning managed to make allies of Giuliani and Democratic
state Sen. David Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think their judgment was outrageous,'' Paterson said of the
Clinton Administration. ''What has the government learned since
Waco and Ruby Ridge?''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate
Hillary Clinton, attacked the mayor rather than comment on the
decision to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shocked that the Mayor would call United States law
enforcement officers 'stormtroopers,''' Wolfson said. ''Rudy
Giuliani's angry rhetoric is divisive and wrong.''

<HEADLINE> China Detains Cult Follower Daughter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police have detained the daughter of a
member of the banned Falun Gong sect, apparently for trying to
publicize her mother's death while in custody, her husband said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police took Zhang Xueling from her home on Monday, said her
husband, Ding Zhongyuan. Police would not let Ding visit his wife,
but he said the 15-day detention order police showed him at the
prison accused her of ''distorting facts to undermine social
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   While police would not explain the charge, Ding said Zhang had
been trying to publicize the circumstances of her mother's death
and had met with foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's detention comes just before the one-year anniversary
Tuesday of a huge Falun Gong protest outside the communist
leadership's compound in Beijing. The daylong silent protest last
April 25 drew 10,000 Falun Gong followers and shocked Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. He ordered a crackdown and the group was
publicly banned in July.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's mother Chen Zixiu was an avid follower of Falun Gong, a
mixture of traditional beliefs, slow-motion exercises and ideas
drawn from its founder that is believed to promote health and that
attracted millions of Chinese in the 1990s. Like thousands of
followers, Chen traveled to Beijing to protest the July ban.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, Chen, 59, was intercepted on her
way to Beijing in February and taken to an office for
''education.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, authorities told the family Chen was dead. In
an account Zhang posted on the Internet, she described Chen's body
as covered in bruises, her ears a dark purple, her teeth broken.
Out in the yard, she found Chen's clothes cut to ribbons, her
underwear soiled.
</P>
<P>
   People detained along with Chen claimed that police beat her and
others who refused to sign a written pledge to renounce Falun Gong,
the account said.
</P>
<P>
   The information office for China's cabinet claims that Chen was
never mistreated. In its account, Chen's health worsened while in
custody and she was taken to a hospital where she died from a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 Falun Gong followers have died in custody since the
group was banned nine months ago. The government has denied any
abuse, saying that the practitioners either committed suicide or
died of natural causes.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Cuban community block highway, march in streets after raid onElian  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- More than 150 people in the nation's
second-largest Cuban-American community blocked a highway, marched
in the streets and said they were ashamed to be American Saturday
after the government took Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives'
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in tears,'' Rosa Grabe de Peralta said. ''I thought that
this was the land of the free, but apparently it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Waving Cuban and American flags and carrying signs that read
''Clinton and Reno are kidnappers'' and ''Clinton and Castro --
Perfect Together,'' protesters marched down a highway ramp onto
Interstate 495 and blocked hundreds of cars in both directions
about a mile from the New Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys who appeared to be about 8 or 10 years old lay on the
southbound side of the highway in front of a Greyhound bus as one
man with a microphone screamed continuously, ''Free Elian!'' and
''Freedom!''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators dispersed after 20 minutes, the time that the
Lincoln Tunnel was closed to both New York City and New Jersey
drivers. No one was hurt or arrested, said Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey Sgt. Stephen Prospero.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mendez, 30, of Weehawken waved two large Cuban and
American flags in the middle of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''When 800,000 people feel the same way, it's for a reason,''
Mendez said, referring to the nation's Cuban-American community.
''I'm ashamed to be American today.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the type of situation I worked hard to avoid,'' said
U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, who was a key participant in
negotiations to reunite the boy with his father last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a carefully worded statement that did not blame anyone for
the raid, Torricelli said, ''We are a nation of laws that respects
freedom and human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Menendez, a Cuban American who also has
participated in negotiations, called the raid ''a despicable use of
the force of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To take a child out at gunpoint in the middle of the night,
awakened from his sleep, with masks on, reminds me of the tactics
of Castro's dictatorship,'' said Menendez, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at his Union City office, Menendez said the
family's negotiators were ''on the verge of an agreement'' with the
government to release Elian when the raid began.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Hudson County, which is home to about 150,000
Cuban-Americans, awoke to news of Elian's taking that blared on
Spanish language television and radio in local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton is following Fidel Castro's orders,'' said
Luis Nunez, 48, sitting inside the El Artesano restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno made a deal with
the Cuban government to remove the boy by force, rather than allow
the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to come to Florida to take
him.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a copy of an Associated Press photograph of an agent in
riot gear pointing a gun near Elian, 10-year-old Amanda Perez said:
''If Elian's father really loved him, he would have come from the
beginning, not coming to get him like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many said they expected the government to take the boy,
they were surprised it occurred on the holy day before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are preparing to go to church and they come in and take
him,'' said Sergio Alonso.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders who had scrambled to put together a protest
Saturday afternoon in Union City's business district decided to
scrap that after the march on the Lincoln Tunnel. Instead, at least
150 demonstrators boarded buses headed for New York City to attend
a previously planned vigil outside the Cuban Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, about 100 younger people began marching
in the streets again, chanting in Spanish, ''Clinton, Fidel,
Husband and Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents understood the government's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a family laughing at the attorney general, and
sooner or later you've got to show them some authority,'' said
Roland Rolo, 44, sipping coffee in a Union City cafe. ''The family
overestimated their position of power.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Summons Insurance Execs  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Accused of mishandling claims from the
1994 earthquake in Los Angeles, executives from six insurance
companies were summoned to the state Insurance Department's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   They were ushered into an office one by one and offered a
choice: Donate to a new fund set up by the department or face
billions of dollars' worth of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were told, 'You cooperate,''' an insurance industry
source familiar with the meetings with then-Chief Deputy Insurance
Commissioner William Palmer told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''One (executive) would walk in, and Palmer would throw down two
press releases -- one that he said would be sent out if they
contributed, the other if they didn't. One by one, they got mad and
walked out,'' said an insurance executive whose account was
confirmed by two other sources. All spoke on condition of
anonymity. Palmer didn't return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the insurers decided to avoid the penalties and gave
the fund a total of $11.6 million in donations for education,
consumer assistance and earthquake research.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissed potential fines were enormous: $2.38 billion for
State Farm, $819 million for 21st Century and $172 million for
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, who
the sources said didn't attend the Spring 1999 meetings, said those
penalties were cited for ''shock value'' and never seriously
contemplated. ''They extrapolated the worst-case scenario for every
problem we identified, including willful violations,'' said
spokesman Dan Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The California Research and Assistance Fund is now under
investigation by two committees of the state Legislature and by
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Lockyer has subpoenaed directors of
CRAF and two other funds financed with similar payments by
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The first legislative hearings are scheduled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are also expected to focus on what has happened to
the mishandled claims which prompted the threatened fines.
</P>
<P>
   They include complaints that insurers low-balled damage
estimates in settlement offers, improperly deducted for
wear-and-tear, didn't inform policyholders of benefits and forced
some to sue for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush aides say confidentiality laws prevent them from
giving details, but that insurers are cooperating in seeking fair
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say many complaints remain unresolved six
years after the quake in the Northridge area of Los Angeles. But
only a few victims have stepped forward during the current dispute
to say their complaints are still unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has spent $3 million for public service ads featuring
Quackenbush, a Republican re-elected in 1998, and another $1.1
million for public service ads starring Shaquille O'Neal of the
NBA's Los Angeles Lakers. The Quackenbush ads that aired last
November showed Quackenbush discussing quake dangers and urging
viewers to call a toll-free number for more information. The O'Neal
ads have not aired yet.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also donated $500,000 to the Greater Sacramento Urban
League after Quackenbush joined the organization's board of
directors. The league has no official business related to
earthquakes, which are infrequent in the Sacramento area.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield, who wrote a 1988 ballot
measure that created the elected insurance commissioner's office,
said any payments by insurers should have been made to the state
treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The insurance commissioner does not have the authority to
order or agree to payments to nonprofit foundations as a substitute
for payments to the state treasury,'' Rosenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards disagreed, saying the commissioner has broad powers to
levy fines and decide penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did something creative, but it's not unprecedented, and
it's better for consumers,'' Edwards said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Compares Clinton to Castro  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republican leaders accused the
Clinton administration of using Fidel Castro's tactics to snatch
Elian Gonzalez from relatives in Miami on Saturday to be reunited
with his father. A Cuban-born congressman is demanding a
congressional hearing about President Clinton's ''most cowardly
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, said the
armed raid ''clearly was not justified'' and blamed the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I awoke in my hometown with my family today -- Easter
weekend -- and learned of the tactics that had been used to seize
Elian Gonzalez, my first thought was that this could only happen in
Castro's Cuba,'' Lott said. ''President Clinton should not have
allowed this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, the third-ranking Republican in the House,
accused the administration of kidnapping the boy, ''more
reminiscent of Castro's communist Cuba than the America I thought I
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   He apologized ''to all Americans who are morally offended'' by
the raid.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart accused Republicans
of ignoring repeated Clinton pleas to keep politics out of the
Elian saga.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing that those leaders today continued that
effort to exploit the case of a 6-year-old boy for political
purposes,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said she sent in Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents and federal marshals only after
negotiations broke down with Elian's Miami relatives to surrender
the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Janet Reno have mustered
extraordinary patience in waiting this long,'' said Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which handles Justice Department matters.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and the raiding party ''acted professionally as they did
their duty to uphold the law,'' Leahy said. ''It is unfortunate
that the Miami relatives made it necessary to send federal agents
to remove Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans disagreed strenuously with that line of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-born Miamian Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart said he will demand
a congressional investigation of Reno and Clinton's conduct and
wants to know what was behind the raid. ''I accuse William
Jefferson Clinton ... of committing his most cowardly act,''
Diaz-Balart said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Florida Republican, Sen. Connie Mack, expressed
repulsion and outrage and said the predawn raid on the house where
Elian has lived since surviving a Thanksgiving boat wreck marked
''a tragic day in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, sharply
criticized the Clinton administration Saturday for its seizure of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The forced abduction of Elian Gonzalez at five o'clock in the
morning on a sacred holiday with guns drawn was dangerous and
reckless,'' Shays said. ''While Elian needed to be reunited with
his father, there is a process that should have been followed that
protects his life and those who care deeply about him on all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode also had an impact on the presidential election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Al Gore's campaign office in Nashville,
Tenn., the vice president repeated his previous stand that ''this
issue should have been handled through a family court and with the
family coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   As street violence struck parts of Miami in protest to the boy's
seizure, the presumed Democratic nominee appealed to ''all
Americans, no matter what their position on this issue, to obey the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's likely GOP opponent in November, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, blamed Gore with Clinton for deciding to resolve a custody
dispute ''in the terror of middle-of-the-night raids.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The moral authority of our law comes from the understanding it
will be applied in a fair and measured way,'' Bush said. ''The
chilling picture of a little boy being removed from his home at
gunpoint defies the values of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother Jeb, Florida's governor, said Clinton assured him
the administration intended to negotiate a settlement. ''I was
surprised that the forcible removal of Elian took place when it
did, in light of the recent positive developments to resolve the
matter peacefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his disappointment over the raid, however, the Florida
governor urged Miami's Cuban community not to infringe on the
rights of others with their protests or risk public safety. He said
state law enforcers would be available, if needed, to keep the
peace.

<HEADLINE> Pope Leads Open-Air Vigil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II led thousands of faithful
Saturday in an open-air candlelit vigil for the approach of Easter,
lighting a twinkling flame shared hand-to-hand as twilight fell
over St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, normally held in the darkness of St. Peter's
Basilica, moved outside for the Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 worshippers gathered before the
flower-banked steps of the basilica, sunset lighting up jet trails
in the apricot sky behind the dome on a warm spring evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christ is risen!'' John Paul proclaimed to the crowd as
darkness settled. ''We proclaim this witness to the world, so that
the joy which is ours will reach countless other hearts, kindling
in them the light that does not disappoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony is the most solemn of the Catholic liturgical year,
marking off the final dark hours before the exultation of Easter
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope's strength showed no sign of flagging
through the long ceremony, which leaves him only a short night of
sleep before Easter Mass. He waited attentively as each of eight
lay people approached his throne on the steps, baptizing them in a
fixture of the Easter vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Often those baptized are chosen for the symbolism of their
nationality. This year, as in recent ones, China was among the
countries selected -- a move that emphasizes the Vatican's
sovereignty over China's Catholics. China does not recognize that
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The pope in the past has remarked on political strife and other
troubles facing the countries of those baptized. This year, his
message was strictly religious -- celebrating the most central event
to Christianity, the resurrection of Christ.

<HEADLINE> Cops Take On Miami Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, and
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Riot police with batons and shields beat down
demonstrators who set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches on the
streets of Little Havana on Saturday after Elian Gonzalez was
snatched away by federal agents. More than 80 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest continued for hours after the pre-dawn raid on Lazaro
Gonzalez's house, as police cleared out one area only to have
another protest pop up a few blocks away in the working-class
neighborhood. By early evening, the situation appeared to ease.
</P>
<P>
   Police in small groups or walking 30-strong down the avenues
shooed away protesters and scuffled with those that resisted.
Several officers were assaulted, and several were injured by a man
with a baseball bat. Conditions of the injured were not
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man was handcuffed and dragged on his knees toward a
police wagon. Officers threw down a girl in her 20s wearing
flip-flops and handcuffed her. A teen-ager riding a bicycle was
knocked down by police in an unmarked car, beaten and handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is terrible,'' said Cristina Valdes, 67, who was among
dozens of people venting their anger by banging on a parked van.
''I'm ashamed to be an American. Clinton is a coward, coward,
coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and witnesses said the unrest appeared to be contained to
2{ square miles within Little Havana, with traffic stopped from
entering.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers shut down parts of the city's highway system near
Little Havana as they cleared protesters who climbed onto roads and
stopped traffic. A motorcycle trooper was struck by a car and
seriously injured. Police said it appeared to be an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters threw rocks, one smashing the rear window of a patrol
car. One mob chased and attacked a police spokesman, who escaped
after sprinting for a block while being punched and spit upon.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped traffic from entering most of the area. Many
stood in the street, waving Cuban flags and upside down American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been quiet and kept in my home until now,'' said Ozzie
Zamora. ''But what our country did today was wrong. Everyone should
come out and protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanting protesters set fire to a pile of tires, rubbish and
plastic trash cans at an intersection about five blocks from the
house where Elian was taken.
</P>
<P>
   At least 80 demonstrators had been arrested by midafternoon,
said Miami police spokesman Detective Delrish Moss. Charges ranged
from disorderly conduct to inciting a riot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fortunate part of this whole thing is it is all
contained,'' Moss said. ''Overall, I've seen a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   One protester who jumped through the glass window of a service
station was chased down by eight officers. They smashed his head
into the ground, handcuffed him and took him away.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Elian's relatives, a man who people said was a
communist infiltrator was beaten, kicked and poked in the eye by a
mob of at least 20, while others urged calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not animals,'' a woman yelled as the scuffling crowd
tumbled down the street. ''We don't want to be like Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Two high school students, standing a few blocks from the worst
of the unrest, held up a bedsheet scrawled with this message:
''Miami, Please Not Another L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters lambasted President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno, who ordered the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Send Chelsea to Castro,'' said one protester's sign. ''Reno,
you have betrayed our trust. Ten children in Waco and Elian
condemned today,'' said another, a reference to the 1993 raid on
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Others denounced the government for snatching Elian from his
relatives' home the day before Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like crucifying the Messiah all over again. This is a
slap in the face to the Cuban-American community and the Christian
community,'' said Ralph Anrrich, a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   Photos were released after the boy was reunited with his father
showing Elian smiling. But protester Emy Peterson said Elian's
father isn't the issue -- Fidel Castro is. She carried a sign
saying: ''Reno: Which 'experts' on child psychology did you
consult? Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he's happy to see his father, but we're talking about
where he's going back to,'' Peterson said. ''He's going to be a
trophy to be paraded around like everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more peaceful protesters decried the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of people doing the wrong thing. The escalation
is just ridiculous,'' said Omar Silva, 42, who carried a giant
Cuban flag. ''The community is frustrated. It's been five long
months and we've been playing by Fidel's rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Others predicted there would be no end to the demonstrations
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over yet. How can you forget something like this?''
asked Ivette Morales, 30. ''It's been 40 years since the Bay of
Pigs and we still haven't forgotten that.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Surrogate Mother Anguished  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LACORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Marisleysis Gonzalez shouted like a revolutionary,
screaming in a voice already raw from the emotional drama that
unwound Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old cousin who took on the role of surrogate mother
to Elian Gonzalez took the bullhorn in front of her family's house
in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they did was wrong,'' a haggard Gonzalez shouted to
hundreds of Cuban-American protesters in the street. ''How can this
boy be OK when he had a gun to his head? I thought this was a
country of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   She blasted President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno's
decision to storm her house, point guns at her family and take the
little boy she has cared for during the past five months from his
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On leave from her bank job, Gonzalez was constantly at Elian's
side, escorting him to school or playfully carrying him on her
back. She was also among the family's most prominent speakers,
constantly lobbying against Elian's return to Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the continuous pressure and media spotlight appeared to wear
on her. She was hospitalized at least four times since Elian was
placed in her home after his Thanksgiving rescue.
</P>
<P>
   In between two trips to the hospital, she traveled to Washington
to testify in the Senate on the boy's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how much more I can take,'' she told The Miami
Herald in January.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, Gonzalez; her father and Elian's great
uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez; and fisherman Donato Dalrymple, who found
Elian at sea, boarded an American Airlines plane to Washington in
hopes of meeting with the boy and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The father and son were reunited at Andrews Air Force base on
Washington's outskirts shortly after he was removed from the Miami
home before dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear whether the trio would get to see Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after federal agents stormed the Miami house early
Saturday, Gonzalez led reporters through the disheveled house where
armed agents stormed in to take the 6-year-old boy and reunite him
with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'Give me the boy or we're going to shoot,''' she
recounted a few hours after the acrid smell of pepper gas had
spread through the house and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said she begged: ''Don't let the boy see this! I'll
give you the boy! Please don't let the boy see the gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, the armed agents in riot gear found the boy
cowering in a closet in her parents' bedroom and took him from the
arms of Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who rescued Elian after his
mother and 10 others died at sea last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was screaming and crying, 'Don't take me!''' she said. ''I
never thought they would do this to a kid. He's seen so much.''
</P>
<P>
   As she recalled the raid, she burst into tears as she lifted a
broken piece of Elian's bed: ''They trashed my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the gun was not pointed at the boy and that agents had
guns because officials had ''received information'' someone in the
crowd or the home could be armed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said she had told Reno personally she didn't want the
boy taken by force.
</P>
<P>
   ''She lied to this country and, to me, she doesn't have a
heart,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   After the raid, Gonzalez staggered as she walked around her
home. She wept repeatedly through the morning as she recalled the
loss of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I am asleep and he wakes up, and he doesn't see me, he
cries,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Refute Meningitis Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia denied reports Saturday
that an outbreak of meningitis among Muslim pilgrims who recently
traveled to Mecca had originated in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no proof that the cases reported in some European and
African countries originated in Mecca or Saudi Arabia,'' said a
Health Ministry official on condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization said Thursday it had recorded 250
cases of meningitis it believes is linked to the pilgrimage to
Muslim shrines, called the hajj. The U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said three of those people were from New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five of those diagnosed have died.
</P>
<P>
   The reports began about a week ago when Britain and France
diagnosed meningitis in pilgrims who had returned Saudi Arabia.
Last week, Saudi Arabia denied a report that two people who had
died in France from meningitis had contracted it while performing
the pilgrimage or from returned pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi health official said the number of meningitis cases
registered in the kingdom last year was 11, ''a low figure compared
to other countries and that is due to the strict preventive
measures taken by Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia requires visitors to produce documents certifying
that they have been vaccinated against contagious diseases such as
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million pilgrims traveled to Mecca last month for the
pilgrimage, which every able-bodied Muslim is expected to perform
at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial meningitis is a serious and often deadly infection of
the fluid and membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Its
symptoms include stiff neck, fever, intense headache, nausea,
vomiting and a purplish rash. It is spread through coughing,
kissing and other close contact.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists see progress, problems in NJ on 30th anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Citing worsening air and water quality, as
well as sprawl, New Jersey environmentalists said this year's Earth
Day was as much a call to action as a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some ways the quality of the pollution is less severe,''
David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation told the
Courier News of Bridgewater for Saturday's editions. ''But the
quantity and the long-term impacts are even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite government efforts to preserve open space, such as the
plan to save 1 million acres in a decade, activists are divided
over whether the state's environmental situation has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists complain that government officials have failed
to enact a waste water plan that will prevent construction of sewer
lines in undeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some say official discussions about the proposed
plan have indicated that the rules will be weak once they pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Full-time environmentalists want to hide under our desks on
Earth Day,'' Bill Neil, conservation director for the New Jersey
Audubon Society, told The Times of Trenton for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gov. Christie Whitman received a ''National Award for
Environmental Sustainability'' from Renew America, a national
environmental organization. She was recognized by the same group
for her support of ''smart growth'' about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey's population is increasing in many areas, and
environmentalists say they fear rampant development is not far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the number of people living in Ocean County has
more than doubled since Earth Day 1970, from 208,470 to a projected
490,000 this year. Some projections expect it to reach 576,000 by
2020.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County's population, now about 614,000, is expected to
reach 705,000 by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   William deCamp Jr., president of Save Barnegat Bay, told the
Asbury Park Press of Neptune in Saturday's editions that he's
pessimistic about the future if current trends hold.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Whitman's efforts to curb sprawl, deCamp blamed her
administration for failing to prevent development along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't find some mechanism for slowing down rampant
overdevelopment, the future for nature in our county cannot be
bright,'' he said. ''I'm pleased to note that Gov. Whitman's term
runs out in less than two years, so there is some hope there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Conner, a spokesman for the governor, said Whitman has
launched one of the most ambitious land preservation plans in the
country and is committed to the state's environment.
</P>
<P>
   And some environmentalists say they've seen attitudes -- both
official and unofficial -- shift in favor of preserving natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Forest, a member of Monmouth County Friends of Clearwater,
said he sees more awareness of the need for balance between the
needs of residents and the importance of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in our best interests to have a balance, because nobody
is going to be happy if we don't have any trees around, not to
mention fishing and a lot of other quality of life issues,
health,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Choice but Force in Miami  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the harrowing photo of a federal agent
with a gun seizing Elian Gonzalez, the Clinton administration
defended its use of force Saturday to take the Cuban boy from the
home of his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said she had received information
''there were guns -- perhaps in the crowd, perhaps in the house,''
but the boy's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez described a chaotic scene
with agents yelling: ''Give me the boy or we're going to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-dawn operation immediately was embroiled in presidential
politics, with Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush
saying ''the chilling picture'' of Elian's removal ''defies the
values of America and is not an image a freedom loving nation wants
to show the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., was even blunter.
''My first thought was that this could only happen in Castro's
Cuba,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Elian from Lazaro Gonzalez's bedroom was captured
in an Associated Press photo shown around the world. It showed a
federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles with an
automatic rifle confronting a man holding the frightened 6-year-old
boy in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   A switch on the HK MP-5 weapon in photographs is clearly on
''S'' for safety, a position from which it could not be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that in addition to the intelligence about possible
weapons, those outside the house had previously suggested ''that
they were going to prevent it from happening. Lazaro, who had said
that at one point that he would step aside, said that people might
have to run a gauntlet. And there was clear defiance of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno cast events in the best possible light. she told how a
Spanish-speaking immigration agent spoke soothingly to the boy as
she took him away, using a script worked out in advance. He was
given toys and assured he would not be harmed or put on a boat back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Marisleysis Gonzalez said there was nothing soothing about
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can this boy be OK when he had a gun to his head?'' she
asked in anguished tones. She said she told the officers: ''Don't
let the boy see this! I'll give you the boy! Please don't let the
boy see the gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Glick, executive director of the National Tactical
Officers Association, said the officers handled the situation well.
''They didn't send in an overly harsh force,'' he said. ''They
fired chemicals into the crowd first to prevent more serious
injuries. They announced who they were at the door and when the
door was not opened, they did force it open.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended his attorney general. ''The law has
been upheld, and that was the right thing to do,'' Clinton he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no alternative but to enforce the decision'' of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and of the courts that
custody of the boy should transfer to the father, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was harshly critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ours is a nation of laws, not guns,'' Bush said. ''Custody
disputes are resolved in the calm of a courtroom, not in the terror
of middle-of-the-night raids.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that ''if you look carefully'' at the picture, ''it
shows that the gun was pointed to the side, and that the finger was
not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture showed the agent's finger not on the trigger, but
just above it.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agents were in the house during the operation, which Reno
said lasted for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said, ''We had to make sure
our agents could protect themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Quotes From the Elian Gonzalez Case  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes from the Elian Gonzalez case:
<TEXT>

   ''Elian Gonzalez is a child who needs to be cherished, who needs
to have quiet time and private time, and to be with his father. And
that is what this case is still all about -- the bond between a
father and a son.'' -- Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no reason to keep him here -- and take him to
Disneyworld. That's not America,'' said Michael Pollizatto, 28, of
Portland, Ore. ''He should be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ashamed. I am so ashamed of what our country did here
tonight. There was no need for this to happen in this fashion.'' --
Miami Mayor Joe Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thank the millions of Americans who supported this young
father's efforts to be reunited with his most wonderful son.'' --
Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're angry and disgusted. We were in communication with the
mediator handling negotiations and discussion with the government
when they knocked the door down.'' -- Kendall Coffey, an attorney
for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Janet Reno handled this beautifully. I can't stand Clinton,
but he and Reno did a good job on this one. Why shouldn't the man
have his child? There's nothing abhorrent about a child being with
his father.'' -- Bob Burman, a Columbus, Ohio, attorney and father
to two.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took this kid like a hostage in the nighttime.'' -- Donato
Dalrymple, who was holding Elian when federal agents seized him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great joy for us. We're filled with satisfaction that
the boy is with his father.'' -- Maura Casanas, 37, an industrial
engineer in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are together.'' -- Myron Marlin, Justice Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is terrible. I'm ashamed to be an American. Clinton is a
coward, coward, coward.'' -- Cristina Valdes, 67, protester in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what they did is necessary because reuniting him with
his father was necessary.'' -- Carlos Moran, 67, in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I'm back in Cuba in 1960. That's the way I feel
right now. I've been here 40 years. I never, never thought anything
like this would happen.'' -- Beatriz Hernandez, 55, member of
Mothers Against Repression.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a family laughing at the attorney general, and
sooner or later you've got to show them some authority. The family
overestimated their position of power.'' -- Roland Rolo, 44, in a
Cuban cafe in Union City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe what I saw. And they want to take our guns
away from us? Why couldn't they just wait another week and let the
boy go peacefully?'' -- Priscilla Talich, mother of a 9-year-old
son, in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid should be with his father. The people in Miami weren't
going to give the kid up. I don't think they had a choice.'' -- Tom
McClean, 41, an electrician from the Chicago suburb of Woodridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked as though they went to extremes, but we don't know
what led up to that. ... I don't think a child of 6 knows where he
wants to live. I don't think a child of 6 knows politics.'' --
Caroline Tyson, a waitress in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am heartbroken and devastated. I was shocked that a peaceful
transfer, which according to all reports appeared so close, failed
to materialize. It's a real travesty of justice that this had to
come to such a needless and violent transition.'' -- Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, who was the host of a meeting between Elian and his
Cuban grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone talks about Cuba being the evil empire, but how evil
would we be if we kept the boy from his father?'' -- Tim Quistoroff,
34, a musician in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Rocket May Be Ukraine Blast Cause  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A military rocket that veered off-course
during training exercises may be to blame for an apartment building
explosion that killed three people, Ukrainian investigators said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Several metal pieces that appeared to have come from a rocket
were found near the damaged building in the town of Brovary, 35
miles from the capital Kiev, the Interfax news agency quoted
investigators as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said a surface-to-surface rocket was fired
from a training range 80 miles away shortly before Thursday's
explosion and admitted that it deviated from its target -- but said
it was only by 25 yards, Interfax said. Earlier the ministry had
denied the missile left course.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the experts make the final conclusion that the Defense
Ministry is responsible for the blast, the ministry will be the
first to acknowledge it,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Serhiy
Nahorianskyi, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-designed 9M-79 rocket has an 80-mile range, but was
shooting at a target just 35 miles away, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Final investigation results are expected Monday, Interfax said.
Police are also investigating whether the explosion was caused by a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The blast in a nine-story apartment block sent rafters slamming
through ninth to second floors of the building and forced 91 people
to evacuate. Three were killed and five were injured.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Calls for Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Serbian opposition leaders renewed calls
Saturday for early elections and promised greater coordination to
oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 party leaders, Orthodox clergy and heads of emigre
groups backed the declaration issued at the end of a two-day
meeting here hosted by Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, son of
Yugoslavia's last king, who claims the country's throne.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country and people await changes and it is up to you to
provide leadership for changes. (Otherwise) the country will go to
ruin,'' Karadjordjevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading participants in the talks met on Friday with
James Dobbins, special Balkan adviser to President Clinton, who was
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's traditionally fractured opposition agreed to join
forces against Milosevic in January and are pressing calls for
early elections, which are not required to be held until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and European Union strongly favor early elections and
provide support and funding for Yugoslav opposition groups and
private media. They say sanctions against Yugoslavia will not be
lifted as long as Milosevic is in power.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou on Saturday met a main
opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, as well as a key group of Kosovo
Serb moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Serb moderates received his ''full support'' for
their efforts toward ethnic reconciliation in the province,
Papandreou said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your efforts for survival and cooperation between all the
nationalities of Kosovo are truly heroic,'' Papandreou said after
meeting with members of the group, who included Christian religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou promised aid measures for Kosovo, including accepting
children at Greek summer camps this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said Athens is in ''regular'' contact with both the Yugoslav
government and opposition groups, in an attempt to ease regional
tension.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting was met with skepticism by many Greeks, who
strongly condemned NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Serb royalists in Athens, also drew criticism in
a country which abolished its own monarchy in a 1974 referendum. A
close aide to Papandreou submitted his resignation Friday after
addressing Karadjordjevic as ''your highness''. Papandreou urged
him to stay on.

<HEADLINE> India Tea Estate Manager Kills 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- A tea estate manager allegedly shot at
workers who mobbed him Saturday to demand better wages, killing
five people and seriously wounding 20 others.
</P>
<P>
   The company official in the thickly forested Assam state,
India's tea hub, was joined by his security guards as they opened
fire at nearly 200 slogan-shouting laborers inside the Borgora tea
estate in the northern Darrang area, a district official said on
customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The workers demanded their daily wages be raised to 90 cents
from the current 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The official said four workers died immediately and one more in
hospital. Police have arrested the garden manager and his security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Borgora is among the three gardens in Assam which produce green
tea.

<HEADLINE> 911 Tape Sheds Light on Pa. Murder  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINKING SPRING, Pa. (AP) -- Friends and family say the final
terrifying moments of Candace Wertz's life followed five years of
abuse from the boyfriend suspected of using his car to push hers in
front of a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so horrible that no one was able to get to her in time to
help,'' said Tammy Wertz, Candace Wertz's sister-in-law. ''But
something should have been done about this guy a long time ago. ...
She tried to get away from him and she just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, several sources revealed the contents of Wertz's
frantic 911 call made before she was struck by the train Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Driving her car at high speeds through a residential
neighborhood, Wertz grabbed her cell phone and desperately told a
911 operator to send police because her ex-boyfriend was chasing
her.
</P>
<P>
   With the shrieking of tires coming to a halt in the background,
Wertz told the operator that she had a protective order against the
man pursuing her, but that it had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The roar of three giant crashes then overwhelms Wertz's voice
and she screams something about the window cracking. Finally, the
phone goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her boyfriend was banging into her car as she was talking. It
sounded like he took off her side mirror,'' Eric Olena, assistant
director of the 911 center, said in Saturday's Reading Eagle. ''She
sounded panicky. You could tell it was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertz had stopped at the railroad crossing to let the train pass
and was just blocks away from a police station near Reading, about
50 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   All on board Wertz's car -- her 2-year-old son, John Michael
Cortez; Cynthia Jacques, 22; and Jacques' daughter Allissa, 2 --
were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Angel Diaz Santiago, 22, was arrested Friday and charged
with four counts of murder and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Another dispatcher who heard a tape of the call said Wertz never
gave enough detail for police to locate her.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of the five-minute conversation reveals the two women
in the car were trying to keep their crying children calm. Police
believe the crashes heard on the tape are Santiago pushing Wertz's
car onto the train track. A scream follows, then the phone went
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Myers, 65, who owns a coffee shop in the shopping center
beneath Wertz's apartment, said she felt Wertz had been in mortal
danger for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those things where you wished you had known what
to do, but there weren't any easy answers,'' Myers said.

   It was barbaric, some Americans said Saturday of the forcible
removal of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives. It was the
right thing to do, others said, and the government had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions were polarized even inside Cuban-American communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that this was the land of the free, but apparently
it's not,'' Rosa Grabe de Peralta said in Union City, N.J., which
after Miami has the nation's second-largest Cuban-American
community.
</P>
<P>
   But Roland Rolo, sipping coffee in a Cuban cafe in Union City,
said he understood the government's action ordered by Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a family laughing at the attorney general, and
sooner or later you've got to show them some authority,'' said
Rolo, 44, of Piscataway, N.J. ''The family overestimated their
position of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Cuban-Americans marched in protest outside Cuba's
mission to the United Nations in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kind of storm trooper tactics are the kind of thing
that's done in Cuba,'' said demonstrator Rafael Ocasio, 42, of New
York. ''Clinton is a hypocrite. He says he's upholding the law, but
there is no law in his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic to and from the Lincoln Tunnel connecting New York City
and New Jersey was blocked for 20 minutes as more than 150 people
from Union City marched down a highway a mile away. No one was
arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ashamed to be American today,'' said Joseph Mendez, 30, of
Weehawken, N.J., as he waved Cuban and American flags in the middle
of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For others, it was simply time the standoff came to a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It lasted way too long,'' said Maria Bouchereau, 36, of Los
Angeles. ''I wish the family had cooperated so they wouldn't have
had to go in like that. But I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   After the months-long tug of war between the family and the
federal government, it took officers only minutes to retrieve the
boy from the relatives who cared for him since his rescue at sea
and had defied efforts to have him released to his father, who
wants to take him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is the law. You can't bend it. I'm sorry it had to
come down to something like that but I think he's back where he
belongs, with his father,'' said Ben Merritt, a Milwaukee
bartender.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a case of politics, said Charles Dooley, one of
several veterans at VFW Post 1019, in Albany, N.Y., who said Elian
belongs with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all just because we're against Cuba,'' said Dooley, 58.
''If it was a kid from a country we were friendly with, this would
never be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair to bring up politics at the expense of a
child,'' said Ian Coleman, a student in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Some people saw it in terms of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid should be with his father,'' said Tom McClean, 41, an
electrician in the Chicago suburb of Woodridge. ''The people in
Miami weren't going to give the kid up. I don't think they had a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone talks about Cuba being the evil empire, but how evil
would we be if we kept the boy from his father?'' asked Tim
Quistoroff, 34, a Chicago musician.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why shouldn't the man have his child? There's nothing
abhorrent about a child being with his father,'' said Bob Burman,
an attorney in Columbus, Ohio, who has two children.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents were troubled by photographs showing armed
federal agents taking Elian from the home of his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe what I saw. And they want to take our guns
away from us?'' said Priscilla Talich of Denver, mother of a
9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The show of arms also disturbed others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the government tried hard enough. It could have
been done without guns. To take a child forcibly with guns is
tantamount to kidnapping,'' said Misty Sheehan, 55, of the Chicago
suburb of Glen Ellyn, a college humanities professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he should be with his dad, but it was a hell of a way
to do it. That doesn't look good for us at all,'' said Gerard
Lombardo, a security guard in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was barbaric,'' said John Smith, 60, a personal
injury lawyer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Byrd was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ashamed to be an American,'' said Byrd, 56, of Huntington,
W.Va. ''I feel like taking the American flag and digging a hole and
putting it upside down in the ground.''

<HEADLINE> Earth Day Celebrated With Exhibits  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cindy Bilsky and her family traveled from New
Hampshire to celebrate Earth Day, checking out a varied offering of
politicians, celebrities and environmental lessons on the National
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Her children, 6-year-old Johnny and 4-year-old Alicia, emerged
smiling from a trailer for the Discovery Creek Children's Museum
that housed butterflies, a tarantula and a monkey in a rainforest
exhibit. The trailer reinforced classroom lessons about the perils
of cutting down all the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an interesting way to find out how everything is
produced,'' said Bilsky, of Hudson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary Earth Day celebration on the mall featured
tents from the Capitol to the Washington Monument with exhibits
about fighting pollution and using alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mascots dressed like Smokey Bear, a bald eagle and a giant panda
roamed the mall and posed for pictures. Pamphleteers distributed
literature on subjects ranging from Ralph Nader's presidential
candidacy to repenting before the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities ranging from teen heartthrob Leonardo DeCaprio to
singer David Crosby contributed to the festive nature of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Interest Research Group, which is fighting to hold
sport-utility vehicles to the same air-pollution standards as cars,
set up a large, inflatable SUV with the sign ''Clean Cars Now!''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Jackson carried his 3-year-old daughter Casey in a
shoulder pack to listen to the music and learn about recycling. His
6-year-old son Taylor already knows littering is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I drove here in my SUV -- but I carpooled,'' said
Jackson, of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord Nelson, the former senator from Wisconsin who is
credited with startinging Earth Day in 1970, said elementary
students he speaks to about protecting the environment today ask
better questions than college students a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the United States must lead the world to
reduce pollution and renew resources because this country is the
biggest consumer, the biggest polluter and the most affluent in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't take the lead,'' he asked, ''who will?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani head toward most expensive Senate race ever  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a campaign that's been making history
since Hillary Rodham Clinton announced her candidacy, the first
lady and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are on a pace to shatter
the record for the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history.
</P>
<P>
   California set the bar in 1994 when Diane Feinstein and Michael
Huffington spent $43.3 million; New Yorkers Alfonse D'Amato and
Charles Schumer spent $40.9 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Giuliani have raked in more than $32 million so far,
federal campaign finance records show, and the election is still
seven months away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were saying early on, $50 million, but I think that's going
to be low,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
nonpartisan, Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics that
studies campaigns and their financing.
</P>
<P>
   When soft-money spending by special interest groups and the two
national parties is factored in, the total could easily top $100
million, said Peter Eisner, managing director of the Center for
Public Integrity, another Washington-based watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reports filed this past week show that through
the first quarter of this year, Giuliani had raised $19.3 million
and Clinton had raised $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   About half their funds through the end of last year had come
from outside New York: Giuliani counted itemized donations of $200
or more from every state but North Dakota, and Clinton had them
from 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a national race,'' Makinson declared. ''This is going
to be to the world of the Senate what George W. Bush was to the
world of running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 California race, Republican Huffington spent $29.4
million in losing to incumbent Democrat Feinstein, who spent $13.9
million. Four years later, the New York incumbent, Republican
D'Amato, spent $24.2 million in losing to Schumer, the Democrat,
who spent $16.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the big numbers in the New York Senate race is
apparent, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a double lightning rod race,'' he said. ''Both of the
candidates are capable of stirring strong emotions in people.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been particularly helpful to Giuliani, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the first lady has a broader household
recognition,'' he said. ''There's nobody in the country who doesn't
know who she is and probably there's nobody in the country who
doesn't have strong feelings either for or against her, and I think
that's what Giuliani has tapped into.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, Giuliani spent more than
$3.6 million on direct-mail fund raising, including about $1
million for the services of conservative fund-raising guru Richard
Viguerie.
</P>
<P>
   That was aimed, according to Clinton, at raising money ''from
people who historically give money to Jerry Falwell or Ollie North
or Jesse Helms.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp dismisses that charge by saying Clinton still
wants to blame all her troubles on the ''vast, right-wing
conspiracy'' she said was responsible for her husband's impeachment
woes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani has complained about Clinton's acceptance of
campaign money from rap mogul Sean ''Puffy'' Combs, who is under
indictment on gun and bribery charges in connection with a shooting
at a New York nightclub late last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor's fund-raising success has surprised some, the
Clinton camp publicly maintains it is not worried. On Monday night,
the first lady will join President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore at a Manhattan hotel for a fund-raising event aimed at helping
her and Gore as well as other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt we are going to raise everything that we
need to compete and win,'' said Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson. ''We're going to be right on target.''

Elian Gonzalez and Dad Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- After Elian Gonzalez was seized by
federal agents early this morning and reunited with his father outside the
nation's capital, the boy's Miami relatives arrived in Washington to try to see
the boy. Agents fired pepper spray into an angry crowd as they took away the
screaming 6-year-old boy from the home of his Miami relatives and returned him
to his father at Andrews Air Force base. Though in his father's custody, Elian's
fate still remains unsettled. The courts will ultimately rule on whether the boy
should remain in the United States.

Cubans Celebrate; Protests in Miami

<P>
   CENTRAL AUSTRALIA, Cuba (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of jubilant Cubans
streamed down a muddy road to a historic sugar refinery today to celebrate Elian
Gonzalez' reunion with his father -- a breakthrough in the drama that has
gripped the island for five months. ''Elian, friend! Cuba is with you!'' chanted
an estimated 400,000 people called by Cuba's communist government to gather at
Central Australia. In Miami, riot police with batons and shields beat down
demonstrators who set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches on the streets of
Little Havana today after Elian was snatched away by federal agents. More than
180 people were arrested. As Miami mayors called for calm, an angry crowd tore
down the CNN tent at the house where Elian had lived.

opposition supporters, and the often-violent occupation of white-owned farm by

Kennewick Man DNA Studies To Begin
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A team of scientists will begin long-delayed studies
of the Kennewick Man skeleton this week to help determine whether the
controversial 9,000-year-old bones can be linked through DNA and other clues to
contemporary Indian tribes. The government-appointed team also hopes to learn
whether Kennewick Man was intentionally buried at the site where the bones were
found in the shallows of the Columbia River in 1996. Kennewick Man is one of the
oldest and most complete skeletons found in North America. Radiocarbon-dating of
the bones place their age at between 9,320 and 9,510 years old.

<HEADLINE> Lubavitch Rabbi Run Down in Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAFED, Israel (AP) -- The chief rabbi of the northern town of
Safed, a leading figure in the Lubavitcher branch of Judaism, was
run over Saturday in what police suspect was attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   The police were investigating Meir Baranes as a suspect in the
hit and run attack on Rabbi Levy Bistritzky, whose condition was
described by doctors at Safed's hospital as between moderate and
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the incident on Safed's main street, Baranes
called local reporters and confessed to the crime. He was taken
into police custody a while later.
</P>
<P>
   Baranes was arrested three months ago after punching Bistritzky.
At the time, he said he wanted to hurt Bistritzky because the rabbi
had excommunicated Baranes for claiming that the late leader of the
Lubavitcher movement, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was the
Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Almost six years since Schneerson's death, many in the movement
still cling to the belief that he will return -- despite official
Chabad teaching to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   The prophecy has split a closely knit movement that prefers to
be known for bringing thousands closer to Jewish tradition, not for
naming a Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Baranes was particularly adamant in his belief that Schneerson
was the Messiah, at one time attempting to ''sue'' God in a local
court for keeping the Messiah from the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Baranes is currently facing charges for his alleged
participation in a ceremony which put a death curse on Pope John
Paul II just days before the pontiff made his historic pilgrimage
to the Holy Land in March.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Opposes India's U.N. Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan will oppose its arch-foe
India's bid to win a permanent seat on the United Nations' Security
Council, Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   India doesn't deserve Security Council membership because it has
failed to implement U.N. resolutions on the disputed Kashmir
region, Sattar told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, a former princely state, is divided between Pakistan
and India and has already been the cause of two of the three wars
those countries have fought since they won independence from
Britain in 1947. Both nations claim the region in its entirety. A
third war between them was fought over Bangladesh, then known as
East Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolutions call for a plebiscite among Kashmiris on
which country they wanted to join, something India opposes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, militant Kashmiris have waged a bloody war
against Indian troops in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in
Hindu-dominated India. The militants advocate either merger with
Islamic Pakistan or independence.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the secessionist movement, a
charge Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
   India wants a permanent seat on the powerful body, whose five
permanent and ten non-permanent members turn U.N. policies into
action. Only the permanent members -- the United States, Britain,
France, China and Russia -- have veto power. The 10 non-permanent
members rotate in two-year stints.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats have for years debated expanding the council, but the
idea has been stalled by disputes over how many seats and which
countries to add.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar said the issue needs in-depth discussions since at least
five African, four Latin American and quite a few Asian countries
are bidding for permanent Security Council seats.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Puts Two More on DL  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Already without No. 1 starter Jamie Moyer, the
Seattle Mariners placed No. 2 starter Freddy Garcia on the 15-day
disabled list on Saturday after a rash of injuries sidelined four
Mariners players the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were pretty rapid fire, weren't they?'' manager Lou
Piniella said the day after he lost Garcia, John Mabry, Edgar
Martinez and Mike Cameron in the first three innings of a 10-2
victory over Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a 17-game winner who was runnerup in the AL Rookie of
the Year voting last season, probably has bursitis in his right
leg, a condition he might have aggravated Friday night when he
attempted to cover first in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was taken to a hospital on Saturday to have X-rays to
determine if he had a stress fracture in his right tibia, team
medical director Dr. Larry Pedegana said. If he has a stress
fracture, he will be sidelined 4-6 weeks, Pedegana said.
</P>
<P>
   ''On top of Moyer, you lose Garcia, the top two pitchers in your
rotation,'' Piniella said. ''We're fortunate we have some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, the Mariners placed Mabry, a valuable utility
player who is a left-handed hitter, on the 15-day DL because of a
severe groin pull in his right leg, sustained while attempting to
field a ball in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners recalled right-hander Kevin Hodges from Triple-A
Tacoma to take Garcia's place on the roster. After Seattle's 4-2
victory over Kansas City on Saturday, Piniella said Hodges would
start out in Seattle's bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piniella and pitching coach Bryan Price have not
decided who will start on Wednesday in Garcia's place, Piniella is
expected to bring right-hander Paul Abbott out of the bullpen to be
a starter.
</P>
<P>
   He said right-hander Frankie Rodriguez would remain in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's game, the Mariners brought up utility
infielder Carlos Hernandez from Tacoma to take Mabry's place.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners put Moyer on the 15-day DL with a strained
muscle in the back of his left shoulder on Friday, they brought up
right-hander Brett Tomko from Tacoma to start Saturday's game
against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said Martinez (sore left quadriceps muscle) and Cameron
(bruised left knee) were expected to be able to play in Sunday's
game. Neither were available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen, who began the season as Seattle's starting third
baseman, was scheduled to begin a rehabilitation assignment in
Tacoma on Saturday night. Guillen was placed on the 15-day disabled
list on April 13 with a pulled left hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Giants 8, Diamondbacks 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 452nd home run and tied Carl
Yastrzemski for 21st place on the career list and the San Francisco
Giants beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-6 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit his seventh home run of the season, tied for the NL
lead. Arizona's Steve Finley also hit his seventh homer.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks closer Matt Mantei made his first appearance of the
season, pitching a hitless ninth inning and striking out Bonds. He
had been sidelined by biceps tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (2-1), making his first start in 11 days, allowed
four runs and four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen worked the ninth for his third save. He struck out Luis
Gonzalez, who had homered earlier, with runners on first and second
to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Finley's two-run homer gave the Diamondbacks a 4-3 lead in the
third, but San Francisco rallied in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller singled and later scored on shortstop Hanley Frias'
throwing error. After Russ Davis singled and Rich Aurilia walked to
load the bases, Omar Daal (0-2) walked Doug Mirabelli to force home
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco extended its lead to 8-4 in the seventh on Jeff
Kent's two-run double and a sacrifice fly by Ellis Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn had an RBI double and Lenny Harris had a
run-scoring grounder in the Arizona eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks wasted little time against Rueter as Bell drew
a one-out walk in the first and Gonzalez followed with a home run
to the back of the pool area.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants pulled within 2-1 in the second when Burks doubled
and scored on a single by Aurilia.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds gave San Francisco a 3-2 lead an inning later when he hit
a line drive over the Giants' right-field bullpen. But Finley
answered in the bottom half, homering 20 rows deep into the
right-field stands for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona C Damian Miller left the game in the bottom of the
seventh when he strained his left hamstring while running out a
double. .... Commissioner Bud Selig was in attendance and watched
the end of the Suns-Spurs playoff game on a TV in the stands with
Diamondbacks and Suns general partner Jerry Colangelo. ... The win
assured the Giants of their first series victory against Arizona
since Sept. 14-16, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Mets 7, Cubs 6, 2nd Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no winners when Bobby Valentine and
Don Baylor renewed their feud from Japan to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine and the New York Mets, however, were the only ones on
top when it ended, sweeping Baylor's Chicago Cubs in a doubleheader
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura's solo homer and a two-run single by Rey Ordonez
keyed a five-run sixth inning as the Mets won the nightcap 7-6 for
their sixth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell went 4-for-5 with two RBIs, and Glendon Rusch won his
first game as a starter in two seasons as New York won the opener
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor and Valentine got into a heated discussion when they
exchanged lineup cards before the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's put to rest, I believe,'' Valentine said of his run-in
with Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the two managers started last month in
Japan when Valentine protested the season opener because Jeff
Huson's name wasn't on the lineup card. He eventually dropped the
protest, but Baylor hadn't dropped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that Valentine was a cheater and that there could be
a fight between the two if they met again. He also wouldn't shake
Valentine's hand before the second game in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Baylor said he'd be ''surprised'' if
Valentine took the lineup card out before the game. Valentine said
Friday that was ''a pretty good bet'' because he had never taken
the lineup card out in his first 534 games with New York.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was at home plate before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My players talked me into doing it, because they had read so
much about it in the papers,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   After the umpires went over the ground rules, Valentine and
Baylor started an animated conversation in which Valentine could be
seen saying, ''It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the imposing Baylor took two steps toward
Valentine. The managers then went back to their respective dugouts
without shaking hands. Valentine smirked and shrugged his shoulders
as he walked back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a problem and he
indicated that it wasn't,'' Valentine said. ''It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor had little to say about the meeting. When asked about
Valentine, he shrugged, turned away and said, ''Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither manager brought out the lineups for the second game.
Cubs coach Billy Williams and Mets coach John Stearns handled the
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then broke out to a 2-0 lead in the first on Benny
Agbayani's two-run single. After the Cubs went ahead 3-2 in the top
of the sixth on Jeff Reed's two-run double, the Mets broke the game
open in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura led off against Kyle Farnsworth (1-3) with his fourth
homer to tie the game at 3. Todd Zeile doubled, Agbayani walked and
Kurt Abbott reached on a bunt single.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie then allowed a two-run single to Ordonez, who had
been 0-for-18 with runners in scoring position before getting an
RBI single in the eighth inning of the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora added a sacrifice fly and third baseman Shane
Andrews' throwing error allowed another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook (3-0) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win. Armando
Benitez pitched the ninth for his seventh save, giving up Sammy
Sosa's single and Henry Rodriguez's home run.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (1-1) made sure there wasn't much excitement in the
opener, holding the Cubs to solo homers by Mark Grace and Andrews
in seven innings for his first win as a starter since beating St.
Louis on June 30, 1998, while with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''My confidence is increasing,'' Rusch said. ''I have a great
team behind me and I'm just trying to be aggressive and throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber (1-2) allowed three runs in seven innings to take the
loss.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs have lost six of seven games. ... Chicago's Eric
Young had an odd first game. He was called out in the sixth inning
when he bunted and the ball bounced up and hit him out of the
batter's box. He was hit by a pitch in the eighth but was not
awarded first base because umpire Paul Schrieber ruled Young moved
his elbow into the ball. ... Dennis Springer allowed three runs in
5 1-3 innings for the Mets in the second game. He is believed to be
the only Mets knuckleballer other than Bob Moorhead in 1965. ...
The field was in good shape following more than a day of rain that
caused Friday's game to be postponed, although water came up in the
outfield as players ran after balls.

<HEADLINE> Suns 72, Spurs 70  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns were able to do more with
less than the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that tied an NBA playoff record for fewest points,
Cliff Robinson and Penny Hardaway each scored 17 points and Corie
Blount hit three free throws in the closing seconds as the Suns
opened the first-round series with a 72-70 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 142 points tied the playoff record set by Atlanta and
Detroit on May 12, 1999. Game 2 in the best-of-five series is
Tuesday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a big confidence boost for us, especially the way we
ended the season.'' Robinson said. ''To come in here and beat this
team gives us confidence going into Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get the next one, we can close it out in Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team played at full strength. San Antonio's Tim Duncan,
the MVP of last year's NBA Finals, missed the game because of torn
cartilage in his left knee. Phoenix guard Jason Kidd is still
recovering from a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our offense couldn't get it done on a consistent basis and
that hurt us,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ''The free-throw
situation obviously was not good. If we had taken care of business
at the line, we would have been in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending champion Spurs were 12-for-21 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix led 41-35 at the half, and opened the third quarter with
an 11-6 run to make it 52-41. But the Spurs didn't wilt, going on a
16-4 run that gave them a 57-56 lead with 10:34 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of game we've played against San Antonio all
year,'' Suns coach Scott Skiles said. ''It's an ugly yet exciting
game. We both seem to shoot under 40 percent. We won and I'm happy
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It still wasn't over until Rodney Rogers stole an inbounds pass
with seven-tenths of a second left to kill the Spurs' final chance.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix got the lead for good with 1:24 left on a basket by
Rogers, who scored 15 points. Blount, a 49-percent free-throw
shooter during the regular season, hit two free throws with 48
seconds showing for a 71-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio center David Robinson's 3-point play made it 71-70,
and Blount hit another free throw with one second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was happy to make those free throws,'' Blount said. ''Once
you get in that situation you want to come through. Once you sit on
the bench, you see what needs to be done when you get into the
game. When you get the call, you'd better be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott led San Antonio with 15 points and Samaki Walker
had 13 points and 16 rebounds. Robinson was 3-for-12 from the field
and finished with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did a great job. They double-teamed me,'' David Robinson
said. ''We have to make adjustments. We need guys to step up. We
need to find a better way to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing most of the first half, the Suns went on a 20-9
run over the final seven minutes of the second quarter for a 41-35
lead at the half after both teams got off to cold shooting starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs hit only two of their first 14 shots, and Phoenix
opened 3-for-14.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson was called for two fouls in the first seven
minutes of the game and the Spurs had to rely on Walker, who had
nine rebounds and seven points in the first quarter. Walker
averaged 3.8 rebounds in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway had eight points in the Suns' second quarter charge to
their halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Spurs forward Jerome Kersey is making his 15th playoff
appearance, tied for second for most appearances among active
players. Only Utah's John Stockton (16) has reached more playoffs.
... The Suns are 10-9 in first-round series and have lost in the
first round the last four seasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Alexander Cohen, a Broadway producer for nearly
60 years and the man who brought the Tony Awards to national
television, died Saturday of complications from emphysema. He was
79.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful, prolific showman, who was never shy of voicing his
opinions, Cohen was a product of the golden age of Broadway when
one man could put on a play or musical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Angel Street,'' Cohen's first production, was one of his
biggest hits, opening in 1941 and running 1,295 performances.
Patrick Hamilton's Victorian thriller, which starred Vincent Price,
was later made into the movie ''Gaslight,'' with Charles Boyer and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   His last show, ''Waiting in the Wings,'' a Noel Coward comedy
starring Lauren Bacall and Rosemary Harris, currently is playing at
Broadway's Eugene O'Neill Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Cohen produced scores of shows including the
legendary 1964 Richard Burton ''Hamlet,'' directed by John Gielgud;
''The Homecoming'' by Harold Pinter; David Storey's ''Home,''
starring Gielgud and Ralph Richardson and Peter Shaffer's ''Black
Comedy'' with Geraldine Page, Michael Crawford and Lynn Redgrave.
Phebe Jacobsen
</P>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Phebe Robinson Jacobsen, an archivist who
helped ''Roots'' author Alex Haley determine that his ancestor
Kunta Kinte landed here, died Wednesday of complications from
diabetes. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen and Haley began corresponding in 1967, after he asked
her for help with his genealogical research.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jacobsen who dug up a Maryland Gazette advertisement from
1767 at the Maryland State Archives. The ad announced the arrival
of the Lord Ligonier in Annapolis on Sept. 29, 1767. The ship
carried ''a Cargo of Choice, Healthy Slaves,'' the ad said. Among
them was Kunta Kinte, the inspiration for Haley's Pulitzer
Prize-winning 1976 historical novel, which traced 10 generations of
his family from Gambia to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Through the course of research for the book, Jacobsen and Haley
became close friends, said Chris Haley, associate director of
research services at the archives and the late author's nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ''She would help give a sense of what life for
African-Americans, free or enslaved, was like during Colonial times
in Maryland,'' he said. ''It just happened that my uncle was
someone who hit big with the story that he was researching, but she
would help anyone who asked a question.''
George Moore
</P>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- George Moore, a former leading U.S. banker
and head of the Metropolitan Opera, died Friday at his home in
southern Spain. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Born April 1, 1905 in Hannibal ,Mo., he started work as a youth
selling honey and as a delivery boy for a delicatessen. After
studying at Yale, he jointed the Farmers Loan and Trust Company,
which later merged with First National City Bank of New York, which
became Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Moore rose to run the bank's domestic division and later its
overseas operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He retired
from the bank in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he became president of the Metropolitan Opera
Association and is attributed with having whipped it into shape
financially.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, Angels 9, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Bubba Trammell hit a two-run homer
off Kent Mercker with two outs in the 10th inning Saturday, giving
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays an 11-9 win over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays set a team record with five home runs. Fred
McGriff connected twice and drove in five runs and Jose Canseco hit
a 472-foot shot, the longest in Tropicana Field history.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell hit his second pinch-hit home run of the season as
Tampa Bay won for just the second time in eight home games.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker (0-1) gave up a leadoff single to McGriff in the 10th
and retired the next two batters. Trammell hit a 3-2 pitch into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (1-0) pitched a perfect 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim tied the game at 9 in the ninth on RBI singles by Mo
Vaughn and Orl Palmeiro off Roberto Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who gave up three homers Friday night, began the
ninth by walking Adam Kennedy on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy stole second, Vaughn drove in his third run of the
game. Tim Salmon and Garrett Anderson flied out, but a throwing
error by third baseman Vinny Castilla on Troy Glaus' grounder
brought up Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's three-run homer tied it at 6 in the fifth inning. The
drive to center field hit a catwalk approximately 105 feet above
the field.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff put Tampa Bay ahead 9-6 with a three-run homer off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa with two outs in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff also hit a two-run shot in the fourth, snapping his
home-run drought that dated back to opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez also homered for the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who finished 2-for-4 with a sacrifice fly, has driven in
25 runs -- including five in two games this season -- against Tampa
Bay the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who had gone 51 at-bats without a homer, hit a 414-foot
shot in the fourth. It was his first extra-base hit since the
second game of the season April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had a two-run double and Vaughn hit an RBI single as the
Angels took a 3-1 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went up 6-3 and chased Esteban Yan during a three-run
fifth. Benji Gil scored from third when shortstop Kevin Stocker
misplayed a throw at second base on Darin Erstad's stolen base.
Vaughn had sacrifice fly and Glaus added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' hit extended his career-high hitting streak to nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit a first-inning solo homer for Tampa Bay. It was his
first homer since last July 4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Five of the 19 fair balls striking the overhanging
structures at Tropicana Field have occurred in eight games this
season. ... The three homers Hernandez allowed in the ninth inning
Friday matched the total he had given up in his previous 485
batters going back to July 4, 1998. ... Tampa Bay had been
outhomered 20-5 at home this season before breaking loose.

Elian Gonzalez and Dad Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was back in his father's
arms today after federal agents used battering rams and pepper spray to hustle
him from Miami and the relatives fighting to block his return to Cuba. The boy's
Miami relatives arrived in Washington to try and see the boy. Crying with
fright, the 6-year-old Cuban boy was taken before dawn and flown to Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington, where he was in seclusion with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother. Though in his father's custody, Elian's fate
still remains unsettled. The courts will ultimately rule on whether the boy
should remain in the United States.
</P>

Protests in Miami; Cubans Celebrate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Riot police with batons and shields beat down demonstrators who
set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches on the streets of Little Havana today
after Elian Gonzalez was snatched away by federal agents. More than 180 people
were arrested. The unrest continued for hours after the pre-dawn raid on Lazaro
Gonzalez's house. As Miami mayors called for calm, an angry crowd tore down the
CNN tent at the house where Elian had lived. In Cuba, Elian's Cuban relatives
joined hundreds of thousands streamed down a muddy road to a historic sugar
refinery to celebrate the boy's reunion with his father. ''Elian, friend! Cuba
is with you!'' chanted an estimated 400,000 people called by Cuba's communist
government to gather at Central Australia.

U.S.: No Choice but Force in Miami
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the harrowing photo of a federal agent with a gun
seizing Elian Gonzalez, the Clinton administration defended its use of force
today to take the Cuban boy from the home of his Miami relatives. The boy's
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, described a chaotic scene with agents yelling:
''Give me the boy or we're going to shoot.'' ''The law has been upheld, and that
was the right thing to do,'' President Clinton said. Elian's removal from Lazaro
Gonzalez's bedroom was captured in an Associated Press photo shown around the
world. It showed a federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles
with an automatic rifle confronting a man holding the frightened 6-year-old boy
in a closet.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A simulation of the deadly 1993 Branch Davidian siege
showed that flashes caught on videotape were most likely sunlight reflecting off
debris, a preliminary report found, not government gunfire as claimed in a
wrongful death lawsuit. Vector Data Systems, the British firm that conducted the
March 19 simulation at an Army base in Texas, submitted its report earlier this
month to U.S. District Judge Walter Smith Jr., who is presiding over the Branch
Davidian lawsuit, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported today, citing

Explosion Rocks Zimbabwe Newspaper
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An explosion shook the offices of Zimbabwe's only
independent newspaper Saturday in a suspected bomb attack. Zimbabwe has been
roiled in recent months by political violence, particularly attacks on
opposition supporters, and the often-violent occupation of white-owned farm by
black squatters. The explosion, near the staff entrance to the building housing
The Daily News, caused little damage but shattered the windows of a neighboring
sculpture gallery. The building was empty, since the newspaper does not print on
weekends.

Kennewick Man DNA Studies To Begin
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A team of scientists will begin long-delayed studies
of the Kennewick Man skeleton this week to help determine whether the
controversial 9,000-year-old bones can be linked through DNA and other clues to
contemporary Indian tribes. The government-appointed team also hopes to learn
whether Kennewick Man was intentionally buried at the site where the bones were
found in the shallows of the Columbia River in 1996. Kennewick Man is one of the
oldest and most complete skeletons found in North America. Radiocarbon-dating of
the bones place their age at between 9,320 and 9,510 years old.

   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers have arrested a Bosnian Serb
detention camp commander more than five years after the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal accused him of rape and torture. Dragan Nikolic, 42, had been the first

<HEADLINE> Town Struggles With Pilgrims' Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMAYO, N.M. (AP) -- During Christianity's holiest week, this
small rural community is struggling to come to grips with the
deaths of two teen-agers killed while making a traditional Easter
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Martinez and high school sweetheart Karen Castanon were
among thousands of pilgrims making the spiritual trek to the
Santuario de Chimayo when they were shot to death. They were both
17.
</P>
<P>
   The killer ''needs to know that they were doing God's will,''
said Lynette Duran, a classmate and friend of Karen. ''I hope he
can find compassion and give himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's body was found before dawn on a highway about 30
miles north of Santa Fe. Hours later, Castanon's body was found
nearby in a remote, hilly area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's a terrible thing, the way it happened,'' said
Clotilde Castanon, Karen's grandmother. ''They were wonderful kids.
We loved her very much. Why did it have to be them?''
</P>
<P>
   Other pilgrims are being asked to come forward with any
information they may have about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are some of the pilgrim walkers out there who
may have information about any vehicle or suspicious people in the
area, but they haven't come forward,'' state police Sgt. Royleen
Ross-Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, investigators continued combing the crime scenes,
looking for evidence and suspects. About 15 miles away, an
entourage of pilgrims of all ages flowed into the Santuario, a
small Roman Catholic church believed to contain healing dirt.
</P>
<P>
   An ensemble of brightly adorned and feathered musicians replete
with conch shells, drums and flutes, danced and chanted around a
church altar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prayed to the children that God called home,'' said Lorraine
Urioste of Santa Fe. ''It's a tragedy for two young people to lose
their lives like that ... coming to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims make the journey, many
of them hoping for miracles from dirt found in a hole in the
church. Last year, an estimated 65,000 people visited the church
during Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the slain boy's home in the tiny community of La
Villita, along the Rio Grande northwest of Chimayo, his parents sat
weeping in their son's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son was perfect. He didn't have any enemies. He was the
light of our life,'' said Gerri Martinez, the boy's mother. ''My
baby didn't deserve this.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 16, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Two games, 25 runs. The Los Angeles Dodgers
are onto something here.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth opened the game with a homer, starting a
four-homer barrage that swept the Dodgers over the Cincinnati Reds
16-2 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster, Eric Karros and Gary Sheffield also homered as the
Dodgers put up their highest run total since a 17-11 victory at
Colorado on May 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun to be on a team when you have a lineup like we have,
that has the balance up and down the lineup that we have,'' said
Sheffield, who has homered in five of his last seven games while
hitting .382.
</P>
<P>
   The only folks not having fun were wearing red. The Reds'
pitching staff has given up 25 runs, 26 hits and six homers in the
first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the season, the Reds knew they'd score a lot of
runs. The question was how many their pitching staff would give up.
</P>
<P>
   The answer so far: way too many.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've said many times that we need our starters to take us
deeper and it didn't happen again,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ''We
can't keep using our bullpen like that day after day. But it's
early. We've been in worse shape than this. We just ran into a hot
club and our pitching went south.''
</P>
<P>
   One drive after another went out. Pete Harnisch (0-2) gave up
nine runs for only the second time in his career and three homers
for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, the Reds' top winner the last two years, missed his
last start with tightness in his forearm. His return to the mound
was disheartening -- three homers, one triple, three doubles, a
single and five walks in 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander said his forearm felt fine, but he couldn't
control his fastball. A precautionary magnetic resonance imaging
test performed a few hours after the game was normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating,'' said Harnisch, whose ERA rose to 9.64. ''I
don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster put the finishing touches on a 9-2 win Friday night by
hitting a grand slam in the ninth off Norm Charlton. On his first
swing Saturday, he hit a two-run homer off Harnisch for a 4-1 lead
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karros added a three-run shot off Harnisch and Sheffield hit a
two-run homer, his seventh, off Manny Aybar in the sixth for an
11-1 lead. The Dodgers added five runs in the ninth off Charlton.
</P>
<P>
   In his two appearances since rejoining the Reds, the former
''Nasty Boy'' has given up nine runs, six hits and six walks in
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park (3-1) gave up only one hit in five innings --
Michael Tucker's solo homer in the first -- before leaving with a
blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand. Manager Davey
Johnson thinks he'll have to miss a start because of the blister.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about the size of a dime,'' he said. ''It was very
painful. We were fortunate he finished the fifth. They drained the
blister and took some skin off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati played its first game without shortstop Barry Larkin,
who tore tissue in the middle finger of his glove hand Friday night
and had surgery. Gookie Dawkins was called up from Double-A and
started at shortstop, going 0-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., playing with a tender back, went 0-for-3 and
came out when the Reds made several substitutions after the sixth
inning. After one awkward swing in the third inning, a trainer came
out to check on him.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Since hitting three homers in San Francisco on April 11,
Elster has gone 8-for-26 (.308) with five homers and 10 RBIs. ...
Alan Mills pitched the last four innings for his first save and got
a bases-loaded walk in the ninth for his first major league RBI.
... Park was 0-for-11 this season before hitting an RBI double off
Harnisch in the fifth. ... The Reds hadn't given up 16 runs since a
16-3 loss in San Francisco on June 1, 1998.. ... Larkin will wear a
brace on his left hand for 10 days and can start gripping objects
again in two weeks. ... Harnisch also gave up nine runs for the
Mets in Philadelphia on May 20, 1995. He last allowed three homers
in San Diego on April 1, 1997. ... The umpires had their equipment
back Saturday. It was mistakenly sent to New York on Friday,
forcing a delay in the series opener while new equipment was
bought.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The following story is based on accounts from
Associated Press reporters on the scene, a free-lance photographer
on assignment for the AP who was inside the house, and interviews
with witnesses and officials.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The white minivans hurtled from the darkness and
screeched to a halt, and out jumped the very people Little Havana
had been bracing for. Government agents had arrived, and they had
come for Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   When the Justice Department moved, it moved powerfully. And when
things finally happened Saturday morning, they happened fast.
</P>
<P>
   Battering ram to the front door. Agents pouring inside. Elian
cowering in a closet. An officer in riot gear pointing a gun and
barking orders. The child, crying and stunned, carried off to a
waiting van. Pepper spray on a tense crowd. From Elian: ''Que esta
pasando?'' -- ''What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, the five-month standoff between the
government and Elian's Miami relatives was over. And Elian was
speeding toward a reunion with his father, driven off into the
night by a federal agent wearing a dark mask.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, he left chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the modest stucco house, an anguished family tried to
cope. Outside, a stunned, enraged crowd -- growing quickly as word
spread and supporters poured into Miami's streets -- denounced the
American government as anger spilled over.
</P>
<P>
   Many demanded answers. Few had any. But as dawn broke, everyone
knew one thing: One hundred and fifty days after he was rescued
from the sea that took his mother, Elian Gonzalez was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Saturday outside Lazaro Gonzalez's house began, like so many
others in recent weeks, with demonstrators outside the house
keeping a prayerful all-night vigil, ready to form a human chain in
case the government showed up.
</P>
<P>
   But no one expected it to happen on the day between Good Friday
and Easter, two of Christianity's holiest holidays.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2 a.m., Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's 21-year-old
cousin and a mother figure to the boy, sat outside a neighbor's
house talking with a group of people. Lazaro, the child's
great-uncle, paced the yard looking somber.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, 450 strong just after midnight, dwindled through the
night as it often does, but more people remained than usual. By 5
a.m., minutes before the raid, about 100 people were outside the
house. The older ones sat in folding chairs; the younger people
stood in clusters and talked.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ordonez, 24, an electrician who has kept vigil nearly
every day for a month, said more people stayed through the night
because they were anticipating a deal. ''We're just waiting it out
to see what happens and see if they're going to come and take this
child away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Olga Hernandez, 45, a Miami secretary: ''I hope Mrs. Reno
changes her mind, and she doesn't use any force.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, and in Washington, negotiations extended into
the night. Phones and faxes buzzed with activity as offers and
counteroffers flew between the government and family attorney
Kendall Coffey. Two of Miami's wealthy Cuban-American power brokers
were helping him out.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Chief of Staff John Podesta called President
Clinton at 2:15 a.m. to update him on negotiations. Clinton agreed
the talks should continue -- as long as progress was being made.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 5 a.m., Podesta told the president that negotiations
had stalled and Reno was beginning to mobilize an operation. Reno,
meanwhile, was telling both sides that the moment of decision had
arrived. She ordered the operation to begin. ''Time,'' she would
say later, ''had run out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Miami Police Chief William O'Brian, whom the government was
relying on to keep the peace outside, got his call: The raid, he
was told, was an ''absolute go.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Gonzalez home, under mild, clear skies, nothing
apparent was amiss. Some attorneys and mediators had gone down the
street to get coffee. The crowd was quiet. The legions of reporters
were eating Cuban crackers that someone had just distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, a shout came from the crowd: ''They're here!''
</P>
<P>
   A white van careened into the media area, knocking over a
microphone stand and nearly hitting a man, who jumped out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   They rushed from their vans -- 151 of them, some with goggles and
bulletproof vests: 131 Immigration and Naturalization Service
agents backed by 20 U.S. marshals.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol officials wore dark green; the INS wore INS
T-shirts. They darted in, past the crowd, past the American flag,
past the large crucifix, past the sign that said ''Keep Elian
Free.''
</P>
<P>
   They knocked. They identified themselves both in English and
Spanish. ''Open up! Open up!'' they yelled. After 20 seconds, they
brought up the battering ram and -- pop! pop! pop! -- knocked down
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Other agents, carrying weapons and pepper spray, ran toward the
crowd and sprayed. Still others ordered the media to stay where it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, still stunned, were just realizing what was
happening. Some tried to form the human chain -- to keep Elian in,
not keep agents out. Others, knocked over, accused federal agents
of assaulting them. ''This is going to get bad now,'' one man
yelled.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Podhurst, a mediator between Reno and the Miami relatives,
was on the phone with family attorney Manny Diaz inside the house
when the raid began. ''The phone went click,'' he said. ''The
marshals were coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, as the agents swarmed, the family scrambled. Elian, in
Lazaro's room, screamed, waking up Donato Dalrymple, the fisherman
who rescued him from the ocean on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Que esta pasando?'' Elian yelled. ''What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple scooped up Elian and retreated into a closet. ''Que
esta pasando?'' Elian asked again. Agents banged on the bedroom
door and entered. One Border Patrol agent, wearing goggles and a
helmet, raised a rifle toward the two. His finger was not on the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple raised his elbow in defense. The agent grabbed Elian
and took him. ''Bingo! Bingo!'' yelled another agent, signaling the
mission's success.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, the family's advisers sat stunned. Across
the room, an enraged Lazaro Gonzalez, crying, was restrained by
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   A federal agent -- a woman -- ran out the front door encircled by
other agents. In her arms she cradled Elian, wrapped in a blanket,
wearing a white T-shirt and plaid shorts and looking bewildered.
She spoke to him in Spanish, telling him he was going to see his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Then she lifted him gently into the minivan as agents sprayed
the crowd again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go! Go! Go!'' one agent yelled, and the van, driven by another
agent in a dark mask, sped backward down the street and off into
the night. The others followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez house was a mess. The front door had an ugly gash
from the battering ram, and a bedroom door was torn jaggedly in
half. In the corner of the bedroom, a framed picture of Christ sat
splayed in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was gone.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5:18 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Outside, amid the din, some demonstrators hurdled barricades.
Several tried to re-establish the human chain, but it was too late.
Some started throwing rocks and full plastic water bottles. Men and
women alike threw themselves on the ground and cried.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Marisleysis Gonzalez emerged from the house and
yelled, denouncing the government. ''This lady to me doesn't have a
heart,'' she said of Reno. Later, on live TV, she waved around a
helmet left behind by an agent.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m., Clinton received a phone call telling him the raid
had succeeded. Just before 6, he called Reno to thank her. ''There
was no alternative,'' Clinton said later. ''The law has been
upheld, and that was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his convoy sped toward Watson Island, where he boarded
a helicopter bound for Florida's Homestead Air Force Base. There,
he was examined by a doctor and put on a U.S. marshal's plane bound
for Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Little Havana, meanwhile, was beginning to erupt. Protesters
swarmed the streets. By midmorning, police in riot gear were firing
tear gas as they struggled to contain the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton, coward, Miami is on fire!'' demonstrators chanted
after igniting a pile of tires, garbage and plastic trash cans at
an intersection five blocks from the Gonzalez house.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, on national television before most Americans awoke, called
the raid successful. A Miami native, she lamented that the problem
could not be solved within her hometown but made no apologies.
''Elian Gonzalez is a child who needs to be cherished,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred miles north, Elian's plane landed at 9:42 a.m. His
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are together,'' announced Myron Marlin, a Justice
Department spokesman. Hours later, the father's lawyer, Gregory
Craig, released a photograph showing Elian with his father at
Andrews, where they will stay for several days. They are posing
with Juan Miguel's new wife and infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Both Elian and his father are grinning broadly.
</P>
<P>
   After five months, the little boy at sea, whose saga reached the
highest levels of the American government, is back with his father.
His Miami relatives flew to Washington -- to make sure the boy is
safe and figure out what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   And in Little Havana, thousands of angry supporters -- many of
them on the streets -- are wondering just how a country they viewed
as a promised land could forsake them so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pulled this little boy from the ocean. And now I brought him
to this country of America, this free country, and he's been taken
with guns,'' said Dalrymple, the fisherman who saved Elian and
surrendered him Saturday morning. ''What has happened in America?''

<HEADLINE> Coach Never Heard Knight Use Slur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers coach Randy Wittman
released a statement saying he never heard Indiana University coach
Bob Knight use a racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   Wittman has become involved in the controversy over the new book
by former Indiana teammate Butch Carter, now the coach of the
Toronto Raptors. In the book, ''Born to Believe,'' Carter claims
Knight used a racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday by the Cavs, Wittman said, ''In the
five years I was at Indiana, I never heard coach Knight use the
word he is being accused of using. Never. And because of that, none
of the other accusations or issues related to me are credible.
</P>
<P>
   ''My reputation stands for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight is under investigation by university officials for
actions that include physically abusing players.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's allegation has been denied by several former players,
including Wittman, who was singled out in a book excerpt that
appeared in newspapers in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpt, Carter said Wittman got upset with him a couple
of years ago at a restaurant because Wittman heard Carter had been
saying Knight is racist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked Randy, 'You sat there in the locker room and heard the
same thing I did. What part of it did you not understand?' Even if
he didn't think the comment was racist, and Knight was just having
a bad day?
</P>
<P>
   ''How did I end up getting the blame for what Knight said? I
left there thinking that here's this guy coaching in the NBA and
how is he ever going to be fair to his black players if he takes
that stand on that statement? He did it because of intimidation and
widespread acceptance of Knight's behavior.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Kin Try To See Elian, Dad  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez followed him
to Washington on Saturday, hoping for a family reunion and to keep
the 6-year-old boy from going back to Cuba. They were turned away
from the air base gate behind which Elian was reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The group attempted to hold a news conference outside Andrews
Air Force, but gave up amid a crush of protesters and news media,
saying only that they would make another attempt to see Elian and
his Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This family is distraught, and you're not helping matters
any,'' Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., shouted to the protesters, reporters
and camera crews. ''If you care about them, just please respect
them now.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives arrived at Reagan National Airport a few hours
after Juan Miguel Gonzalez was reunited with his son under tight
security at Andrews. The boy had been flown from Miami directly to
the air base after being seized from the Miami family by
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   The group included Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared for the boy in
his house for the five months since Elian's rescue at sea; the
cousin who said she was closest to the boy, Marisleysis Gonzalez,
and the fisherman who rescued him, Donato Dalrymple,
</P>
<P>
   They went to the Capitol Hill office of Smith, who accompanied
them to the air base gate. Their five-vehicle motorcade was turned
away, to the protests of a crowd of supporters who had gathered
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them in! Let them in!'' the crowd shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was not barred from the base personally as a
senator but was barred as part of a group. He said they were not
necessarily asking to meet with Elian and his father Saturday
night, but wanted to be on the base in a place ''where we could sit
down and gather ourselves together'' and possibly get a time for a
family meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Smith described his meeting with the family as an
emotional moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're beside themselves with grief ... I never thought I'd
see this in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart indicated the group likely
would not succeed in any effort to see President Clinton, who left
Saturday for the Camp David retreat. ''The president believes the
appropriate place in our government for them to go is the Justice
Department of the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the crowd outside the air base backed the Miami
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear ... that the majority of the people support the
reunion of the boy with his father,'' said Sarah Manning of
Baltimore, who held up a sign saying ''Congratulations,'' aimed at
Elian and his father.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 11, Angels 9, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Bubba Trammell hit a two-run homer
off Kent Mercker with two outs in the 10th inning Saturday, giving
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays an 11-9 win over the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays set a team record with five home runs. Fred
McGriff connected twice and drove in five runs and Jose Canseco hit
a 472-foot shot, the longest in Tropicana Field history.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell hit his second pinch-hit home run of the season as
Tampa Bay won for just the second time in eight home games.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker (0-1) gave up a leadoff single to McGriff in the 10th
and retired the next two batters. Trammell hit a 3-2 pitch into the
left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (1-0) pitched a perfect 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim tied the game at 9 in the ninth on RBI singles by Mo
Vaughn and Orl Palmeiro off Roberto Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who gave up three homers Friday night, began the
ninth by walking Adam Kennedy on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy stole second, Vaughn drove in his third run of the
game. Tim Salmon and Garrett Anderson flied out, but a throwing
error by third baseman Vinny Castilla on Troy Glaus' grounder
brought up Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco's three-run homer tied it at 6 in the fifth inning. The
drive to center field hit a catwalk approximately 105 feet above
the field.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff put Tampa Bay ahead 9-6 with a three-run homer off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa with two outs in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff also hit a two-run shot in the fourth, snapping his
home-run drought that dated back to opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez also homered for the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who finished 2-for-4 with a sacrifice fly, has driven in
25 runs -- including five in two games this season -- against Tampa
Bay the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who had gone 51 at-bats without a homer, hit a 414-foot
shot in the fourth. It was his first extra-base hit since the
second game of the season April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had a two-run double and Vaughn hit an RBI single as the
Angels took a 3-1 lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim went up 6-3 and chased Esteban Yan during a three-run
fifth. Benji Gil scored from third when shortstop Kevin Stocker
misplayed a throw at second base on Darin Erstad's stolen base.
Vaughn had sacrifice fly and Glaus added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' hit extended his career-high hitting streak to nine
games.
</P>
<P>

first homer since last July 4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Five of the 19 fair balls striking the overhanging
structures at Tropicana Field have occurred in eight games this
season. ... The three homers Hernandez allowed in the ninth inning
Friday matched the total he had given up in his previous 485
batters going back to July 4, 1998. ... Tampa Bay had been
outhomered 20-5 at home this season before breaking loose.

<HEADLINE> Honolulu Newspaper Up for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The Honolulu Star-Bulletin is being put up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Newspapers, the owner of the afternoon newspaper,
announced Saturday that it has agreed to offer it for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement approved by U.S. District Court Judge Alan Kay was
reached in negotiations to settle lawsuits filed by the state and a
citizens group against Liberty and Gannett Pacific Corp., owner of
the morning Honolulu Advertiser. The lawsuits will remain in effect
until the newspaper is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale of the Star-Bulletin in completed, Liberty and
Gannett will conclude their business relationship, and the pending
lawsuits will be dismissed, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   If the newspaper doesn't sell, all parties retain their rights
to continue litigating, according to Star-Bulletin managing
director David Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   A stipulation filed in federal court provides for sale of the
daily's assets to a new owner that would publish it apart from the
Honolulu Advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer will be required to continue publishing the
Star-Bulletin. A proposed sale price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Bulletin, which shares office space with the Advertiser
in a Gannett-owned building, would have to find new quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner also would have to set up separate circulation,
advertising, accounting and other operational functions.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the two newspapers entered an agreement last September
to end their joint operating agreement on Oct. 30 and close the
Star-Bulletin. The plan was for Gannett to pay Liberty $26.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Kay issued a preliminary injunction to stop the closure after
the lawsuits were filed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An upper-deck shot by Mark McGwire in the first
inning Saturday night gave the St. Louis Cardinals 41 homers in
April, tying an NL record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his fourth home run, and first since April 10, off
Colorado's Masato Yoshii. The two-run drive landed just inside the
foul pole in left field and was estimated at 446 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tied the NL record set by the Atlanta Braves in
April 1998. The major league mark is 49 by Cleveland in 1997.
</P>

Elian Gonzalez and Dad Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Crying with fright, 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was taken away by federal agents this morning from Miami and flown to
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, where he was reunited with his
father. The boy's Miami relatives, who had been fighting to block his return to
Cuba, arrived in Washington to try and see the boy. Elian was in seclusion at
the base with his father, stepmother and baby half-brother. Though in his
father's custody, Elian's fate still remains unsettled. The courts will
ultimately rule on whether the boy should remain in the United States.

Protests in Miami; Cubans Celebrate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- More than 180 people were arrested as unrest continued for
hours on the streets of Little Havana today after Elian Gonzalez was snatched
away by federal agents. Riot police with batons and shields beat down
demonstrators who set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches. As Miami mayors
called for calm, an angry crowd tore down the CNN tent at the house where Elian
had lived. In Cuba, Elian's Cuban relatives joined hundreds of thousands who
streamed down a muddy road to a historic sugar refinery to celebrate the boy's
reunion with his father. ''Elian, friend! Cuba is with you!'' chanted an
estimated 400,000 people called by Cuba's communist government to gather at
Central Australia.

U.S.: No Choice but Force in Miami
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the harrowing photo of a federal agent with a gun
seizing Elian Gonzalez, the Clinton administration defended its use of force
today to take the Cuban boy from the home of his Miami relatives. The boy's
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, described a chaotic scene with agents yelling:
''Give me the boy or we're going to shoot.'' ''The law has been upheld, and that
was the right thing to do,'' President Clinton said. Elian's removal from Lazaro
Gonzalez's bedroom was captured in an Associated Press photo shown around the
world. It showed a federal agent wearing green riot gear, a helmet and goggles
with an automatic rifle confronting a man holding the frightened 6-year-old boy
in a closet.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Accused of mishandling claims from the 1994

to the state Insurance Department's headquarters. They were ushered into an
office one by one and offered a choice: Donate to a new fund set up by the
department or face billions of dollars' worth of penalties. Ultimately, the
insurers decided to avoid the penalties and gave the fund a total of $11.6

Explosion Rocks Zimbabwe Newspaper

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An explosion shook the offices of Zimbabwe's only

roiled in recent months by political violence, particularly attacks on
opposition supporters, and the often-violent occupation of white-owned farm by
black squatters. The explosion, near the staff entrance to the building housing
The Daily News, caused little damage but shattered the windows of a neighboring

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- When astronauts float into the international

because the Russian side of the Russian space station is still too noisy because
of acoustic design. In addition to the racket 225 miles up, the air is stale and
the ventilation bad -- bad enough to sicken the last astronauts who visited the
space station, last spring. So this next crew will tote small, personal fans and
carbon-dioxide monitors. Six Americans and one Russian are scheduled to lift off

<HEADLINE> Brazil 500th Anniversary Protested  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil (AP) -- Celebrations marking Brazil's 500th
anniversary were tempered by violence Saturday as police clashed
with thousands of Indians and their supporters protesting what they
called Portugal's invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Police used clubs and tear gas to break up the protests, and
there were unofficial reports that 15 Indians were injured. More
than 140 people were detained and could be charged with disturbing
public order, said Gustavo Rios, the local public security chief.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to march in peace,'' said Nailton Pataxo, a
demonstration leader. ''It is the government that is meeting us
with violence. This is the true face of Brazil, 500 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge traffic jams formed as thousands of police with metal
detectors blocked access roads and searched people trying to reach
the seaside resort of Porto Seguro, where Portuguese navigator
Pedro Alvares Cabral first made landfall on April 22, 1500. He is
believed to be the first European to land in the South American
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who stayed on a nearby
island overnight for security reasons, cut short his official
program because of the protests. At a lunch with Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio, Cardoso tried to appease the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Brazil today we have a sharp awareness of the social wounds
that are part of our heritage of these 500 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sampaio also spoke at the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no longer room for resentments over the historical
past, which had moments of greatness and misery, freedom and
subjugation,'' he said. ''We are all responsible for the time we
were given to live. We inherited the past, and it is our duty to
understand it, to transform the present and not reject it with
belated guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   About 330,000 Indians survive today in Brazil, compared with as
many as 5 million when Cabral landed.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted police fired tear gas to break up a crowd of about 2,000
Indians from all over Brazil who marched from the nearby Coroa
Vermelha reservation to join the protest. In feather headdresses
and red-and-black body paint, many Indians carried spears and
banners in Portuguese reading: ''500 years of resistance'' and
''Who said Brazil was discovered?''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters from black rights, student and labor
groups tried to join the Indians but were gassed and pushed back by
police. Some were clubbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They won't allow any demonstration that disfigures the
celebration,'' said Raimundo Bujao of the black rights group
Quilombo Niger Okan. ''This is Brazil for all the world to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberio Nunes of the federal district attorney's office said the
police had shown ''a clear violation of human rights. People have
the right to protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Estado news agency Saturday evening reported that a local judge
had ordered the arrest of a police commander identified only as
Muller, who is said to have led the police action against
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were unable to locate Muller to make the arrest,
Estado said. No more information was available.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 miles west of Porto Seguro, thousands of landless
workers camped by a roadside, saying they would not join the
marches because of the police blockade and would protest there.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso was to attend a folkloric dance and greet a fleet of
wooden ships, including replicas of Portuguese caravels that set
sail from Portugal on March 9 to retrace Cabral's route. He was
also scheduled to inaugurate the Discovery Museum near the
reservation and attend an orchestra concert in the evening, but the
foreign ministry said he would probably cancel because of the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Across Brazil, many cities staged massive open-air concerts. In
Brasilia, Brazilian pop star Roberto Carlos commanded the show.
</P>
<P>
   In Portugal, flags from both countries were hoisted to mark the
date but otherwise there were few celebrations marking Cabral's
arrival in Brazil. Leading daily newspapers ran front-page photos
of Brazilian Indians, and radio and television stations broadcast
long features on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian culture is important in Portugal, where soap operas,
soccer players, musicians and food from the South American nation
are wildly popular.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protest on Easter Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Dozens of protesters plan to march
through a small U.S. Navy base on the Puerto Rican island of
Vieques on Easter Sunday to urge an end to training missions on the
bombing range there.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people have set up a temporary camp on a remote
beach behind the base within the Navy's restricted area, said Nilda
Medina, a spokeswoman for the protesters. Some activists were
arrested in the same area during a 1979 anti-Navy protest.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters plan to leave their camp early Sunday morning and
walk more than a mile through Camp Garcia and walk out the front
gates, which have been locked for months to keep out activists.
Activists angered by the death of a civilian guard killed by an
errant bomb in April 1999 have camped on various areas of the
bombing range for a year to block exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Medina said that Navy officials with whom the protesters spoke
Saturday ''were very amiable and said they would have no problems''
with the march. Navy spokesman Lt. Jeff Gordon on Friday declined
to comment on the planned march.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello agreed in
January to allow the Navy to resume exercises for at least three
more years using practice bombs that will not explode. Under the
agreement, Vieques' residents will decide in a referendum likely to
take place next year whether the Navy can resume live fire training
or must abandon the island.

<HEADLINE> Butch Carter Sues Camby for $5M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Toronto Raptors coach Butch Carter filed a $5
million defamation suit against New York Knicks forward Marcus
Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, whose team faces the Knicks in the first round of the
NBA playoffs Sunday, filed the suit against his former player after
Camby called the coach ''a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm responding to an article of untruths in the only manner I
can,'' Carter told the New York Daily News on Saturday from
Orlando, Fla. ''That's through the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby was served papers after Friday night's practice. The suit
was filed Friday in New York Supreme Court in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crazy,'' Camby told the Daily News on Saturday. ''Me and
my teammates are not going to let it be a distraction. It's silly
and I'm just going to go out and play my game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be confident that I will be ready to play. I am focused
and ready. (The lawsuit) is making me more focused and intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, traded to the Knicks from Toronto before the 1998-99
season, said this week that Carter had promised that the Raptors
planned to build their team around him.
</P>
<P>
   The trade quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a liar,'' Camby told the Daily News on Wednesday before
the Knicks played their final regular-season game in Boston. ''I
don't really like him. No one likes him and no one wants to play
for him. That's the kind of guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't trust him ... I think a lot of guys don't trust him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just been ratting out people and doing things his way.
From what I hear, a lot of people are mad at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klempner, an attorney for the players' union, addressed the
suit in an interview with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we see it in black and white, we can't comment on it
because it's such an incredible and unbelievable claim,'' Klempner
said Saturday. ''Any such claim would be insufficient legally on
too many grounds to even begin counting. I don't think they want to
have a precedent with players starting to sue coaches for coaches'
comments about players.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Have 42 Home Runs in April  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Two-run shots by Mark McGwire in the first
inning and Fernando Tatis in the third gave the St. Louis Cardinals
an NL record 42 homers in April.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his fourth home run, his first since April 10, off
Colorado's Masato Yoshii. The two-run drive landed just inside the
foul pole in left field and was estimated at 446 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis hit his fifth of the season with two outs in the third,
also off Yoshii, although it took the umpires some time to award
it. Replays showed the ball cleared the left-field wall by several
feet before it bounced back on the field, but third-base umpire
Marty Foster signaled the ball was in play.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis was stopped at second base for several minutes before
Foster asked for help, Plate umpire Ron Kulpa over-ruled the call,
and Rockies manager Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves hit 41 home runs in April 1998. The major
league mark is 49 by Cleveland in 1997, and the overall record for
any month is 58 by Baltimore in May 1987.

<HEADLINE> Fleisher, Nelson Share Vegas Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Larry Nelson, the runner-up in his last three
events, shot a 6-under 66 on Saturday for a share of the
second-round lead with Bruce Fleisher in the Las Vegas Senior
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a three-time major championship winner on the PGA Tour
who has five senior victories, matched Fleisher at 11-under 133 on
the Tournament Players Club at Summerlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've finished second three weeks in a row, so it would be nice
just to move up a little,'' said Nelson, who hit 17 of 18 greens in
regulation Saturday after hitting all 18 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've only missed two greens all week. I missed one in the
practice round and I missed one today and the one I missed today
was kind of tough. I hit a sand wedge from 140 yards and the ball
just got caught in the wind and it flew the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, seeking his third victory of the year and 10th in two
seasons, shot a 67. He had a bad break on the par-5 ninth, when his
second shot rolled over the green and wound up in a bad lie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could barely get a club on it,'' said Fleisher, who chipped
on and made par on a hole most of the leaders birdied.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan was a stroke back after a 66. David Lundstrom shot a
67 for a 135 total, and Hugh Baiocchi (67) and Dave Stockton (70)
followed at 136.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, the 1997 and 1998 winner, and Jim Colbert, the 1995
and 1996 champion, shot 68s to join Roy Vucinich at 137.
</P>
<P>
   First-round leaders Doug Tewell and Bob Murphy dropped back.
Tewell, coming off a victory Monday in the PGA Seniors'
Championship, shot a 73 for a 138 total, and Murphy had a 76 for a
141 total.

   TORONTO: Blue Jays players watched the White Sox-Tigers brawl on

purpose right now is to get out here and test my side and see how
it feels against live pitching,'' he said. ''If all goes well, I'll

expected to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Kansas City's eight-game losing streak is its
longest since last season when it dropped nine in a row. The
Royals' longest losing skid ever is 12 in 1997. ... CF Johnny Damon
came out of Saturday's game in the fifth inning with a sprained
middle finger of his right hand. He hurt himself sliding back into
first in the first on an attempted pickoff play.
Orioles-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Jason Johnson, recalled from Triple-A Rochester
on Friday, is to make his first start of the season Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Gil Heredia has walked 13 batters in his first four
starts, an average of 4.68 per nine innings. He walked an AL-low
average of 1.53 last season.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Cubs-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Kerry Wood makes what could be his final rehab start
Sunday for Triple-A Iowa. Wood is expected to return to the Cubs
for the first time since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery on
their homestand that begins next Friday. ... Damon Buford broke an
0-for-16 slump with a single in the opener. ... Baylor said when he
played in Boston that Wade Boggs threw batting practice on days
knuckleballers pitched. ''His was just as tough as Phil Niekro's or
Charlie Hough's,'' Baylor said. Because of the wet field, the Cubs
had to settle for hitting in the batting cage before facing Dennis
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Rick Reed will likely miss his start Monday because he
cannot wear a glove because of an injured left wrist. ''You can't
pitch if you can't defend yourself,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said. Pat Mahomes will likely get the start unless he is needed in
relief on Sunday.
Brewers-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Mark Loretta returned to the lineup for Saturday
night's game, playing shortstop and batting second. Loretta didn't
start Friday night, though he was available off the bench, after
leaving Thursday night's 5-4 loss in New York with a mild
concussion after colliding with OF James Mouton while fielding a
foul pop in the sixth. ... The Brewers were trying to avoid losing
six straight for the first time since last July 31-Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: RF Vladimir Guerrero entered Saturday night's game
with 99 career homers. Guerrero is tied with Larry Walker for
seventh place on the Expos' home run leader list, one behind Larry
Parrish. Andre Dawson's 225 homers from 1976-86 are the most by an
Expo, followed by Gary Carter (220) and Larry Parrish (204). ...
Mike Thurman made 61 pitches in a three-inning rehab outing for
Class A Jupiter Friday. Thurman, who is on the 15-day disabled list
with right elbow tendinitis, allowed two runs and seven hits and
took the loss as the Hammerheads fell 16-3 to Brevard County.
Phillies-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Brian Hunter, who was signed by the Phils on
Friday, made his first appearance and start in place of first
baseman Rico Brogna, who was hit by Vladimir Nunez on Friday. He
singled in his second at-bat but was then picked off. Brogna
sustained a contusion on the right knee but was available to
pinch-hit Saturday . ... C Tom Prince made his second start of the
season in place of All-Star catcher Mike Lieberthal. ... Sunday's
starter Robert Person is 2-0 at Pro Player with an 0.53 ERA. In
four games, he's given up just one run in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins placed 2B Luis Castillo on the disabled
list due to a lower back strain. The move is retroactive to April
16. Castillo, off to the best start of his career, was hitting .333
with a .500 on-base percentage. He had missed the previous six
games. ... The team purchased the contract of infielder Pablo Ozuna
from Double-A Portland. Ozuna was hitting .349. Boles said he would
probably start him on Sunday, but not in the leadoff spot where
Castillo has been excelling. ... The Marlins assigned the contract
of utility infielder Dave Berg to Brevard County (Class A) to
continue rehabilitation of his shoulder. ... Marlins owner John
Henry said that with no prospect of a new ballpark and a potential
revenue loss of $15 million to $20 million next year, he would
unload the higher-priced players in a similar fashion that his
predecessor, H. Wayne Huizenga, did following the 1997 World Series
championship season. ''You've seen a lot of teams spending years
trying to solve their ballpark situation, Montreal and Minnesota,
but if we're going to take that approach, we have to continually
start over rebuilding this team,'' Henry said. ''For us, patience
means a number of years of non-competitive baseball.''
Dodgers-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: RHP Kevin Brown, who broke the small finger on his
right hand while bunting on April 8, threw in the bullpen Saturday.
If he gets through another bullpen session Sunday without problem,
he will be activated and start Tuesday in Atlanta. ... Since
hitting three homers in San Francisco on April 11, Kevin Elster has
gone 8-for-26 (.308) with five homers and 10 RBIs. ... Gary
Sheffield has homered in five of his last seven games while hitting
.382.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: SS Barry Larkin had thick wrapping on his left hand
Saturday, protecting his surgically repaired middle finger. Larkin,
who tore tissue in the finger Friday night, will wear a brace on
his left hand for 10 days and can start gripping objects again in
two weeks. ... Norm Charlton's wild pitch in the ninth gave the
Reds 18 wild pitches in 18 games, most in the majors. The NL record
for wild pitches in a season is 91, shared by Houston (1970) and
Philadelphia (1989). The Reds hold the league record for fewest
wild pitches in a season -- nine in 1944.
Pirates-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Starting pitcher Kris Benson is a 1994 graduate of
Sprayberry High School in Marietta, an Atlanta suburb. ... Jason
Kendall led off for the 16th time this season, the most by a
catcher since Craig Biggio batted first in 17 games for Houston in
1989. ... John Vander Wal, who started in right field, already has
two pinch-hit homers, two away from the team's season record set by
Mark Johnson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Streaking Andres Galarraga got the night off with a day
game Sunday. Wally Joyner started at first base. ... Bobby Bonilla
has started 12 of 17 games in left field. Reggie Sanders is
struggling, hitting .154 with no homers and one RBI in 65 at-bats
prior to Saturday's game. ... John Burkett, signed just before
opening day, made his first start of the season. He went 0-2 with
an 11.81 ERA out of the bullpen. ... Wednesday's game against the
Los Angeles Dodgers was switched from 7:40 to 7:05 p.m. to
accommodate ESPN.
Padres-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres activated C Carlos Hernandez from the
15-day disabled list and optioned OF Mike Darr to Triple-A Las
Vegas. Hernandez had been out since April 7 because of a strained
right groin. Darr hit .077 (1-for-13) with two RBI and three walks
in five games. Hernandez was in the starting lineup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros (6-9) entered Saturday's game four games
behind the division-leading Cardinals, Houston's largest deficit
since Sept. 29, 1996.
Rockies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Before the game, the Rockies reinstated OF Jeffrey
Hammonds from the 15-day disabled list and designated OF Jeff Manto
for assignment. Hammonds, who injured his hamstring doubling in the
ninth inning on opening day, was in the lineup batting sixth and
playing left field. ... The Rockies have won the opener all four
series but entered Saturday's game 2-4 in the second game of the
series. ... Reliever Gabe White had allowed five of six inherited
runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: OF Jim Edmonds, among the league leaders in batting
(.386) and six other offensive categories, got his first day off
due to a strain in his left foot. He blamed a new pair of shoes he
wore during batting practice for the injury. ''They felt a little
tight,'' Edmonds said. ''In the seventh inning, all of a sudden it
just got really bad.'' Team doctors told Edmonds he probably could
play Sunday. ... Reserve Thomas Howard had 12 RBIs and three home
runs in his first 17 at-bats. ... The Cardinals outscored their
opponents 31-13 in the first inning the first 17 games.
Giants-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: San Francisco assured itself of its first series
victory against Arizona since Sept. 12-14, 1998. ... Robb Nen
allowed his first hit and walk of the season but also struck out
the side. He has seven strikeouts in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Luis Gonzalez has hit 14 of his 30 homers with Arizona
at home. ... Byung-Hung Kim had pitched seven scoreless innings
before the Giants scored three runs against him.

<HEADLINE> Sunshine Street Ousts Single Empire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Horses trained by Neil Drysdale finished
first and second in Santa Anita Park's San Juan Capistrano
Invitational Handicap on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunshine Street upset 7-10 favorite Single Empire in the
$400,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Street, the 2-1 second choice, edged Single Empire by
two lengths in the 1}-mile grass marathon, with a time of 2:49.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey flew to California from Florida to ride Sunshine
Street -- a 5-year-old bay -- to his third successive victory. But it
was his first win in a graded stakes race. It deprived Single
Empire and jockey Kent Desormeaux of back-to-back wins in North
America's longest Grade I turf event.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey rallied Sunshine Street on the outside of three horses
turning into the stretch. Single Empire managed to squeeze through
an opening at the three-eighths pole, but failed to match strides
with the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Barracks, who set the early pace under Matt Garcia, held
on for third, one-length farther back in the field of five. He was
followed by Star Performance and Company Approval. Jack Grandi was
a late scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Street, 115 pounds, paid $6.20, $2.60 and $2.40. Single
Empire returned $2.20 and $2.20 while Chelsea Barracks paid $3 to
show.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux declined comment to reporters after the race, but
Drysdale relayed the rider's observations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kent said that when he came through at the three-eighths pole,
he got hammered,'' Drysdale said. ''He felt it kind of knocked the
breath out of the horse. He ran the rest of the way on guts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, meanwhile, had a clear trip on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did take a beating going around the turn, as far as losing
ground was concerned,'' Bailey said, ''but he was going so
smoothly, I didn't want to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Street earned $240,000 for owner Pat Garvey after
accumulating $380,298 in 19 previous starts. The victory was only
his fourth win to accompany seven seconds and a third.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio-Clinton Interview Short  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After all the fuss, Leonardo DiCaprio's debut in
a news role was a bit part.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's 20-minute chat in the White House with President
Clinton about global warming was edited down to two minutes on
ABC's Saturday special, ''Planet Earth 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio was seen asking the president three questions.
</P>
<P>
   The interview prompted a flood of criticism from people --
including some within ABC News -- who wondered why the hunky
''Titanic'' star was being sent to do a journalist's job.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was DiCaprio playing the role of a reporter, he was
playing the role of a reporter with a conflict of interest. He's
chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee and approached
ABC with the idea of a special on global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives, who said they enlisted DiCaprio to entice young
viewers to a news show, were embarrassed when they originally said
the actor visited Clinton at the White House's request without the
understanding of an interview. But the White House said ABC asked
for an interview ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying something different,'' newswoman Elizabeth
Vargas, enlisted as host in the past two weeks to give the show
some journalistic heft, said in introducing DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   The actor filmed segments in a frog habitat in Los Angeles and a
butterfly museum in New York City that were used to begin and end
the show, and introduce individual segments.
</P>
<P>
   His interview with Clinton wasn't shown until 52 minutes of the
hour-long special had passed.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio thanked Clinton for the opportunity to talk about
global warming, saying he was ''neither a politician or a
journalist. It was an opportunity as a concerned citizen I couldn't
pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do you think this issue is so constantly overlooked?'' he
asked Clinton. ''Why do you think people don't take it seriously?
For you, is it as important as something like health care or
education?''
</P>
<P>
   He also asked what Clinton thought was the best course for
American citizens over the next 20 years to help the environment.
</P>
<P>
   His final question: ''Do you think we can eventually become a
role model?''
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio was reportedly helped by something common to actors but
less so to journalists -- the opportunity for retakes. New Yorker
magazine said this week that ABC filmed DiCaprio later asking again
some of his questions after he flubbed his lines, and it was then
spliced into the footage.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's attempt to appeal to younger viewers was evident
throughout the show, which used video tricks like speeding up the
picture, slowing it down or blurring it. Vargas, filmed in a New
Mexico desert, was dressed in fashionable black shirt and black
slacks, with a denim jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The news special also had a trendy techno soundtrack, with one
odd exception: a brief snippet of '60s rockers Jefferson Airplane.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Celebrate Elian Going to Dad  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL AUSTRALIA, Cuba (AP) -- ''Today is a truce,'' Fidel
Castro declared Saturday, praising U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
and INS officials for reuniting Elian Gonzalez with his father.
</P>
<P>
   As the child's grandparents joined hundreds of thousands of
Cubans in celebration, Castro proclaimed the boy's return to his
father's arms a reprieve in the conflict between Cuba and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a day of glory for our people,'' Castro said. But he
added: ''Tomorrow the battle continues.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 people were called to a historic sugar refinery to
celebrate the breakthrough in the personal and political drama that
has gripped the island for five months.
</P>
<P>
   Castro praised the consistency shown by Reno and other officials
in their determination to reunite father and son ''even though they
were scared'' about the repercussions of their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a truce, perhaps the only one in 40 years -- one
day,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro downplayed the shock that Elian suffered during the early
morning raid by armed government agents who carried him away from
the home of his Miami relatives. ''That boy cried for three
minutes, for something that probably saved his life,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed delight with two photographs taken after Elian
was reunited with his father outside Washington, saying that images
of the smiling boy represented ''no better gift for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy that the boy finally is in his father's
arms,'' Elian's maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez said, wiping
away tears as she stood on a stage before Castro's speech.
Rodriguez's only child, Elisabeth Brotons -- Elian's mother --
perished in the sea journey that launched the custody battle over
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   She and Elian's paternal grandmother Mariela Quintana thanked
the American people and officials, including U.S. lawmakers and
Attorney General Janet Reno, for efforts to reunite Elian with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we spoke for the first time with our Elian in five
months,'' said the boy's beaming paternal grandfather, Juan
Gonzalez, who with other Cuban relatives had complained that their
Miami kin interrupted phone calls with the child.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents said Elian -- who earlier Saturday looked
terrified when government agents snatched him from his Miami
relatives' home -- seemed happy when they talked with him later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is my Elian,'' said Rodriguez, who along with the others
wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the boy's image. ''He has not
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro chatted briefly with the grandparents before they
addressed the crowd. He noted in his address that the rally at the
Central Australia sugar processing center was originally called to
mark the 39th anniversary of Cuba's triumph over an exile army at
the Bay of Pigs -- not to celebrate Elian's reunion with his father.
</P>
<P>
   It was from here that Castro directed the revolutionary troops
who on April 19, 1961 conquered the exiles who launched the
disastrous invasion at a nearby beach.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's reunion with his father in the early hours of Saturday,
''was a very emotional moment,'' said 50-year-old sugar worker
Marta Morales. ''All Cubans felt the emotion that the father
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state radio first alerted the news shortly after 5 a.m.,
after federal agents stormed the house of the Miami relatives who
have fought to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, state-run television rebroadcast CNN
footage of the event -- though it did not show a photo of armed
agents finding the boy in a closet. Elian was then flown to
Maryland, where he was reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be returning immediately to Cuba, however. Gonzalez
has promised to remain in the United States with his son pending
further court action over the question of asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cried when I heard the news,'' said a smiling Migdalia
Heredia, 51, a state planning worker who almost danced down a
rickety apartment staircase in Old Havana to tell a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the Florida coast in November, sparking an
international custody battle between his father, who sought his
return to Cuba, and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cuba's communist government has mobilized Cubans by
holding mass protests nearly every day for four months as well as
extensive media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But it discouraged spontaneous celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans should be ''serene, discreet and dignified, because any
other form of conduct could negatively influence the future
evolution of the situation,'' said a government statement broadcast
on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pedro Hernandez, a 69-year-old musician, said Cubans
would raise their glasses to toast the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who don't usually drink rum who are going to
take a drink in celebration,'' said Hernandez, clutching a guitar
and wearing a straw hat and red bandanna in Old Havana's Plaza de
Armas square.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jesus Sanchez was 2-for-2 with an RBI and pitched
into the seventh inning as the Florida Marlins ended their six-game
losing streak against Philadelphia, beating the Phillies 4-2
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez (3-0) allowed two runs and seven hits in 6 1-3 innings,
struck out four, walked two and hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   He also picked off Brian Hunter in the fifth inning and started
a tough double play on a Kevin Jordan comebacker in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had a 4-0 lead but left after Doug Glanville's two-run
single in the seventh. Braden Looper got Ron Gant to hit into an
inning-ending double play, and Antonio Alfonseca pitched a hitless
ninth for his sixth save in seven chances.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Byrd (0-2), making his first start in 12 days, gave up four
runs in six innings and struck out seven. His overall ERA dropped
from 23.40 to 13.91, but his ERA at Miami rose from 1.01 to 1.93 in
eight appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay was 2-for-4 with a leadoff homer and an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which was outhit 8-6, made it 3-0 in the second on Paul
Bako's RBI groundout and Sanchez's run-scoring infield hit, which
caromed off Byrd toward shortstop. Kotsay's double came in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kotsay's leadoff homer was the first of his career, the
10th in Marlins' history. ... Dolphins quarterback Damon Huard
threw out the ceremonial first pitch -- high and wide left. ... A
half-inning after Sanchez's bouncer caromed off Byrd, Byrd hit a
grounder off Sanchez for an infield hit. He was doubled up when
Glanville lined to second. ... Glanville climbed the fence in
left-center to rob Chris Clapinski of a potential double with a
backhand catch in the fourth inning.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Geoff Jenkins homered for the second straight
game and added a two-run double as the Milwaukee Brewers stopped a
five-game losing streak by beating the Montreal Expos 7-3 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Stull (1-1) got his first major league win, allowing two
runs and nine hits in five-plus innings. He gave up consecutive
homers by Lee Stevens and Chris Widger leading off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee had a season-high 15 hits to send Montreal to just its
second loss in its last seven games at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who homered off Hideki Irabu (1-2) leading off the
second, doubled off Steve Kline with runners at second and third in
the seventh to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard was 2-for-4 with a homer and two RBIs, and Kevin
Barker had a pair of run-scoring doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, making his first career appearance against Milwaukee,
allowed five runs and 10 hits in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins hit his sixth homer off leading off the second and the
Brewers added a second run on Barker's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard homered leading off the fourth to make it 3-0 and,
after Jose Hernandez singled with one out, Barker delivered his
second straight run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal closed to 4-2 in the bottom half when Stevens led off
with his third homer and Widger followed with his second of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero scored the Expos' third run on a strange play
in the sixth to draw Montreal within one.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero singled leading off to chase Stull, and advanced on
Chris Widger's one-out single off Jim Bruske.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners moved up on Michael Barrett's grounder to
shortstop, and Guerrero came home on Orlando Cabrera's sharply-hit
grounder to third. Hernandez ran down Widger for the third out,
after electing not to throw to first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Barker's doubles were his first two of the season. ... Mark
Loretta returned to the Brewers' lineup, playing shortstop and
batting second. Loretta didn't start Friday night, though he was
available off the bench, after leaving Thursday night's 5-4 loss in
New York with a mild concussion. ... Guerrero is tied with Larry
Walker for seventh on the Expos' career homer list at 99, one
behind Larry Parrish. Andre Dawson's 225 homers from 1976-86 are
the most by an Expo, followed by Gary Carter (220) and Larry
Parrish (204). ... Mike Thurman made 61 pitches in a three-inning
rehab outing for Class-A Jupiter on Friday. Thurman, who is on the
15-day disabled list with right elbow tendinitis, allowed two runs
and seven hits and took the loss as the Hammerheads fell 16-3 to
Brevard County.

   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez was in seclusion with his
father, stepmother, and baby half-brother at Andrews Air Force base outside
Washington tonight, after being taken from his Miami relatives' home by federal
agents in a pre-dawn raid. At 5 a.m., more than 20 agents in white vans arrived
at the house of Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, and used battering rams
to get through the home's chain-link fence and front door. Though in his
father's custody, Elian's fate still remains unsettled. The courts will

set today by protesters on the streets of Little Havana after Elian Gonzalez was
snatched away by federal agents. Riot police with batons and shields beat down
demonstrators who set bonfires and uprooted concrete benches. As Miami mayors
called for calm, an angry crowd tore down the CNN tent at the house where Elian
had lived. In Cuba, Elian's Cuban relatives joined hundreds of thousands who
streamed down a muddy road to a historic sugar refinery to celebrate the boy's
reunion with his father. ''Elian, friend! Cuba is with you!'' chanted an
estimated 400,000 people called by Cuba's communist government to gather at
Central Australia.

Miami Kin Try To See Elian, Dad
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez followed him to
Washington today, hoping to keep the 6-year-old boy from going back to Cuba.
They were turned away from the air base gate behind which Elian was reunited
with his father. The group attempted to hold a news conference outside Andrews
Air Force, but gave up amid a crush of protesters and news media, saying only
that they would make another attempt to see Elian and his Cuban father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, on Sunday. The group included Lazaro Gonzalez, who has cared
for the boy in his house for the five months since Elian's rescue at sea; cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez, and the fisherman who rescued him, Donato Dalrymple.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Accused of mishandling claims from the 1994
earthquake in Los Angeles, executives from six insurance companies were summoned
to the state Insurance Department's headquarters. They were ushered into an
office one by one and offered a choice: Donate to a new fund set up by the
department or face billions of dollars' worth of penalties. Ultimately, the
insurers decided to avoid the penalties and gave the fund a total of $11.6
million in donations for education, consumer assistance and earthquake research.

Explosion Rocks Zimbabwe Newspaper
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- An explosion shook the offices of Zimbabwe's only
independent newspaper Saturday in a suspected bomb attack. Zimbabwe has been
roiled in recent months by political violence, particularly attacks on
opposition supporters, and the often-violent occupation of white-owned farm by
black squatters. The explosion, near the staff entrance to the building housing
The Daily News, caused little damage but shattered the windows of a neighboring
sculpture gallery. The building was empty, since the newspaper does not print on
weekends.

Noise, Stale Air Await Astronauts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- When astronauts float into the international
space station this week, they'll be armed with ear plugs, air monitors and fans
because the Russian side of the Russian space station is still too noisy because
of acoustic design. In addition to the racket 225 miles up, the air is stale and
the ventilation bad -- bad enough to sicken the last astronauts who visited the
space station, last spring. So this next crew will tote small, personal fans and
carbon-dioxide monitors. Six Americans and one Russian are scheduled to lift off
aboard space shuttle Atlantis on Monday.

Senate race in history. California set the bar in 1994 when Diane Feinstein and
Michael Huffington spent $43.3 million; New Yorkers Alfonse D'Amato and Charles

<HEADLINE> Actor Brosnan's Son in Car Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Pierce Brosnan's 13-year-old son was
in a car that plunged 150-200 feet down a steep embankment early
Saturday, leaving him with multiple fractures and spinal injuries,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol was a factor in the crash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Brosnan suffered multiple fractures and spinal injuries
when the vehicle went down a brush-covered embankment near Malibu,
the California Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center, where he underwent
surgery, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan, best known as the latest actor to play James
Bond, was contacted at his home in Malibu shortly after the
accident and accompanied his son in the helicopter, the CHP said.
</P>
<P>
   CHP Officer Karen Faciane said Brosnan was being treated for a
fractured pelvis, a possible fracture to a vertebra and a ruptured
bladder. She said he was recovering in the intensive care unit and
was in stable but serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Roxanne Moster said the hospital did not
have any patient listed under Brosnan's name.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 Chevrolet Blazer was carrying six people when it went
off Dume Mountain Way near Malibu at about 3:45 a.m., the CHP said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, James Hall, 19, was arrested for investigation of
driving under the influence of alcohol and causing major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hall told authorities he swerved to avoid a large rock and went
off the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initial investigation indicates that in addition to the
driver, several of the passengers had been consuming alcoholic
beverages,'' the CHP said.
</P>
<P>
   The CHP said some passengers were not wearing seatbelts and were
thrown from the vehicle. Several passengers with minor injuries
hiked back up to the roadway and used a cellular telephone to call
for help.

<HEADLINE> Coa, Ziadie Sweep Lone Star Derby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- It was a big day for Eibar Coa and
trainer Ralph Ziadie.
</P>
<P>
   Coa drove Ziadie-trained Tahkodha Hills from third at the
clubhouse turn to victory in the $300,000, 1 1/16th-mile Lone Star
Derby for 3-year-olds in the seventh race at Lone Star Park on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth race about a half-hour later, Coa rode another
Ziadie-trained entry, Sir Bear, to a win by a nose over Lexington
Park in the $300,000, Texas Mile for 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Tahkodha Hills broke second from the gate, fell to fourth by a
length in the backstretch, then rallied to beat Jeblar Sez Who by
two lengths in 1:44.05. The favorite, Big Numbers, finished third
in the field of seven, two lengths behind Jeblar Sez Who.
</P>
<P>
   Tahkodha Hills took $180,000 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ziadie said the horse probably will make his next start in the
Belmont Stakes on June 10 to seek Lone Star Park's new $1 million
bonus to any Lone Star Derby winner who goes on to also take a
Triple Crown event.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas Mile, Barbara Smollkin's Sir Bear fell to seventh
early in the field of nine before rallying down the backstretch.
Sir Bear and Lexington Park then battled furiously from the
clubhouse turn all the way to the wire, with Sir Bear prevailing by
a head for a $170,000 payday. Southern California invader Luftikus
ended up third.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Bear completed the mile in 1:35.98 in his first win since
the 1999 Metropolitan Mile Handicap in New York. Ziadie said the
2000 Metropolitan Mile will be Sir Bear's next start.

<HEADLINE> Elian and Dad Reunite on Airplane  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It ended with a bear hug in the aisle of an
airplane. Elian and his father -- finally reunited.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly five months, 6-year-old Elian and his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, have been entangled in an international custody
fight that transformed them into heroes in America and their native
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Their separation ended Saturday morning. When the plane carrying
Elian landed at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, Gonzalez
boarded it alone and spent five minutes with the son he hadn't seen
since before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   When they emerged from the plane, Elian was wrapped in a
blanket, said Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Elian's arms ringed his father's neck. His
head rested on his daddy's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very, very moving,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner
said. ''It was very touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither father nor son had gotten much sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 31, had spent most of Friday night negotiating with
the boy's Miami relatives. They wanted to retain custody of Elian,
who was found holding on an inner tube floating off the Florida
coast on Nov. 25 after a boat sank. His mother and 10 others died
in the attempt to escape from communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations broke down, U.S. government agents raided the
relatives' home in Miami early Saturday, retrieved the boy and flew
him to the Air Force base where the reunion took place.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshots recorded the emotional day.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Gonzalez holds Elian, who is wearing a light blue Batman
T-shirt. Side-by-side, their resemblance cannot be mistaken. Father
and son's eyebrows arch over the same deep-brown eyes. Their smiles
are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   In another photo, Elian sits on the floor, cradling his
6-month-old half-brother, Hianny, on his lap. Elian's eyes ''lit
up'' when he saw his baby brother, according to the Rev. Joan Brown
Campbell, who has been in touch with the Gonzalez family in both
the United States and Cuba. She said Elian remarked: ''He's gotten
so big since I saw him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's trip to Andrews was his first time on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Elian colored, played with Play-Doh and fell
asleep on the lap of INS Agent Betty Mills, who is fluent in
Spanish, Cardona said. Also aboard was a flight surgeon and a
psychiatrist, both from the U.S. Public Health Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy appeared to be very calm throughout the flight,''
Cardona said. ''In one of the legs of the flight, he became a
little upset. He started to cry a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   To help soothe him, the INS agents opened a window shade and
urged him to gaze outside ''at the pretty colors in the sky,''
Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   At Andrews, he went into a home on the base where he joined his
stepmother, Nersy, and baby brother. Mills and Jim Goldman, the
other INS agent on the flight, reported that when they left the
house, Elian was ''happily playing on the floor like any
6-year-old,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian also politely shook hands with his daddy's lawyer, Greg
Craig, who said he was surprised at the small stature of the boy,
who has become a giant-sized folk figure whose plight prompted
demonstrations in two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you really see this little boy, you realize how small he
is physically,'' Craig said.

<HEADLINE> Braves 4, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andruw Jones homered, Bruce Chen pitched three
scoreless innings in relief and the Atlanta Braves won their sixth
in a row Saturday night, 4-2 over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, coming on to another standing ovation, struck out
the side in the ninth for his second save. After allowing a two-out
singles to Pat Meares, he fanned Brian Giles on a checked-swing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen (2-0) took over in the fourth after starter John Burkett
was injured the previous inning. The left-hander, making his first
appearance since being recalled from the minors Thursday night,
allowed three hits and struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Jones broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth, knocking a hanging slider
into the left-field seats for his fourth homer of the season. He
has hit in 13 of 14 games, including six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves extended their lead in the sixth. Wally Joyner,
starting at first in place of the streaking Andres Galarraga, led
off with a single to left and moved to third on Bobby Bonilla's
double.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss walked to load the bases before pinch-hitter Keith
Lockhart brought home the run with a slow grounder to second.
Warren Morris got the force at second, but Lockhart beat Meares'
relay throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh closed to 3-2 in the seventh on Kevin Young's RBI
groundout against Luis Rivera. But Mike Remlinger came on to get
the final out, and the Braves pushed the margin back to two runs in
the eighth when pinch-runner Rafael Furcal sprinted home on a wild
pitch by Jose Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta went ahead in the first, leading off with three straight
hits against Kris Benson (0-3). Brian Jordan struck out with the
bases loaded but Joyner made it 1-0 with a sacrifice fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tied it up in the third, taking advantage of two
walks by Burkett. Kevin Young followed with an RBI single to left
before the Atlanta starter got out of the inning by striking out
John Vander Wal and getting Wil Cordero on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, making his first start of the season, was hurt during
the third and left the game with a stuff right shoulder, an injury
not thought to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, a native of suburban Marietta, allowed seven hits,
walked two and struck out four. He also started slowly last year,
going 1-2 with a 5.06 ERA in April.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mike Remlinger has retired the first hitter in all 11 of
his appearances this season. ... The crowd of 41,389 was the
largest at Turner Field since opening day. ... Cordero had an
embarrassing play in the fourth, dropping a fly ball by Bonilla at
the edge of the warning track in left. Benson was able to pitch
around the miscue. ... Galarraga came on in the eighth as a
pinch-hitter. He struck out to end his seven-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Split on Elian Raid Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By ROGER PETTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was barbaric, some Americans said Saturday of the forcible
removal of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives. It was the
right thing to do, others said, and the government had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions were polarized even inside Cuban-American communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that this was the land of the free, but apparently
it's not,'' Rosa Grabe de Peralta said in Union City, N.J., which
after Miami has the nation's second-largest Cuban-American
community.
</P>
<P>
   But Roland Rolo, sipping coffee in a Cuban cafe in Union City,
said he understood the government's action ordered by Attorney
General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got a family laughing at the attorney general, and
sooner or later you've got to show them some authority,'' said
Rolo, 44, of Piscataway, N.J. ''The family overestimated their
position of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Cuban-Americans marched in protest outside Cuba's
mission to the United Nations in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kind of storm trooper tactics are the kind of thing
that's done in Cuba,'' said demonstrator Rafael Ocasio, 42, of New
York. ''Clinton is a hypocrite. He says he's upholding the law, but
there is no law in his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic to and from the Lincoln Tunnel connecting New York City
and New Jersey was blocked for 20 minutes as more than 150 people
from Union City marched down a highway a mile away. No one was
arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ashamed to be American today,'' said Joseph Mendez, 30, of
Weehawken, N.J., as he waved Cuban and American flags in the middle
of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa, Fla., about 500 gathered near Raymond James Stadium.
Police said three people were arrested for blocking traffic and
disorderly conduct. In downtown Jacksonville, about 75 people
peacefully protested at Friendship Fountain. Similar crowds
gathered across the Florida, expressing their opinions by waving
flags, honking horns and hoisting signs.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, it was simply time the standoff came to a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It lasted way too long,'' said Maria Bouchereau, 36, of Los
Angeles. ''I wish the family had cooperated so they wouldn't have
had to go in like that. But I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   After the months-long tug of war between the family and the
federal government, it took officers only minutes to retrieve the
boy from the relatives who cared for him since his rescue at sea
and had defied efforts to have him released to his father, who
wants to take him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law is the law. You can't bend it. I'm sorry it had to
come down to something like that but I think he's back where he
belongs, with his father,'' said Ben Merritt, a Milwaukee
bartender.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a case of politics, said Charles Dooley, one of
several veterans at VFW Post 1019, in Albany, N.Y., who said Elian
belongs with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all just because we're against Cuba,'' said Dooley, 58.
''If it was a kid from a country we were friendly with, this would
never be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair to bring up politics at the expense of a
child,'' said Ian Coleman, a student in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Some people saw it in terms of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid should be with his father,'' said Tom McClean, 41, an
electrician in the Chicago suburb of Woodridge. ''The people in
Miami weren't going to give the kid up. I don't think they had a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone talks about Cuba being the evil empire, but how evil
would we be if we kept the boy from his father?'' asked Tim
Quistoroff, 34, a Chicago musician.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why shouldn't the man have his child? There's nothing
abhorrent about a child being with his father,'' said Bob Burman,
an attorney in Columbus, Ohio, who has two children.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents were troubled by photographs showing armed
federal agents taking Elian from the home of his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe what I saw. And they want to take our guns
away from us?'' said Priscilla Talich of Denver, mother of a
9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The show of arms also disturbed others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the government tried hard enough. It could have
been done without guns. To take a child forcibly with guns is
tantamount to kidnapping,'' said Misty Sheehan, 55, of the Chicago
suburb of Glen Ellyn, a college humanities professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he should be with his dad, but it was a hell of a way
to do it. That doesn't look good for us at all,'' said Gerard
Lombardo, a security guard in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was barbaric,'' said John Smith, 60, a personal
injury lawyer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Byrd was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm ashamed to be an American,'' said Byrd, 56, of Huntington,
W.Va. ''I feel like taking the American flag and digging a hole and
putting it upside down in the ground.''

Elian Gonzalez and Dad Reunited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) -- After being taken from his Miami
relatives' home by federal agents in a pre-dawn raid, Elian Gonzalez was in
seclusion tonight with his father, stepmother and baby half-brother at Andrews
Air Force base outside Washington. At 5 a.m., more than 20 agents in white vans
arrived at the house of Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, and used
battering rams to get through the home's chain-link fence and front door. Though
in his father's custody, Elian's fate still remains unsettled. The courts will
ultimately rule on whether the boy should remain in the United States.

Castro proclaimed the boy's return to his father's arms a reprieve in the

of a small plane in the hills of southwestern Virginia today, more than a day
after the plane disappeared from radar, officials said. The single-engine Mooney
20G aircraft was en route from Nashville, Tenn., to Roanoke when it vanished
from radar late Friday morning near Norton. The cause of the crash was not
immediately known, but Virginia State Trooper Dan Helton said initial
investigations suggest the plane was flying too low and hit several tree tops
before going down. Also today, two people were killed when a small airplane
crashed in Shenandoah County in northwest Virginia, state police said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- After all the fuss, actor Leonardo DiCaprio's 20-minute chat
in the White House with President Clinton about global warming was edited down
to two minutes on ABC's Saturday special, ''Planet Earth 2000.'' DiCaprio was
seen asking the president three questions. The interview prompted a flood of
criticism from people -- including some within ABC News -- who wondered why the
hunky ''Titanic'' star was being sent to do a journalist's job. DiCaprio is
chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee and approached ABC with the
idea of a special on global warming.

   TORONTO (AP) -- Steve Thomas scored twice, including the
game-winner 14:47 into overtime Saturday night, to lead the Toronto
Maple Leafs to a 2-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who tied it with only 4:30 left in the third period, put
the Leafs ahead 3-2 in the best-of-seven first-round playoff
series.
</P>
<P>
   With a win at Ottawa on Monday, Toronto can advance to a
second-round meeting with the New Jersey Devils. If necessary, Game
7 would be Tuesday night back at the Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The home team has won all five games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal came when Thomas redirected a 2-on-1 pass from
Sergei Berezin behind goalie Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa, which lost its 10th straight road playoff game, held a
32-16 shots advantage when Joe Juneau scored in the second period.
The Senators finished with 38 shots compared to 31 for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs killed off a 5-on-3 disadvantage in the third
period -- including a double minor against Garry Valk for
high-sticking -- not allowing the Senators to register a shot.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, scoring chances came fast and furious. Igor Korolev
had the first good one, and Barrasso got a leg pad on the slap
shot. Shawn McEachern had Ottawa's first shot in the extra session,
but Curtis Joseph snared it with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes into overtime, Joseph got his stick shaft down
just in time to stop Andreas Dackell's slider.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Tucker was set up in front by Mats Sundin but Barrasso
made the save.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Mair, an AHL call-up in his first game with the Leafs since
December, flipped a rebound off the crossbar 13 minutes into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Thomas ended the wild extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Leafs coach Pat Quinn was willing to try anything to get his
team over its two straight road defeats. Wendel Clark was given a
lineup spot for the first time in weeks and stirred things up early
by playing with the body-crunching zeal reminiscent of his glory
days.
</P>
<P>
   It was a goalie duel from the outset. Barrasso went down and
stacked his pads to rob Korolev five minutes in, and Joseph glided
out of his crease to get an arm on a Sami Salo drive in the 13th
minute. Those were the best of many fine saves in a scoreless first
period.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph had no chance on Juneau's goal, scored at 4:36 of the
second period. Dackell had the puck along the left-wing boards in
the Toronto zone. Spotting Juneau free in the circle on the other
side of the ice, Dackell passed the puck as Juneau readied for a
shot. As the puck arrived, Juneau slapped it into the open side of
the net before Joseph could get over.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph kept Ottawa from taking a two-goal lead when he stopped
Shaun Van Allen after he broke in alone when the Leafs were caught
on a bad line change.
</P>
<P>
   Fans starting booing the home team's bad passes and ineffective
play. The Senators smothered the Leafs with a trapping defense
during the regular season, and they were doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   Only one minor penalty was assessed in the first 48 minutes and
it was against Chris Phillips for interference in the second
period. Tie Domi was sent off, again for interference, at 8:08 of
the third, then Valk was put in the penalty box for four minutes
for cutting Radek Bonk with a high stick.

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Marcelo Balboa's acrobatic goal put
Colorado ahead to stay and Jorge Dely Valdes contributed a goal and
assist Saturday night as the Rapids beat the Columbus Crew 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 1-1, Dely Valdes sent a driving cross to
Balboa in the middle of the box. Balboa's bicycle kick from 15
yards out beat Crew goalkeeper Mark Dougherty to his right in the
55th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Agogo made it 3-1 for the visitors five minutes later
with a goal from 18 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus opened the scoring in the sixth minute when Dante
Washington scored the first of his two goals by dribbling around
Rapids goalkeeper David Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Dely Valdes tied the game 1-1 with an unassisted goal in the
10th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus had to play a man down after Robert Warzycha was
ejected in the 21st minute for a hard foul on Paul Dougherty. The
red card was the Crew's first in 59 games.
</P>
<P>
   Washington made it 3-2 with 10 minutes left after Kramer was
unable to pull in a cross from Brian McBride. Washington collected
the loose ball and put it into an empty net for his fifth goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 12,295 watched Colorado (3-3) win its first match in
Crew Stadium. Columbus (2-3-1) swept Colorado last season.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 92, Hornets 82  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Allen Iverson was unstoppable, especially
after Eddie Jones got into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored a career playoff-high 40 points Saturday night,
getting 15 of them in a seven-minute burst after Jones picked up
his fourth foul early in the third quarter as the Philadelphia
76ers beat Charlotte 92-82 in Game 1 of their playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Bottled up by Jones early in the game, Iverson did most of his
damage when the Hornets were forced to use David Wesley to defend
him. Iverson scored 18 in the third quarter and led a 23-12 run
that changed the course of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson went quiet early in the fourth as it took the 76ers more
than seven minutes to score their first basket, but he made up for
it at the end by scoring six consecutive points after Charlotte
pulled within three.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson surpassed his previous playoff-high of 37 reached last
year against Orlando. It was the ninth time this season that
Iverson scored 40 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Snow, George Lynch and Tyrone Hill added 10 points apiece
for the Sixers, who got little help from their reserves as Toni
Kukoc shot 0-for-5 and scored just two points.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of bench production mattered little because of the
way Iverson turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   The first four fouls of the third quarter went against
Philadelphia, and it looked a bit like a makeup call when Jones was
called for an offensive foul with 7:54 left as he barely pushed off
with his forearm. The Hornets led 51-50 at the time, but it forced
Jones to the bench for the rest of the quarter and Charlotte wasn't
the same without him.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones shaking his head in disgust at his team's defensive
failings, Iverson hit two 3-pointers, three shorter jumpers, two
layups and three foul shots the rest of the quarter to give the
76ers a 92-82 lead entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The only player who could produce offensively for Charlotte the
rest of the way was backup center Brad Miller, and that wasn't
enough to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Coleman led the Hornets with 23 points and 16 rebounds.
Anthony Mason, Wesley and Jones added 14 each.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson got off to a slow start, missing his first four shots
while the man he was guarding, Wesley, was putting 10 points on the
board. The 76ers missed five layups and a dunk in the first 12
minutes, yet trailed only 22-17 entering the second quarter thanks
to Iverson's 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had 15 by halftime after scoring 12 in the second
quarter, and Philadelphia briefly took the lead before falling
behind by nine again and then trailing 44-41 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers started to take control midway through the third
quarter as the Hornets abandoned their inside game and couldn't
find a jump shot they wouldn't take.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson grabbed an offensive rebound of his own missed jumper
and put it back for a 52-51 lead, Theo Ratliff dunked on the fast
break, Snow hit a jumper and Iverson had another steal and layup --
this time twisting 180 degrees in the air before shooting -- to put
Philadelphia ahead 58-51. A jumper by Snow after two offensive
rebounds put the Sixers up 64-53.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson reached 30 points with 1:13 left in the third, making
the first of three straight free throws after being fouled by
Wesley on a 3-pointer. That made it 70-59, and then lead was nine
heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte opened the final quarter with a 7-1 run to pull within
three, but that was as close as Hornets would get.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The attendance was 15,023 -- more than 8,500 short of
capacity. Large sections of the upper deck were empty. ... Amid
much uncertainty in Charlotte over whether Jones will leave as a
free agent, coach Paul Silas said: ''It would be a total shock to
me.'' During the second half of the season, Jones wavered slightly
in his commitment to staying with the Hornets. ... The fans made
Matt Geiger feel right at home, booing the former Hornets player
when he checked into the game. The fans in Philly constantly boo
him, too.

<P>
   MOUNT JACKSON, Va. (AP) -- A couple flying from Michigan were
killed Saturday when their small airplane clipped power lines and
crashed in Shenandoah County, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Marcia Wilson, of Millington, Mich., departed from
Caro, Mich., in the morning and were planning to refuel their
four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza in Charlottesville before continuing
on to Newport News in the southeastern portion of the state when
the plane crashed around 1 p.m., state police spokeswoman Lucy
Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane came within 50 feet of striking a house. Wreckage and
debris from the plane, which Gary Wilson owned, was scattered for
about a mile, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilsons apparently were headed to Newport News to visit
family over the Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were
expected to arrive at the crash site by Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mets Sweep Doubleheader From Cubs  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no winners when Bobby Valentine and
Don Baylor renewed their feud from Japan to start the day.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine and the New York Mets, however, were the only ones on
top when it ended, sweeping Baylor's Chicago Cubs in a doubleheader
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura's solo homer and a two-run single by Rey Ordonez
keyed a five-run sixth inning as the Mets won the nightcap 7-6 for
their sixth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell went 4-for-5 with two RBIs, and Glendon Rusch won his
first game as a starter in two seasons as New York won the opener
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor and Valentine got into a heated discussion when they
exchanged lineup cards before the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's put to rest, I believe,'' Valentine said of his run-in
with Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the two managers started last month in
Japan when Valentine protested the season opener because Jeff
Huson's name wasn't on the lineup card. He eventually dropped the
protest, but Baylor hadn't dropped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that Valentine was a cheater and that there could be
a fight between the two if they met again. He also wouldn't shake
Valentine's hand before the second game in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Baylor said he'd be ''surprised'' if
Valentine took the lineup card out before the game. Valentine said
Friday that was ''a pretty good bet'' because he had never taken
the lineup card out in his first 534 games with New York.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was at home plate before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My players talked me into doing it, because they had read so
much about it in the papers,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   After the umpires went over the ground rules, Valentine and
Baylor started an animated conversation in which Valentine could be
seen saying, ''It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the imposing Baylor took two steps toward
Valentine. The managers then went back to their respective dugouts
without shaking hands. Valentine smirked and shrugged his shoulders
as he walked back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a problem and he
indicated that it wasn't,'' Valentine said. ''It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor had little to say about the meeting. When asked about
Valentine, he shrugged, turned away and said, ''Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither manager brought out the lineups for the second game.
Cubs coach Billy Williams and Mets coach John Stearns handled the
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then broke out to a 2-0 lead in the first on Benny
Agbayani's two-run single. After the Cubs went ahead 3-2 in the top
of the sixth on Jeff Reed's two-run double, the Mets broke the game
open in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura led off against Kyle Farnsworth (1-3) with his fourth
homer to tie the game at 3. Todd Zeile doubled, Agbayani walked and
Kurt Abbott reached on a bunt single.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Guthrie then allowed a two-run single to Ordonez, who had
been 0-for-18 with runners in scoring position before getting an
RBI single in the eighth inning of the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora added a sacrifice fly and third baseman Shane
Andrews' throwing error allowed another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cook (3-0) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the win. Armando
Benitez pitched the ninth for his seventh save, giving up Sammy
Sosa's single and Henry Rodriguez's home run.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (1-1) made sure there wasn't much excitement in the
opener, holding the Cubs to solo homers by Mark Grace and Andrews
in seven innings for his first win as a starter since beating St.
Louis on June 30, 1998, while with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''My confidence is increasing,'' Rusch said. ''I have a great
team behind me and I'm just trying to be aggressive and throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber (1-2) allowed three runs in seven innings to take the
loss.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs have lost six of seven games. ... Chicago's Eric
Young had an odd first game. He was called out in the sixth inning
when he bunted and the ball bounced up and hit him out of the
batter's box. He was hit by a pitch in the eighth but was not
awarded first base because umpire Paul Schrieber ruled Young moved
his elbow into the ball. ... Dennis Springer allowed three runs in
5 1-3 innings for the Mets in the second game. He is believed to be
the only Mets knuckleballer other than Bob Moorhead in 1965. ...
The field was in good shape following more than a day of rain that
caused Friday's game to be postponed, although water came up in the
outfield as players ran after balls.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 7, Cardinals 6  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds atoned for an error with a
go-ahead, two-run homer in the seventh inning Saturday night as the
Colorado Rockies beat the St. Louis Cardinals 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Fernando Tatis hit two-run homers to give the
Cardinals an NL-record 42 homers in April. St. Louis has homered in
14 straight games, three shy of the team record.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hit 41 homers in April 1998. The major league mark is 49
by Cleveland in 1997, and the overall record for any month is 58 by
Baltimore in May 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has won five of six this season against the Cardinals,
who lead the NL Central. The Rockies have won seven of their last
10.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds, activated earlier in the day following a stint on the
disabled list caused by a hamstring injury on opening day, dropped
J.D. Drew's drive near the left-field warning track in the second
inning. Mike Matheny followed with an RBI single that made it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   With St. Louis ahead 6-5 in the seventh, Hammonds connected off
Mike James (0-1) for his first homer of the season. He also singled
and scored in the second and is 4-for-8 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Croushore (2-0) worked 1 2-3 scoreless innings and Jose
Jimenez got three outs for his third save, striking Ray Lankford
with a runner on second for the final out. Both pitchers were with
the Cardinals last season, and both of Croushore's victories have
been against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his fourth home run, his first since April 10, off
Masato Yoshii in the first. The two-run drive landed just inside
the foul pole in left and was estimated at 446 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis hit his fifth with two outs in the third, although it took
the umpires some time to award it. Replays showed the ball cleared
the left-field wall by several feet before it bounced back on the
field. Third-base ump Marty Foster signaled the ball was in play,
plate umpire Ron Kulpa overruled the call.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Buddy Bell was ejected for arguing the call.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Garrett Stephenson allowed five runs -- four
earned -- and eight hits in six innings. Yoshii had a pair of RBI
singles off him and is 5-for-10 with five RBIs -- matching his total
in 1998 and '99 combined.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, he allowed six runs -- five earned -- and 5 hits in
five innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals have outscored their opponents 34-14 in the
first inning. ... The homers were the first allowed this season by
Yoshii in 23 2-3 innings. ... Cardinals rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel
was headed to the plate for a pinch-hit appearance in the sixth
when manager Tony La Russa called him back and used Jim Edmonds.
Edmonds, who missed his first start due to a foot injury, looked
awkward striking out. ... The Cardinals are 11-0 when they don't
commit an error and 0-7 when they do. On Saturday, Lankford had an
error in left.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Reunited With Dad  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seized in darkness, the little castaway adrift for five months
in an international custody battle was placed in his father's arms
Saturday after federal agents used battering rams and pepper spray
to hustle him from Miami and the relatives fighting to block his
return to communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking you to see your papa,'' an agent told a terrified
Elian Gonzalez, ending the protracted standoff in three frantic
minutes with an armed raid that sparked protests through Miami and
debate over the Clinton administration's use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Crying with fright, the 6-year-old Cuban boy was taken before
dawn by agents brandishing rifles and flown to Andrews Air Force
Base outside Washington, where he was in seclusion with his father,
stepmother and baby half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   Though in his father's custody, Elian's fate remains unsettled.
The courts will ultimately rule on whether the boy should remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest spread through Miami's Little Havana neighborhood as
protesters spilled into the streets, lighting street fires and
struggling with police carrying batons and shields. More than 260
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happening?'' Elian yelled in Spanish as riot-clad
agents armed with automatic weapons burst into the Miami relatives'
home. They found him in a closet in the arms of the same fisherman
who had rescued him from the sea on Thanksgiving Day -- and now had
to hand him over.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the boy whose mother drowned fleeing Cuba was
getting reacquainted with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian smiled as he posed for a picture with his father, and was
seen in another photo playing with 6-month-old half-brother Hianny.
Elian wore a Batman T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to be very happy to be back with his father,'' said
Gregory Craig, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's lawyer. ''It is amazing how
quickly that bond re-established itself. It was almost
instantaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent corroboration of the lawyer's account
of the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, an estimated 400,000 people rallied for a
government-organized celebration of the boy's reunion with his
father. A chant arose: ''Elian, friend! Cuba is with you!''
</P>
<P>
   After the months-long tug of war and failed all-night
negotiations, it took officers only minutes to retrieve the boy
from the relatives who cared for him since his rescue -- and defied
all previous efforts to have him released to his father and
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The boy who had so often turned an impish face to the world
looked terror-stricken in pictures taken by an Associated Press
photographer who captured the raid inside the house on film.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian is safe and no one was seriously hurt,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno said afterward. She said the relatives'
intransigence left her no choice but to order the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who had cared for
the boy like a mother, wailed and wept through the morning and
shouted her disdain for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have a 6-year-old crying, 'Don't take me, don't take me'
... This is not America,'' she yelled as hundreds of
Cuban-Americans poured into the streets to protest what they saw as
Washington's betrayal and what they feared would be Cuban President
Fidel Castro's propaganda victory.
</P>
<P>
   She and her father, Lazaro Gonzalez, who had temporary custody
of Elian, later arrived in Washington to try to see Elian and his
father. Donato Dalrymple, the sports fisherman who had rescued
Elian on an outing with his cousin, was with them. They met with
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who accompanied them in a failed to attempt
to meet with the father and son at the air base.
</P>
<P>
   As protests mounted in Miami, police fired tear gas into one
crowd, stationed two gray buses with bars on the windows in the
center of Little Havana and began handcuffing demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The few protesters who put up a struggle were beaten down by
police and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., more than 20 agents in white vans swarmed around the
house of Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, and used battering
rams to get through the home's chain-link fence and front door.
Eight actually entered the house and officials said 151 federal
agents were used in all, including those maintaining security away
from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Quesada, who was at the home, said Elian was
screaming ''Help me! Help me! Don't take me away!'' in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assassins,'' shouted supporters who had been keeping constant
vigil outside.
</P>

   Rushed into a van as officials fired clouds of pepper spray to
keep the crowds back, Elian was soothed by an immigration agent who
told him he was being taken to ''papa.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This may seem very scary,'' she told him, according to Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ''It will soon be better.''
</P>
<P>
   On the government plane, where he was described as subdued and
calm, he was given Play-Doh, a toy airplane, a map and a watch. He
talked to his father by telephone, and was accompanied by a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who had been staying at a Cuban diplomat's
home outside of Washington since he left Havana more than two weeks
ago with a personal send-off from Castro, was told about the raid
as soon as his son was away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to act was made by Reno, President Clinton said
during a brief question and answer session in the White House Rose
Garden. ''She managed this, but I fully support what she did,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she tried to reach a negotiated solution until the
final moments but the relatives ''kept moving the goal post and
raising the hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives said they were still negotiating and had been put
on hold on the telephone by a mediator when the agents arrived.
''We're angry and disgusted,'' said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for
the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the boy would stay in the United States pending
further court action over the question of asylum, as the federal
appeals court ruled -- a statement confirmed by Gonzalez's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Gonzalez has made a commitment to remain in the United
States during this appeal, and he will live up to that
commitment,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the reunited family would stay
at the secured air base for a few days and then go to an
undisclosed location in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious in his statements about the standoff up to now, George
W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, sharply
criticized the raid and said the dispute should have been settled
in Florida family court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chilling picture of a little boy being removed from his
home at gunpoint defies the values of America and is not an image a
freedom-loving nation wants to show the world,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno defended sending armed agents to the house, saying
officials had been ''told on occasion that people would have
weapons to prevent it from happening.'' She did not say whether any
weapons were found.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the agent photographed confronting Dalrymple in
the closet with Elian had his gun ''pointed to the side'' and his
''finger was not on the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   AP photographs showed the agent with his trigger finger extended
alongside the trigger, but not gripping it. The gun was pointed
slightly off to the side of the huddling man and boy. Examination
of the photos showed the gun was set to ''S'' or safety, a position
in which it could not be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader of the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, was bleeding from one ear after the raid. He said he was
knocked out by an agent using a rifle as a club.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were animals,'' said Jess Garcia, a bystander. ''They
gassed women and children to take a defenseless child out of here.
We were assaulted with no provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is terrible,'' said Cristina Valdes, 67, who was among
dozens of people banging on a parked van to vent their anger. ''I'm
ashamed to be an American. Clinton is a coward, coward, coward.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and Juan Miguel Gonzalez insisted that any deal
contain an immediate transfer of custody of Elian to him, but the
Miami relatives refused.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that had been under discussion called for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez and Elian, Lazaro and Marisleysis to move to one of two
foundation-owned conference centers near Washington, with formal
custody being transferred immediately to the father, a Justice
Department official said. The two sides couldn't agree on the
custody issue or how long they might live together pending the end
of the court battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives lost a U.S. District Court battle to get a
political asylum hearing for Elian. An appeals court has ordered
Elian to stay in this country until it decides that case, but did
not bar Reno from switching custody. A hearing is set for May 11.

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) -- Two skydivers were injured when they
landed hard on their feet and knees during a performance after the
sixth race at Lone Star Park on Saturday.

<P>
   James Knight of Kaufman, Texas, was upgraded from critical to
serious condition Saturday night at Methodist Medical Center in
Dallas, nursing supervisor Karen Clark said. Track spokesman Darren
Rogers said Knight, 56, suffered a broken right femur and a minor
cut on his chin.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Keese of Grandbury, Texas, sprained his right ankle in the

   Lone Star general manager Steve Sexton said the accident
happened just before the $300,000 Lone Star Derby, the seventh race
on Saturday's card.
</P>
<P>
   ''His chute opened, but he just came down harder than normal,''
Sexton said of Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The accident delayed the race for about eight minutes as an
ambulance crew treated Knight.
