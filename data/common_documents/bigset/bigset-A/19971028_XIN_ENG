<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Sudanese
government left here today for the Kenyan capital of Nairobi to
hold peace negotiations with a main rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The government delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Ali Osman
Mohamed Taha, is scheduled to start negotiation Tuesday with Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang under the
auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and
Development of eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has reportedly voiced doubts about the
outcome of the forthcoming negotiations due to the fact that the
rebel delegation is not headed by Garang himself, but his deputy,
who the government believes not to have the final say.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA and several other rebel factions have been fighting
the Islamic government since 1983 for greater autonomy for the
Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
The government and four factions signed last April a peace
agreement, under which the southerners would be given the right to
self-determination at the end of a transitional period. But the
SPLA rejected to sign the agreement.

LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Faustino Asprilla of Columbia is
looking forward to a return match against Barcelona on November
26, inspired by a fast recoverence from a groin muscle tear.
</P>
<P>
The Newcastle playmaker injuried his groin muscle when he was
converting a free-kick in a Champions-Cup match against Dynamo
Kiev when the Magpies tied 2-2. He had not been expected to come
back until December.
</P>
<P>
The genius Columbian played a hat-trick in the first-leg clash
on September 17 when the English Premier club beat Barcelona 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle lost 1-0 at PSV Eindhoven last Wednesday after
Asprilla's absence.
</P>
<P>
To gain top place in the group, Newcastle needs a maximus

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Algeria to Implement Reform Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- France today called on Algerian
government to implement its plan on political, economic and social
reforms, and took note of the criticism by Algerian parties about
the situation of the local elections held last week in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of European Affairs Pierre Moscovici
strongly criticized on Sunday the situation of the local elections
held last Thursday, in which the Algerian opposition denounced
"flagrant and massive fraud."
</P>
<P>
"While the 15 European Union countries can approve an
institutional process which begins to improve (in Algeria), one
can also be sometimes unsatisfied with the way in which democracy
moves ahead (in the country), notably in case of the latest local
elections which showed a certain step backward in comparison with
previous votings, " said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that France had taken note of the criticism by Algerian
parties about the lack of transparency in the local elections last
week.
</P>
<P>
"What is essential is that these local elections should have
let Algerians mark their rejection of violence as well as their
hope to overcome by peace and voting the crisis which their
country knows," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France hopes that elected institutions could allow Algerians to
reconcile among themselves and "concretize the objectives of
economic, social and political reform and opening which the
Algerian authorities have announced."

<HEADLINE> Strong PC Market Growth Seen in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- World personal computer market
showed a six percent growth in the third quarter of 1997,
according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The performance was 16 percent higher than the same period
1996, the Massachussets-based IDC said today in its preliminary
data release.
</P>
<P>
Analysts at the IDC, a global information technology market
research and consulting company, attribute the boom to increasing
demand driven by lower price points and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
Supported by a healthy economy, the United States market
sustained a 20 percent surge for the third straight quarter, IDC
said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's market declined 12 percent in the quarter, the first
plunge in 18 months, it added.
</P>
<P>
Other regions displayed mixed results with Asia Pacific
fetching 20 percent growth and Western Europe a
better-than-expected growth of 14 percent, driven by strong
demand in the business and consumer markets of France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. company Compaq was the best performer with a 52 percent
increase in its worldwide unit shipments due to its new price
strategy. Its worldwide market share widened to 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Leader Hun Sen to Run for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Hun Sen, Cambodia's second
prime minister and vice-president of the Cambodian People's Party
(CPP), said today that he will be the only candidate from the CPP
to run for the position of prime minister in next year's polls.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told reporters at the conclusion of the 23rd session of
the fifth congress of the CPP that his candidacy will not change
this year or the next year.
</P>
<P>
Terming the reports on the split in the CPP as sheer
fabrication, Hun Sen noted, "There will be no discussion on who is
to be the CPP candidate for the post of prime minister as long as
I am alive."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CPP spokesman Khieu Kanharith told reporters that
the three-million member CPP will try to get 73 of the National
Assembly's 120 seats in next year's polls.
</P>
<P>
The CPP is optimistic about its victory in the polls, Kanharith
said. Even if the CPP lost, the winner could not rule the country
without the CPP's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"If the CPP wins, we will also establish a coalition government
with other parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Central Committee of the CPP said
the elections next May will be organized by Cambodia and
supervised by the international community. The CPP said it will
respect the results of the polls.
</P>
<P>
However, Kanharith said the CPP will seek to conduct the polls
on May 23 next year. He cannot, however, rule out the possibility
of postponing the polls until next September.
</P>
<P>
The communique also said that a special national congress of
the CPP will be held in February 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The earnings of self-employed in
Canada has become more polarized, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the averaged self-employed person in this country made
30,800 dollars, which was about 91 percent earned by the average
employee.
</P>
<P>
At the low end of the scale, about 45 percent of the
self-employed made less than 20,000 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the other end, 4.2 percent of the self-employed made more
than 100,000 dollars, according to today's Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The highest earners among the self-employed were business
owners in the social sciences -- people like lawyers, economists,
sociologists and psychologists.
</P>
<P>
They earned an average of 85,000 dollars and were followed by
those in medical occupations, who earned 73,800 dollars, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The self-employed accounted for 75 percent of the new jobs
created in Canada between 1989 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
They now account for about 17 percent of all workers in this
country, up from 14 percent in 1989.

</P>
<P>
"It is an enormously important meeting," Ruggiero told
participants from WTO members and representatives and ministers

He called on the participants to produce meaningful results,
results that will be of real and practical significance to the

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 people from various
countries joined a demonstration in Berlin today protesting over
the alleged discrimination against Scientology in Germany.
</P>
<P>
At a rally outside the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church in
central Berlin, U.S. actor John Travolta said: "The primary
problem in Germany is the unfair persecution of Scientology and
other minority religions by the government without factual
justification."
</P>
<P>
Scientologists in Germany have been put under surveillance by
the country's domestic security service since early this year when
interior ministers from 16 federal states concluded the
organization posed a threat to democracy.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, neo-Nazis and left extremist parties are being
likewise treated.
</P>
<P>
Bonn had also considered using overseas intelligence service to
monitor Scientologists abroad, and only decided not to do this 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Recognized as a religious sect in the United States,
Scientology is but accepted as an enterprise with economic goals
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a statement refuting an accusation by a U.S. senator
that Scientology was being persecuted in Germany, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel described it as a "quasi-totalitarian"
organization.

PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
announcement by the new president of Congo Republic, Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, to set up a government of national union, after
the latter was sworn in as president last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good thing," said French Foreign Ministry

He said that in his swearing-in speech, Sassou-Nguesso had

which should lead to general elections" in Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France hopes the United Nations can
"play a role" in the national reconciliation process of Congo
Republic, including sending observers to supervise the process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French ambassador to Congo, Raymond Cesaire, is
now in the Congolese economic capital Pointe-Noire to seek the

Sassou-Nguesso for smuggling arms to the troops of former

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is set to revisit Libya Wednesday, the second of
its kind within five days, the president office announced in Cape
Town today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's return to Libya would be "a very brief visit
touching on matters arising out of his recent visit there," the
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He will be making no announcement and is not intending to hold
a press conference in connection with the visit, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The president office declined to give more details about
Mandela's coming visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
But government officials who asked not to be identified said
Mandela would give Libyan leader M. Gaddafi an official
decoration and tell him attitudes of Commonwealth leaders to
impose sanctions against the north African country.
</P>
<P>
Last week Mandela had a one-day visit to Libya where he held
talks with Gaddafi over possible resolutions for the Lockerbie
dispute. He is now in Edinburgh, Scotland for a Commonwealth
summit which is due to end today.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie dispute was erupted after an explosion of a
Pan-Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. The air
tragedy claimed 270 lives.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain claimed that Libya intelligents
were involved in the incident, and demanded two Libyan suspects
be handed over for trial in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya's resistance to the Western allegation and extradition
demand has resulted in United Nations' sanctions.

OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada is insisting on
continuing to screen foreign investment under a proposed
multilateral agreement to liberate global investment, a report
said today.
</P>
<P>
As talks resume this week in Paris, the Canadian government is
pushing for a long list of exemptions that would allow the
screening of foreign takeovers to ensure companies maintain
research and employment in this country.
</P>
<P>
According to a leaked copy of the list, Canada is also seeking
the right to adopt or maintain any social program that is in the
public interest and to maintain foreign ownership restrictions in
telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
The 29 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) are hoping to conclude a deal by next spring
that would ensure countries provide the same treatment to foreign
corporations as they do to their domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
Other OECD countries have also submitted reservation lists,
though the United States is pushing for a wide open deal,
according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Baltic States Dislike Russia's Security Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia
have expressed their dislike for the security guarantees offered
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The security guarantees proposed by Russia to the Baltic
nations are "nearly protectorate," Chairman of the Lithuanian
Parliament Vytautas Landsbergis told Interfax news agency today in
Vilnius, Capital of Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin gave the visiting Lithuanian president a document
Friday in Moscow on security guarantees for the Baltic countries.
</P>
<P>
"A protectorate status cannot be imposed through a unilateral
decision," Landsbergis said. "To put the proposals into practice,
Lithuania would have to accept them by signing an appropriate
agreement and becoming Russia's guarded state," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Lithuanian constitution bans such
post-Soviet defense unions, saying that "if the West confirms that
the security guarantees will contribute to speeding up the Baltic
countries' entry into the European Union and NATO, Yeltsin's
proposals can be assessed positively."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Estonian foreign ministry said that Estonia is
guided by the principle of "indivisibility of European security,"
and cannot rely on guarantees offered by one country.
</P>
<P>
An Estonian diplomat said the Estonian foreign ministry has not
yet received the complete statement from Russia and that "upon
receiving it we shall thoroughly analyze the Russian proposals."
</P>
<P>
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said on October 25 that Latvia
has not demanded any security guarantees from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Security guarantees are not the sort of things one side
chooses for the other," Ulmanis said.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia stated on many occasions that
only membership in NATO can fully guarantee their security. The
three countries are therefore actively seeking admission to NATO,
which is strongly opposed by Russia.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Act for Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official today
urged member states of the Common Market for the Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) to take action for a co-ordinated
regional development in transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day meeting on transport and communications held
here in the capital, Dawson Lupunga, Minister of Communications
and Transport, said development in this regard is key to the
promotion of economic development and the integration of the
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency Zana quoted Lupunga as saying that without
transport and communications, trade and interaction in the region
would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern over the slow pace and in some cases
the "outright failure" by some COMESA members to implement
programs aimed at achieving the intended goal of the 23-member
regional body.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which was established in 1994 and groups 23 members
including Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Sudan and Zambia,
aims to achieve a full free trade area by 2000, a customs union
with zero tariff and free movement of people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some members, said the Zambian minister, have not yet
established what are called multi-disciplinary working groups and
mechanisms for monitoring and facilitating the implementation of
agreed COMESA programs.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga also urged COMESA and its secretariat to keep in step
with the current development trends in information technology
strategies so as to enhance the exchange of vital information
between the secretariat and its member states.
</P>
<P>
He said COMESA members should ensure that the advanced cargo
information system, in which Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia
have taken the lead, is implemented for all the railway networks
as well as all major ports of the member states.

<HEADLINE> Regional Body on Lake Victoria Poised to Take off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Three years after it was
created, the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization aimed at
protecting the eco-system of Lake Victoria is about to begin
operations, the East African newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ntiba (only identified with one name), executive secretary
of the agency, said Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania will contribute up
to 7,000 U.S. Dollars each year toward a common fund for the
organization based in Jinja, eastern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
However, 21,000 Dollars put together by the three governments
will constitute only 10 percent of the total budget of the body
for the next five years, said Ntiba.
</P>
<P>
The remaining funding is expected to come from
non-governmental organizations including the Global Environmental
Facility, he added.
</P>
<P>
The body will be focused on coordinating efforts by the three
governments to preserve the environment of the lake and to
improve the lakeside industry.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water lake, the second largest in the world, is the
main source of livelihood for more than 40 million people in the
eastern African region.
</P>
<P>
However, the eco-system of Lake Victoria has been under threat
since 1990 from the fast-spreading water hyacinth, which is
choking the lake and hindering fishing and lake travel.
</P>
<P>
Each of the three eastern African states has been grappling
with the water hyacinth but none has yet come up with concrete
plans to control the weed.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government recently rejected the use of chemicals
to curb the spread of the water hyacinth, arguing that it could
adversely affect the country's lucrative fish industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today condemned a joint U.S.-South Korean
military exercise as an aggressive maneuver for a possible
surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
"Facts prove that the exercise is not an 'annual exercise
to 'test the command, control and communications systems,' but an
aggressive maneuver for launching a surprise attack on the DPRK,"
a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"No one can predict when the current military drill will
develop into real war against the DPRK," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The military drill, code-named "Foal Eagle," began on Monday
and is scheduled to end on November 6.
</P>
<P>
"In order to defend the security of the country and the people,
we will not rule out sacred war against the aggressors, " the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the United States and South Korea "had better
act with discretion, mindful that today's one wrong step may
result in an irrevocable repentance."

<HEADLINE> No Plan to Join EMU Before Next Election: Brown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) - The British Government does not
intend to join a single European Currency before the next
election, Chancellor Gordon Brown said.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor told parliament this afternoon: "Barring some
fundamental and unforeseen circumstances, making a decision during
this parliament to join is not realistic."
</P>
<P>
Brown's statement was aimed to return the government an even
keel after several weeks of buffeting by markets and media over
its handling of the EMU decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chancellor said the Treasury had concluded that in
principle membership of the single currency would be of benefit to
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Brown made it clear that if the economic benefits were "clear
and unambiguous", Britain should join EMU.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chancellor restated that any recommendation to join
would have to be approved in a referendum.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Plagued by Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The heavy rains of the Deyr
season continue to inflict losses to both human lives and
livestock in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people have died when they were drowned in
torrential floods from Jubba river which burst the bank of the
regions of Middle Jubba, Bay Bakol and Gedo of Southwestern
Somalia as heavy rain kept pouring down in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the town of Tiyeglow in Bakol
region, 30 houses were destroyed as the water rose to a height of
1.5 meters above the ground level, thus forcing residents of the
town to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
In the village of Biyoley, also in Bakol region, the floods
have claimed the lives of five people, and destroyed 15 houses.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mo'allim Iman, an elder of Bay region, told the
reporters that the villages of Gof-Guduud, Bonkay, Ufurow and
Labatan Jirow were also severely affected by the floods and
rains.
</P>
<P>
In Gof-Gudud village, said the Iman, five children died and
more than 10,000 quintals of beans and sorghum were washed away.
All business activities in the region were stopped with all the
roads linking Qansah Dhere, Korombod and Habal Barbaar cut off by
the waters, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rahanwein elders in the region said, hundreds of families are
now fleeing the waters to the nearby main towns. Many of them are
now stranded in between the villages without enough food while a
large number have moved to the towns of Huddor, Luq and Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
According to the elders, so far there are no aid agencies
operating to cope with the floods and rains of the season as the
elders keep appealing for the international community for dry
food, medicine, tents and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The town of Luq in the Gedo region has been isolated by waters
from other neighboring villages and towns after all roads leading
to and fro it were filled with the waters.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, spokesman for Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) in Mogadishu has called on the international NGOs to
help the Rahanwein communities whose people cannot run to the
towns of Baidoa or Huddor for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle said, as many as 360 goats and 45 houses were
destroyed by the waters in the areas which were under their
control since the beginning of this week.

<HEADLINE> WTO: No Truly "Global" Trading System Without Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero said here today that the
world can never have a truly "global" trading system without the
full integration of the least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero was speaking at the opening session of an inter-agency
meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least Developed Countries'
(LDCs) Trade development jointly sponsored by six
inter-governmental agencies, which are WTO, UNCTAD, the
International Trade Center (ITC, a joint subsidiary of UNCTAD and
WTO), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormously important meeting," Ruggiero told
participants from WTO members and representatives and ministers
from 39 LDCs, present at the meeting to be held on October 27-28.
"It is important because for the first time we are bringing all
the energy of the multilateral system to bear on the problem of
economic marginalization."
</P>
<P>
"It is important because without the full integration of the
LDCs we can never have a truly "global" trading system," Ruggiero
went on. "And it is important because it represents a tangible
sign of the extent to which your countries have embraced openness,
integration and trade as the keys to economic development."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero called on the participants to produce meaningful
results, results that will be of real and practical significance
to the LDCs.
</P>
<P>
He gave three reasons why the meeting should produce concrete
and practical results: first, by opening up new market access
opportunities for LDCs exports; second, by designing an integrated
approach to building trade capacity which reflects the real needs
of the LDCs themselves; and third, by using new technology to open
a window of new opportunity between North and South, a window
through which information, knowledge and ideas can flow freely and
productively.
</P>
<P>
Participants will have a series of roundtable sessions during
the two-day meeting. The secretariats of the six agencies taking
part in the meeting will offer assistance in their respective
areas of expertise to the 12 LDCs for which roundtable sessions
have been organized.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, WTO members will have a chance to announce
steps they are taking, on an autonomous basis, to enhance their
market access for imports for LDCs.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda to Sign Pipeline Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Uganda are expected
to sign a contract Wednesday for extending an oil pipeline from
western Kenya's Eldoret to Kampala, the capital of Uganda, a
local report said today.
</P>
<P>
The contract, funded by the European Investment Bank, is to be
signed in Kampala by Kenyan Minister of Finance Musalia Mudavadi
and his Ugandan counterpart Jehoash Mayanja-Nkangi, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The Eldoret-Kampala oil pipeline would reduce transport costs
not only to Uganda, but also to Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda currently pays 20 U.S. Dollars for per ton of oil from
Eldoret instead of Mombasa, the Indian Ocean port of Kenya. It
always complains that it spends too much money on road transport.
</P>
<P>
Kenya regulations prohibit the ferrying of fuel from Nairobi
or Mombasa by road, but rail haulage is still permitted.
</P>
<P>
Although the Eldoret pipeline allows transporters a two-day
return journey by road, compared to more than four days if the
oil is fetched from Mombasa, the latter alternative is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
But Kenya argues that its demand that all oil destined for
Uganda should be collected from Eldoret is a way of curbing the
destruction of its roads by heavy haulage trucks.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Uganda is also actively engaged in the
proposed Dar-es-Salaam-Mwanza oil pipeline project as an
alternative oil outlet.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Refuses to Return More Land to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here this evening that no more land will
be handed over to the Palestinians unless the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) fulfill its commitment to fight terror.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address to the Knesset (parliament), Netanyahu
said that Israel wants to advance the peace process, but there
will be no unilateral fulfillment of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the PNA for not doing enough in fighting terrorism,
saying it is still violating its commitment and pledge to combat
terror.
</P>
<P>
He declared that Israel will continue Jewish settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem will
remain as the unified capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's relations with Syria, he said that any
agreement with Syria must take into account that Syria should not
maintain its capability of launching surprise attacks against
Israel and that Israel must continue to retain water sources in
the north bordering Syria.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention if Israel will continue to occupy the Golan
Heights, but said the Heights is very important to Israel and vital
to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
As for the South Lebanon issue, he said that Israel will not
withdraw its troops unilaterally. Any agreement related to South
Lebanon must be linked to the dismantle of the Hezbollah (Party of
God) forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Iran's missile issue, he said that Israel will,
both in political and intelligential ways, try its best to reduce
the threat of Iran's buildup of long-range missiles with the help
of Russia, because that poses a direct threat to Israeli security
and existence.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset, which opened its winter session today after a
three-months recess, faced a stormy sitting from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
As Netanyahu touched upon the proposed budget for 1998 with
deep cuts on education, health and military expenditure,
opposition parliament members (MPs) started attacking him for
leading the country into a mess.
</P>
<P>
The opposition MPs from Labor and Meretz parties hoped to turn
the vote of Netanyahu's policy address into a no-confidence
motion even if it means delaying the vote for a week.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Knesset has 120 members, with Netanyahu's coalition
government taking 66 seats.

<HEADLINE> Two More Sugar Acquisitions for AFB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) - Associated British Foods today
announced two further acquisitions in the drive to build its
presence in the growing markets of China and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Through its British Sugar Overseas (BSO) subsidiary, the
company is acquiring a 70 percent holding in the former Xianghou
Country Luoxio Sugar Factory in Guangxi province, south western
China.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the joint venture, British Sugar's 13
million pounds (20.8 million US dollars) will be used to develop
the factory's capacity up to 80,000 tons of sugar per year from
its current capacity of 20,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Glinojeck Sugar Factory, one of Poland's largest and most
modern units, will invest 10 million pounds (16 million US
dollars) in a 41 percent stake with the intention of taking a
majority holding within six months.
</P>
<P>
Together with its partners, the North East Handling Company and
the UK's Treasury Ministry, it will develop the factory from its
current 750 tons per day of sugar, to over 1000 tons per day.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Rise as Attention Shifted to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's tuberculosis
(TB) cases have increased sharply as more attention have been
shifted to combat HIV/AIDS infection, according to a survey by
Southern Africa Control Initiative (SATCI).
</P>
<P>
The survey, made available today, says that at least one third
of Tanzania's TB cases are indirectly attributable to HIV/AIDS
infection. Tanzania is one of the countries where the onslaught
on HIV/AIDS has caused more TB deaths.
</P>
<P>
The report said Tanzania's TB control program used to serve as
a model in the world for controlling TB effectively with the
highest TB cure rates from 1977 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
Matters changed when the country was slammed by the deadly
HIV/AIDS in 1984. "As a result of HIV's onslaught, the TB control
program was swamped with new TB cases," it said.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the global average on TB incidence was 60 cases per
100,000 people for last year, in Tanzania it is 134 per 100,000.
There were 39,847 TB cases in Tanzania then with 24,980 newly
infected.
</P>
<P>
According to SATCI, eleven Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) countries are struggling under "the greatest TB
burden" with 168 TB cases per 10,000 people, nearly three times
the world average level.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, SADC countries had an estimated 227,156 people
reported to have TB with 152,198 of them found out to be newly
infected. Tanzania is the second in TB cases after South Africa
which had 84,750.
</P>
<P>
TB is an infectious disease whose bacteria can remain
undetected in the body for many years. It attacks many parts of
the body especially the lungs.
</P>
<P>
Within the SADC region, the spread of the disease has been
fuelled by large immigration worker flows, refugees and periodic
surges of displaced people.
</P>
<P>
"The mass movements generally result in interruptions of TB
treatment and disruptive changes in treatment schedules and
medications," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise of HIV/AIDS has caused dramatic rise in TB
deaths and its spread across the region especially in the past
decade.

<HEADLINE> US, UK Welcome Ideas of Ending Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain would welcome any intervention to break the deadlock over
the venue for the trial of two Libyans suspected of the 1988
Lockerbie Bombing, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
said today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki told reporters in Pretoria that President Nelson Mandela
was interested in facilitating a conclusion of the Lockerbie
dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied both the government of the U.S. and the UK
will appreciate any intervention which breaks the logjam," He
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the suspects might be tried in South Africa, Mbeki
said this was still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the families of the Scottish victims on
Sunday said South Africa would be acceptable as a neutral venue
for the trial, an offer first made by Mandela in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A crisis was erupted between Libya and Western countries after
the United States and Britain claimed Libyan intelligents were
involved in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland that killed 270 people nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London have been demanding two Libyan suspects
be handed over for trial in Scotland. But Libya, the Organization
of African Unity and the Arab League insist that the suspects
should be tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who had a brief visit to Libya last week, came out in
support of Libyan leader Gaddafi's refusal to extradite the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought it is correct for any country to be
complainant, prosecutor and judge," Mandela told reporters at the
meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Edinburgh, Britain on last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a United Nations air and arms embargo
against Libya to be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Loses 200,000 Hectares of Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said today it is
losing its natural forest at an estimated rate of 200,000
hectares per annum.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a training course here, Tamena Tirunneh,
environmental planning senior expert with the Ministry of
Economic Development and Cooperation, said the depletion has an
adverse effect on natural resources and it is continuing unabated
to meet demands for fire wood, farmland and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to replenish the dwindling natural resources is very
minimal despite the fact that the agricultural sector, the
backbone of the national economy, is totally dependent on the
resources, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The training, jointly organized by the ministry and the
Environmental Protection Authority, was aimed at drawing
attention to issues related to environmental economics during
project planning and review.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage in Ethiopia is only three percent. The
decline of forest resources in the country has warned people to
protect their environment.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Receives 1.5 Billion Dollars Offset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has so far
received 1.5 billion U.S. dollars of investment commitment from
its arms suppliers under its Offset Program launched in 1992,
according to officials in charge of the Offset Program today.
</P>
<P>
They said the program is making steady progress with several
projects already up and running.
</P>
<P>
The offset program requires any foreign arms supplier winning
a contract worth more than 1 million Kuwaiti dinars (3.3 million
U.S. dollars) from the oil-rich emirate to reinvest 30 percent
of the contract's value in Kuwait or Kuwait's ventures abroad.
</P>
<P>
The program is mainly aimed at getting back some of the funds
which have poured out in defense contracts signed with mainly
its western allies since it started a massive rearmament plan
following the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 companies, almost exclusively defense companies,
have signed offset agreements with Kuwait, although a Japanese
civil company has also signed an offset deal.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Finance Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan told the Parliament
earlier that Kuwait currently had seven major offset projects
which are either being implemented or are under formation.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest projects approved under the offset program
is a plan to set up an aluminum plant with an annual capacity of
230,000 tons of aluminum. Raytheon Cooperation of the United
States is involved in the project. France and Britain also have
offset projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, most offset projects have been slow to get off the
ground and actual investment so far in the established offset
projects is about 50 million dollars, accounting for a small
fraction of the pledges, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, foreign companies rarely have to spend the full 30
percent of their contract's value.
</P>
<P>
After signing an offset agreement, a company must first
identify a suitable investment venture, have it approved and
then set up the new operation, which usually take three to five
years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Favors Preemptive Strike on Missile Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today he would favor launching preemptive
strikes to thwart missile and non-conventional weapon threats to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the statement in a key-note speech at an
international conference held in Tel Aviv to discuss missile and
non-conventional weapon proliferation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Israel, the United State, Europe and Jordan
presented papers to the meeting on weapon threats and the possible
establishment of certain regimes to prevent such threats.
</P>
<P>
The meeting put its emphasis on threats from Iran, Iraq, Syria
and Libya, which were alleged to have been striving to acquire
weapons of mass destruction. Mordechai said Israel must relate to
those threats and potential dangers "very seriously."
</P>
<P>
The minister outlined major factors in Israel's defense against
threats of long-range ballistic missiles and non-conventional
weapons:
</P>
<P>
- Israel will make every effort to prevent war; but in face of
threats from missiles with non-conventional warheads, it boasts
deterrent capabilities and will employ all necessary options at
disposal to prevent such threats.
</P>
<P>
- Israel has enough far-reaching capabilities to deal with
missile threats, including a missile-detecting system and the
"Arrow" missile-shooting system.
</P>
<P>
- Israel has the ability to strike all missile targets
threatening its security, including missile launchers and
storerooms.
</P>
<P>
- Israel owns a passive civil defense system to protect its
civilian population from missile threats, at least reducing the
possible casualties in attacks.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mordechai warned that if any of its enemies will
strike Israel with missiles and non-conventional weapons, it will
have to pay a heavy price since Israel will strike back hardly.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's remarks came as Israel was making efforts to
persuade Russia to halt its alleged transfer of missile technology
to Iran, which is deemed No. 1 military threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai met with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov this morning in Jerusalem to discuss Russian assistance
to Iran's weapons development programs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Foreign
Minister David Levy and other senior officials had already held
talks with Primakov in a bid to discourage Russia from continuing
its military cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Primakov strongly denied Russia's involvement in Iran's missile
and nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai expressed his regrets over Russia's refusal to accept
the Israeli demand.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Calls for Respecting Signed Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ramallah, (Palestine) October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov today called on both Israel and the
Palestinians to respect the obligations to their signed agreements
in a bid to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the call here at a joint press conference with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat after
a three-hour meeting to discuss the situation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that all parties, especially the Israeli
government, should respect the duties to carry out the Oslo
accords and other agreements.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Palestinians to fulfill its commitments to
the agreements by curbing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that all parties will stick to their
obligations in the branch of security, because all terror acts
harm the Palestinian people and their cause," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Russia's continued support to the PNA and the
Palestinian cause for an independent state, which he said Russia
would recognize as soon as it is established.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov called for the resumption of the peace
talks between Syria, Lebanon and Israel, saying it is very
important to achieve a stable and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed deep gratitude to Russia for its support to
the Palestinian cause and its efforts to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He called on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to mediate and
help save the peace process as a co-sponsor along with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, arriving here Sunday after visiting Lebanon, Syria
and Israel, was originally scheduled to visit Jordan later today
after meeting with Arafat. But he has decided to return to
Damascus for another round of talks with Syiran President Hafez
al-Assad as he reportedly has come up with "new ideas" on resuming
peace talks after the meetings with Syrian and Israeli leaders.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Action-Oriented International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- In strengthening
inter-state cooperation in drug control as well as in adopting a
balanced drug control strategy against the illicit supply of and
demand for narcotics, the international community needed to be
more action-oriented and enhance international and interregional
Multi-level cooperation, Chinese delegate Diao Mingsheng stressed
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and
Cultural) of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Diao Mingsheng said the international community had achieved new
progress in implementing the Global Program of Action and relevant
international conventions and in strengthening the cooperation in
the control and interdiction of narcotics drugs and psychotropic
substances.
</P>
<P>
Diao said on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the 1988
Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances before the advent of the 21st century, it
would be necessary for the international community to deliberate
on the global drug situation over the last decade and express to
mankind its strong political will to improve and enhance
international cooperation in drug control.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate said the political will of the
international community to strengthen cooperation had been well
reflected in the preparatory work for the Special Session of the
General Assembly on drug control and the discussions and
consultations were now well under way on documents for the
Session.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Special session of the General
Assembly on drug control to be held next year would be more
result-oriented and produce documents that would, in a positive,
practical and effective way, constitute the basis for guiding the
international drug-control cooperation in the next century.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Qatar Foreign Minister Hamad
Ibin Jassim Jaber al Thani arrived here this afternoon for a brief
visit, the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Wam news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the minister's visit was part of Qatar's
efforts to expound to its Arab neighbors its insistence in hosting
the controversial Fourth Middle East and North Africa economic
conference in its capital Doha next month.
</P>
<P>
The conference, traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the world, was strongly opposed by
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, the UAE and Saudi
Arabia for lack of progress in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Those Arab countries held Israel's Netanyahu government
responsible for the expansion of Jewish settlements, confiscation
of Arab lands, demolition of Palestinian houses and worsening of
the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister is expected to explain to UAE officials the
reasons for Doha's determination to convene the gathering despite
opposition from most Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has argued that such a meeting is aimed at boosting trade
cooperation among world countries and it is "purely an economic
one" and should not be connected with political issues.

</P>
<P>
Speaking after presenting the traditional "Freedom Scroll" to
Mandela, Lord Provost Eric Milligan said earlier this year
Edinburgh's councillors unanimously voted to offer the award to
recognize Mandella's "personal lifelong fight for the freedom of
South Africa".

bestow on any individual and we are proud of honoring someone
whose personal strength, compassion and dignity has made him
admired around the world," Milligan said.

"At a political level, President Mandela has similarly proved
an inspiration for the example he has shown in bringing people
together and developing a shared vision for the future," he added.

<P>
Mandela, who is in Edinburgh attending Commonwealth summit,
said that he would regard it as a tribute to the whole South
Africa nation for the courage in the struggle for freedom.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The four-day 1997
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) ended at the
Edinburgh International Conference Center this afternoon with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair calling it an "immensely
successful" summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final press conference, Blair expressed
satisfaction over the achievements made over the the special theme
of the summit: "Trade, Investment and Development -- the Road to
Common Prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is also Chairman of the meeting, said that the
successful first ever Commonwealth Business Forum held in London
last week "reflects the significant change for the Commonwealth on
economic issues."
</P>
<P>
"Putting behind some of our controversies of the past, we are
now able to focus on issues of trade, investment, jobs and shared
prosperity for the future," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe very much together with other heads of government
we've prepared the Commonwealth to face the challenges of the next
century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the final Edinburgh Communique, the Commonwealth leaders
hailed the Edinburgh Economic Declaration, issued on Saturday, as
a "fitting complement to the Harare Commonwealth Declaration in
1991."
</P>
<P>
The Harare Declaration, which put forward fundamental political
principles for the Commonwealth, is commonly regarded the
political pillar of the institution.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Nigeria, whose membership was suspended in 1995
because of alleged human rights violations, the Commonwealth
leaders expressed their deep concern and decided to maintain the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
The communique also points out that if the Nigerian government
failed to improve its human rights records by October 1 1998, the
Commonwealth would impose tough measures including mandatory oil
embargo, a ban on air-links with Nigeria and even expulsion from
the 54-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth leaders decided that the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) should continue to its standing
ministerial mechanism "to address serious and persistent violations
of the principles of Harare Declaration."
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years after the Edinburgh summit, the new
ministerial group would consist of the following eight countries:
Barbardos, Boswana, Britain, Canada, Ghana, Malaysia, New Zealand
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
On the criteria of admitting new Commonwealth members, the
Communique said that in order to become a new Commonwealth member,
an applicant country should have a "constitutional association"
with an existing Commonwealth member and should also promise to
comply with Commonwealth principles set out in the Harare
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Commonwealth leaders expressed their views on
the Cyprus problem, fighting international terrorism and other
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Under agreement reached among Commonwealth members, South
Africa will host the next Commonwealth summit meeting in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Former French President Criticizes Tendency to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing today criticized the tendency in France and
abroad to defame France through the on-going trial of former Vichy
official Maurice Papon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with daily Le Monde, d'Estaing said that the
role played by Vichy France during World War II is uncomparable
with that of Germany, which he said "was the player of history"
while France was subjected to its military occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Many rejoiced, notably in the Anglo-Saxon media, at an
affirmation of a recognition of guiltiness of France," said
d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
Papon, a former official who served under the Vichy
collaboration regime led by Marshal Philippe Petain, is being
tried for crimes against humanity because of his role in the
deportation of 1,690 Jews from southwest to Nazi death camps from
1942 to 1944, when he was in charge of the "Jewish Question" in
the Gironde Prefecture of southwest France.
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing said that there exists "an expectation, a desire to
hear proclaim the guiltiness of France" by the court in Bordeaux
where Papon is standing trial.
</P>
<P>
Papon also served as the budget minister of a conservative
cabinet under d'Estaing in 1978.
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing said that during World War II, France was "less
defeated than it does not want to believe... and less collaborated
(with Germany) than one tries today to present it to."
</P>
<P>
"How many French houses are open to the Germans? Very few.
Which cities applauded when German garrison troops paraded through
them? None," said the former president.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the primary information on the role of
Papon during the occupation was released in 1981 and between the
two rounds of presidential election, when Francois Mitterrand was
posing as a presidential candidate for the Socialist Party against
the rightwing candidate, who was d'Estaing himself.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, who won the presidency, refused to recognize the
responsibility of France for the deportation of 76,000 Jews from
France to Germany.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac recognized in 1995 that the "French
state" did the "irreparable" by deporting the Jews to Germany.

instead of quantity and try to have local communities benefited
from relevant natural resources, will represent the main trend of
future world travel market, the conference was told.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which is held here, with the theme as "eco-tourism
-- Charting the way forward," discussed today how to draft
eco-tourism principles and improve eco-tourism operation on the
continent in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
It was said to be the first-ever of this kind held in east
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Global and regional case studies on successful eco-tourism
models are to be discussed at the meeting which will end on
November 3.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the conference was an exhibition of
community-based tourism activities, showcasing the unique
heritage, handicrafts and tourism development efforts of Kenya's
40-plus diverse cultures.
</P>
<P>
More than 260 delegates from the U.S., Britain, South Africa,
Mexico, Brazil, Belize, Tanzania, Swaziland, Uganda, Australia,
Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and other
countries attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>

international tourist arrivals, up 4.6 percent from the previous
year, according to the latest data from the World Tourism
Organization.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A multi-billion-dollar gas
project off Canada's east coast got a go-ahead today from a panel
of energy and environmental regulators.
</P>
<P>
The panel, led by Canada's National Energy Board, recommended
that the 2-billion-dollar (1.4 billion USD) Sable gas project be
allowed to proceed.
</P>
<P>
After months of hearings, the panel also approved the
one-billion-dollar Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline, which will
carry gas through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick provinces to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Gas pools around Canada's Sable Island are estimated to contain
142 billion cubic meters of gas, more than twice Canada's
consumption in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The total potential of Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia is thought
to be at more than three times of that.

today decided in Edinburgh, Scotland, that it is not ready to
re-admit Nigeria into the 53-nation organization but it will not
impose new sanctions against Abuja at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted a communique issued at the
end of the Commonwealth summit as saying that the heads of
government expressed satisfaction with Nigeria's political
transition program and decided to allow it to complete it.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, however, warned at a press
conference that measures would be taken against Nigeria "if there
is no progress in the transition program by October next year".
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in November
1995 after its government executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military government led by General Sani Abacha
has announced a transition program which promises to return power
to elected civilian government by October next year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the transition program, the government has approved
the registration of five political parties and held a local
election on party basis in March, which is generally regarded as
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
Some pro-democracy groups, however, have criticized the
government for being insincere in implementing the transition
program. They also hold that the government has not done enough
in improving its human rights records.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they have been advocating for further sanctions on
Nigeria and even for its expulsion from the Commonwealth.

<HEADLINE> China Sticks to Its Stance on U.N. Membership Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China adheres to its
principled position on the scale of assessments of the United
Nations, China's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Fifth Committee of the 52nd
Session of the General Assembly, he said the current scale method
on the basis of full consultations of the entire membership, is
fair and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Such a method has basically reflected the principle of capacity
to be set forth in the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's objection to the concept of so-called
"responsibility to pay" as it is "a proposal of money for power in
a disguised form" violating the principle of capacity to pay.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is an inter-government international organization
composed of sovereign member states, not a share-holding company
or a club of the rich, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any proposal to base a country's role in U.N. affairs on how
much it pays runs counter to the spirit of the Organization," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Regarding a saying that China agrees to consider lowering the
scale of assessments of the largest contributor, referring to the
United States, and raising China's scale of assessments to over
four percent, Qin said "this is someone's own wishful thinking."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation is of the view that adjusting the scale
of assessments involves the interests of the entire membership. It
should therefore be settled by the entire membership through
consultations on an equal and democratic basis," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"It can not and should not be determined by one or a few member
states in private," he said, adding that no country has the right
to lower its scale of assessments by itself let along willfully
demand a raise in other countries' scale of assessments," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"Any unilateral move on the question of assessments by placing
one's domestic legislation above the international community will
get nowhere," Qin went on to say.
</P>
<P>
However, He said, China does not take exception to appropriate
adjustments to the scale of assessments of member states for the
next three years on the basis of the principle of capacity to pay.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China needs several decades more to
catch up with the moderately developed countries even if it
maintains its current economic growth rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt to drastically increase overnight China's
assessments or even redouble it in disregard of objective facts
and the principle of capacity to pay is entirely unacceptable to
the Chinese Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the only effective way to solve the current U.N.
financial crisis is to pay up without delay the arrears by the
largest U.N. dues contributor.
</P>
<P>
"Attributing the crisis to the scale of assessments by certain
member states is ill-founded and is just an excuse for not
fulfilling financial obligations to the Organization," he pointed
out.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian elderly
woman has been seriously wounded after being attacked by a
man-eater crocodile at her home village.
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose right hand was fractured with multiple
injuries, is under medical treatment in the Tanzanian capital of
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old woman named Zena Selemani Kondo said she was
attacked last weekend by the crocodile as she was drawing water
from the Ruvu River in the eastern region of Morogoro.
</P>
<P>
"The huge reptile caught my arm as I lowered to collect
water," she said, adding that the crocodile then tried to pull
her into the river.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the scene, two men on each side of the river
immediately came to pounce on the crocodile and pull the victim
out.
</P>
<P>
The crocodile was later confused and started searching its
prey wildly but to no avail, the women added.
</P>
<P>
The river is notorious for similar incidents in which several
people have lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
The woman from Kipera Village was attended by doctors from a
military hospital nearby and then transferred to the Muhimbili
Orthopaedic Institute in Dar es Salaam.

<HEADLINE> Kabbah Hails Pact for His Return to Power as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Sierra Leonean President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah today reacted to the agreement signed last
week for his return to power by April next year, saying its
intention is honorable.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted him as saying at a news
conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, that his strategy is to "first
go home, work on a program of a good security system and
disarmament so that everybody can feel secure".
</P>
<P>
Kabbah is in Edinburgh to attend the Commonwealth summit of
heads of government, which closed today.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he is yet to be briefed on the accord signed
in Conakry, Guinea, between the military authority now in
Freetown and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
"I think the intentions of the agreement are very honorable,"
said Kabbah, "My impression is that they are trying to first get
rid of the arms and weapons in the country by encamping the
people who have them and disarming them before it will be safe
for me to resume my duties."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also said that after the summit, he is going to
Brussels to ask the European Union for a program of assistance to
rehabilitate and rebuild his country.
</P>
<P>
Elected only in March last year, Kabbah was overthrown in a
military coup on May 25. The international society has been
demanding he be reinstated to power.
</P>
<P>
Major Johnny Kromah, who came to power after the coup,
announced previously that he is not ready to quit before the year
2001. This led to the breakdown of the first round of
negotiations between him and ECOWAS in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Last week's agreement came after a global oil and arms embargo
on Sierra Leone by the United Nations and continuous clashes
between Kromah's soldiers and the west African intervention
forces which have been in Freetown immediately after the coup.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah to Announce New Recruiting Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah secretary-
general Sheikh Nasrallah has said that he would announce soon a
new recruiting policy for the resistance, local newspaper the
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech last week commemorating the 40th day of his son's
death during a battle against Israeli troops, Nasrallah said that
he would announce the details of the new policy this week, the
paper quoted an unidentified source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said that Hezbollah, or Party of God, had studied
carefully and taken into consideration all factors relating to the
more lenient new policy, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah would be more open for any "honest Lebanese" to join
in a comfortable way, regardless of their religion or political
affiliation, Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
"This announcement concerns all those wishing to participate
in military operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the war against Israel was not only
dependent on weapons, but on reviving the unity of the Arabs as
well in facing the Israeli menace.
</P>
<P>
"This is the responsibility of all Islamic movements and
political parties in the Arab world, regardless of their ideology
or background," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, backed by Iran, is fighting to drive the
2,500-strong Israeli occupation army out of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes for Improved Ties with Tunisia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's First Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah today
described Kuwait's ties with Tunisia as "good and progressing" and
hoped for more improvement in the future.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah was speaking in an interview after meeting with
Tunisian International Cooperation and Foreign Investments
Minister Mohammad Ghannouchi who arrived here Saturday on a
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that he was fully satisfied with the
"progress of Kuwaiti-Tunisian relations" and that Ghannouchi's
visit "helped boosts all domains of economic, investment and
development cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today a Kuwaiti Airways Corp. airplane landed in Tunis
for the first time in seven years, resuming air links between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries soured after Tunisia was
accused of having sided with Iraq during the seven-month Iraqi
occupation of the emirate and the Gulf War in 1991. But recent
years saw a full normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has invested about 250 million dollars in Tunisia's
tourism sector. Its exports to the African state grew by half from
1994 to 1996 to reach 3 million dinars (9.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Tunisian exports to Kuwait climbed to nearly 6.4
million dollars last year from slightly over 1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Tunisian minister said Sunday that the two
countries would sign an accord to encourage and protect
investments.
</P>
<P>
"Tunisia seeks to encourage more Kuwaiti investments to include
other sectors of industry, agriculture, services and tourism,"
Ghannouchi said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that his visit would give an impetus to
cooperation and improved relations, as well as opening new
spheres through signing the investment protection agreement.

<HEADLINE> Russian Grain Harvest Nearly Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian state grain production
totaled 84.7 million tons, 16.3 million tons more than 1996,
and the yield had risen 0.3 tons to 1.94 tons per hectare, the
Interfax quoted Ministry of Agriculture and Food's crop chief Ivan
Gridasov as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, only 9 percent of the crop area,
600,000 hectares of grain, left to harvest as of October 25.
</P>
<P>
Gridasov said that 294,000 hectares of maize had been cleared,
44 percent of the crop area and 104,000 hectares more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Russia is expected to produce about 85 million tons of grain
in all this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gridasov said, the sugarbeet harvest was causing
serious concern. Machinery could not be used properly due to heavy
rains in some areas, and just 480,000 hectares of crop had been
harvested, 53 percent of the target and 282,000 hectares less than
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
He noted that farmers had harvested 1.86 million hectares of
sunflower, 681,000 hectares less than last year, 94,000 hectares
of flax-fiber, 39,000 hectares less, and 251,000 hectares of
potatoes, 49,000 hectares less.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seed reserves in Russia as a whole contained 9.243
million tons of grain and grain legume seeds, 96 percent of the
requirement.
</P>
<P>
Gridasov said there would be a shortage of some 300,000 tons
of grain seed, 20,000 tons of which maize seed, for next year's
crop.

<HEADLINE> C. African States Urged to Settle Issues Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos today called on central African countries to settle
regional issues through dialogue and consultations in a bid to
find an immediate and lasting resolution.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here during a summit with his counterparts
from Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
According to Dos Santos, some central African countries seemed
to have been turned into a stage for launching destructive wars,
with their people suffering and economies severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, some countries have been used in the
interests of other nations as tools for creating instability and
chaos.
</P>
<P>
The president cited the power change in former Zaire as the
beginning of a new era for peace, regional stability and
cooperation, during which countries will collaborate in solving
problems facing them.
</P>
<P>
Central Africa has at present come to a turning point, he
said, urging all countries in the region to boost multi-lateral
cooperation within the framework of the Economic Community of
Central African States (CEEAC) and regional security system.
</P>
<P>
CEEAC should become a major bridge linking up southern Africa,
eastern Africa and western Africa in order to establish a common
market in Africa, said the Angolan head of state.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos appealed to central African nations to take up five
measures, namely a good neighborly cooperative relation, a
collective security system; a regional cooperative system and
legislation to make full use of natural resources in a bid to
turn the region into a new center for social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The measures also include the establishment of democracy and
let it become a way to solve social, economic and cultural issues
and regular meeting between regional leaders to avoid conflicts
and promote peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three other presidents arrived in Luanda today at the
invitation of Dos Santos. The summit will mainly discuss the
impact of drastic changes in the Democratic Congo and Congo
Brazzaville on the region so as to achieve regional stability and
to enhance its economic development.

<HEADLINE> North-South Research Coop Vital to African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-president
Omar Ali Juma has urged developed countries to support research
activities in higher learning institutions in Africa to ensure
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Opening the African-Norwegian Universities' Conference in Dar
es Salaam today, Juma said universities in the developing
countries lack funds to conduct research.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to ensure sustainable economic development and
political stability in Africa, we must put emphasis on research,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Juma cited the key areas needing research, such as economic
reforms, poverty alleviation, agricultural production and animal
husbandry, environmental protection and control of religious and
ethnic conflicts which threaten democracy.
</P>
<P>
The vice president told the conference that inadequate funding
and material incentives have prompted many African scientists to
leave for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"This brain drain puts us into a vicious cycle of poverty
since African countries cannot record significant economic
development without effective introduction of science and
technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the vice president called on intellectuals
not to run away from their motherland, saying that "Africa will
be built by Africans themselves."
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania will raise budgetary allocation for research
activities if the financial situation improves.
</P>
<P>
"Africa needs the support of the developed countries like
Norway in conducting serious research into effective and
sustainable approaches to economic reforms," Juma noted.
</P>
<P>
He told over 110 delegates from 25 higher learning
institutions in Africa that another area that merits the
North-South cooperation in research is poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Juma also called for greater cooperation in agricultural
production and animal husbandry, saying productivity is low and
the marketing skills in this sector is poor.
</P>
<P>
He said there is also need to carry out serious research on
livestock keeping, including the fight against persisting
diseases like trypanomysis, rinderpest and foot and mouth
diseases.
</P>
<P>
On environmental protection, the vice president called for
urgent research in seeking viable alternative sources of energy
and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Land erosion is another serious problem needing research, he
said, adding that a great part of the continent is rapidly
turning to desert because of massive tree cutting for firewood
and building.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to developed countries to support research on
conflict management, saying peace is a prerequisite for economic
development and yet it remained elusive in Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Propose Open-Ended Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's special advisor for Cyprus will visit the island next
month to examine whether the two Cypriot sides are ready for
open-ended talks to settle the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
in Edinburgh, Britain where he is taking part in the Commonwealth
summit which concluded today, according to Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Clerides revealed that the U.N. chief had sent letters to
him, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and the governments of
Greece and Turkey concerning this issue.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Annan said his advisor Diego Cordovez will
visit Cyprus "to see whether the two sides are willing to start
open-ended talks to solve the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Cordovez's visit was also confirmed here today by
U.N. Resident Representative to Cyprus Gustave Feissel in his
statements at the Larnaca Airport on his return from New York,
where he conferred with Annan on the latest developments in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Feiseel said that Annan suggested in his letter a visit by
Cordovez during the second half of November to Cyprus, and also
to Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Feissel refrained from giving details about his meetings in
New York.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of Cyprus peace talks, sponsored by Cordovez, took
place this summer in the U.S. and Switzerland, which reached a
deadlock because of the Turkish Cypriot side's refusal to
negotiate unless the European Union withholds its decision to
start accession talks with Cyprus next spring.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island following
a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bizonal, bicommunal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Privatization on Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's privatization process
is on course, Jazzman Chikwakwa, Deputy Minister of Commerce,
Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day workshop for the Africa Privatization
Network here, Chikwakwa said the government is to complete
privatization, which was started soon after the current ruling
party won the country's first multi-party elections in 1991.
</P>
<P>
This must not mean that the government will be completely
de-linked from the business community and it will continue to
play its vital role of being a facilitator by ensuring that the
environment is conducive for investment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 11 African countries are participating in
the workshop on how to promote cooperation in implementation of
the privatization programs of the countries.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) country
director Niels Biering said on the occasion that it is important
for the countries to come together to give their experiences so
that they can learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
Privatization should not be performed in a vacuum for the mere
purpose of divesting public assets because the winds of change
are blowing in that direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Zambia Privatization Agency for transparency
and accountability in its work.
</P>
<P>
Africa Privatization Network chairman Hamza Zayyad called on
the member countries to give finance support to the organization
and urged non-member African countries to join the network.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed the
support of the Commonwealth to the demilitarization of Cyprus and
its condemnation of Turkey's threats to the east Mediterranean
island republic.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied because it reconfirms U.N. Security Council
resolutions which call for a single sovereignty and state in
Cyprus," said Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in Edinburgh,
where he was attending a four-day Commonwealth summit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, the president said he was
also content that the Commonwealth condemned "the bogus state in
the occupied areas and demand the withdrawal of foreign troops" in
its final communique.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
declared by Turkish Cypriots and recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in the communique the 54 Commonwealth
leaders adopt his proposal to demilitarize Cyprus and condemn
Turkish threats to partially annex occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed troops and took over the northern third of the
island in 1974 following a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
With 35,000 troops stationing there, Ankara has threatened to
partially annex the island if the European Union starts accession
talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In their five-page final communique, passed today in Edinburgh
at the end of the four-day summit, Commonwealth government leaders
reaffirmed their support for the sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity, and unity of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
They strongly supported the process of direct intercommunal
talks.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides expected that the Commonwealth will involve
itself in the Cyprus peace efforts if negotiations between the two
Cypriot sides take place.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku has
appointed as special envoy for Cyprus Krishnan Srinivasan, a
deputy secretary-general of Commonwealth for political affairs and
former Indian foreign minister.

UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- It is all the more
necessary to strengthen dialogue for international economic
cooperation in the lack of dynamism for the cooperation, a Chinese
delegate told the United Nations today.
</P>
<P>
China's Deputy Representative to the U. N. Wang Qun said at a

</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of the Economic and Financial
Committee which was working on the agenda "Renew the Dialogue on
Strengthening International Economic Cooperation through
Partnership".
</P>
<P>
Wang said U.N. member states should reach a new understanding
of international cooperation in a new situation, with a genuine
global partnership functioning on the basis of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative to respect the right of the developing
countries to choose their mode of development and that the
dialogue should be action-oriented and productive.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of the Agenda for Development and the review of
the follow-up to major international conferences should give much
impetus to our efforts to explore ways and means to transform
consensuses and commitments into actions," Wang added.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Up to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. increased by 0.2 percent to a record high in
September, the U.S. National Association of Realtors said today.
</P>
<P>
The home trade group said that existing home sales increased to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.32 million units, up from a
revised 4.31 million in August,
</P>
<P>
It was the highest level since the group began tracking sales
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of existing homes jumped by 11.7 percent in
the Northeast. They were unchanged in the South. But sales dropped
by 2.8 percent in the Midwest and 4.1 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that strong economic growth and plentiful jobs
are giving Americans the wherewithal to buy homes. The favorite
mortgage rates, which are near the low point for the year, have
also made homes more affordable.
</P>
<P>
The group also reported that the median price of an existing
home in the nation, meaning half sold for more and half for less,
was 125,600 dollars in September, up 6.6 percent from a year
earlier.

AMMAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Yemen announced today that it
will participate in the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic summit scheduled for next month in the Qatari capital
Doha.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh made the
announcement here at a press conference. He said Yemen will send a
low-level delegation to the meeting in protest of Israel's
hardline policy in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Jordan, however, Saleh expressed Yemen's
readiness to be represented by a high-level delegation if progress
was made in the peace process. The Yemeni president was on a
two-day visit to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Saleh listed an Israeli halt of Jewish settlement activities or
further troop redeployments in West Bank as examples of progress.
</P>
<P>
Yemen became the third Arab country after Oman and Jordan to
officially declare readiness to attend the controversial
conference which traditionally included Arab states, Israel and
their major partners from the world over.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have made their participation conditional
on possible progress in the Middle East peace process and
refrained from jumping to a final decision.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Market Fall Called Short-Term Phenomenon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent severe downturn in
the Hong Kong stock market is a short-term phenomenon and would
not affect the long-term sentiment of investment in Asia, Hong
Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) Chairman Edgar Cheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the Hong Kong authorities have the
resources and skill to fend off the speculators," Cheng told an
international business conference.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index has plummeted nearly 6,000 points, or
one-third since the financial trouble started on October 17, the
10th anniversary of the Black Monday collapse.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were hit hard as the monetary authority jacked up
interest rates to record levels to fend off speculative attacks on
the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The stock market suffered its biggest loss today in terms of
points, plunging 1,428 points to close just above 9,000.
</P>
<P>
Cheng told the International Investment Funds Association
Conference that "the short-term pain which this is inflicting on
equity investors and the property market is a price worth paying
for the long-term stability of our system."
</P>
<P>
"When the attacks are seen to have failed, the present risk
premium on Hong Kong dollar interest rates will drop and the
recent panic by investors will be recognized as having been an
over-reaction," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe it will take a while for investors to digest the
shock they have received in the last few months," he said. "I do
not believe, however, that recent market turmoil will alter the
long-term trend of increasing investment in Asia by global
investors."
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who will retire from his position in two days' time,
predicted that the demand for capital from regional issuers would
certainly not diminish, especially from inland areas of China. He
is optimistic that the Hong Kong market capitalization would
double again in the next five years to exceed 1 trillion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The HKSE chairman stressed that the market systems have
withstood recent dramatic swings in stock prices and heavy trading
volume without any sign of strain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the HKSE said in a statement today that it has been
monitoring the market closely from a risk management point of view
and that the market is operating in an orderly manner.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Sees Doha Conference as "New Impetus" to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Qatar saw next month's
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference as "a new
impetus" to the stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks, Qatari Foreign
Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The conference to be held in the Qatari capital of Doha on
November 16-18 will "add a new impetus to the Middle East peace
process and advance economic development in the region," Qatari
news agency quoted Fawaz Al Attiya, spokesman of the Qatari
Foreign Ministry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country's determination to convene the
conference which was opposed by some Arab states due to Israel's
participation should not be regarded as a sign for its stand
change in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Qatar understands the motivation of the countries which will
attend the conference as well as the states who have decided to
boycott it," Attiya said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no difference with our (Arab brothers) on the means
but perhaps on the methods" of promoting the peace talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are all agreed on one point: Israel must halt its policy
of building settlements in the Arab lands, abstain from
provocation, respect its commitments to peace and resume
negotiations with Syria," he added.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
talks, Syria, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
have threatened to boycott the conference which is traditionally
attended by Arab states, Israel and their major partners in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, Qatar has downgraded the conference,
the fourth since it was launched in 1994, from a summit to a
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qatar said it had sent invitations to 92 countries in the
world and so far, more than 50 countries from Europe, Asia and
America have signed up their participation.
</P>
<P>
Doha said that among the countries, the United States,
European countries and Israel will sent delegations at the
ministerial level. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will represent their
countries in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Jordan, Yemen and Oman are the only
Arab countries which have confirmed their appearance in the
three-day conference while the others remain hesitant to say
whether they would attend.

<P>
XIAOLANGDI (Yellow River), October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sincere
cooperation will reap the most benefits for both Chinese and
foreign parties involved in the Xiaolangdi water control project,
Chinese Vice-minister of Water Resources Zhang Jiyao told
reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The successful damming of the Yellow River this morning is a
key achievement in the project, and is the result of the hard work

The project used one billion US dollars of loans from the World
Bank, and accepted international bidding. Construction work
completed over the past three years has proved that honest
cooperation fundamentally guarantees the best interests of both
parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Technological and contractual difficulties were solved through
concerted efforts of the builders, so that the damming could be
completed on schedule, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to solving the disputes over contracts, the Chinese
side has been fully respecting the terms of the contracts while
taking into account the actual situations at the construction
site, Zhang said.

ABU DHABI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) invested 77.8 billion U.S. dollars in
non-oil industries in 1996, up nearly a quarter from 1975.
</P>
<P>
This figure was released today by the regional organization in
a report at the Forum on Investment in Gulf Economic Communities
which is being held here.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, has nearly 45 percent of world's
proven oil reserves and are world's major oil producers and
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Their economy depends heavily on oil revenues which account for
more than two thirds of their total income each year. From late
1980s, they pushed ahead with a drive to diversify their
oil-reliant economy.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of investments in non-oil sectors, the
countries have set up more than 6,000 industrial enterprises,
including 20 major joint ventures worth about 2.7 billion dollars,
said the report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Damming in Three Gorges Well on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The damming of the Yangtze
River has passed the toughest stage, and the final damming before
4 p.m. on November 8 is sure to succeed, a senior engineer said
today.
</P>
<P>
Between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. on November 8, the remaining 40
meters of the dam opening will be sealed, said He Gong, deputy
general manager of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
By October 23, the river flow had been reduced to a width of
130 meters, and by the early morning hours of October 27, the
space was down to only 40 meters.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists, the most difficult work was to reduce
the opening from 100 meters to 50 meters because of the water
depth and fierce current.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that from October 26 to 31, river flow through
the Three Gorges area will be about 10,000 cubic meters per
second, and the flow will eventually slow down, a good omen for
the damming operation, He Gong said.
</P>
<P>
With the 40-m opening forming, 85 percent of the river now
flows through the diversion channel on the southern bank of the
river.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI (HENAN), October 28 (Xinhua) -- Though the Yangtze
River and the Yellow River have long been considered symbols of
the Chinese nation, never before have the country's two longest
waterways attracted as much attention as they did today.
</P>
<P>
The flood-prone Yellow River, which has repeatedly wreaked
havoc throughout China's 2,500 years of recorded history, changed
its course forever at 10:28 a.m. today, when the last load of
stone sealed the opening of a multi-purpose dam at Xiaolangdi, 40
km northwest of Luoyang, an ancient city in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts have hailed today's completion of the damming of the
Xiaolangdi Multi-Purpose Water Control Project, the largest of its
kind on the Yellow River, as a success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work to narrow the gap of a coffer dam at Sandouping
as part of the construction of the Three Gorges Project is
proceeding smoothly. One after the other, heavy-duty trucks
shuttled between the dam and the stone-pit round-the-clock to dump
boulders into the river. Ten days from now, China's longest river
will be dammed by the world's largest dam.
</P>
<P>
Both rivers originate from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and flow
east, with the Yangtze River passing through provinces in Southern
China, and the Yellow River stretching across Northern China. To
dam the two rivers in 10 days is an extraordinary undertaking
in a showdown with Mother Nature, and adds lustre to the already
eventful year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Though the two massive water control projects are expected to
be completed early next century, the closing of the dams marked
that the two highly challenging projects have achieved
considerable progress.
</P>
<P>
Builders described the two projects as milestones in the
history of water control in China.
</P>
<P>
Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, said the river
damming marks the beginning of a new phase in harnessing the two
hazardous rivers.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is regarded as one of the most complex engineering
jobs ever in history, due to its complex geographical features and
high containment of sediment in water. The successful damming of
the river indicates that the toughest technical problems in
construction have been solved. The key task now is to heighten the
dam to a crest of 154 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will enter the phase of dam and power
house building after closing of the coffer dam on November 8.

<P>
The Chinese have mixed feelings about the Yangtze and Yellow
Rivers, which have been dubbed both "the cradle of Chinese
civilization" and "the sorrow of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
The two rivers have produced catastrophic floods every other
year in the 2,000 years prior to the founding of New China in
1949. The Yellow River recorded a disastrous breach in 1938,
killing more than 900,000. A powerful flood which occurred at the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 1954 resulted in
30,000 deaths and inundated over three million ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
But taming the Yangtze and Yellow rivers was just wishful
thinking for centuries.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades and more, the government has built a
big number of water control projects on the two rivers. Sanmenxia
Reservoir and Gezhouba Water Control Project were among the most
successful.
</P>
<P>
Pan Jiazheng, an established Chinese hydraulician, said that
the building of the Three Gorges Project and Xiaolangdi Water
Control Project is a turning point in harnessing the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
No other projects can match the two massive schemes, Pan said,
as the Three Gorges Project will raise the flood prevention
capacity along the river from the current once per 10 years to
once per 100 years for the occurrence of major floods. The
Xiaolangdi Project will raise flood prevention capacity from the
present 60 years to 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts warned that serious hidden troubles
caused by floods still exist. The riverbed at the lower
reaches of the Yellow River, the world's muddiest, rises 10 cm
annually due to silting. The river has become a "hanging river,"
with the riverbed perched 20 meters above cities on both banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the Yellow River drainage basin, 694,000 sq. km or 93
percent, is located upstream from the Xiaolangdi site, putting
Xiaolangdi in a key position to control flooding and sedimentation
of the river.

The Three Gorges and Xiaolangdi projects are trans-century
endeavors designed to benefit future generations. They are not
only to serve as flood control facilities to protect the highest
area of farmland and the most people, but also will provide huge
amounts of water and power resources for the development of the
Yangtze and Yellow rivers areas. The two projects will also play a
big role in improving the environment and eco-system.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion in 2009, the Three Gorges hydropower station
will be the world's largest, equipped with a capacity of 18.2
million KW. The equivalent of a tenth of the country's total
electricity at present will go to east China, central China, and
Chongqing municipality, which contribute 40 percent to China's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Electricity generated by the Three Gorges power plant is equal
that of 10 thermal power plants each with a capacity of 1.8
million KW. Thus, the plant will alleviate the logistics problems
of transporting and consuming 50 million tons of coal annually,
and will greatly reduce environmental pollution along the Yangtze
River watershed.
</P>
<P>
The project will make it possible for 10,000-ton freighters to
go directly to Chongqing, and markedly improve China's "golden
passage", the Yangtze River, which accounts for 80 percent of
country's waterway transport through inland rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi project is expected to increase enough water
resources to cover 2.2 million ha of farmland in Shangdong and
Henan provinces, and to yield a million tons of grain and 58,000
tons of cotton annually. It will also provide water for Beijing,
Tianjin, and some other cities which face water supply shortages.
</P>
<P>
"The two projects can match any project of the kind in the rest
of the world, in terms of scale, technology, and economic
results," said Pan Jiazheng, an academician of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: A Milestone in Taming of China's Longest Rivers (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Zhang Guangdou of Qinghua University was strongly opposed
to the building of the Three Gorges project in the 1940s. But now
the 85-year-old authority on China's water conservation and
hydropower is a staunch advocate.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, China's economic and financial conditions
couldn't afford such a gigantic project as the Three Gorges
project. But now China is rapidly gaining national strength, with
equally fast development of science and technology, and the
national economy need more power. That's why I say 'Yes' to the
project," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges project cost 6.5 billion yuan in 1995,
accounting for 0.11 percent of GDP, a striking contrast to bygone
days when the country had to scrape to fund even a minor project.
</P>
<P>
The two endeavors are not only a symbol of overall national
strength, but also direct results of the reform and opening-up
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Without the reform and opening-up drive, projects like these
would be inconceivable," said Zhang Jiyao, vice-minister of Water
Resources, who is in charge of the Xiaolangdi project.
</P>
<P>
The first large project to be run according to
internationally-accepted practices, Xiaolangdi used more than a
billion US dollars in loans, and was open to worldwide
bidding. Consequently, the construction work of the dam, the flood
diversion project, and the power-generation project went to some
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 10,000 builders on Xiaolangdi, over 700
experts and technicians came from some 50 countries and regions,
prompting some observers to call the construction site a
"mini-United Nations".
</P>
<P>
"Open the door for the construction of the Three Gorges
project" is the comment on international cooperation by Lu Youmei,
general manager of the Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corp, which overally takes care of the project.
</P>
<P>
Diverse forms of funding were used in China and overseas to
raise money for the 200-plus-billion-yuan project, with key
generators and other equipment imported from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Despite this fruitful year of 1997 for China's water
conservation, Chinese water control experts remain
sober-minded. As Prof. Pan put it, "we cannot expect to finish our
work with the two projects once for all. In fact, we still have a
long way to go in harnessing the Yangtze and Yellow rivers."

<HEADLINE> German Institutes: Unemployment Continue to Rise in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's six leading economic
institutes today predicted that the country's unemployment would
continue to rise next year, reaching an average of 4.42 million, up
from this year's 4.38 million.
</P>
<P>
In a joint autumn report on German economy published today, they
said high joblessness would remain a major concern to the government
and a turnabout on the job market is "not in sight."
</P>
<P>
They criticized the political sector for failure to carry out tax
reforms this year, which they said had reduced "the readiness of
companies to expand their capacities or to hire additional labor."
</P>
<P>
The institutes forecast that the country's economy would grow by
2.4 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1998, slightly faster than
earlier estimation.
</P>
<P>
In the biennial joint report presented to Bonn, they also warned
that for the first time since 1990 reunificaton, overall economic
output in eastern Germany would grow slower than in western part of
the country in 1998 due to dropping construction investments.
</P>
<P>
The six independent institutes are located in Berlin, Munich,
Hamburg, Kiel, Magdeburg and Essen.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia voiced full support for
Japan's "trustful, mutually beneficial and toward the future"
diplomatic policy with Russia, Federation Council Chairman Yegor
Semeonovich Stroyev told Itar-Tass news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's stand is constructive and encourages the development of
Russian-Japanese cooperative relations, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the two countries met at the Denver Summit of
Eight in June this year. The meeting made it possible for both
sides to prevent the closing of the "iron curtain" and provided a
way to approach and resolve differences.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming informal talks between the two leaders will be the
basis for setting a new stage for bilateral relations and should
provide specific plans to embody the relations, Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
He called for strengthening bilateral economic cooperation and
a peaceful settlement for all differences.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev made the remarks on the eve of his first visit to
Japan. He is to lead a delegation from the Federation Council to
Japan on October 29 for a formal visit.

<HEADLINE> Experts Debate Links Between Traditional Culture and Modern Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- What's the connection between
traditional Chinese culture and modern management? Can the Chinese
people use the wisdom of traditional culture to go about the market
economy in the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
These were some of the questions debated by more than 120
renowned scholars and enterpreneurs from China and overseas during
an international symposium, which closed today in Ningbo, east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Participants from Chinese interior area, Hong Kong and Taiwan,
and those from foreign countries, including Japan, the Untied
States, and Singapore discussed "the role of traditional Chinese
culture in market economy," "traditional culture and modern
enterprise management" and other issues during the three-day
symposium, jointly sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and the Ningbo City Government.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the rapid economic growth of Japan, Thailand,
the Republic of Korea, Singapore, China's interior area and Taiwan
in the 1970s and 1980s has been influenced by traditional Chinese
culture.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese economists spoke on the current economic situation
in China, pointing out that the Chinese economy has entered a
stable and gradually progressing period, with a growth rate of
nine percent and an inflation rate of two percent.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Pay off WB Loans for Xiaolangdi Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has the ability to pay
back the one billion US dollars in loans from the World Bank
granted for the Xiaolangdi water control project, Vice-minister of
Water Resources Zhang Jiyao told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the second longest in China, was successfully
dammed this morning at Xiaolangdi in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
All the loans will be paid off 17 years after the Xiaolangdi
reservoir is put into use, Zhang said. World Bank loans account
for only a third of the project's total investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
An assessment of the value of electric power and water in the
future indicates that China will have the financial strength to
repay the WB loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact the river flow has decreased over the past
years due to less precipitation and an increasing number of water
projects at the upper reaches, the Chinese government will ensure
electricity generation by adopting new water-allocation plans,
promoting water-saving industries and diverting more water into
the Yellow River, according to the vice-minister.

<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Now that the Xiaolangdi
damming project has been successfully completed, three pressing
problems that remain will have to be tackled with the concerted
efforts of both Chinese and foreign parties involved,
Vice-minister of Water Resources Zhang Jiyao told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the flood season of 1998, cofferdams along
the upper reaches of the Yangtze River must be constructed to a
height of 185 meters before the floodwaters come.
</P>
<P>
Second, the resettlement of local residents will become more
urgent as a result of the rising water levels after the damming. A
total of one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) has been put
into the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Finally, machinery and electric equipment to be installed at
the dam must arrive according to schedule and in good condition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his belief that all the problems can be solved
with the full cooperation of both Chinese and foreign entities.

HELSINKI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 59 percent of the Finnish
people are opposed to joining the European Monetary Union (EMU) in
the first wave, a recent survey conducted by the Council of the
Finnish Economic Circle revealed.
</P>
<P>
Although 80 percent of the Finnish people believe the country
will join the EMU in the first wave as the government has
proposed, most of them are in doubt about the move. The doubts
were instigated by the prudent attitudes of Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Finland was the first group of European Union (EU) member
countries to meet the criteria for joining the EMU. Its government
has been actively preparing for entry into the European
integration system in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
However, the biggest opposition party, the Finnish Centre and
some other parties, strongly oppose joining the EMU in the first
wave.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia is pressing for the
resumption of Middle East peace talks on all tracks, visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after meeting separately with Jordan's Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali and Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Russia calls for reviving the peace negotiations on all tracks
involving Israel, the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria, said
Primakov, who arrived here last night on a two-day working visit
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He described Jordan's role in the peace process as "vital" and
said Russia would like to develop its relations with the kingdom
for the benefit of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth leg of his Middle East tour in a bid to
reactivate Russia's role as a co-sponsor of the peace-making
between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Primakov, Majali reiterated the kingdom's
position and strong conviction that the peace process would not
continue if it did not include all tracks.
</P>
<P>
He deemed Israeli government`s stand on the peace process as
"unreasonable and unacceptable." There would not be security and
peace without restoring the lands and rights to the Arabs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Majali rejected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu`s
demand to give priority to security over peace, insisting that
security could only be achieved through peace.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh told Primakov that peace was a strategic option for
the Arab countries, and stressed Jordan`s commitment to secure
progress on various tracks and revive a comprehensive peace in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon Primakov started a closed-door meeting
with King Hussein in the Royal Palace.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's week-long trip in the region began on October 24 in
Lebanon, which also includes Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule area, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia co-sponsored the peace process together with
the U.S., its long absence in the region has left Washington
played the dominant role in brokering talks between the Arabs and

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Benefits of Xiaolangdi Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Experts say that the
completion of the Xiaolangdi Multi-purpose Dam Project will
effectively control floods and protect people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Dam Project, the largest of its kind ever built
on the Yellow River, China's second longest river, is meant to
control the river at the place where the riverbed of the lower
reaches has been rising at a rate of ten centimeters a year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the large amount of sediment deposited from the upper
reaches that pass through the eroded Loess Plateau, many cities
along the river are several meters, often as many as ten, below
water level of the river.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi is situated in a prime position for flood and
sediment control of the Yellow River. Upon completion, the
Xiaolangdi Dam and Reservoir Project will effectively mitigate
catastrophic floods, as well as control silting, ice jams,
irrigation, water supply and hydroelectric power generation.
</P>
<P>
The dry season of the river has become longer as a result of
the arid climate, diversion of water for industrial and
agricultural purposes and the lack of a major water
reservoir.

<HEADLINE> Levy Awaits Guidelines for Talks with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said today he is still not sure if he will travel to
the United States for talks with Palestinian deputy leader Mahmoud
Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with a delegation of the European
Parliament, Levy said he is still waiting for a meeting of the
inner cabinet, to be convened tomorrow, to formulate guidelines
for future negotiations with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
If the parameters for concessions that Israel is expected to
make and the commitments to be undertaken by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are defined, Levy will be able to leave
for Washington in time for talks to begin early next week.
</P>
<P>
But the possibility of delay caused by ministerial wrangling
over security concerns and other issues could push the diplomatic
timetable back to the point where a trilateral session will not be
feasible until late November or early December.
</P>
<P>
This is because U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
scheduled to attend the World Economic Forum's Middle East and
North Africa economic conference due to open in Doha, capital of
Qatar on November 16.
</P>
<P>
Levy conferred with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday on
three main issues which he wants specific instructions: a
"time-out" on settlement activity; further redeployment of Israeli
troops in the West Bank and preparations for the final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy was said to be pleased with the outcome of his dialogue
with Netanyahu. "We discussed several ideas," Levy said, "I hope
that they will be crystallized in final form by the end of
(tomorrow's) Cabinet meeting. When they are adopted, we will be
able to convene the meeting in Washington in a manner that will be
fruitful and will inject momentum into the peace process."
</P>
<P>
On Palestinian side, PNA President Yasser Arafat said Monday
that the PNA was withholding a decision about whether to attend
next week's planned talks in Washington until Israel decides.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the final resolution from the Israeli side
to decide if we will go to this meeting or not," Arafat
said.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin of China surprised many afternoon
strollers on Waikiki Beach by turning up unexpectedly for a swim
late Sunday afternoon. He swam the breast stroke for a full hour.
</P>
<P>
-- A worldwide plunge in stock prices erased more than 7
percent from the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday and
forced the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Jiang Zemin, the leader of the world's most populous
nation, was feeling elated, and overwhelmed with the hospitality
of the tropical island state of Hawaii. He joined students from
a local hula dancing school for a three-minute impromptu session
of free-form undulation.
</P>
<P>
-- Washington's economic policymakers, watching fretfully and
conferring intensively, responded to the Wall Street stock
market plunge with little more than soothing words about the
underlying strength of the U.S. Economy.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Stocks plummeted as a continuing sell-off eliminated about
$1.2 trillion in global market value. Trading in the U.S. was
halted early for the first time under the Big Board's
circuit-breaker rules after the Dow Jones industrials sand
554.26, or 7.18%, to 7161.15. It was the Dow's biggest point
drop ever, while only the 12th worst in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stocks were sharply lower midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Latin American stocks were among the hardest hit, amid fears
that the turmoil in southeast Asia might roil current markets
there next.
</P>
<P>
Economists say ties between business and markets are tested
by plunge in stocks.

<HEADLINE> "Italy Today" Exhibition to Be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition titled "Italy
Today" will be held from November 25 to December 2 in Beijing at
the China International Exhibition Center, Italian sources
announced today.
</P>
<P>
They said at a press conference held today in Guangzhou,
capital city of south China's Guangdong Province, that the
exhibition will be the first of its kind sponsored in China by the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
The show will be the most important trade-promotion activity
conducted by the Italian government in China over a decade, and
will be a milestone marking the economic and trade cooperation
between Italy and China, E. Bevilacqua, a senior Italian trade
official stationed in Beijing, said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Some 260 Italian companies, which are engaged in energy,
machinery, telecommunications, chemical industry, transport,
building materials, decoration, clothing and food, will
participate in the event, bringing with them the newest products
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is expected to help the Chinese understanding
more about Italy, and offer an opportunity for more cooperation
between enterpreneurs in both countries, China's Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said recently.
</P>
<P>
Italy is one of China's major economic and trading partners in
the European Union. Trade volume between the two countries in 1996

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Dive in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The price of shares on the Seoul
stock exchange plunged sharply today to below the 500-point level,
and the U.S. dollar was unusually strong against the South Korean
won.
</P>
<P>
Amid the reported crash of foreign stock markets, in a wave of
heavy selling by panicked players throughout the session, the
leading composite index crashed as much as 35.19 point to close at
495.28.
</P>
<P>
The plunge, representing a decline of 6.63 percent, was the
largest single-day fall in the history of the South Korean bourse,
depressing the market below the 500-point mark for the first time
in more than five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, amid rekindled dollar demand and bearish foreign
stock investors' continuously fleeing from the market, the South
Korean won continued its plunge to set another new record low
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the time of this report, foreign exchange authorities gave
up intervening in the market after its failure to keep the 940-won
resistance barrier Monday. The dollar, beginning 3.20-won higher
on Tuesday, shot up to end at 957.60 won, up as much as 21 won
over the base rate.
</P>
<P>
The base conversion rate scheduled to be posted Wednesday will
be 942.80 won to the dollar, which means the won dropped more than
3-percent this month alone and 11.8 percent from 844.20 at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
While ruling and opposition parties urged the government to
take extraordinary measures to bridge the current monetary crisis,
financial sources are concerned that the won will plunge even
further toward the end of this year before stablizing.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing monetary jitters and the drop in foreign
exchange reserves to below 30 billion U.S. dollars, government
financial experts discount the possibility of a foreign exchange
crisis in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Worse Yet to Come in Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- As regional markets tumbled,
political leaders and market analysts warned today that the
current financial crisis in Southeast Asia is likely to spill over
to the world markets and that the worst is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is now in Denmark
on an official visit, said today that the turbulence in the
financial markets will not be isolated and kept to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
A local television report quoted the prime minister as saying
the contagion effect could spread to Europe and other parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
What is important is to restore confidence in Southeast Asia,
he stressed, adding that the basic factors underlying the region
are still sound.
</P>
<P>
The world stock markets plunged today in a chain reaction under
the weight of Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Free falls in New York and Europe fueled a new round of losses
as early trading began in Asian markets today, with stock markets
in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, Japan
and South Korea all going down sharply.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index crashed through the 9,000-point floor in
Hong Kong in the morning before recovering in the afternoon to
close at 9,059.89 points, down by 1,438.31 points or 14 percent
from the previous close, suffering the largest single-day point
drop ever.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost
122.87 points to close at 1,497.03, hitting the lowest level in at
least five years.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the overnight sharp fall on Wall Street and the
plunge in the Hong Kong market, the STII nose-dived immediately
after trading opened. It once dropped to the 1,486.74-point level
at 3:45 p.m., down by 133.16 points from the opening of 1,619.9
points.
</P>
<P>
A well-known global strategist predicted here today that
further selling in global markets would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, there is probably more to come," said David Roche,
president and global strategist at Independent Strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Our forecast for the decline in major global equity markets
stays unchanged: a fall of 20-25 percent from the peak," he said,
adding, "That implies a further 15-percent correction from current
levels."
</P>
<P>
Roche, a bear on Asian markets, told a gathering of fund
managers here that the environment is now bullish for bonds. The
strategy is to buy long-term bonds and stay overweight in the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The global stock market correction is likely to keep the U.S.
dollar strong as a safe haven currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that the material impact of Asia's
financial crisis on the U.S. and other developed markets is small,
because the region constitutes just 8.5 percent of the world
economy.

<HEADLINE> NPC Discussion Urges Improvements for People's Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's senior lawmakers called
for strengthening democratic and legal construction and further
perfecting the system of the people's congresses as the country's
fundamental political system.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, discussed the report by
Jiang Zemin at the Party's 15th national congress during the first
two days of the committee's 28th session which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report placed more emphasis on building democracy and
the legal system in China, members said, and confirmed that
building a country under the rule of law guarantees smooth
development of various causes of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Huanjue Cailang, chairman of the standing committee of the
Qinghai provincial people's congress, said that expanding
socialist democracy and improving socialist legal system feature
prominently in Jiang Zemin's report.
</P>
<P>
"This represents an important development in the way the Party
manages the country and it is the continuation and creative
development of Deng Xiaoping Theory about democracy and legal
system," Huanjue said.
</P>
<P>
NPC standing committee member Qu Geping said that China faces
the task of modernizing in the 21st century not only in economic
terms but also in political terms.
</P>
<P>
"The hallmark of a modern political system in China is a
perfected system of people's congresses," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
Many members pointed out that realizing a rule of law in China
is to guarantee that the NPC and its standing committee perform
their functions as state power organs according to law and to
enhance their role in legislation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress has made great strides in building up a legal
framework by drafting an unprecedented number of laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Members said they will act under the guidelines of the Party's
congress and continue to strengthen legislation and supervision.

<HEADLINE> UAE Minister Expects Oil Prices at 23 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Oil Minister Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir expected here today
that world oil prices will climb to 23 dollars in the next six
months due to increasing demands in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today during the Forum On Investment In
Gulf Economic Communities held here, the UAE oil minister said he
expected that the prices for Opec's basket of seven crudes will
soar by about four dollars per barrel in the last quarter of this
year and the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said his prediction was based on world increasing demands
and the output decline of the non-Opec oil producers.
</P>
<P>
The increase will be mainly due to the upcoming winter in
the Northern Hemisphere, he stated.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Nasir also reiterated the UAE's commitment to
its oil output quota awarded by Opec at 2.2 million barrels
per day (bpd) and he urged other Opec members to maintain
the organization's output ceiling to shore up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The current Opec ceiling was set in September 1993 with
the exception of Iraq's. It stands at 25.03 million bpd and
remained unchanged for four years.
</P>
<P>
However, Opec's reports showed that the actual output now
is running nearly two million barrels a day in excess of the
ceiling because many members are known to have been exceeding
their quotas.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly affected crude prices which currently hover
around 19 dollars a barrel, sharply dropping from 25 dollars a
barrel in late 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Condemns Failed Military Coup in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba here today condemned the aborted military coup
and pledged to continue
economic and political reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide televised speech at the State House this
afternoon, Chiluba said the coupists are against the Zambian
people and they wanted to destabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his government will try to maintain
peace and never allow bloodshed in Zambia. He warned that no
force against the government shall ever succeed or prosper.
</P>
<P>
He called on the whole nation to work together to rebuild the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Chiluba assured the nation and investors,
both local and foreign, that his government will continue the
economic and political reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president also thanked the country's army and air force
for their loyalty to the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Chiluba made a speech on the state
radio, confirming that an military coup has been put down and the
situation in the capital is firmly under control.
</P>
<P>
The attempted coup was staged around 6 o'clock local time and
the coup leader Captain "Solo" has been identified by army
sources as Captain Steven Mungu.
</P>
<P>
In a radio announcement after his men besieged the State House
and took Zambia's Mass Complex, Captain Mungu demanded Chiluba to
resign or the coupists will take by force the State House where
the president lives.
</P>
<P>
Heavily-armed forces supporting the government later
surrounded the Mass Complex at noon and arrested Mungu as well as
several soldiers involved in the coup, a senior army official
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
About 10 vehicles, more military jeeps and about one hundred
government soldiers are now placed around the Mass Complex which
houses the Zambia Broadcasting Services, Zambia Information
Services and the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no signs of tension in the streets although
all shops and government offices are closed. And no casualties
are reported during the three-hour coup.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Lebanon's Resistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian leader Ali Khamenei
today reiterated Tehran's support for the Lebanese resistance
movement against the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri here,
Khamenei termed Lebanon as "the hero of Arab world" for its strong
resistance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei lauded the Lebanese government for its "positive
attitude towards and support for the Lebanese resistance
movement."
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon is the last Arab-Israeli battle field. The
Iran-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war
to oust Israelis from the 1,000-square-kilometer security zone
Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hariri said that expansion of relations between
Lebanon and Iran in all fields was very important for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Hariri arrived here Saturday for a four-day official visit,
the first by a Lebanese prime minister since Iran's Islamic
Revolution in 1979. He wound up his visit today and left for
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iran, Hariri held talks with Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, First Vice President Hassan Habibi and
other senior Iranian officials. The two countries also signed
several cooperation agreements during Hariri's visit.

<HEADLINE> Cautiously Boosting Share-holding System: NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's high-level legislators
today warned against indiscriminate development of the
share-holding system in China.
</P>
<P>
They urged a healthy and orderly endeavor for stock reform
during a bimonthly meeting attended by the members of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"The kind of collective economy that features, in the main, the
association of laborers in labor and their association in capital,
including the joint stock cooperative system, is also part of the
public ownership," said Li Yining, a member of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Any business must not force all workers or farmers to buy
stocks during the process of standardizing the share-holding
system in China," said Li, a well-known economics professor at
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Those inefficient businesses should not be allowed to float
shares, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jing also called for effective measures to ensure smooth
development.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly the large businesses with sound high-tech
strength should pay enough attention to the negative effect
resulting from indiscreet mergers," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuqing said, "While issuing stocks, all companies should
pay more attention to effective running of the capital and the
transformation of management mechanism inside businesses."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the necessity of separating the functions of
government from that of enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Leading Gold Firm Forecasts Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Ashati Goldfields, the leading
gold producer of Ghana, is expected to earn 40-50 million U.S.
Dollars this year as against the 60 million dollars recorded last
year, according to a company report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The company, which accounts for about 80 percent of the
estimated market capitalization of 1.31 billion dollars of the
Ghana Stock Exchange, recorded a 42 percent drop in its second
quarter pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
However the company said the sharp drop in profit is not
likely to affect the 1997 revenue and cost forecasts.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the unsatisfactory performance of the
international gold market is expected to impact negatively on the
fortune of Ashati, which is also listed in London and New York
stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
However, financial analysts say that with a cash cost of
265-269 dollars per ounce, the company can weather the downward
turn in the price of gold.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the company, 80 percent of
its 1998 output is ledged at 428 dollars per ounce and more than
five million ounces at over 420 dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Gold mining is currently one of the most active industrial
sector of Ghana, while gold export has surpassed that of cocoa,
becoming the country's primary foreign exchange earner.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Encourages LDCs to Use Multilateral Trade System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Rubens
Ricupero has called for fresh thinking in order to let the Least
Developed Countries (LDCs) utilize the multilateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of an inter-agency meeting on
Integrated Initiatives for LDC Trade Development on Monday,
Ricupero expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that only half
the 48 LDCs are currently members of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) and that their representation at the two-day meeting is
small.
</P>
<P>
Noting that WTO's dispute settlement procedures, which are
costly and difficult, have caused problems for LDCs in utilizing
this mechanism adequately, Ricupero said.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh thinking is needed to resolve this problem, possibly
through the provision of international judicial assistance."
</P>
<P>
The meeting on October 27-28 involves six international
institutions including WTO, UNCTAD, the International Trade Center
(ITC, a joint subsidiary of UNCTAD and WTO), the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the importance of the meeting, Ricupero said the
meeting is the first of its kind for two reasons: It is the first
meeting specifically devoted to LDCs in the context of the
WTO. Secondly, it marks a new alliance among six major
international institutions to develop a coherent and integrated
approach to LDC trade-related problems.

<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has reached its goal for
1997 in gold production three months ahead of schedule, according
to a recent issue of China Gold, one of the publications published
by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, the country turned out 101.8 tons of
gold, up 20.3 percent over the corresponding period for last
year. The target for gold output for the whole of 1997 set by the
ministry was only 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the ministry attributed its achievements to the
reforms and efforts of local gold-mining companies to increase
production.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold has been down in China, but the cost of gold
production has been rising due to price hikes in raw materials,
fuel and electricity.

<HEADLINE> Global Sales of Industrial Robots Up in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The global sales of industrial
robots in 1996 reached about 80,500 units, an 11 percent increase
over the previous year, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (UN/ECE) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the year 1996 marked the second consecutive year of
double digit growth in world robot sales, the robots sold in 1996
were less than those in 1990 when they peaked at almost 81,000
units, said a UN/ECE press release.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the sales of robots in 1997 is predicted to reach at
least 10 percent, and the UN/ECE foresees a yearly average growth
of more than 15 percent in the period of 1998-2000, or sales will
increase from 80,500 units in 1996 to about 131,000 units in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the stock of operational industrial robots
worldwide will increase from nearly 680,000 units at the end of 1996
to about 950,000 at the end of 2000, of which more than half will
be in Japan, followed by the United States with 100,000 units,
Germany's 77,000, Italy's 335,000, France's 19,000 and Britain's
12,000, the UN/ECE said.
</P>
<P>
One of the ways to calculate robot density is the number of
robots per 10,000 persons employed in the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Japan has so far the highest density of advanced robots. In
1996, it had 225 units (265 if counting all types of robots) per
10,000 persons engaged in manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea had the second highest with 75 units last year,
followed by Germany with 71, Sweden with 54 and Italy with 47. In
other Western European countries, Australia and the United States,
the density ranged from 15 to 40 robots per 10,000 persons.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Halts Trading Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The trade in Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange was halted temporarily Tuesday morning following a
stumbling 12 percent fall in the share prices.
</P>
<P>
The trading was halted at 11:45 am Tuesday for 45 minutes after
the share prices plunged by 12 percent in panic trading, which was
caused by the Dow Jones dive in New York Stock Exchange Monday.
</P>
<P>
After it was decided to limit the decrease of stock prices to
10 percent, the trading in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange resumed at
about 12:30 pm.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government was quick to come out to calm the stock
market as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman called on the public not to be panic.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Netanyahu as saying that Israeli economy
is strong and the public should be confident about the stock
market and not be panic.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel is the second most important hi-tech
market in the world after the Silicon Valley in California of the
United States, adding this should be reflected in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he did not want to advise investors what to do
at the time, but Neeman asked them to calculate their steps well.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli share market plummeted following the worldwide
drop in major stock markets, especially in Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Today's drop in the share market also followed the
announcement by Bank of Israel that it would leave the interest
rate unchanged in November despite the speculation that the
interest rate would be lowered due to the negative consumer price
index in September.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street abruptly shut down 30 minutes before the closing
bell Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 554.26
points, the largest one-day point decline ever.
</P>
<P>
Most Israeli shares traded on the New York market also
plunged, dropping an average of 6.5 percent. Israeli stocks in
Tel Aviv exchange also dropped for about 1.7 percent Monday as
investors expressed concern about continued declines in New York,
particularly Israeli companies listed on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Calls for Further Investment Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Secretary for Trade
and Industry Denise Yue today called for further dismantling
investment barriers and enhancing the transparency of investment
regimes among Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members.
</P>
<P>
She told the opening of a two-day APEC Investment Symposium
that attracting foreign investment is one of the top priorities of
many economies today, and the wish to attract investment has
resulted in a greater willingness to establish a more liberal
investment framework.
</P>
<P>
The trend toward liberalization notwithstanding, restrictions
still exist in many investment regimes due to historical,
economic, national security and other reasons, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
These restrictions often take the form of admission barriers,
foreign ownership control, export requirements, local content
requirements and technology transfer requirements, she added.
</P>
<P>
"We need to further dismantle these investment barriers and
enhance the transparency of investment regimes in order to be able
to realize the full benefits of liberalization," the official
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Given the turbulence in Southeast Asian financial markets in
the last couple of months, some may doubt whether free flow of
investment is all that good. "Some will point to the havoc
purportedly wreaked on regional financial markets by overseas
investors as proof that investment and liberalization bring with
them disbenefits," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
However, she stressed, these recent problems actually
reinforce, and not weaken, the arguments for a stable investment
environment and a robust investment regime.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, the third of its kind, was hosted by the
Industry Department of the Hong Kong SAR government. The overall
theme this year is enhancing the environment for investment in
APEC, which underlines the vital importance of investment in the
process of economic development in the APEC economies.

<HEADLINE> First International Hardware Show Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The first international
hardware show opened today at the Convention and Exhibition Center
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Herbert Liang, president of
the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, said that the
 creation of such a significant new trade event creates many
opportunities for buyers and sellers in the hardware business.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that hardware products are important to Hong Kong's
trade. In 1996, Hong Kong exported 24.9 billion HK dollars (3.19
billion U.S. dollars) of traditional hardware items, such as hand
tools, metal parts, wiring nails, nuts and screws to all parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
This fair has attracted 170 exhibitors from Hong Kong, China's
inland and other countries and regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Among the major product categories are do-it-yourself products,
tools and equipment, gardening and camping gear, auto and home
improvement items.
</P>
<P>
"Hardware traders should also take advantage of the prevalent
Asian moving trends towards higher urbanization, more and smaller
household units and improved transport, power and communication
services," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Everything -- from the construction of massive power projects,
bridges and highways to more families moving into new flats --
tends to trigger demand for quality hardware items, large and
small, he added.
</P>
<P>
Frederick Lam, deputy executive director of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (HKTDC), said at the opening ceremony that new
trade fairs, like this one, demonstrate not only that the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is conducting business as
usual, but that Hong Kong's appetite and scope for business
continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
As the organizer, HKTDC is proud to play a role in bringing so
many buyers and sellers together in a setting and circumstances
bound to facilitate business deals, Lam said.

people a first hand opportunity to experience the diversity of
what our country offers," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bodenmuller, the "Switzerland Greets Hong Kong"
weeks will encompass a diverse range of cultural, entertainment
and economic activities, with an aim to bring Switzerland and its
many faces nearer to the SAR people and to get them more
interested in Switzerland well-known for its watches and tourist
paradises.
</P>
<P>
An Economic Forum on November 13 is one of the key events in
this upcoming diverse promotion.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is the sixth largest foreign investor in Hong Kong.
The SAR is the eighth most important destination for Swiss exports
world-wide and the most important place in the world for exports
of Swiss watches. Switzerland is also a leading market for Hong
Kong products, with exports totaling 491 million U.S. dollars in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,500 Swiss citizens residing in Hong Kong,
making it the second biggest Swiss community in Asia. Furthermore,
over 150 subsidiaries or branches of Swiss enterprises, banks,
insurance companies and trading firms are present here.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss consul general told the news conference that "there
is a real and flourishing partnership between Switzerland and Hong
Kong, and there is definitely room to develop it."
</P>
<P>
"With our Swiss weeks, we want to underline that we strongly
believe in a prosperous future for Hong Kong and that the
confidence of the Swiss government and the Swiss business
community in this regard is very high," he added.

<P>
The Macao airport got high points in its outlook and
convenience design, both ranking 10th. But it ranks only 19th in
the means of public transportation and 18th in handling
immigration (customs) procedure.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Aborted Coup in Zambia Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States ambassador to
the United Nations Bill Richardson today condemned the coup
attempt in Zambia this morning before he left Kenya, a stop of
his current six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Richardson said: "We are always
concerned about undemocratic, unconstitutional overthrows of
elected governments," according to a report from Nairobi available
here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Regional Superintendent of the Church of God,
Bishop John Manbo, also condemned here the coup attempt, saying
violence not the answer to the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
He said the public should not just rejoice that the coup has
been foiled but should pray for peace to continue.
</P>
<P>
He urged Zambian President Frederick Chiluba to be magnanimous
enough to call for round table talks with all stakeholders
including the church, opposition parties and trade unions to find
a solution to the outstanding national issues.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the president needs to hear from all
stakeholders what is the grievance in the nation because his
advisors could not tell him the unpleasant truth.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned former president Kenneth Kaunda, arch rival
of Chiluba, against making inflammatory public remarks, adding
that he would have been accused of having connections with the
plotters, had the coup succeeded.
</P>
<P>
One of Kaunda's supporters said that although he is opposed to
Chiluba, he is happy at the news that the coup has been foiled
because Zambians do not want to be led by a military regime.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on HK Stocks Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KOGN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said that today's share falls at the Hong Kong stock market was a
reaction to that around the world, urging local citizens not to
panic.
</P>
<P>
After today's Executive Council meeting, Tung told reporters
that he thinks "the market still goes up and down" and "the latest
 round is due to what happened overseas."
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index plunged 15.5 percent on selling this
morning, with 1,627.70 points down through the 9,000 point barrier
 for the first time in 26 months to hit 8,870. 5 in late morning
trade, in the wake of an overnight global market crash.
</P>
<P>
The dive followed a 7.18 percent fall on Wall Street overnight,
which in turn stemmed from Monday's 5.8 percent decline here as
the SAR government sought to defend the Hong Kong dollar and its
peg to the U.S. dollar from speculators' attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index fell 1,438.31 points, or 13.70 percent, to
close at 9,059.89 after a slight recovery in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Questioned by reporters, Tung said: "Well, I think the market
still goes up and down. What has happened this morning was a
reaction to what happened around the world, particularly in New
York, and from our side we don't see any panic."
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals here are very good, the economy is going well
in Hong Kong and the economy in China is going very well," the
Chief Executive said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the peg of the linked exchange rate is
staying and it is slowly but surely coming to normal.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Flooring Exhibition Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The second Asia Pacific
Flooring Exhibition (Asiaflor) opened today at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, attracting 220 exhibitors from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Mike Chappell, director of the
 Britain-based company of Paragon Exhibition, which organizes
Asiaflor, said that he believes the Asia-Pacific region offers
very exciting business prospects not to be missed.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason Hong Kong was chosen as the ideal location for
Asiaflor, through which exhibitors are given the chance to tap the
opportunities of the region and to cater to the demand created by
the rapid development and volume of construction taking place in
this part of the world," Chappell said.
</P>
<P>
Asiaflor was first held in 1996 with over 160 exhibitors, but
the number of exhibitors rose more than 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day show, exhibitors will showcase the full
range of flooring products for the commercial and residential
markets, as well as manufacturing and installation systems.
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year's show, wood and wood laminate
exhibitors have more than doubled and raw material and
technology-related exhibitors have trebled, which confirms
Asiaflor's importance for designers, specifiers and the flooring
trade.
</P>
<P>
Textiles such as carpets, rugs, tiles, entrance matting and
automotive carpets, are shown by many exhibitors, some showing
their products and designs for the first time in Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The French chemical and
pharmaceutical conglomerate Rhone-Poulenc has opened the first
phase of its technology park in Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
Cost of the first phase is 24 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The multi-purpose Technology Park in the Shanghai Shenzhuang
Industrial Zone is the first of its kind in China's chemical and
pharmaceutical industries.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, which involves a high-technology silicon
manufacturing plant and four chemical applications laboratories,
has a floor space of 10 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Marc Bruel, vice-chairman of the Rhone-Poulenc Group, said
that construction of the technology park was a concrete example of
Rhone-Poulenc's determination to be a major speciality chemical
player in China, one of the world's fastest growing markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the second phase of the park, targeted for completion
in 2000, will include space for companies in such fields as food
ingredients, fine-chemical production, packaging, and training and
development.
</P>
<P>
As the world's seventh largest producer of chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, Rhone-Poulenc has established 17 joint ventures
and one wholly owned subsidiary in China, involving an investment
of 400 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Envoy Believes HK's Dollar Link Will Not Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Consul General in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China Rolf
Bodenmuller said today that he has a strong confidence in the
economic future of the SAR, believing that the Hong Kong Dollar's
link with the U.S. dollar will not change under the current
pressure from speculators.
</P>
<P>
After a news conference underlining next month's "Switzerland
Greets Hong Kong" promotion activities, Bodenmuller told Xinhua
that the current stock market turmoil has involved not only Hong
Kong, but also other regions or countries in Southeast Asia and
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he believes that Hong Kong, backed by the
motherland, is strong enough to face the current financial
challenge and that the SAR would not change its currency's link
with the U.S. dollar. In the recent days, the Hong Kong dollar has
been the top target of speculators' attack.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss envoy cited the SAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang as saying that Hong Kong's
economy remains strong and steady and its finance not weak.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that "with our Swiss weeks (the "Switzerland
Greets Hong Kong" promotion), we want to underline that we
strongly believe in a prosperous future for Hong Kong and that the
confidence of the Swiss government and the Swiss business
community in this regard is very high."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- For a long time to come it will
be possible to avert a new world war, Chinese Premier Li Peng
said, increasing hopes for world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement on October 17 in an interview with Salama
Ahmed Salama, acting editor-in-chief of the Egyptian newspaper
"Al-Ahram".
</P>
<P>
Noting that peace and development are still the main themes of
the present era, Li said that the international situation is
becoming more relaxed. He added that the trend toward
multipolarity has further developed globally in the political,
economic and other fields, which will benefit world peace,
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the call of the people of all countries for
treating each other on an equal footing and living together
amicably is becoming louder and louder, and that it has become the
mainstream of the times to desire peace, seek cooperation and
promote development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are devoting themselves to building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said, and that China's
goal is to completely modernize in the mid-21st century, so as to
build itself into a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally
advanced socialist country.
</P>
<P>
China needs a longstanding, stable and peaceful international
environment, especially a surrounding environment of
good-neighborliness, to concentrate on advancing economy and
raising people's standards of living, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
China's sustained and rapid economic growth has benefited from
a stable and tranquil regional environment since the beginning of
its reform and opening-up policies 19 years ago, Li said, and
China's economic advancement and prosperity has contributed to
promoting stability and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to work for regional peace and development,
and to fulfill its due responsibilities and obligation, Li said,
noting that a stable, developing and strong China will not pose a
threat to any other countries, but will make an even greater
contribution to peace and development in Asia and in the world as
a whole.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Sino-Egyptian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has all along regarded
Egypt as its important partner in the Arab world as well as in
Africa, and China is ready to work with Egypt, in the spirit of
mutual respect and benefit, and equality, to bring a friendly
bilateral cooperation to the 21st century, Chinese premier Li Peng
has said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made the remarks in an interview with Salama
Ahmed Salama, acting editor-in-chief and first editor of the
Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram", in Beijing on October 17.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt have enjoyed friendly relations based on mutual
understanding and respect, although great changes have taken place
in the world over the past decades, the Chinese premier noted.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Li said, bilateral relations have scored some new
development, as both sides not only have continued to support each
other and maintain close cooperation in international affairs, but
also forged mutually beneficial ties of cooperation in the fields
of politics, economy, trade, agriculture, science, technology and
culture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China and Egypt have seen fruitful cooperation
in culture, sports, education and science and technology, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts by the two sides, bilateral trade and
economic cooperation, as an important part of Sino-Egyptian
friendly relations, has maintained a stable and sustainable
development, with a trade volume exceeding 400 million US dollars
last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are great potential and broad prospects for further
expansion of Sino-Egyptian trade and economic cooperation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The premier suggested the two governments encourage more
exchanges and understanding between businesses of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes mutually beneficial cooperation through
various forms and at various levels will expand increasingly.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding, signed during
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed El-Ganzouri's China visit in
April this year, China will help Egypt establish a free trade zone
in northern Suez.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government attaches great importance to this
project, he said, adding that China's relevant departments have
submitted a report to the Egyptian side, and China is looking
forward to an early reply from the Egyptian side for the sake of
future cooperation.

<HEADLINE> China to Work for Middle East Peace: Premier Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government highly
values its traditional friendship with Arab nations and supports
their rights and interests and Egypt's positive efforts and
important role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
China will, together with the international community, continue
to make an unremitting efforts to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng made the statements in a recent
interview with Salama Ahmed Salama, acting editor-in-chief of the
Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram."
</P>
<P>
Li said that Egypt initiated the Middle East peace process, and
has made major contributions in seeking a comprehensive and just
peace in the region, thereby winning admiration from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Major progress had been made in the peace process through the
efforts of the international community and all parties concerned,
Li said. "We are concerned about the current impasse of the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Only after a comprehensive and just peace is realized, all
nations in the region can enjoy real security, he said. The
realization of peace will not only serve interests of the region,
but will also benefit world peace and development, Li added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all parties concerned will oppose interference
and remove obstacles to restore peace negotiations at an early
date on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations and 'land for peace' principles, so as to push ahead the
peace process and finally achieve regional peace, stability and
development," Premier Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has supported solidarity
and cooperation among the gulf nations, and is opposed to external
threats and interference. China holds that remaining problems
should be settled in a just and reasonable way, based on the
relevant resolutions of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the delayed solution of the remaining problems
from the Gulf War will not be helpful to regional peace and
development, or comply with the desire of the relevant nations to
improve relations and cause their national economies to prosper.
</P>
<P>
China values friendship with the gulf nations, and is ready to
advance friendly and cooperative ties with them in a variety of
areas, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Clarifies Reports on State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The reported number of
state-owned enterprises that are in debt has been exaggerated,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Salama Ahmed Salama, acting
editor-in-chief and first editor of the Egyptian newspaper
"Al-Ahram" on Oct. 17, Li said that the figure is less than the
reported estimates of 70,000 and higher.
</P>
<P>
Li said that many state-owned enterprises in China are
well-run, especially those in the country's key industries.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises suffering losses are mainly in traditional and
special industries, he said, such as machinery, textiles,
nonferrous metallurgy, chemicals and defense.
</P>
<P>
The losses are inevitable in the process of restructuring the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 80,000 state-owned enterprises. More than
80 percent of those are small, he said, and only one-third are
losing money. More than 80 percent of those losing money are small
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said, in terms of the total, the ratio of state-owned
enterprises losing money is very high. However, since small
enterprises account for a small proportion of the total asset
value, sales revenues and profits, he said, the total loss is
relatively insignificant. He stressed that most large state-owned
enterprises are making money.
</P>
<P>
For example, the 512 key state-owned enterprises receiving top
priority from the central government account for less than one
percent of state-owned enterprises. However, they account for 55
percent of total assets, more than 60 percent of sales revenues
and 85 percent of profits and taxes paid to the government.
</P>
<P>
In the process of shifting to a market economy, he said, a
considerable number of state-owned enterprises encountered some
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Li said reforming state-owned enterprises is the key point of
China's economic restructuring. "We will focus on invigorating the
state sector of the economy as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, to attain this goal, a modern enterprise system
must be introduced and state enterprises must be strategically
reorganized.
</P>
<P>
The major ways to do this, he said, are properly managing
large enterprises while relaxing control over small ones, enabling
efficient enterprises to prosper while eliminating the inefficient
ones, and increasing efficiency by downsizing staff.
</P>
<P>
The government will concentrate its resources on beefing up
major enterprises with established advantages, making small
enterprises prosperous by relaxing controls, and combining the
reform of state-owned enterprises with their reorganization,
upgrading and improved management, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government encourages superior enterprises to
take over inferior ones, and allows money-losing companies to go
bankrupt. Laid-off workers receive assistance in finding new jobs
and enterprises are relieved of excessive debt and unreasonable
burdens.
</P>
<P>
These measures already are bearing fruit, Li said. As a result,
more and more state-owned enterprises have changed the way they
operate and increased their competitiveness in the
marketplace. The general situation of state-owned enterprises is
improving, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has
put forward a series of explicit measures to accelerate the reform
of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We have the confidence to get most of the state-owned
enterprises out of the doldrums through unremitting efforts," he
said.

<HEADLINE> China To Check Unemployment at Reasonable Level: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has an unemployment rate
of about three percent and the government is trying to retain it at
a "reasonable" level, Chinese Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Salama Ahmed Salama, acting
editor-in-chief and first editor the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram"
on Oct. 17, Li said that unemployment in urban areas is nearly six
million. He said that the actual unemployment rate in urban areas
is probably higher than the registered figure of three percent.
</P>
<P>
"China does have a problem of unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a population of 1.2 billion, he said, and the
government is trying hard to keep the unemployment rate at a
"reasonable level" by training laid-off workers for re-employment
and by increasing production.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of China's population is in rural areas; 13
million babies are born every year. Surplus labor has been one
result of higher productivity in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
This is a problem for every developed country and this problem
still exists in all countries, Li said, especially developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese farmers have built large numbers of
township enterprises by themselves since the beginning of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great creation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that these enterprises have not only invigorated the
rural economy and increased farmers' income, but have also
provided job opportunities for many rural people. This will help
stem the flow of rural people into urban areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that, so far, township enterprises in the country have
taken in 120 million laborers. In addition, 60 million rural
people have gone from less developed areas to more developed
coastal areas for employment.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the coastal areas are in need of laborers for
economic development, while less developed areas have a surplus,
Li said there is a mutual need for a labor flow that benefits both
sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the duty of governments at all levels is to maintain an
orderly flow of labor, to protect laborers' legitimate rights and
interests and to safeguard social stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of rural laborers have learned production
skills and become the backbone of local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government's policy on the growing
number of surplus laborers is to encourage the development of
township enterprises and service industries that are based on
local raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China has required governments
at all level to be responsible for environmental protection and
earnestly carry out a strategy of sustainable development, Chinese
Premier Li Peng said.
Y  Li made the remarks in an interview with Salama Ahmed Salama,
acting editor-in-chief and first editor of the Egyptian newspaper
"Al-Ahram" on October 17.
</P>
<P>
He said China has viewed environmental protection as a matter
of overall importance, and has taken protecting the environment as
a basic national policy since it initiated the policy of reforms
and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated a series of policies and laws to step up
environmental protection, Li said, adding that in 1996 China had
shut down 60,000 small businesses which were severe polluters.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the country's 9 percent economic growth rate since
1979 has generally not damaged the environment because of the
effectiveness of protective measures.
</P>
<P>
China has incorporated sustainable development into its
strategy for modernization in accordance with the Ninth Five-year
Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2010 adopted in the fourth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress held in March
last year, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Discusses Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The process of Hong Kong's
return to the motherland has strongly proved the feasibility of
China's "one country, two systems" policy, said Premier Li Peng in
an interview earlier this month with the Egyptian newspaper
"Al-Ahram".
</P>
<P>
Li said the successful return of Hong Kong has opened up
brought prospects for China's resumption of sovereignty over Macao
and resolution of the Taiwan issue in accordance with the policy of
"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has entered a new age in which Hong Kong people
administers its own affairs with a high degree of autonomy," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong, as an important
international financial and trade center, has played a great role
in advancing the nation's economy and promoting its ties with the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
China has in return given strong support for the sustained and
stable development of Hong Kong's economy and provided convenient
conditions for the region apart from being an extensive market to
it.
</P>
<P>
A large share of Hong Kong's entrepot trade volume results from
trade with the mainland, with the two parts forming a healthy
eocnomic tie based on mutual promotion and common progress.
</P>
<P>
Li said "one country, two systems" policy is an important part
of Deng Xiaoping's theories, which became the guiding maxims of
the Communist Party of China in its 15th Congress which convened
recently. The continued stability and development of Hong Kong
after the return reflects the sincere implementation of the "one
country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international metropolis, Li said, "and we
welcome countries and regions to conduct rightful economic and
cultural activities there so as to strengthen the links and
exchanges between Hong Kong and them as well as those between
China and the rest of the world. However, Li stressed, "we would
not allow any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs by
taking advantage of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Destroy Last Batch of Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will destroy
its last batch of 1,000 stockpiled anti-personnel landmines
(APLs) this week, local daily, The Star, quoted military sources
as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The detonation program, involving 260,000 landmines, began in
May and received worldwide publicity as a positive move towards
eliminating mines, which are estimated to cause 26,000 deaths or
injuries worldwide every year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa promised to destroy landmines early this year,
but it noted that a limited and verifiable quantity of APLs were
to be kept in storage "solely for training specific military
personnel in demining techniques and for research into the
demining process".
</P>
<P>
"All demining training and research will be carried out under
the strictest government supervision and control," South African
National Defense Department reiterated Monday.
</P>
<P>
The detonation is to take place Thursday at Alkantpan test
range, near Copperton in the Northern Cape Province.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been making efforts to ban the production,
use and sale of landmines, and was one of more than 100 countries
and organizations which met in Oslo, Norway, recently to hammer
out a treaty banning APLs.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will be formally signed at an international
conference in Ottawa, Canada, in December.

<HEADLINE> More Generators Added to Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Three more generating units
are expected to be added to the original two, which will begin
operation in 2003, as work on the Three Gorges Project has been
going faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Dafu, expert from the Yangtze River Water Conservation
Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources, said today that
increases would be required in static investment of 2.6 billion
yuan (about 300 million U.S. dollars) and in dynamic investment of
more than 5 billion yuan (600 million U.S. dollars) to carry out
the plan.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, the added generators will produce more than
26 billion kilowatts/hour of electricity, which means the Three
Gorges Project would make an additional 10 billion yuan (about 1.2
billion U.S. dollars) in output value.
</P>
<P>
Five turbo-generators are expected to be separately fixed in
2001, one year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to the original design, the first generator at the
left-bank water power station of the Three Gorges Project would be
put into operation in 2003, and the first one on the right bank
would begin producing electricity in the beginning of 2007. The
total of 26 generating units would be put into operation in 2009.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the temporary dams will be raised from 135
meters to 142-145 meters, which should improve the project's
capacity for regulating floods and improving navigation, Yuan
said.

<HEADLINE> Abacha's Candidature of Presidency Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state general
Sani Abacha cannot contest any election because he is not a
registered member of any political parties in the country,
according to Information and Culture Minister Walter Ofonagoro.
</P>
<P>
"The mind of the head of state at the moment is not in the
presidency of the fourth republic," the minister said, adding
that "it is people who are trying to drag him in."
</P>
<P>
According to press reports today, the minister also advised
Nigerians to be more interested in the success of the transition
program and not who becomes the president.
</P>
<P>
At present, he stressed that they should be concerned about
electing credible people into the house of assembly on December 6
this year and in subsequent elections.
</P>
<P>
Ofonagoro, who is also the spokesman of the government,
reiterated the government decision that no officials are allowed
to participate in the election while still holding his or her
positions.
</P>
<P>
There was no chance for anybody in the present administration
to evolve into anything in the coming civilian government except
he or she resigns and contest elections at the ward level, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the military government's three-year transition
program, presidential election will be held next year, with the
elected government taking power from the military on October 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
it has become a hot topic in Nigeria whether Abacha should
quit the military and participate in the election. Abacha himself
has said it was a matter that one should think about and it would
depend on the will of his continuity.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit
increased to 2.50 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of the
current fiscal year (from April to September) as against 1.81
billion dollars in the corresponding period of fiscal 1996, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The higher trade deficit was on account of a 7.6 percent growth
in imports during the period which outpaced the export growth of
4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the data released by the Indian Commerce Ministry
here Monday, exports during April-September 1997 was 16.82
billion dollars compared with 16.14 billion in the same period of
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This represents a growth of 4.2 percent, indicating that the
sustained slowdown in the country's export since 1996 has not been
overcome yet.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, imports during
April-September 1997 stood at 19.32 billion dollars compared with
17.95 billion in the same period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps to New Low Before Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar plunged
to a four-year low today following dramatic falls on Wall Street
and in domestic shares, before bouncing back more than one U.S.
cent to close stronger on the day.
</P>
<P>
In a volatile session, the local currency reached a new low of
68.18 U.S. cents in morning trading, a level not seen since
December 1993, and a high of 69.75 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 69.25 U.S. cents, up from Monday's
close of 68.61 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Moore, St. George Bank foreign exchange trading manager,
said it had been a very volatile day for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Moore said the local unit came under pressure following the
fall on Wall Street overnight and the 10 percent decline today in
the Australian Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
But he said aggressive buying of the local currency by one
American institution in particular had pushed the Australian
dollar up through 69 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Traders also said there were unconfirmed rumors in the
financial markets that the Reserve Bank of Australia had been
buying up the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"People are sitting back and trying to keep their noses clean
at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All eyes will be on Wall Street. There is plenty of
nervousness and plenty of uncertainty," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was at 88.58 Japanese yen
from 83.69, and against the Deutsche mark it was at 1.1959 from
1.2140.

people to foster a correct world outlook, outlook on life and
concept of value.
</P>
<P>
The second is to continue the reforms to remove the soil that
corruption grows in.
</P>
<P>
The third is to promote the development of democracy and the
legal system, improve the democratic supervisory system, and
prevent the abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
There must be laws to abide by and everyone must obey the
law. Laws must be enforced strictly and law-breakers must be
brought to book, he said, adding that those whose duty is law
enforcement but break the law and take bribes and bend the law
must be punished severely.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that market economy does not belong just to
capitalism, and that socialism can also adopt a market
economy. China's economic reforms are aimed at establishing a
system of a socialist market economy, and any form of management
or organization that reflects the rules of socialized production
can be used.
</P>
<P>
"Our guideline is to maintain public ownership as the mainstay
while securing common development of all sectors of the economy,"
he said, adding that further readjusting and improving the
structure of ownership is a major task of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the non-public sectors have grown remarkably and
have become an important part of the socialist economy, and
encouraging these sectors to expand in a healthy way is important
for meeting market demands, increasing employment, and developing
productivity.

PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair has opened the door to
European single currency euro but excluded Britain's joining
before the year 2002. British Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown
presented Monday to the House of Commons the policy of his
government, making clear a position of principle in favor of the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
-- Four days after the local elections and despite the blocade
of principal streets of Algiers by the authorities, thousands of
Algerians defied fear by responding to a call of the Front of
Socialist Forces -- one of the major opposition parties -- to
protest the "massive" fraud in the elections held last Thursday,
in which the presidential National Democratic Rally won a majority
of seats in communal parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The international stock exchange markets experienced a very
agitated day on Monday, when Asian, European and American stock
markets suffered strong falls. The Wall Street failed to fend off
the wave of shock from this financial crisis and the fall of the
Dow Jones index forced the market authorities to interrupt
provisionally quotations, in a near crash never seen since the
1987 collapse.
</P>
<P>
-- According to simulations made by Le Figaro, the French
right-wing Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy,
whose deputies are now ruling 19 regions out of 22 in France, are
no longer exerting domination in these regions except five --
Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne, Il-de-France (Paris region),
Basse-Normandie and Pays de Loire.

their respective armed forces.
</P>

their economic development and prosperity.
</P>

Commission, made his remarks here today in a meeting with Tan Keng
Yam, visiting Singapore deputy prime minister and defense minister.

<HEADLINE> G-15 to Adopt Guidelines for Project Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The group of 15 developing
countries (G-15) will adopt a set of guidelines for implementing
projects to ensure they are streamlined and concentrated in
priority areas, G-15 Economic Affairs Officer Lim Aik Hoe said
today.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will be applicable immediately and cover mostly
technical aspects apart from providing more cohesiveness in the
way member countries undertake projects, Lim said while briefing
reporters after the fourth meeting of the Governing Council of the
Committee on Investment, Trade and Technology (CITT), here ahead
of the inaugural meeting of G-15 economic ministers on October 31.
</P>
<P>
"The projects should be feasible and beneficial to member
nations. They should deal with an area that is not already
covered... It is important that the projects should add value and
bring something new or required by member countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said member nations would not be bound to the
guidelines for approval of their projects but it would help them
in obtaining support from other member countries in the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said the G-15 economic officials at their meeting today
asked the private sectors in member nations to give greater
commitment in the grouping's business and investment programs.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that greater business involvement is required to
energize the work of the Business and Investment Forum (BIF), a
G-15 project, Lim said, adding member countries felt that much
more could be done to bring in the private sector into the
mainstream of the BIF.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the G-15 members will convene a seminar in New
Delhi, India, in January next year to share their experience and
look for ways to facilitate trade among member countries, Lim
said.
</P>
<P>
Intra-trade among G-15 countries totaled 72 billion U.S.
dollars last year against the 64 billion dollars in 1995. And the
grouping's total trade in 1996 rose 8.8 percent to 796 billion
dollars, accounting for 7 percent of global trade.
</P>
<P>
G-15 now comprises Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will be admitted as the 16th member at the G-15 summit
here from November 3 to 5 which will discuss measures to be taken
for a more positive and constructive dialogue with developed
nations, according to a statement by the Malaysian Foreign
Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time for Malaysia to host the G-15
summit. The inaugural summit was held here in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Uganda Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital investment to
Uganda has declined from 157 million U.S. dollars in May-June to
38.5 million U.S. in July-August, The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
The slow-down of the investment inflow was caused by the
budget speech read by the finance minister on June 12 this year,
Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) said in its July-August 1997
operating summary report.
</P>
<P>
The budget speech announced to abolish tax holidays as an
incentive to investors.
</P>
<P>
"Most potential investors were taking cautious steps seeking
for clarification on the new measures and revaluating their
investment dicision," the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there were 40 planned projects expected to create
1,853 jobs in July-August, camparing 76 projects to create 4225
jobs in May-June, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The total approved projects since July 1991 were 2,275 at the
end of August 1997, with a planned investment of 3,799 million
U.S. dollars to create 157,738 jobs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UIA is to create a national technology information unit and to
sponsor a survey of available technology in use, the operating
report said.
</P>
<P>
A private firm has been contracted to handle the work, the
paper said.

CANBERRA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's share market

similar carnage on Wall Street and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The 7.18 percent dive brought to 41 billion Australian dollars
(28.39 billion US dollars) the amount wiped off the market's value
in the past three trading days, and was the fourth largest fall in

</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones' 554.26 point dive to 7161.15, which surpassed
the 508 point crash of Black Monday, 1987, automatically shut
trading on the U.S. stock market for the first time since such
rules were adopted in the aftermath of 1987.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Don Hamson, Westpac Investment Management investment
director, said the market had redeemed itself in late trading as
investors took note of share values.
</P>
<P>
"It redeemed itself in the afternoon as people stopped
panicking and started looking at the value of stocks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fortune favors the brave... The whole market's been sold off
across the board and the bargain hunters are looking," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bellwether BHP staged an admirable recovery after plunging as
much as 1.59 Australian dollars to a low of 12.30 Australian
dollars to close just nine cents down at 13.80 Australian dollars,
which traders attributed to bargain buying in late trade.

<HEADLINE> Laid-Off Workers in China Get Preferential Terms for Reemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has worked out a series of measures
to help find jobs for workers laid off from state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In a recent document, the SAIC urged all its subsidiaries to
expedite the registration of applicants for individually owned or
private businesses filed by laid-off workers. Fees are reduced or
exempted for these applications.
</P>
<P>
The documents needed for the application include a lay-off
certificate issued by relevant labor departments and an
identification card.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, jobless people in
China now number about 8 million, or 4 percent of its labor
force. Six million of those have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million laid-off workers have been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
In China, industrial and commercial offices are responsible for
handling the registration of enterprises as well as the management
of private firms. These offices can arrange temporary business
licenses for the laid-off workers who have special financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The SAIC has also called for preferential terms in bank credit,
business sites, and facilities needed by professionals and
technicians laid off by state enterprises to help them open
scientific, production, and export-oriented private businesses.
</P>
<P>
The SAIC also is encouraging laid-off workers to open businesses
and set up stalls in marketplaces.

<HEADLINE> Israel: None Responsible for Failed Action in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An inquiry committee of the
Israeli army has ruled that the abortive naval commando raid into
Lebanon last month, in which 12 Israeli soliders were killed, was
only a case of bad luck with no one to blame.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Ofir, head of the committee was quoted in Israel Radio as
saying today that the failed action, that has caused a new
campaign in Israel calling for withdrawal of Israeli troops from
South Lebanon, was due to a random ambush but not an intelligence
leak.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this was an incidental ambush which was set up
in the field by the terrorist groups out of fear of an Israeli
army action and not on the basis of concrete information," Ofir
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Hezbollah and Amal guerrilla forces have claimed
responsibility for the attack on the Israeli commando, that was on
a secret mission on a night of September 4 near the village of
Ansariya, north of Lebanese city Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Ofir indicated that military intelligence had apparently
mistakenly assessed that there was a low probability that
guerrillas would plant bombs so deep inside their territory.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed repeatedly that none of the deficiencies in
the actions, carried by intelligence officers and the commando
squad itself, had any direct bearing on the failure.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 15-kilometer-wide buffer zone in South
Lebanon to stop cross-border attacks in 1985, Muslim guerrillas have
attacked its troops frequently and caused many casualties.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Hits Lebanon's University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded late last night
on the campus of American University (AUB) in Beirut, shattering
the windows of two faculty buildings and destroying a professor's
car. No casualty was caused.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese newspaper the Daily Star said that there is no
evidence yet on a possible linkage between the incident and the
current visit of John Waterbury, the first U.S. president of AUB
to come to Beirut in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Waterbury, appointed as the new AUB president in Lebanon in
July, is expected to take office early next year.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's link between the attack and Waterbury's
visit," the paper quoted a student of psychology as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They probably didn't want to hurt anyone but wanted to make a
statement," another student said.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the blast, Waterbury had praised the return of
stability to Lebanon in separate meetings with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi and House speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
No U.S. university president has served in AUB in Lebanon since
the 1984 assassination of President Malcolm Kerr.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba declared here today that a coup has been aborted and the
situation in the capital is "firmly under control".
</P>
<P>
In a short nationwide speech transmitted by Zambian
Broadcasting Corporation at 09:50 local time, Chiluba said "the
situation is firmly under control."
</P>
<P>
"The enemy is defeated. The victory is certain," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Zambians to go to work and not to be
"intimidated and frightened."
</P>
<P>
No shots can be heard in the capital at present.
</P>
<P>
A defense official told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that
the coup has been aborted and all the soldiers involved in the
coup have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
He described the coup as "a small problem" created by some
"drunken soldiers" from the army.
</P>
<P>
Some sporadic shots were heard in the capital after a coup
staged by a group calling itself the National Redemption Council.
</P>
<P>
All government offices and shops were closed earlier this
morning, and few cars were spotted except the armored vehicles
and military vehicles loaded with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers led by Captain Solo (only name) who announced the
coup at seven o'clock local time through Zambia News Broadcasting
Corporation surrounded the State House, where President Frederick
Chiluba lives, and the buildings of Zambia News Agency have been
captured by anti-government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by the coup leader had demanded Chiluba to
surrender and leave the state house, or they would take the State
House by force.

<HEADLINE> Minister: 35 Weekly Labor Hours Won't Destabilize Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Labor Minister Tiziano
Treu said today that 35 labor hours in a week will not destabilize
the Italian government and the "negative predictions should be
avoided."
</P>
<P>
The government stability "would be safeguarded," said Treu,
counter-attacking the recent savaging by the Fiat Group of the
cabinet proposals to introduce a 35-hour working week.
</P>
<P>
Fiat senior officials had said that the cut of labor hours
would weaken the competitiveness of the Italian industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
However, Treu said that it was "wrong to speak about the issue
as if everything had already been decided," since the government
wanted the law to be passed in January with the consensus of all
parties and it would take at least three years for it to become
effective.
</P>
<P>
The work-week cut emerged from a recent crisis-averting deal
with the government's left ally the Communist Refoundation.
</P>
<P>
Employers have slammed the deal while unions have also voiced
doubts about interfering with collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the employers' association Confindustria stressed
today that the cost to business of introducing a 35-hour week
would have to be taken into account in any contract renewals.

JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense and Security
Minister Edi Sudrajat said here today that cooperation in various
fields between China and Indonesia is very important for the
preservation of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting Chinese Air Force Commander Liu
Shunyao, Sudrajat expressed his satisfaction over the development
of the relations between Indonesia and China and their armies.
</P>
<P>
Some countries in Asia-Pacific belong to developing countries
and they can not develop their economy and raise the living
standard of their people without a peaceful and stable
international environment, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Sudrajat, who had just finished a visit to China, said that
China is devoted to economic development and raising the living
standard of its people.
</P>
<P>
He held that China's political situation is stable and believed
that China's economy will develop at high speed.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shunyao, who arrived here on October 23 for a one-week
visit, expressed his satisfaction with the result of his visit,
saying it has reached the goal of strengthening understanding,
learning from each other and developing friendship between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
On October 24, Liu met with Commander of Indonesian Armed
Forces General Feisal Tanjung and Air Force Chief of Staff Air
Marshal Sutria Tubagus.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his party will leave here Wednesday for Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Chief: HK Stock Setback Temporary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said the Hong Kong economy is "fundamentally
strong" and the Hong Kong stock market is expected to bounce back
soon.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted the finance chief as
saying that the current situation being faced by Hong Kong further
reinforces the view that strong economic fundamentals are an
important element in weathering this passing storm in the region.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the Hong Kong stock market has joined
other markets in the region in sharp declines as a result of the
"contagion effect" of the currency crisis sweeping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
After tumbling 646 points Monday in the market's worst slide in
8 years, Hong Kong's 33-stock Hang Seng Index fell as much as
1,621.80 points to 8876 at today's intra-day trading.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong's economy is "fundamentally strong" and is
thus expected to quickly weather the financial storm which has
been hitting Southeast Asian nations since July, de Ocampo said.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Damming Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI (Yellow River), October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow
River was successfully blocked at 10:28 a.m. today on a section 40
km north of Luoyang, an ancient capital in Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The dam work, which began on Sunday at 4:15 p.m., went well
because the flow was only 190 cu.m. per second. Its completion
marks the beginning of the construction of the Xiaolangdi
Multi-Purpose Water Conservation Project.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, who presided over the project's
opening ceremony three years ago, said today, "The damming of the
Yellow River at Xiaolangdi marks a joyful step forward in the
history of taming the river," after Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
announced the success of the damming.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the river is the birthplace of the Chinese
civilization, but it is also a source of great sorrow for the
Chinese. "Controling Yellow River floods and developing
its water resources have remained a top priority of the Party
Central Committee and the State Council."
</P>
<P>
When completed, he added, the Xiaolangdi project will be able
to control catastrophic floods that occur once every 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide a foundation for flood control on the
lower reaches of the river, water-soil conservation on the Loess
Plateau, and economic development on the middle and lower reaches,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show the water flow of the Yellow River once
exeeded 30,000 cubic meters per second and the river had breached
its banks for more than 1,500 times in the past 2,500 years,
claiming the lives of numerous people and causing catastrophes to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese government has made great efforts to bring the wild
river under control. Both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have given
important instructions on controling the river. And President
Jiang Zemin has visited the Xiaolangdi project site.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Conservation Project is the second largest
in China, after the Three Gorges Power Project on the Yangtze
River. When completed, the project will help stop the 10-cm annual
rise of the bed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, by
controling 93 percent of its 649,000-sq-km drainage areas.
</P>
<P>
The dam has other functions as well: ice-run prevention, silt
reduction, irrigation, and water supply.
</P>
<P>
It is also the largest World Bank-financed project in China and
the project that employs the largest number of foreign technicians
and experts.
</P>
<P>
John Anderson, Head Consultant of the project, told Xinhua, "The
Xiaolangdi Project shows that China needs the world and the world
needs China."

to do so," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI (YELLOW RIVER), October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Premier Li Peng, speaking today at a ceremony to mark the
successful damming of the Yellow River at Xiaolangdi, called the
dam work a gratifying sign of progress made in taming the
river.
</P>
<P>
Li congratulated all the Chinese and foreigners involved in the
work, which started on Sunday and took more than 40 hours to
complete, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Li said that 1997 is an unusual year in the Chinese history and
that the country, which is still in the primary stage of
socialism, should take development of productive forces as its
major task.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation, which is part and parcel of the national
economy, is playing a bigger role in national economic growth and
maintaining social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest, is seen as the cradle
of the Chinese civilization, but it has also been the source of
many disasters. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council
have placed great importance on taming the river, and the
Xiaolangdi Dam is a major step taken by the Party and the
government in that direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the project will be able to control
catastrophic floods that usually occur once every 1,000
years, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide opportunities for water and soil
conservation on the Loess Plateau and lay a solid foundation for
the economic development on the middle and lower reaches of the
Yellow River, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony was presided over by Niu Maosheng, minister of
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony were Jiang Chunyun, member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier; Li
Changchun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and secretary of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee; and

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Additional 2000 megawatts of
power will be produced in Bangladesh by the year 2000, which will
be more than the present demand of 3,150 mw, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Bangladeshi Power, Energy and Mineral
Resources Minister Mohammad Nuruddin Khan while visiting the site
of the 100-mw barge mounted power plant in Khulna District last
week.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the minister said, 1,200 mw electricity will
be produced by private initiatives and 800 mw by the government.
</P>
<P>
The present government has been working hard to establish power
plants under public and private initiatives with a view to meeting
increasing demand, the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
Measures to set up barge-mounted power plants along with
land-based power centers within the shortest possible time in
private sector have also been taken considering the time-consuming
and expensive nature of power production, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that final agreements have been reached
with two companies and agreements with two others are afoot. He
hoped that production would begin within 10 months of the
agreements.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Major Polish newspapers today
covered Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States
and viewed it an important visit with "turning significance".
</P>
<P>
The Trybuna newspaper, the organ for Poland's Social Democratic
Party, said in a signed article that the whole world was paying
great attention to President Jiang's visit to the U.S. It was
regarded as the most important event during the recent few months
by commentators, even before Jiang started his trip.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the countries with the fastest economic
development and played an important role in the world. Chinese
economic reform was deepening and had achieved remarkable success.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China had experienced consecutive economic
increases averaging 10 percent yearly, and living conditions were
notably improved. These had greatly changed Washington's, and
other countries' attitudes towards China, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It wished the visit full success.
</P>
<P>
The Zycie Warszawy newspaper expressed belief in an article
that the visit would promote China to open more to the
world. Jiang's visit, which went beyond the category of bilateral
trade relations, would be an historic turning for
Sino-U.S. relations, it said.
</P>
<P>
Other popular newspapers, including the Rzeczpospolita and the
Gazeta Wyborcza newspapers, also gave prominent coverage to the
first visit to the U.S. by a Chinese leader in 12 years. It was a
major event in Sino-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Regional Anti-AIDS Cooperation Urged in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic which
threatens Asian economic development can be tamed through regional
cooperation and shared responsibilities, a senior official of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) said today.
</P>
<P>
"The potentially grave consequences of a widespread AIDS
epidemic on economic development demand forward-looking,
anticipatory strategies to tackle the disease," ADB Vice President
Peter Sullivan said at the on-going 4th International Congress on
AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The five-day congress, which opened here Saturday, is designed
to explore ways to check the quick spread of HIV/AIDS in the
region. HIV is the human immuno-deficiency virus that causes AIDS
(acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome).
</P>
<P>
In his speech titled "HIV and Economic Development," Sullivan
warned that "the AIDS epidemic is the enemy of Asian promise."
</P>
<P>
"It threatens in a material way the progress that Asia has made
over the past several decades. It imposes huge economic costs on
societies, families and individuals, and endangers the economic
development of countries of Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS can be prevented, if not cured," he said, adding that
regional or multicountry approaches can be effective since there
are similarities in the nature of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He said the public sector, non-government organizations, local
community organizations and the private sector "all have parts to
play" in fighting against the spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The private sector can play a major role by providing care
facilities, research and development initiatives and financial and
other types of contributions for HIV/AIDS activities, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has been promoting economic cooperation in the control
and prevention of HIV/AIDS in the Greater Mekong Subregion, which
is the hardest-hit area by HIV/AIDS in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigating Russian Access to Supercomputers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
investigating how Russia acquired U.S-made supercomputers that the
U.S. fears could be used to improve Moscow's nuclear warfare
capabilities, a State Department spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the Russians have those computers,"
spokesman James Rubin told reporters. "And we believe they are at
locations precisely where we did not want them to be."
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government learned last January that Russia
had acquired the computers and considered the matter so serious
that "it has been brought up at the highest levels."
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, U.S. companies sought Department of Commerce
licenses to export high-performance computers to ... weapons
labs in Russia. The application said the computers were in
ground water modeling and simulation," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We did not approve these requests because of the risk of
diversion to nuclear weapons programs at these facilities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States made clear that "Russian refusal to
cooperate in finding a mutual acceptable solution would
jeopardize joint U.S.-Russian cooperation and would result in
tightening of U.S. export controls vis-a-vis Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Russia recently proposed moving the
computers from the weapons labs to other locations under an
agreement that would include U.S. monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"We view this idea with interest and hope the Russian
government makes a formal proposal that we can evaluate," Rubin
said.

<P>
DHAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asiatic Society of Bangladesh
(ASB) has taken up a massive project of compiling a ten-volume
encyclopaedia of Bangladesh, in both English and Bengali, sources
from the ASB said today.
</P>
<P>
Encyclopaedias in English are available in plenty, the sources
stated, adding that only one or two have been compiled in Bengali,
and their lives and usefulness were short-lived for one reason or
another.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, twelve selected scholars from
different disciplines have already written the outline of the
encyclopaedia and another 65 scholars have been selected to
scrutinise this draft.
</P>
<P>
The scholars have been divided into four panels and their task
will be to review the outline, and the outline will be finalised
after the panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
The outline has itself been divided into six subject-based
parts, covering the natural science, biological sciences, arts and
humanities, history and heritage, society and economy, and state
and governance, the sources stated.
</P>
<P>
As each part will be looked after by a separate editorial
committee, there will be a central editorial board charged with
the overall responsibility of bringing out the whole.
</P>
<P>
The encyclopaedia is expected to contain a minimum of ten
thousand entries contributed by more than a thousand scholars from
both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
There is also a plan to preserve the encyclopaedia, when
completed, on a CD-Rom, the sources added.

</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the baht has made overseas trips 40 percent
dearer, while about 600,000 industrial workers have lost their
jobs so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Soaring consumer prices and tax increases have forced the
ordinary Thai people to cut back their spending on non-essential
items, including overseas tours.
</P>
<P>
Many Thais who had deposited money in the 58 finance companies
which had been suspended by the government for their huge debts,
are not able to get access to their money. The 58 finance firms
face either merger or closedown if they cannot raise enough money
to survive before a government-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
The government's belt-tightening policy encourages Thais to
spend their holidays in their home country.
</P>
<P>
The flagging economy has resulted in the closure of a number of
travel agents. Others are resorting to price-cutting just to
survive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) hopes to
take advantage of the lower value of the baht to attract more
inbound tourists over the next two years. In December, the TAT
will launch the amazing Thailand campaign for 1998 and 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plummeted on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
(STII) nose-dived by 123.52 points to reach 1496.38 points at 11
a.m. hitting an all time low level in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers said that this is the first time since December
1992 that the market saw the STII fell below the psychological
support at 1500 points. They noted that the plunge came in the
wake of a sharp sell-off in regional stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets in Hong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia,
Japan and South Korea were all down sharply in early trading. Hong
Kong shares fell by 849.14 points to 9649.06 points at the open.
</P>
<P>
In a chain reaction under the weight of Asia's financial
crisis, freefalls in New York and Europe fueled a new round of
losses as early trading began in Asia, market observers said.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrials Average Index lost
554.26 points, or 7.2 percent, and the New York Stock Exchange
halted trading for half an hour after the Dow fell by 350 points.

<P>
WARSAW, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from 11 Central
European countries have recently decided to jointly undertake a
research project on geodynamics.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the European Foundation for Sciences, researchers
will study the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's
crust in a wide area ranging from the Carpathian Mts, the East
Alps to the Baltic Sea.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Research Institute of Geometrics and
Geodynamics under the Academy of Engineering told reporters that
the project consisted of several regional programs, involving the
lowlands in Hungary, the highlands in the Czech Republic and the
frontier area of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
It intended to determine the movement of the earth's crust in
the central European continent by conducting regular measurement
in 30 selected spots.
</P>
<P>
Scientists conjectured that the Carpathian Mts was moving
northward at a low rate of 1-3 centimeters a year. Research
results from the project are expected to provide reliable
scientific evidence for the hypothesis.

JAKARTA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Spain has agreed to provide a
soft loan of 100 million US dollars to Indonesia, official sources
here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed here

<HEADLINE> US Government Tries to Calm Investors After Stock Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government moved
quickly today to assure investors that market safeguards were
working effectively and the U.S. economy remained fundamentally
sound despite a sharp stock plunge.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to remember that the fundamentals of the
United States' economy are strong and have been for the past
several years, and the prospects for low inflation and low
unemployment are strong," U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks after the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged by 554.26 points before automatic "circuit breakers"
halted trading before the normal market close.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the circuit breakers designed to stop
trading were used. The mechanism had been put in place as one of
the reforms following the stock crash of October 1987 when the Dow
fell by 508 points.
</P>
<P>
While today's sell-off was bigger in point terms, it was far
smaller in percentage terms because the Dow average is three times
the level of a decade ago. The 1987 crash represented a 22.6
percent loss in stock value compared with a 7.2 percent slide this
time.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Working Group on Financial Markets -- the
interagency task force composed of officials at Treasury, the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Securities and Exchange Commission
-- had been convened for the first time and was closely keeping
tabs on market operations.
</P>
<P>
"Our consultations indicate that the payment and settlement
systems and other market mechanisms are working effectively," he
said.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry also told reporters
today that President Clinton was being kept informed of
developments in the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
"The president is confident the fundamentals of the American
economy are strong," McCurry said. "We want everyone to just take
a deep breath and think about where we are.... Let's be calm and
reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the market correction would likely keep the
U.S. Fed from raising interest rates for the rest of the year for
fear of being blamed for more instability.

<HEADLINE> Thai Textile Sector to Benefit from Japanese Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide Thailand
with equipment for textile product quality inspection, which will
help increase the sector's exports, according to a senior Thai
official.
</P>
<P>
The move will help upgrade Thailand's textile exports to reach
the standards required by international markets such as Europe and
Japan, the Bangkok Post today quotes Manu Leopairote, director
general of the Industrial Promotion Department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA), the Japanese government will also fund personnel
training to upgrade textile officials' expertise in textile
product development.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs to move quickly towards producing high-end
products because it is losing competitive edge from its low-wage
neighbors, Manu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's textile industry will also benefit from a
US plan to lift quota restrictions on 20 categories of textiles
and garments as of January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Items under the US quota lift include child garments,
handkerchiefs, stockings, brassieres, cloaks, mixed silk and
fiber-made apparel, silk clothing, and carpets.
</P>
<P>
The US plan is in conformity with international agreements on
textiles and clothing. Under the World Trade Organization's
agreement, the garment trade will have to be liberalized in three
phases by the year 2004.

</P>
<P>
The international credit rating organization also listed PICC

company official.
</P>
<P>
The crediting rating was given by more than 100 insurance
analysts of Standard and Poor's which has collected information

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania opposes "a hasty
refusal" of the security guarantee proposal made by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to the three Baltic nations.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said this today at a
press conference in Vilnius, Capital of Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, he said the Baltic nations
had refused Yeltsin's proposal "too hastily", though they could
express their ideas on this issue after careful deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the security guarantee proposal to Brazauskas
Friday here, that has met strong opposition from Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia soon after.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax reported that Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis
stressed today that Yeltsin's proposal was "unacceptable" while
Lithuanian Parliament Chairman Vytautas Landsbergis said it had
rendered the three nations "protectorates."
</P>
<P>
Also, Estonian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vaino Reinart said
Estonia, guided by the principle of "indivisibility of European
security," would not rely on the security guarantees offered
merely by an individual country.

<HEADLINE>   Bulgarian Professional Soldiers Start Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-nine of the 120 announced
vacancies in the Bulgarian army have been filled by professional
soldiers, the army said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Georgi Ananiev said the campaign for
recruiting professional soldiers ended on October 22 and it had
been partly successful.
</P>
<P>
What was important was that a start had begun in the gradual
professionalization of the army, he said.
</P>
<P>
The process had three envisaged stages -- going from an
experimental start to a mixed, professional-conscript principle of
army building. The formation of entire units of professional
soldiers was expected by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
By law, professional soldiers should not be paid less than
average wage. The first group of professional soldiers will start
with a monthly pay equivalent of 89 to 120 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minimum wage in Bulgaria is something worth 25 dollars and
the unemployment rate has reached 13.63 percent, and even higher
among young people.
</P>
<P>
Professional soldiers will also enjoy some privileges, such as
free life insurance and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Professional military service attracted not only unemployed
youths but university graduates. There were also cases of reserve
officers and sergeants wishing to give up their ranks to become
professional soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Experts reported weaknesses in publicity of the campaign,
especially in the provinces. Fund shortages were a main obstacle.

COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Following intelligence reports
of possible rebel bomb attack in the downtown area of Colombo, the
Sri Lankan police further tightened up their security which has
been high already, well-informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
There were claims in certain security circles that the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was on the verge of
launching another major bombing campaign in the heart of the Sri
Lankan capital, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The warning came two weeks after a truck-bomb exploded in the
city center which resulted in heavy casualties and multi-million

Though key security establishments in the city have been put on
alert, the authorities were unable to identify the facilities
being targeted by the LTTE, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The government on Monday requested foreign diplomats to avoid
being in this potentially dangerous area and cautioned hotels and
government institutions to be wary of fresh bombing attack,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The authorities placed new restrictions on traffic in the city,
under which unattended vehicles could be towed away by police.
</P>
<P>
The security forces sealed off Colombo on Saturday and
conducted a massive crack-down operation in which around 1,000
people were detained.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the security forces were doing their utmost to
hound out the rebels hiding in the city.

<HEADLINE> Peruvians to Continue Talks With Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said today his government will continue to pursue
dialogue with Ecuador in line with a border treaty signed in 1942
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori made the remark at a meeting with top military
officials. He stressed that talks with Ecuador must rely on the
Rio de Janeiro Protocol signed in 1942, which established the
definitive limits of the Peru-Ecuador border.
</P>
<P>
A government release said Fujimori instructed the armed forces
to take preventive actions in order to avert possible clashes
between troops of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Peruvian Foreign Minister Ferrero Costa
refused to grant Ecuador a free and sovereign pathway to the
Amazonas River. Ecuador's territorial demand led to demonstrations
in Lima and other Peruvian cities.
</P>
<P>
But Peruvian authorities say they are willing to attend the
second round of talks with Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru had been embroiled in border disputes since
their independence in the early 19th century, culminating in a
large-scale conflict in January 1995. A cease-fire was achieved
following mediation by the Rio De Protocol Countries.

BANGKOK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives will seek funds for a program to
attract unemployed industrial workers back to farms.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, which will need government budgetary

By the end of the year, about 600,000 industrial workers will

The agriculture ministry is devising incentives for the

to Pitipong Puengboon, deputy permanent secretary of the ministry.
</P>

Enforcement of land leases would also be relaxed under the
program, he said.
</P>

Current regulations set a minimum lease term of five years, but

COLOMBO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a

XIAOLANGDI (Yellow River), October 28 (Xinhua) -- China's
Yellow River was fully blocked at 10:28 am today on a section
40 km north of Luoyang, an ancient capital of China in Henan
province.
</P>
<P>
The dam is the 12th on the river and marks the beginning of
the construction of the Xiaolangdi Multi-Purpose Water Control
Project. Its main purpose is to prevent the perennial flooding,
which has been referred to as the "sorrow of the Chinese nation".
</P>
<P>
The past 2,500 years of recorded history show that the river
has gone over its banks more than 1,500 times and has claimed the
lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
The water control project started in 1994 and is the second
largest after the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-three percent of the Yellow River's
649,000-sq.-km. drainage area is located upstream from Xiaolangdi,
which is expected to increase the flood prevention capacity along
the river, allowing it to stop the kind of catastrophic floods
that happen every 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng attended today's ceremony to celebrate the
success of the dam work, which took more than 40 hours to
complete.

China has over the years supported struggles of developing
countries in safeguarding their own rights and interests at
UN human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
China resolutely opposes Western Countries politicizing the
human rights issue, interfering in internal affairs of developing
countries under the pretext of human rights and sabotaging
international cooperation in the human rights area.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, a few Western countries led by the United States
have proposed an anti-China draft resolution seven times at the UN
conferences on human rights, in an attempt to wantonly interfere
in China's internal affairs, disrupt its stability and contain
China from developing under the pretext of human rights, and
change its road of development and its social system.
</P>
<P>
With support from other developing countries and
justice-upholding countries, China has foiled seven times in a row
the anti-China plot of the Western countries, thus safeguarding the
purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
For years, Chinese leaders have held extensive discussions on
the human rights issue with foreign heads of state, heads of
government and other personnel, in an effort to enhance
understanding and cooperation between China and other countries in
the human rights area.
</P>
<P>
China also has held many rounds of dialogue on human rights
with the European Union and Western countries, and invited foreign
experts and officials of human rights to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as China
Society for Human Rights Studies visited some European countries
at their invitation. Their visits achieved positive results as
they exchanged views on the human rights issue with government and
parliamentary officials and NGO leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has taken an active part in drafting and formulating
international legal instruments on human rights within the UN,
such as the Declaration on the Right to Development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has sent delegations to participate in working
groups charged with drafting the instruments, and has extended its
efforts in the instruments which include the UN Convention on the
Rights of Children, the International Convention on the Protection
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families, the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment, the Declaration on the Right and
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to
Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, and the Declaration on the Protection of
Rights of Persons Belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious and
Linguistic Minorities.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has ratified and acceded to 17 international
human rights conventions, including the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the
International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the
Crimes of Apartheid, the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,
the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention
Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of Children, the
Convention Concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers
for Work of Equal Value, the four Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12,
1949, and their two additional protocols.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has earnestly performed its obligations
prescribed in the conventions it has acceded to, and strictly
implemented the stipulations of the conventions through
legislative, judicial and administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government actively cooperates with
the United Nations. In 1994, it invited the UN Special Rapporteur
on the Question of Religious Intolerance to visit China, and in
1996 and 1997, it invited the chairman of the UN Working Group on
Arbitrary Detention to visit China, in a bid to increase mutual
understanding, which demonstrates China's sincerity in cooperating
with the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Danilovich Kuchma announced Sunday night that he would enter the
next presidential election set for October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence in a television speech that Ukraine's
economy would change for the better by the next election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he said he would participate in the election provided
the national economy would be improved.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, Evgeny Kirillovich Marchuk, also
made public today his decision to run for the presidency in 1999,
the Telefax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuchma's announcement broke the silence of the future
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk reiterated that he would remain faithful to social
democracy and that he would absorb experiences from social
democracies in Europe, and the Russian economic reforms, to align
Ukraine with European countries with advanced economies and
reliable social security.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk headed the Security Department, followed by one year's
service as the prime minister from June 1995 to May 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was recently selected as the candidate of the Social
Democratic Party for the election of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it seemed too early for candidates to announce
their future contests for the presidency two years ahead, and it
was likely to have a bearing on the stability of the national
situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A lovely cloth tiger will be
hunted by tens of millions of Chinese stamp-collectors next year.
</P>
<P>
The design of the tiger, created by Gao Qiuying, a 52-year-old
female farmer in north China's Shanxi Province, will be printed on
a set of stamps to be issued early next year, said a source from
the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Chinese astrological chart is represented by 12
symbolic animals -- the rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake,
horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and the pig -- with one animal
representing a year in a 12-year cycle. 1998 will be the year of
tiger.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, China has annually issued a set of stamps featuring
that year's symbolic animal. The stamps have become favorites of
Chinese stamp collectors.
</P>
<P>
Next year's tiger stamp will be the 19th set of the kind.
</P>
<P>
Gao's design was selected from several hundred entries
submitted by Chinese folk artists.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Forbidden City in central
Beijing, once the home of emperors but now one of the world's most
famous museums, is being refurbished to restore it to its original
look, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 old houses will be reconstructed to line the moat
where barracks used to be situated, said Li Deshan, an official
with the ancient architecture department of the Palace Museum, the
name now given to the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
Residential buildings currently occupying the site will have to
be torn down to make room for the planned construction. A
committee will be set up by the State Cultural Relics Bureau and
the Beijing municipal government to be responsible for the
relocation of residents, said Li.
</P>
<P>
In the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) the imperial city housed more
than 700 soldiers in rooms in surrounding walls on three sides of
the palace, the city gate on the south side being the exception.
</P>
<P>
Work will also be undertaken to dredge the moat and plug the
480 sewage outlets in the water, Li said.

The breakthrough occurred on October 14 when a team of Zerox
scientists demonstrated a gallium nitride-based blue diode laser
under pulsed current-injection conditions at room temperature, the

Despite much work to do to reach the point of commercial

It was learned here that the settlement was reached after
Japanese shipping companies agreed to pay 1.5 million U.S. dollars
as a fine to settle their disputes with the FMC.
</P>
<P>
"While we continue to believe that the FMC's actions were
unfair, unwise and illegal, the carriers reluctantly agreed to
make this payment in the interests of removing any further threat
of sanctions and moving the reform process forward," an attorney
for the Japanese shipping lines said in a statement.

The protracted disputes flared up earlier this month when the
FMC threatened to bar Japanese ships from the U.S. ports.

<HEADLINE> Once Threatened Bird Species Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- After 17 years of efforts by
Chinese scientists, the crested ibis, an internationally protected
bird now only found in China, has increased to an estimated 100 in
number in Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The rare bird used to live in the former Soviet Union, Korea
and Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, too. It has been threatened with
extinction because of low reproductive capacity and bad ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
In China, the ibis had disappeared for 17 years before it was
refound in 1981, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
On May 23, 1981, Chinese scientists found seven crested ibises
in Yangxian, a mountain area far away from
industrial spots and large cities. And then a State level natural
protection zone for the bird was established in the county,
according to Zhong Gaoshi, director of the Shaanxi Protection
Association for Wild Animals.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, Chinese scientists have made great
efforts in the protection and research of the bird. Artificial
propagation and incubation made the bird's numbers increase
rapidly, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Now an estimated 100 ibises have been living in the Yangxian
Natural Protection Zone.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the zone received 2.7 million Japanese yen
(22,310 US dollars) from the Japanese Bird Protection Union for
further protection research work on the bird.

<P>
CARACAS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela loses more than 500
million dollars a year for the absence of a legal frame to curb
the traffic of intellectual counterfeit goods.
</P>
<P>
The National Council For Investment Promotion said protection
of intellectual property rights is an important matter in view of
trade between Venezuela and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The council's spokesman, Luis Soto, asserted the country should
foster the passing of a bill on the Intellectual Property Law
which was stalled in the Congress more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The bill should also be supported by a civil group against
violation on intellectual copyrights, he added.
</P>
<P>
The council reported that effective actions taken recently have
reduced sales of fake software in Venezuela, which percentage of
total software sales went down 68 percent in 1995 from 70
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Council registered an enhancement in the
application of the law in protecting intellectual property.

<P>
NANNING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Su Mingli, a Jing ethnic
minority farmer, has spent more than one million yuan to develop
tourism in his hometown of Wanwei Island, Dongxing City, Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China.
</P>
<P>
His restaurants and shops on the island receive more than 3,000
tourists every day. And more than 300 Jing islanders have
participated in the local government's effort to build up the
tourism market, pouring in a total investment of over 30 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Jing, one of China's smallest ethnic minority groups, has a
population of 20,000. They live in Dongxing's Wutou, Wanwei, and
Shanxin islands bordering Vietnam. In the past they made a living
from fishing, and were isolated from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, they have prospered as a result of
border trade and deep-sea fishing. Wutou Island's more than 1,300
Jing families registered more than 6,000 yuan in per-capita net
income last year, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 300 overseas firms have joined in the
development, with 125 million yuan in investment.

Autonomous Region has vowed to limit environmentally destructive
industries to maintain the region as one of the country's cleanest
places, said Xu Mingyang, vice-chairman of the regional government
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Xu, in charge of environmental protection in Tibet, said

According to Xu, the regional government will take full account
of the needs of environmental protection when formulating
industry, energy, technology and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
He said the local government is working on a series of
regulations on pollution control in township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has set environmental protection
requirements for existing large and medium-sized enterprises to
prevent them from discharging untreated wastes into the
surroundings.

<P>
An environmental protection committee has been set up to
coordinate and handle major environmental issues.

Tibet is currently one of the cleanest regions in China with
pure air, high transparency and a fairly good state of atmospheric
environmental quality. Acid rain has never occurred in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of the main rivers all over the region is
quite good and most of the lakes are in their primary state.

BEIJING, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Law of Technology
Contracts, which has been in place in China for ten years, has
significantly promoted the development of technology markets in
the country, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the law's guidance, domestic technology trade volume has
been increasing by a large margin every year.
</P>
<P>
For example, the volume exceeded 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion
US dollars) by the end of last year, almost 10 times the figure in
1987, when the law was instituted.
</P>
<P>
The progress of the technology market has greatly stepped up
industrial restructuring, upgraded the quality of products and
improved technology in enterprises, the paper quoted Lu Shiliang,
deputy-director of China Technology Management and Promotion
Center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Technology contracts have provided a legislative basis for
co-operation among domestic and overseas enterprises, research
institutes and institutions of higher learning over the past 10
years," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, technology

DALIAN, October 28 (Xinhua) -- China stopped some 200 ships
carrying foreign garbage from entering the country last year,
according to a state environmental protection official.
</P>
<P>
Following the shocking exposure of imported chemical refuse in
1994, China has stepped up its checks and supervision on rubbish
imports and handled instances of illegal imports in Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai over the past years.

In January this year, the Shanghai judicial department handed
down a ten-year prison term to the man who organized the export of
garbage to China. The man, who was from the United States, was
expelled from China after paying a fine.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- American film director Mark
Rydell lashed out at the American "blockbuster" movies at the
ongoing Third Shanghai International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
Rydell, an international judge at this year's festival, was
asked by some journalists about whether those big movies are the
mainstream of American films. He flatly denounced the idea.
</P>
<P>
"No, it is a misunderstanding. It is a mistake for so many
movies to seek special effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some producers make lots of entertainment films to attract
teen-agers, but those films have no content, no art. Movies should
come back to the problems that human beings really need to solve,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Rydell was born in New York in 1934. He has directed many
award-winning movie scripts such as "On Golden Pond" and "The
River," and has received 28 Academy Award nominations.
</P>
<P>
This is Rydell's first visit to Shanghai.

11.

Schumacher could not continue after the accident while
Villeneuve finished the race and snatched the season's title.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Reverend Jesse Jackson
has brought thousands of supporters to California's Capitol in
Sacramento, seeking to restore affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
Jackson is targeting Proposition 209, approved by 54 percent of
state voters last November to abolish race- and gender-based
preferences in public hiring, contracting and education.
</P>
<P>
Now that the law has survived court challenges, Jackson says
it's time for President Bill Clinton to enforce federal civil
rights laws and overturn it.
</P>
<P>
Jackson suggested today that the federal government withhold
money for California programs if the state repudiates the vision
of Martin Luther King Jr. for an inclusive America, United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the Capitol, Proposition 209 supporters
invoked King as well in calling for a color-blind society --
without preferences.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's rally, involving about 10,000 people, was the latest
in a series against the initiative, beginning with a march across
the Golden Gate Bridge last summer.

<HEADLINE> Hussein: Jordan Continues Committed to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein said today
that his country continues committed to a just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East despite various challenges.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark at a joint press conference here this
evening with visiting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will continue to try to "help restore rights to the
Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese people," the king said.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that he was disappointed with the current situation
between his country and Israel, which signed a peace agreement in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The third anniversary of the signing of the accord fell on
Sunday, but there were no celebrations planned for the historic
event.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of Jordan-Israel peace was "encouraging and full
of hopes, but the conditions had not remained the same all the
way," the king said, quoted by Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan-Israel peace treaty covers political, trade,
economic and other issues, but only one item, the full opening of
the border, has so far materialized.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries slumped after Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent two secret agents to assassinate
a Hamas leader in Amman last month.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab countries that conceived
peace with Israel. The other is Egypt.

BRUSSELS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Sir Leon Brittan,
vice-president of the European Commission, the European Union
(EU)'s executive body, today flew to South Korea for high-level

</P>
<P>
Top of Sir Leon's agenda will be trade liberalization talks,

South Korea's National Assembly is currently considering a

of ongoing negotiations in the World Trade Organization on
financial services.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Reach Agreement Over Shipping Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC) today approved a settlement with Japanese
carriers ending a dispute that had threatened to close American
ports to Japanese cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
It was learned here that the settlement was reached after
Japanese shipping companies agreed to pay 1.5 million U.S. dollars
as a fine to settle their disputes with the FMC.
</P>
<P>
"While we continue to believe that the FMC's actions were
unfair, unwise and illegal, the carriers reluctantly agreed to
make this payment in the interests of removing any further threat
of sanctions and moving the reform process forward," an attorney
for the Japanese shipping lines said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The protracted disputes flared up earlier this month when the
FMC threatened to bar Japanese ships from the U.S. ports. Japan's
three major shipping companies had refused to pay 4 million
dollars in the FMC-imposed fines after the Japanese government
rejected the U.S. demand for reforming their port practices which
were alleged by the U.S. side as biased against foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japanese negotiators reached agreement in
principle on most aspects of the dispute on October 17, but a gap
remained on whether the fines should be paid by the Japanese
shipping firms.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement requires final approval of the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the settlement
was consistent with the terms the administration had been seeking.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement would promote competition and increased
efficiency at Japanese ports.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Dissatisfied With German Stance Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that Germany should not take a negative
attitude toward Turkey's European Union (EU) membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Demirel said that German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had assured Turkey that Bonn would help
pave the way for Ankara's EU membership issue, but their actions
"are now disturbing Turkey."
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had reportedly told a EU
ministerial meeting in Luxembourg last weekend that Germany is
"sceptic" about the success of Turkey's EU bid.
</P>
<P>
Turkey can hardly be invited to talks on accession so long as
it fails to settle its conflict with the Kurds and improve its
human rights record, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has always been termed by Ankara as the biggest
obstacle for Turkey's success to be admitted into the European
body.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for Germany not to know the value of
Turkey," Demirel said, "it is also against Bonn's own interests
to withdraw its support for Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president, however, expressed his belief that
Europe will be wise enough not to exclude Turkey from the EU
enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers gathered in Mondorf, a resort town in
Luxemburg, to discuss their strategy for talks with eastern and
southeastern European countries wishing to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is scheduled to hold a summit meeting at the end of
this year to make decisions on the plan to start membership
talks with some prospective EU candidates.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been making efforts for full EU membership
but so far no positive results have been achieved due to its
differences with the EU, including the Kurds problem, the Cyprus
issue, human rights as well as its weak economy.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit visited some EU countries, such as
Germany, France and Sweden, to rally support for Turkey's EU
bid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Iraq over Cutting Ties with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Monday warned Iraq of serious consequences by suspending its
dealing with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warning came after Iraq's parliament had earlier
recommended Iraq cut ties with U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction as a
gesture to counter a U.N. Security Council resolution threatening
more sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council last week approved a resolution
threatening to impose a travel ban on Iraqi officials alleged to
have hindered the inspectors from carrying out their work.
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq decides to follow the assembly's advice, that would
have serious consequences," a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to comment on what the consequences
might be, only saying: "We have a wide range of options. I do not
want to go beyond that at this time."
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.N. weapons inspectors had not reported any
problems in their inspection and monitoring activities in the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman called the Iraqi parliament's
recommendation "a crude attempt to intimidate the security
council", which he said would not be "successful."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq needs to understand clearly that it must cooperate with
UNSCOM's mission. UNSCOM must be given full and complete access
to the sites, documents and personnel that it seeks to fulfill
its mission," he said.

<HEADLINE> At least 10 Reported Dead in Snowstorm in Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Snowstorms in the Plains in
the United States during the weekend led to at least 10 deaths and
left hundreds of thousands of people without power in the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
The first big snowstorm of the season dumped 22 inches of snow
on Denver, the city's worst for October, and record snowfalls were
registered in parts of Iowa and Nebraska. In the Colorado
foothills, snow piled up to 50 inches in Coal Creek Canyon, about
33 kilometers west of Denver.
</P>
<P>
The blizzard knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of
people from the Plains to the Great Lakes. As many as 230,000
homes and businesses were blacked out today in Michigan and more
than 70,000 were without power in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people had to seek shelters in airports, bus
terminals and along highways. As airlines sharply reduced flights
in the region, thousands of travelers were stranded at airports.
</P>
<P>
Schools in many communities were closed from eastern Colorado
into Iowa. Major highways had reopened today, but several roads
were still blocked by three-meter drifts in southeastern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said that four people were found
dead in stranded cars, three of them from the cold and one from
carbon monoxide poisoning in east Colorado. An 11-year-old boy in
tiny Stratton, near the Kansas line, died after becoming lost in
the snow after sledding.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, a 77-year-old woman who tried to walk from her
stranded car to her home was found dead in 18 inches of snow. Two
deaths were blamed on the storm in Nebraska, one in Illinois and
one in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
National Guardsmen had used helicopters, snowmobiles and
all-terrain vehicles to rescue stranded motorists or residents
from powerless homes.
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters supplied warmth today for some of the
hundreds of thousands of people left without power.

129.50 points to end at 4,840.7, below the 4,900- point level as
Wall Street slipped further into the red and the British
Chancellor Gordon Brown ruled out early UK entry into European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

A poor performance on Wall Street on Friday and dollar weakness
also hurt market sentiment, leaving the DAX-30 index 171.75 points
lower at 3,879.12.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Announces Breakthrough in Blue Laser Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at U.S. company
Zerox's research center in Palo Alto, California, announced today
that they developed a blue diode laser beam preluding a new
generation of high-speed laser printing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough occurred on October 14 when a team of Zerox
scientists demonstrated a gallium nitride-based blue diode laser
under pulsed current-injection conditions at room temperature, the
company said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Despite much work to do to reach the point of commercial
application, the new technology reassures Xerox' leading
position in the printing industry, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Supported by Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, the scientists are making efforts to create light-emitting
diodes and laser diodes that operate in the blue to green region
of the visible spectrum where the shorter wavelength of the beam
can result in a two-fold increase in printing resolution.
</P>
<P>
The spot diameter of a blue laser is half that of an infrared
laser, critical for color laser printing where accurate spot
placement and size control are necessary for higher quality work.
</P>
<P>
One way to create laser diodes is to lay down remarkable thin
layers of semiconducting materials.
</P>
<P>
Besides printing, the technology may be applicable to other
systems including high-capacity compact-discs.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also link blue laser's usage to military systems
including covert communications, biological warfare and missile
threat warning.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Urges Environmental Tax Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) official
today urged the European Council to endorse environmental tax
reform which she believes has an important contribution to making
a cost-effective means of reaching environmental objectives.
</P>
<P>
EU Environment Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard made the appeal at
a conference on environmental tax reform held today in Brussels,
saying that she "believes very much in the economic efficiency of
taxes creating incentives to change behavior."
</P>
<P>
She rejected the idea that all EU member states should go at
the speed of the slowest, saying that she is seeking to amend
Community legislation in the area of taxation in such a way as to
enable member states to press ahead while "taking care not to
fragment the single market."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner further underlined the need "to shift away
from taxes and charges on labor towards energy, natural resources,
waste and pollution."
</P>
<P>
She urged all the participants in the conference, from
industry, government, think-tanks or NGOs, to support the EU's
efforts to convince all the member states that environmental tax
reform is "valid, necessary, and can be put into practice
immediately by adoption of the proposal for an energy products
tax."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: US Federal Deficit Lowest Since 1974 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal budget
deficit dropped to 22.6 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997 ending
September 30, the lowest since 1974, U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced today.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Democratic Leadership Council, President
Clinton said the federal deficit is down by 267 billion dollars
since he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit in last fiscal year is the lowest
since 1974 when it was 6.1 billion dollars. The deficit is now
equal to 0.3 percent of America's gross domestic products (GDP),
also the lowest since 1970, the year after the U.S. government
recorded its last budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit hit a record high of 290.4 billion
dollars in 1992 and has been declining since that time, helped out
by an improving economy and the tax increases and spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
The White House and U.S. Congress reached a balanced-budget
agreement in August aiming at wiping out all the deficit by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government deficit is now lower than any other major
industrialized country and has declined to a point in relationship
to the overall economy that is viewed as insignificant by many
economists.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. government officials warned that tax cuts would likely
cause the deficit to increase next year.
