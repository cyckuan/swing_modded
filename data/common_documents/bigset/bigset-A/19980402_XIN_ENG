<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Surges in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. construction spending
increased in February for the third consecutive month, with gains
in housing and government construction offsetting a dip in
commercial projects, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.3 percent increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 622 billion U.S. dollars, followed stronger gains of 0.7
percent in January and 0.8 percent in December, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Construction has been boosted in recent months by a drop in
long-term interest rates caused by Asian financial and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The monthly growth was led by a 1.1 percent increase in
residential construction, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
278.8 billion dollars. Single-family construction climbed up 1.9
percent and remodeling, 0.1 percent, but apartment building
declined 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government construction rose 1 percent, the largest increase in
four months, to a rate of 140 billion dollars. Increases in
housing projects, highways and streets, military buildings,
offices and water systems offset drops in the construction of
schools, hospitals and sewer systems.
</P>
<P>
Commercial construction fell 2.6 percent in February, the
biggest drop since August 1995, to a rate of 158.9 billion
dollars. Private school and college construction rose, but
factory, office, hotel and shopping center spending all went down.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Underlines Importance of Educating Cadres (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of the "Study on
Party Building" journal carries an important speech on the
education of leading cadres by the Communist Party of China (CPC)
General Secretary Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, delivered by Jiang on December 22, 1997, the
Party leader gives top priority to the role of cadres in carrying
out various tasks of the country.
</P>
<P>
Cadres are a decisive factor in implementing the correct line
and policy, arousing the masses of people, and resolving problems
in the Party and the society, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the 21st century is a century in which the CPC will
lead the people to invigorate the Chinese nation in an all-round
way, Jiang said the Communist Party shoulders a great historical
responsibility, and the cadres, especially leading and
middle-ranking cadres, shoulder the great historical
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Strict criterions must be adhered to, in order to fostering and
training young cadres and to help them become ideal successors of
the older generation, he says.
</P>
<P>
The on-job leading cadres at all levels are well-learned,
energetic and much younger, but they lag behind the veteran cadres
of the older generation in terms of political experience, the
ability to organize, and ideological style, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Some cadres have failed to stand the trial since the
country launched its current reform and opening-up drive in the
late 1970s, he says, urging cadres to learn lessons from the past
experience.
</P>
<P>
Jiang criticizes some cadres for their failure to study
theories assiduously, to ponder problems deeply, make
investigations and studies, and work hard and in a down-to-earth
way. And some of them have even been indulged in luxury life, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
He pledges to wipe out all these evil styles that would be
detrimental to the State and the people.

Meanwhile, in his speech, Jiang reiterates what he has said
repeatedly that leading cadres should be subjected to the serious
and strict demands and disciplines, management and supervision,
and, leading cadres should respect, retrospect and encourage
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Party chief calls on cadres to give top priority to
studying, so as to improve their theoretic and knowledge level. He
proposes to launch a new wave of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also advises cadres to maintain a high uniformity with
the Party Central Leadership, seriously implement the principle of
democratic centralism, serve the people sincerely, and behave
themselves and welcome supervision.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he emphasizes the crucial role of the major figure of
any party or government unit, saying that the leader is equal to
other leading members and, meanwhile, he plays a especially
important part.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries Company will join hands with Germany's Basf AG to build
a chemical base in Shanghai to produce di-phenylmethane
di-isocyanate (MDI), a key element for polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
The base will cost 25 billion yuan for the first phase of
construction work and will be built up within three years. It is
expected to produce 160,000 tons of MDI a year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the third largest of its kind worldwide,
after the other two in the US and Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
China's demand for polyurethane rose to 500,000 tons in
1997 from 100,000 tons in 1980. China is expected to become a
center in Asia to produce items made of polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
The base is expected to help China save 200 million US dollars
in foreign exchange which was used for exporting polyurethane
before.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Becomes Major Market for Zambian Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo
has become a major market for Zambian goods, a Zambian minister
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Enock Kavindele said the
present value of non-traditional exports to Congo now amount to
40 million U.S. Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
By exploring more trade opportunities in Congo, the value of
the non-traditional exports will increase to 100 million Dollars
in the next two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the ministry is in the process of appointing
a trade commissioner to be based in Lubumbashi, a border city
inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is also exploring business opportunities in Namibia and
the United States, while goods such as beef have generated a lot
of interest on the South African market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Zambia will sign a trade agreement with the
Southern African Customs Union next week to enable Zambian goods
to have an easy access to the southern African market.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Hikes Aircraft Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Wednesday approved price increases of fuels used by aircraft by
between 16 and 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Transport and energy minister Enos Chikowore said in a
statement that the prices of the fuels would be adjusted on a
monthly basis while an announcement on the prices of petrol,
diesel and illuminating paraffin would be made in due course.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the recent depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar
against the U.S. dollar," he said, "the level of our fuel prices
cannot be sustained. The effect of the low prices is that traffic
is now coming from other countries to fuel in Zimbabwe,."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's fuel prices are the lowest in southern Africa and
drivers of heavy vehicles travelling in the region are reported
to be coming here for fuelling because of the cheap prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is understood to be hesitant to
increase the prices of petrol and diesel in fear of triggering
protests by consumers since such increases would have ripple
effects on the prices of other goods.
</P>
<P>
The government's delay in adjusting the prices of petrol and
diesel is causing the state-run oil procurement agency, the
national oil company of Zimbabwe, to lose millions of dollars
every week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia-Europe Summit Poses Challenges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Asian leaders will meet their
European counterparts in London on April 2-4 for their second
summit in great expectations of winning European support to
address the economic woes confronting some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
But will the Asem summit live up to the expectations of Asian
leaders? There have been signs that the summit will pose
challenges to East Asian leaders who face a tough task to prod
Europeans into offering more aid to help shore up their battered
economies.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to focus on the currency crisis
besetting a number of Asian nations, while setting aside human
rights and other thorny political issues. Fifteen European Union
member states and 10 Asian countries will be represented.
</P>
<P>
The second Asem summit "is quite timely in the sense that we
are now facing this financial crisis," said Apinan Pavanarit,
director-general of the European Department of Thailand's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, where the currency crash first started, will explain
to European leaders what steps have been taken to restore
confidence. It will also ask European countries to roll over and
restructure corporate debts and provide export credits.
</P>
<P>
Other Asian nations will likely make similar requests.
</P>
<P>
East Asian countries have been unhappy about the slow response
by Europe to help out with Asia's crisis. The EU extended 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in export credit loans to Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea in 1997 but have refrained from making greater
contributions ever since.
</P>
<P>
Europe is perceived by certain Asian countries to even have
lagged behind the United States and Japan in coming to the
region's rescue. Asian countries have complained that the United
States and Japan have not done enough to help them out.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be friends just in times of prosperity, we should
be friends in times of need as well," said Apinan.
</P>
<P>
He said Europe was interested in Asia's problems because it had
a vested interest. European banks have loan exposure of 350
billion U.S. dollars in Asia greater than the U.S. and Japanese
bank exposure combined.
</P>
<P>
European diplomats also stress the continent's stakes in East
Asia, where EU exports totaled 123 billion U.S. dollars in 1996,
outstripping EU exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Asian officials were quick to note that despite the financial
crisis, a lot of progress had been made in the improvement of the
economic infrastructure and monetary system in the Asian countries
concerned, as well as in the improvement of links between the two
continents.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that given these conditions there remain great
potentials for Asia-Europe cooperation and therefore the EU should
play a greater role in helping Asian countries tide over the
present economic hardships.

<P>
In an apparent bid to show EU's commitment to the currency
crisis, host Britain has proposed setting up an Asia-Europe trust
fund to provide assistance to Asian countries, primarily in giving
technical advice to Asian countries on banking and other financial
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
European officials said Europe wants closer ties with Asia
which is expected to become a major market in the next century.
Two-way trade between Asia and Europe at present is around 15.8
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Asian countries expect more and want the upcoming summit to
rectify the slow response by Europe towards the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, on its part, has requested that a separate statement
be made on Asia's economic crisis, which would show Europe's
commitment to helping solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
But so far hopes for the statement looked uncertain, with
Britain neither agreeing to nor rejecting the idea.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the leaders," Paul Sizeland, British Charge d'
affairs in Bangkok, told reporters earlier this week when asked
about the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Asem normally issues only a statement from the chairman at
the end of the summit. Having a separate statement on the
financial crisis would underline the importance of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Sizeland said the European side would push for a discussion on
child welfare, on building links between young Asians and
Europeans and on joint efforts to increase trade and investment,
protect the environment  Europeans also have requests for Asians.
Prior to the summit, EU officials required Asian countries to meet
certain conditions for obtaining more aid from outside, such as
fully opening the doors of their financial, insurance, agriculture
and other markets to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's prime minister Chuan Leekpai, in apparent reference
to the request, said recently that "we are not fully ready for
full globalization and liberalization and therefore we have to
take measures to protect our people from its (the globalization's)
full impact."
</P>
<P>
He said exceptions needed to be made for uneven economic and
social development in a world where some countries can send a man
"to walk on the moon, while in developing countries the people do
not yet have shoes."

The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted an official of the Zimbabwe
Tobacco Association as saying, "due to low prices there was a
high rate of rejection at the sales floors at an average 58.72
percent."
</P>
<P>
As expected this time of the year, the market was dominated by
primings. The situation was expected to be better later in the
season as more high quality tobacco would be brought forward by
farmers as prices firmed.
</P>
<P>
A total of about 210 million kgs was expected to be sold this
year earning the country about 540 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Urges Yeltsin to Convene "Roundtable" Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's parliament on Wednesday
called on President Boris Yeltsin to convene "roundtable" talks
on the formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable meeting is to be attended by four sides --
parliament deputies, the Presidential Administration, the
government and major political forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin proposed the composition of the government without any
serious discussion with Russia's leading political forces, and his
demand for immediate approval of his nominations by the Duma does
not fit into constructive cooperation of federal authorities, said
Duma, lower house of the parliament, in a resolution passed with
273-40 vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting of the four sides scheduled for Thursday
can be no substitute for the roundtable talks, said State Duma
Speaker Gennady Seleznyov, adding that the Duma is expected to
debate on Kiriyenko's nomination on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Council, upper house of the parliament,
adopted the resolution by 138-3 with one abstention, saying the
roundtable meeting is needed for consultations on the composition
and policy of the new Cabinet and for working out a program to
overcome crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council said its representatives should also attend the
State Duma's meeting on the formation of the new government.

Military Intelligence (MI) report implicating her and others in
an attempt to overthrow the government.

<P>
Mandela has appointed a three-man judicial commssion, chaired
by chief justice Ismail Mahomed, to probe the report.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was to probe "how, why, and when the report was

ADDIS ABABA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Sam Nujoma of
Namibia said Wednesday that his country is keen to bolster
bilateral relations with Ethiopia including economic ties in
various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the president during a stopover here
on his way back home from a visit to the Netherlands and Russia.

He said, Ethiopia, a country which extended unreserved support
to African countries including Namibia in their struggle to
shatter the yoke of colonialism, is a true friend of Africans.

On his visit to Russia, Nujoma said his tour to that country
was aimed at reinvigorating ties and pay tribute for the support
extended to Namibian freedom fighters during the armed struggle
against colonialism.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Should Explore SADC Market: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURB, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South African businesses
should make haste in accessing markets in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries before they lost to
overseas competitors, Deputy Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 1998 World Canned Deciduous Fruit Conference in
Somerset West outside Cape Town, Didiza said that while the
region represented a market of about 130 million people, its
potential for local firms could be reduced if they had to compete
with multinational investors.
</P>
<P>
"South African firms have tremendous opportunity to utilise
the comparative advantage of the region by spreading their
investments in the various countries and consolidating their
market as one SADC market, while aiming at the central and East
African markets for exports."
</P>
<P>
While South Africa was busy finalizing trade negotiations with
the European Union and other countries, its immediate challenge
was to tap the SADC market, Didiza said.

MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Robert Kocharian, who has won 59.3
percent of the votes already counted, has apparently been elected
Armenia's president.
</P>
<P>
About 99.4 percent of all ballots have been counted.
</P>
<P>
Kocharian's challenger, former Soviet-era Communist leader
Karen Demirchian, got 40.7 percent of the votes already counted.
</P>
<P>
The Central Electoral Commission has confirmed this result of

According to the constitution, the nominee who gets more than
half of the votes in the second round of voting will be the president.

About 68 percent of the electorate participated in the polls,
the commission added.

Kocharian, 43, began his political life from 1980 and won his
war hero reputation during a six-year secession conflict in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian-populated enclave of Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Angola Warns Against Cholera Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Health Minister
Teresa Cohen warned Wednesday that 100,000 Angolans will be
infected with cholera if no measures are taken to improve the
country's general health condition and expand tap water supply
around the country.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks at the launching ceremony of a
government-sponsored anti-cholera campaign.
</P>
<P>
The recent heavy rainfalls around the country have given rise
to the eruption of cholera, she said, adding that her ministry
will take up a series of measures, including ensuring the quality
of tap water, eliminate possible infection sources and
distributing water disinfectants to residents, to reduce cholera
victims.
</P>
<P>
According to Cohen, a total of 114,701 Angolans were infected
with cholera last year, among them 751 died. Of the country's 18
provinces, Benguela Province in central Angola, Huila Province in
the south and Bie Province in the central highland were the
seriously hit, with the death tolls at 460, 137 and 352
respectively.
</P>
<P>
So far, she noted, only 46 to 50 percent of those receiving
injections could exempt from infection.
</P>
<P>
Cohen disclosed that her ministry will meet on the coming
Friday with some non-governmental organizations and
representatives from foreign embassies in Angola on possible
assistance in case of a sudden breakout of the disease in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Japan Launches Financial System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan Wednesday kicked off a major
financial overhaul designed to build a better banking system by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
As part of the long-awaited program, restrictions on foreign
currency trading will be lifted beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This could mean that instead of going to banks, Japanese could
soon be able to change their yen for foreign currencies at places
including supermarkets, department stores and airports.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese version of "Big Bang," nicknamed after similar
British financial reforms in the 1980s, is the core of Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's six ambitious reform programs,
which include administrative, economic structural, social welfare,
fiscal structural and educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
The "Big Bang" program will also liberalize brokerage
commissions on stock trades worth more than 50 million yen (about
378,000 U.S. dollars) and enact a law requiring weak financial
institutions to improve their management.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of these reforms, Japanese financial institutions had
already been teaming up with foreign institutions and been cutting
commissions on stock and foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
Upon the imminent passage of the fiscal 1998 budget by the Diet
(parliament), lawmakers will begin to discuss the second stage of
the "Big Bang" reform, which will include the abolition of
barriers between banks, brokerages and insurers.

<HEADLINE> 7.5 Million Indonesians Risk Food Shortage: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 7.5 million Indonesians risk
experiencing food shortage until early 1999 because of the drought
and financial crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
That is among the results found by a UNITED NATION DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM (UNDP)-sponsored mission to Indonesia, according to a
press release issued here Wednesday by UNDP.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member mission, consisting of international experts from
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food
Program (WFP) as well as Indonesian consultants, assessed crop and
food supply in Indonesia for the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The team found that the rice harvest in the next coming months
is expected to be below normal because of delayed and irregular
rainfall, reduced use of fertilizer and use of low quality seeds,
leading to possible record rice import requirements in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The experts warned that 1.5 million families or 7.5 million
people living in 15 provinces risk experiencing food shortage
until early 1999 if there is a renewed drought later this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the team found that production of most secondary crops
such as maize, soybean, cassava, sweet potato and groundnuts is
expected to increase, providing some food security cushion.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly could not call this situation a famine," said
mission leader Uwe Kracht, adding that many pockets of the
population are however facing acute food supply inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned over the food security situation of the
poorest in the country and hope to help them through emergency and
food assistance for a limited period of time," said UNDP Resident
Representative Ravi Rajan, who is also U.N. Resident Coordinator.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Tobacco Production to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Due to the adverse effects
of the rains caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, Tanzania's
tobacco production is expected to drop to 20 million kilograms
this season from 42 million kilograms harvested during last
season.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in production is likely to cause a loss of about
30 million US Dollars, The Guardian Wednesday quoted Michael
Filakos, chairman of the Tanzania Tobacco Council, as saying.
</P>
<P>
This year, Tanzania is expected to produce only about 35
million kilograms of tobacco leaves, as the excessive rains have
hindered the growth of tobacco and washed away a lot of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Most farmers will harvest below their expectations and the
cost of production will be high, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, one tobacco harvest per year normally takes place
from mid January to April.
</P>
<P>
The main harvest months are February and March. Tobacco
planting is normally from mid-November to mid-March. The number
of people in the industry, including farmers and process workers,
is approximately 440,000.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is Tanzania's sixth foreign exchange earner after
coffee, cotton, cashew nuts, tea and sisal.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco market in the country is undergoing a rapid
expansion after the privatization of Tanzania Cigarette Company
and the liberalization of the tobacco industry.

<HEADLINE> Syrian, Lebanese Leaders Discuss Israeli Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
held talks Wednesday with visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, who arrived here Tuesday evening from Saudi capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The content of the talks was not revealed, but was believed to
focus on an Israeli proposal on conditional withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his talks with al-Assad, Hariri had had a second round
of talks with Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and other
senior officials on the matter and the latest efforts to rescue
the collapsing peace process due to Israel's hardline policies on
peace-making with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed that it pull out of south Lebanon if adequate
security arrangements can be worked out with Lebanese government.
This offer has been rejected as a deception by Beirut, which
insisted that the U.N. resolution 425 calls for unconditional and
immediate Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a major power broker in the Middle East peace process,
favors a linkage between a solution on the Israeli-Lebanese track
and Israel's return of Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
After Hariri arrived here Tuesday evening, he went straight to
talks with Khaddam, and later with Syrian Speaker of the People's
Council Abdel Kader Kaddura, Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi and
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
After the meetings, Hariri told reporters that Lebanon would
not make any security commitments to Israel, and that the
U.N. resolution 425 had to be implemented unconditionally and
without negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the ongoing intensive Arab contacts would result in an
action formula based on strong solidarity that would be capable of
confronting the new developments, changes and grave dangers
resulting from Israel's "deceitful proposal."
</P>
<P>
In Riyadh, Hariri had a series of meetings with Saudi King
Fahd, Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other top officials
in charge of regional affairs and inter-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
He also met with foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and Saudi
Arabia who were there to discuss the convocation of an Arab
mini-summit in a bid to reinforce the Lebanese stance on
unconditional Israeli troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> OCHA Says Drought-Stricken Guyana Needs water, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (xinhua) -- The United Nations Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on
Wednesday that drought-stricken Guyana urgently needs potable water
and relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
In its latest situation report on Guyana, OCHA said that the
prolonged drought attributable to the El Nino weather phenomenon
continues to cause widespread deprivation and loss throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
OCHA said acute problems facing the population were lack of
drinking water and shortage of food as sea water moved up stream
into areas of cultivation.
</P>
<P>
According to OCHA, in one region, an entire population of more
than 14,000 made up of mainly indigenous communities was facing
the threat of starvation and destitution.
</P>
<P>
In addition to crop losses in the rice and sugar sectors,
losses of livestock had also been reported, said OCHA.
</P>
<P>
OCHA said Guyana urgently needed equipment including hand,
submersible and mobile pumps for drilling a well and pumping
water.
</P>
<P>
The office said the families of the most affected rice and
sugar farmers needed financial assistance over a period of six
months. It also said the farmers would need paddy seeds for the
next cropping season.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Called on to Buy More from Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Several member states have
called on the United Nations to award more procurement contracts
for peace-keeping purposes to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
During the on-going debate of the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations, the Indonesian representative said while
financial obligations for operations were borne by the general
membership, the majority of procurements were being carried out in
a limited number of countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Syria and Iran also emphasized the need to address
the current heavy buying from developed nations. The
representatives took the floor on Tuesday, according to a U.N.
press release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the mandate of the peace-keeping operations, Cuba's
representative said peace-keeping operations could not be
considered as a substitute for peaceful resolution of conflicts,
but rather as a measure of last resort, requiring specific clear
mandates and reasonable chances for success.
</P>
<P>
On the Denmark-led Multinational U.N. Stand-by Forces High
Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG), some countries saw it as duplication
of the existing U.N. stand-by arrangements system.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's representative said rather than promoting SHIRBRIG,
it would be more meaningful and effective for the U.N. to focus
on improving the existing system.
</P>
<P>
The representative of Kyrgyzstan said that among the
peace-keeping issues of concern to delegations were also the delay
in peace-keeping reimbursements to troop-contributing countries
and low geographical representation of civilian police officers at
higher levels.
</P>
<P>
The debate, which started on Monday, focuses on
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's five-part report including the
enhancement of U.N. capacity in peace-keeping operations and
cooperation with regional arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-EU Ties Have Broad Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A China-European Union summit,
scheduled on April 2-3 on the sidelines of the second
Asia-Europe Meeting, is regarded as a landmark opportunity for
further developing relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
China's new premier, Zhu Rongji, is to attend the China-EU
summit, the first since China and the 15-member European Union
established a formal diplomatic relationship in May 1975.
</P>
<P>
For the past 22 years, relations between the two sides have
maintained a positive general trend of moving forward, after
taking some windings and turns. Especially in the 1990s, the
relations entered a phase of development, with increase exchanges
of high level visits and closer cooperation in the fields of
politics, economy, science and education.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the then Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-
Premier Li Lanqing made separate visits to western European
countries. In return, some senior officials from the EU and its
member states toured China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders believe that the EU and China are both an
important force to safeguard peace and promote development in the
world. To develop an all-round relationship of cooperation which
is mutually beneficial with the EU and its members is an important
aspect of China foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has stressed
the importance of both having a political dialogue and
strengthening the economic and trade ties with China in its China
policy documents respectively issued in July 1995 and November
1996.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday last week, the commission approved a policy
document on establishing an all-round partnership with China. It
called for strengthened political dialogue with China and an
annual summit meeting between the commission and China. If it is
adopted by the governments of EU member countries, the political
relationship between China and the EU will enter another new
period of development.
</P>
<P>
"China's growing economic and political self-confidence is an
overwhelmingly positive development. It should serve as an
incentive for the EU to engage the country more fully," said Sir
Leon Brittan, European Commissioner responsible for relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current EU president, welcomed the document,
saying it reflected "the growing breadth and importance of the
EU-China relationship" and Britain would ensure that EU ministers
gave it "serious and rapid consideration."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the EU has revised its China policy in order
to fit in with its new global strategy and to enhance its political
and economic leverage in this increasingly multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that the emerging leadership role of China
during the Asian financial crisis underlined the need for the EU
to further develop its political, economic and trade relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
China is a fast developing economy with a huge market potential
while the EU has advanced technology and investment funds. The
total volume of trade between China and the EU in 1997 reached 43
billion U.S. dollars, three times that in 1990. The EU so far has
had more than 8,000 investment projects in China, worth a total of
11.5 billion dollars. China and the EU are the fourth largest
trading partners of each other. The fast growing economic and
trade ties have laid a solid foundation for the development of
all-round relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, it is natural for China and the EU to have differing
views on some issues due to the differences in their social
systems, culture and ideology. But there is no conflict in basic
interests between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided in February not to sponsor a resolution against
China at this year's United Nations Human Rights Commission in
Geneva. The EU said in its document that it favored dialogue over
confrontation with China on the issue of human rights. It has
become the consensus of China and the EU members that in
developing relations, they should take an approach of expanding
common ground while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and EU leaders are now working toward the
establishment of a cross-century China-EU relationship.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that such a relationship will surge forward as
long as the two sides observe the principles of mutual respect,
mutual benefit, consultation on the basis of equality and seeking
common ground while reserving differences.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Prepare for Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) were urged Wednesday to develop
skilled manpower if they are to enter the 21st century in a position
to compete favorably with industrialized countries, reported the
Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the COMESA's committee on industry held in Lusaka,
Erastus Mwencha, Acting COMESA secretary-general, said that the
experiences of the 1980s and 1990s show that the the comparative
advantage previously offered by inherited natural resources will not
be of much benefit in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Low wage labor too will not present a guarantee on competitive
advantages, said the COMESA official, stressing that the nature of
competition in the 21st century will require innovation and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
COMESA countries therefore, he said, will be required to find
an appropriate mix of lower and higher order production functions
which are supremely competitive.
</P>
<P>
He noted that COMESA members, however, can achieve growth with
equity if industrialization and promotion of agro industries become an
integral part of the industrial transformation strategy.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha pointed out that growth with equity will also require
both macro-economic stability and a selectively targeted supply side
intervention between member governments, the private sector and civil
society.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which now groups 20 members, is designed to achieve a full
free trade area in the sub-region by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Africans to Better Cooperate in Leather Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Leather and Leather Products
Institute (LLPI) of the Common Market for Southern and Eastern
Africa (COMESA) and the Eastern and Southern Africa Leather
Industries Association (ESALIA) promised to enhance their
cooperation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum of understanding singed here, LLPI Director
Robert Arunga said COMESA has attached great importance to the
development of leather and leather products industries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to develop the sector through the
involvement of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said with signing of the memorandum of understanding, the
two associations will cooperate in areas of human resources
development, cmnsultancy and information services.
</P>
<P>
Arunga said the objective of LLPI mainly is to develop the
leather industry fully and provide a linkage to other industries
like chemical and engineering, and in the end create employment
and good incomes to the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the joint action will promote the use of
available resources in the region which provides for 60.9 percent
of the cattle population in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Head of the ESALIA Secretariat Samuel Kiruthu said his
association was born out of urgent need to have a coordinated
approach in charting out short and long-term development
strategies for Africa's leather industry.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the signing of memorandum of
understanding will mark a new beginning in the development of
leather.

<HEADLINE> S. Leoneans Urged to Co-operate With ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peacekeeping Force
known as ECOMOG Wednesday strongly adviced Sierra Leoneans to respect
orders from ECOMOG and police in order to maintain social security in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, made by ECOMOG Task Force Commander Maxwell Kobe,
followed Tuesday's shooting by ECOMOG soldiers which badly wounded a
middle-aged man in central Freetown, the capital of S. Leone.
</P>
<P>
A British Broadcasting Corporation report quoted eye-witnesses as
saying that the man was shot while going to the State House in
defiance of the order to stop at an ECOMOG security checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
The warning shot was fired in the air and the second shot hit the
passerby in the leg.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the shooting incident, Kobe urged all Sierra
Leoneans to follow the orders from the sub-regional force and police,
which are trying to bring some forms of order of law to the country
after more than nine months of chaos caused by last May's coup.
</P>
<P>
Kobe said indiscipline does not go with security, especially
when the country is under the state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
During the debate on the state of emergency earlier, the members of
parliament said that Sierra Leoneans were very confused over the issue
of their safety and security after more than 5,000 junta soldiers and
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels had been disposed of their
weapons and allowed to go home and do things as usual.
</P>
<P>
Many people believe that this is a serious issue, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, ECOMOG has started the manning of the
security checkpoints again around the city.
</P>
<P>
These checkpoints were dismantled according to the ECOMOG High
Command to give some semblance of normalcy in the capital.
</P>
<P>
But with thousands of former soldiers and RUF rebels still at large
and apparently echoing the sentiment of the people, Kobe's
decision to re-man the checkpoints has been well welcomed, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Rejects Israeli Pullout Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berry Wednesday rejected Israel's inner cabinet decision on
conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying there is nothing
new in the Israeli move.
</P>
<P>
Berry made the remark when meeting with parliament members. He
said that Israel's acceptance of the U.N. Security Council
resolution 425 can be interpreted as a political preparation for
Israeli forces to launch new attacks in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning Israel's inner cabinet approved, with
conditions attached, the 20-year-old U.N. resolution 425 calling
for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Israel showed willingness, of a
sort, to comply with this U.N. resolution over the past two
decades since it first invaded Lebanon in 1978.
</P>
<P>
But it remained stubborn in linking execution of the resolution
with negotiated security arrangements with Lebanese government in
the area it wanted to quit because of heavy casualties, a
condition strongly rejected by Lebanon and its close ally, Syria.
</P>
<P>
The demanded arrangements include deploying Lebanese
government troops in the south, disarming the Iranian-backed
resistance Hezbollah, or Party of God, and integrating the
pro-Israeli militia South Lebanese Army (SLA), in the Lebanese
regular forces.
</P>
<P>
When Israel first hinted it might go along with the
U.N. resolution at the start of this year, Lebanon and Syria,
whose 40,000 troops are stationed in Lebanon, insisted that the
resolution must be implemented unconditionally and without
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has grown anxious to pull itself out of the quagmire in
south Lebanon where it was engaged in an attrition war with
Hezbollah with increasing losses of lives.
</P>
<P>
By announcing the proposal, Israel also wanted to impress the
world at large that the peace wheel in the Middle East, stalled as
it is on many fronts, still keeps moving on the Israeli-Lebanese
track.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic resistance Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla
war against an estimated 1,200-strong Israeli forces, aided by the
2,500-strong SLA, which have been occupying south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in 1985
after two invasions of south Lebanon, allegedly to protect
Israel's northern areas from cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Israeli Decision on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Wednesday welcomed an
Israeli decision to accept a U.N. resolution calling for its
withdrawal from south Lebanon, but underlined that Israel should
implement it "unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
"The official statement of the Israeli government announced
today sets an organized stand regarding Israel's preparedness to
accept resolution 425 and withdraw from Lebanon," said Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Jawad Anani, quoted by
Jordan's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's preparedness to withdraw from south Lebanon is a
more advanced stand than its previous ones, nevertheless it
contains conditions that are not available in the Security
Council's resolution 425," Anani said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's adoption of such a step in this direction was the
right thing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel's inner cabinet on Wednesday morning approved, with
conditions attached, the 20-year-old U.N. resolution calling for
immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that implementation of the resolution should follow
negotiated security arrangements with Lebanese government in the
area it wanted to quit, a pre-condition strongly rejected by
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Anani also urged Israel to respond positively to a proposal
raised by the United States on Israel's second troop redeployment
in the West Bank, and to implement with good faith the Hebron
accord which it signed with the Palestinians in January last
year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Port Urges for Better Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Tanga port
authorities called on the Tanzanian government to make full use
of the port to improve the port's sluggish business.
</P>
<P>
The Port Manager, Idi Mkwata, has complained that tea which is
at present being auctioned in Mombasa, Kenya, is transported by
road instead of using the port facility, reports reaching here
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mkwata told the Tanga Regional Commissioner Captain George
Mkuchika who inspected the port recently that the government
should establish a tea auction center in the country and use the
port as a route for export consignments.
</P>
<P>
The port official also urged the government to build a railway
from the northern town of Arusha to Musoma on the shore of the
Lake Victoria, to serve cargo to and from neighboring countries
such as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the manager suggested that the government
review the proposal of building an oil pipeline from Dar es
Salaam to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on capital investment plans from the year 1996 to
2001, Mkwata said the port will launch an economic processing
zone (EPZ). Terms of reference have been worked out and the port
are seeking technicians to study the issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of December this year the study will be ready," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mkwata said the port authorities are making
efforts to win the ownership of the Mwambani bay for future
development. Since late 1980s, the bay has been under a 20-year
plan as the future port because it has deep berths for ship
anchoring, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The port has already paid some 84 million shillings (about
126,000 U.S. Dollars) as compensations for the resettlement of
Ndumi villagers living in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Tanga Port, a major port along the Indian
Ocean, handled 108,500 tons of cargo but suffered a loss of 1.5
billion shillings, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) see eye to eye on the latest U.S. initiative to
save the Mideast peace process, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and the Palestinians have reached consensus on the
recent U.S. proposal to resume the Palestinian and Israeli talks,
and will follow up its development," Moussa told reporters in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and PNA
President Yasser Arafat met in the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will boost their sustained coordinations in the
future as regards their next steps following the U.S. proposals,
he said, quoted by the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Arafat flew to Sharm el-Sheikh Tuesday night to brief Mubarak
on the results of his three rounds of talks last week with
U.S. Middle East peace mediator Dennis Ross who brought with him a
new U.S. initiative to restart the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security cooperation as part
of a package deal to end a year-long Mideast peace stalemate. The
idea, however, bounced by the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said earlier that it was ready to cooperate with the
U.S. peace-saving efforts so long as they advocates "balanced
peace" in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who met Mubarak and Moussa in Egypt Monday, is expected
to present a report to President Bill Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on his failed mission.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to remove from the Middle East peace
process as a mediator in an attempt to put pressure to bear on
Israel and the Palestinians to make compromises.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Cuts Oil Production Under OPEC Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has started to cut oil
production by 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) according to an
agreement reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), a senior Kuwaiti official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah made the
remark one day after he returned from OPEC's extraordinary meeting
in Austrian capital Vienna, which concluded by deciding to cut
OPEC's production by 1.245 million bpd from April 1 till the end
of this year to rescue the oil prices, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted as saying that he hopes other oil
producing countries would comply with the Vienna agreement, adding
that this would be beneficial to OPEC and non-OPEC members alike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed belief that if all oil producing
countries keep their part of the deal, the market would stabilize
and the slide in prices would stop.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices, which dropped to a nine-year low last month,
gained two dollars following a joint initiative made by Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico on March 22 to cut oil
production to boost crude prices.
</P>
<P>
But the oil prices in the world market dropped again Tuesday as
a decision by OPEC oil ministers to cut production left doubts
over whether member countries would keep their promise and whether
the cuts are enough to drain oversupply from the market.

sustained Tuesday's rally and ended higher Wednesday, supported by
a firm dollar and the start of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 index on the London market closed up 85.4 points
or 1.44 percent at 6,017.6, above the psychological 6,000 mark for
the first time, boosted by a wave of buyers at the start of the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the index failed to hang on to its best levels as a weak
opening on Wall Street prompted a mild retreat.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that index futures-led derivatives trading and
stock shortages also fueled the gains.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index also ended well off the day's earlier
highs on a disappointing start of the Dow, but managed to rise to
a second consecutive record close, up 7.5 points or 0.19 percent
at 3,883.31.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a strong dollar and another set of strong
corporate earnings, from construction and communications group
Bouygues, helped carry shares higher.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's DAX-30 index had earlier hit a fresh
record high of 5,170.29 before ending off the day's peak at
5,154.21, but still up 51.86 points or 1.02 percent, driven by the
strength of the dollar and sharp gains in financials.

<HEADLINE> Albright Welcomes Israel Withdrawal Decision from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Wednesday welcomed Israel's decision to withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon and called for talks between Israel and
Lebanon on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the decision by the Israeli Cabinet. This is a
positive step," Albright said after talks with Qatar's foreign
minister Sheik Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday adopted the 20-year-old U.N.
Security Council resolution 425, which called for a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon five days after Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1978 to wipe out Palestinian guerrilla bases.
</P>
<P>
"We have supported resolution 425 and therefore are pleased
that the Israeli Cabinet took this action," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set a condition
for the withdrawal, demanding Lebanon to deploy its troops
southward to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Lebanese leaders dismissed the Israeli move,
calling the condition a "new obstacle" to peace. Lebanese
President Elias Krawi said the Israeli offer was a trial balloon
and said Israel must withdraw from Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Albright said it is important that "some discussions" would
be needed if the withdrawal was to take place.
</P>
<P>
"I think some discussions between Israel and Lebanon on this,
in order to assure that the northern border of Israel is indeed
secure," she said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM on Cyprus' EU Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said here Wednesday that with the start of Cyprus'
accession talks with the European Union (EU), the prospects for a
Cyprus settlement can be bright.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark upon his return from Brussels, where
he attended the official opening of EU's membership talks on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He described the Cyprus-EU accession talks as the most
positive element since Turkey's military intervention in the
island in 1974, saying that there is no question of delaying
Cyprus' entry under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"No country entered accession talks without success,"
Kasoulides said, stressing that the EU would not allow for such
talks to begin if it judged an applicant country not in a position
to conclude them successfully.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be a lot of movement this month concerning
efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem and the government
welcomes envoys of all willing foreign governments to contribute
to breaking the present deadlock in the peace process on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special advisor Diego
Cordovez recently visited the island and held talks with the
leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, but was
unable to secure an agreement on resumption of stalled talks aimed
at reuniting the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who met Annan and
Cordovez in Geneva last Saturday, said the peace talks in Cyprus
can no longer take place on an inter-communal basis but between
independent states.
</P>
<P>
This implies recognition of the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus", proclaimed in 1983 but recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said "the position of the (Cypriot) government has
always been that the work of the U.N. secretary-general should be
assisted by the five permanent members of the Security Council,
either together or separately."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Cypriot government had no information
concerning a forthcoming visit of U.S. presidential emissary
Richard Holbrooke to the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency Wednesday quoted diplomatic sources as
saying that Holbrooke and State Department Special Coordinator for
Cyprus Thomas Miller are expected to arrive in Cyprus in the next
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The two U.S. officials are expected to have meetings with
President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Hard on African Peacekeeping Force  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton of the United

States Wednesday repeatedly sought support for the U.S.-initiated plan

security in Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the Senegalese military airbase in Thies, 70

km east of the capital Dakar, Clinton said the force would rapidly

respond to wars and refugee crisis, bringing "security, hope and a

future" to Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. army special forces are training Senegales troops in Thies to

participate in the African crisis response initiative put forward by

the U.S. government two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, troops in Senegal, Uganda and Malawi have been

trained by soldiers from the 3rd Special Forces Group of the U.S.

army, while Malian troops are undergoing their own training.
</P>
<P>
The training of Ghanaian troops is scheduled to begin Wednesday

and Ethoipia has also signed up for the training.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Clinton said#,an African crisis response force

is "very important" for the peace and security in the continent,

an issue which is both a key part of his first ever African visit as

president and the major topic in the discussion between him and his

Senegalese counterpart President Abdou Diouf.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and other African countries have expressed "more or

less" interest in participanting but insisted the force will have an

African command in charge.
</P>
<P>
A total force of 10,000 to 12,000 is envisaged though the U.S.

is doubtful this many troops would ever be called at one time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Africa's economic giant Nigeria, which is out of

Clinton's itinerary, has said it's better that such a force has the

west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG as nuclues.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG has successfully put an end to civil wars

in Liberia and Sierra Leone, providing somewhat of a model to the

international community.
</P>
<P>
According to Clinton, the U.S. wants to build on existing efforts

including those of African countries, the Organization of African

Unity, the United Nations, France, Britain and others to strengthen

the capacity for preseving peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is not to dominate seucrity matters in Africa or to

abandon America's role in Africa's security," said Clinton, who a week

ago admitted the U.S. and others reacted too slowly to stop Rwanda's

1994 genocide which led to the slaughter of more than 500,000 Tutsis

and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has promised the U.S. will provide assistance and training

in order for African countries to conduct their own peacekeeping

exercises on their own continent, saying such a force will relieve the

U.S. forces of having to intervene in African problems.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president arrived in Dakar Tuesday night for a two-day

visit. In the past week or more, he visited Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda,

South Africa and Botswana, in a bid to promote new partnership

relations with Africa.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the need to preserve peace and security in Africa,

Clinton announced that he would send three of his cabinet ministers to

Africa as follow-up to promote trade and economic ties with the

world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
However, some African leaders have rejected the U.S. attempt to

lay down pre-conditions for assistance to African countries.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has said: "We oppose any

attempt by any country to impose conditions on our freedom of trade

and that we cannot accept."

<HEADLINE> German Socialist Leader Pledges to Keep Ties With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- German Social Democratic leader
Gerhard Schroeder Wednesday pledged to keep the special ties
between Germany and France if he becomes the next German
chancellor later this year.
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that the French-German relations are
irreplaceable and indispensable for Europe. It is a relationship
which should be maintained," said Schroeder after meeting with
French Socialist Party First Secretary Francois Hollande.
</P>
<P>
As for his attitude toward the European single currency, the
minister-president of the German state of Lower Saxony said that
it is no longer necessary to argue about the reason for launching
the single currency, as it is already "a part of history."
</P>
<P>
He said what is important now is to discuss "how to maximize
the chances and minimize the risks" in adopting the euro.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was criticized by some French officials for
expressing his doubt over the advantages the euro can bring about,
and for suggesting that the French-German axis is not as good as a
German-British-French triangle alliance in European construction.

<HEADLINE> IPE Volumes of Trade Soar to Record Highs in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Volumes of trade on the London
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) reached the highest levels
ever recorded last month, said the IPE Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said that exchange volumes as a whole rose to an average of
83,380 lots a day over the month, which represents an average
daily volume of more than 75 million barrels of oil and 28 million
therms of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Individual contracts also set new records. The Brent Crude
futures contract traded an average of just under 60,000 lots a
day, peaking a 101,776 lots on 23 March, breaking the previous
daily record of 95,659 lots set in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Natural Gas futures volumes also rose. The daily average
reached a new high of just under 950 lots, equivalent to about 40
percent of UK consumption.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE, said: "So far this
year has proved an exceptional one in terms of the volumes of
trade. Increased price volatility has reinforced to producers and
consumers alike the benefits of risk management".
</P>
<P>
He added, "The boom in volumes has also coincided with an
upturn in interest from companies and individuals in trading on
the IPE which is a further sign of confidence in the Exchange".

SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The French government plans to
grant about 350 million US dollars (or two billion French francs)
worth of loans for subway construction in Shanghai, according to a

business in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The investment of French companies in Shanghai rose 30 percent
last year over the 1996 figure. France will increase investment in
hi-tech areas in China, especially in the fields of airplane

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Intercept Huge Car Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Irish police said Thursday that
they intercepted a bomb in a Britain-bound car at a ferry port
near Dublin which contained nearly half a ton of home-made
explosive, boosters, detonators and a timer, adding that it was
the work of republican guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said that it was among the biggest bombs
Irish police had ever found.
</P>
<P>
Chief superintendent Patrick Culhane was quoted as saying that
"some element of republican paramilitaries" was believed to be
behind it.
</P>
<P>
Police also confirmed that two BMW cars were involved in the
apparent bid to launch a terrorist attack on the UK.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the vehicles were stopped as they queued
in the port of Dun Laoghaire near Dublin for a ferry bound for
Anglesey on the Welsh coast.
</P>
<P>
Five people, including two women, are being questioned by
detectives.
</P>
<P>
The incident came at a particularly sensitive time for the
Northern Irish peace talks as there is not much time left before
the April 9 deadline to hammer out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the participants of the peace talks are still divided
on several issues, particularly on the power of a new North-South
administration which is supposed to be set up under the peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart Bertie ]hern Thursday reportedly said after three
hours of a late-night talk in London Wednesday that "more work
needs to be done" in the search for peace and there were still
hurdles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair's spokesman said Thursday that the Prime
Minister remains "cautiously, stubbornly optimistic" about
prospects for a breakthrough in the Northern Irish peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will soon hold
a conference in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, on
international assistance in rebuilding the war-devastated
country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Thursday here at a press conference by
Zimbabwean Voreign Minister Stan Mudenge who led a five-men
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) team this week to
assess the needs of the reinstated government of President Tejan
Kabbah, which was ousted last May in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the conference would focus mainly on assisting
the country to rebuild its institutions.
</P>
<P>
"In that respect on our visit we agreed with President Kabbah
that the commonwealth develop and implement support for the
development of a sound policy framework for the country's mining
sector," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that commonwealth countries should
support the rebuilding of Sierra Leone's national institutions
such as the police, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Zimbabwe was going to help, Mudenge said, "If
asked to help there would not be any problem. I think we can do
that as we did with South Africa when they requested for help in
rebuilding their police."
</P>
<P>
"We also urged all member governments to assist bilaterally in
every practicable way in the country's efforts to achieve
national reconstruction and reconciliation," he said.

<HEADLINE> American Judge Comments On Chinese Court Procedure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Dorothy Nelson, a prestigious
judge in the United States' Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who is
visiting Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province,
said today that the mediation used by Chinese courts is a method
that American judges could study.
</P>
<P>
Judge Nelson arrived in Beijing late last month and has visited
to courts and held discussions with judges in the cities of
Beijing and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Chinese judges often try to get the two parties involved in a
lawsuit to reach a consensus, and about 60 percent of all lawsuits
are concluded in this way.
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this is a better method than that used in the
United States, where judges have to rule on many trivial things,
but mediation can make people accept the consensus more agreeably,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she expressed the hope that China's judiciary will
not make the same errors or mistakes American courts have in
expecting every lawsuit to be decided by a court ruling.

<HEADLINE> India Relaxes Use of Transit Route By Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- India has agreed to relax some
conditions to make the operation of the Phulbari transit route
easier for Nepal, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between Indian commerce secretary and his
Nepalese counterpart in New Delhi on Monday and Tuesday, India
agreed to make an arrangement for Nepal to use the transit route
four days a week instead of two days a week as set under previous
modalities.
</P>
<P>
India also agreed to allow transportation of goods by container
or by truck with seals by the Indian customs at the entry point to
make sure that the goods are not tampered with midway, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the trucks and containers must be escorted by the
Indian security force.
</P>
<P>
Commerce secretaries of the two countries also discussed a
seven-year-old transit treaty which expires late this year and
decided that separate bilateral talks will be held in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Phulbari transit route, which gives Nepal an access to the
Mongla port in Bangladesh through Phulbari in northeastern India,
went into operation on September 1, 1997 on a six-month trial
basis.
</P>
<P>
But except a convoy of trucks on the inauguration day, no other
trucks used the route in the past seven months. Impractical
modalities were mainly blamed for the poor use.
</P>
<P>
Early in March, India extended Nepal's use of the route and
agreed to review the modalities when commerce secretaries of the
two countries met in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Nepal in mid-March, Bangladeshi Finance
Minister Shah Kibria said that his country would take measures to
upgrade the physical infrastructure in Bangladesh to make the
transit route economically viable in the near future.

<HEADLINE> World Moves Toward Curbing Hazardous Chemicals: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide governments are to meet
in Montreal in June over a draft treaty that will minimize the
release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the
environment, the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, scheduled for June 29, will start with a list of 12
POPs including some of the most toxic chemicals ever developed,
said a statement issued at a press conference in the UNEP
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The total negotiations are expected to be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of people are killed or seriously poisoned by toxic
pesticides and chemicals every year," said UNEP chief Klaus
Topfer in the statement, stressing hazardous chemicals a top
priority for global environment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for further concerted international
action as no country acting alone can protect its environment
from risk since chemicals circulate globally -- whether through
trade or naturally via air, water and animals.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the deaths and acute effects caused by direct
and immediate contact, POPs and other chemicals persist for years
at background levels that can cause long-term damage to human
health and the environment," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The situation is further worsening due to the accumulation of
unwanted and obsolete stockpiles of pesticides and toxic
chemicals, particularly in developing countries, since 1950s,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Dump sites and toxic drums dated from 1950s are now decaying
and leaching chemicals into the soil and thus poisoning water
resources, wildlife and people, it said.
</P>
<P>
A great deal of infrastructure and equipment such as
electrical transformers and capacitors are also at or near the
end of their useful lives and are leaking dangerous chemicals, it
warned.
</P>
<P>
With worldwide sales of some 1.5 trillion U.S. Dollars
annually, the chemicals industry is a vital part of the
international modern industrial economy and continues to expand
its size currently.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada Thursday invited
financially-troubled Asian countries including Malaysia to
increase their exports to that country to help boost their
economies.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is always willing to market Malaysian products. With
the lower value of the Malaysian currency, products from this
country will be more competitive in the Canadian market," Jim
Peterson, special envoy to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
said here Thursday at the end of his one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who is Secretary of State Finance, was here to

</P>
<P>
He met here earlier in the day with Malaysian Deputy Prime

</P>
<P>
They discussed how Canada and Malaysia, which have long and
close political and economic ties, can further cooperate with each
other and with the region, especially in addressing the current

</P>
<P>
Peterson, who also discussed the haze problem with Anwar,
expressed Canada's willingness to extend its technical expertise
in combating forest fires and the haze problem to Malaysia.

"Canada has the knowledge and expertise in this area and we are
willing to send water bombers if there is a need and request from
Malaysia," Peterson said, adding that no such request had been
made so far.

<HEADLINE> Movie Blockbuster `Titanic' Chugs into China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The blockbuster movie "Titanic"
has began its Chinese run in the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Starting tomorrow, every major Chinese city will be showing the
movie which has caused a worldwide sensation and earned more than
1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Managers of some Beijing cinemas said that tickets have already
sold out, and they expect the film will set box office records,
easily beating "The Lost World."
</P>
<P>
"Titanic" has been front-paged many Chinese newspapers since
last month, with a host of reports citing its remarkable
investment, superb digital technology and marvelous acting
skills. Some say that the movie's love story theme will touch the
hearts of Chinese viewers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the China Film Corp. said this is the shortest
time span for a movie to hit the Chinese market after it won the
Oscar prize for best movie.
</P>
<P>
The film, based on a true incident, won 11 Oscars last month.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the China Film Corp. began to discuss the
possibility of introducing the film early this year with 20th
Century Fox and Paramount Pictures.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, China has adopted a policy of sharing
the benefits with major international film companies after
releasing their movies on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The move intends to satisfy Chinese viewers who have not felt
contented with so many domestic movies.
</P>
<P>
Many people in China know at least a little about the Titanic
story. And Titanic books emerged on bookstores across the country
overnight before the film was shown.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Stock to Reach 2.2 mln Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice stock this year
could reach 2.2 million tons, enough to meet the country's demand
up to the end of the year, an official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"People should not be worried about food shortage," National
Logistics Agency (Bulog) Chairman Beddu Among said.
</P>
<P>
Among made the remark in response to a survey made by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) showing that some 7.5
million people in Indonesia's 15 provinces will experience food
scarcity if drought continues this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNDP, the country's rice production in the
next few months will also be low and that Indonesia is expected to
import food commodities in large volume in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Among said that considering last year's EL Nino that badly
affected Indonesia's crops, Bulog's rice supply still reached 1.95
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"That will be easier to surpass this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Bulog will remain vigilant about the
possibility of food scarcity as some regions are already
experiencing now.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's tourism industry saw a
15 percent increase in foreign exchange earnings in 1997 despite a
slump in the number of foreign tourist arrivals in the year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange income of the central European nation
stood at 2.58 billion U.S. dollars, making a favorable balance of
1.43 billion dollars, an 11 percent rise from a year before,
latest bank figures indicated.
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors to Hungary totaled 37.32 million last year,
down 6.3 percent from 1996, according to the National Bank of
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The slump was mainly blamed on the fall in the number of
tourist arrivals from eastern European nations, such as Ukraine,
Russia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the number of tourists from western European
countries, such as Germany, Italy and France, grew steadily,
boosting the rise in tourism earnings.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism foreign exchange earnings in 1998 is
expected to amount to 2.8 to 3 billion dollars.

LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian new Health Minister Nkandu
Luo has banned fruitless workshops, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper reported that she has with immediate
effect banned the workshops in her ministry for the next three
months because most of them are fruitless as their resolutions
are never implemented.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who was named as the country's new health minister last
month, imposed the ban when she addressed a community partnership
in health workshop held in Livingstone in southern Zambia
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said now is the time for implementation and not planning,
adding that she will personally go round the country to inspect
whether workshop resolutions are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Luo warned health workers to sit up and take work seriously or
risk being sacked for incompetence.
</P>
<P>
She warned workers against laziness and told those unable to
perform to step aside.
</P>
<P>
The new minister cautioned once again health workers not to
join unions that do not promote health ethics and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
But the Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ) advised the
health workers to join any union of their choice and ignore Luo's
advice.
</P>
<P>
CSUZ General Secretary Japhet Moonde said here Thursday that
"workers under the ministry of health have the right to belong to
a union of their choice just like ordinary Zambians have the

be implemented so that a framework would be made to put existing
rules into effect and set up new rules, said Manhenje.
</P>
<P>
He noted that issues like livestocks stolen at the
Mozambican-Swazi border would be discussed by special
institutions of the two states.
</P>
<P>
However, Manhenje said, the approach in which the Swazi
government and its police treat the Mozambicans living in
Swaziland should also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the discussion disclosed that the three
ministers also exchanged views on the restoration and
establishment of border inspection posts, especially smuggle
monitoring ones, agreeing that the procedures of passing customs
must be standardized and some kind of travelers should be granted
exemption of visas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Coup Report Dismissed as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A South African military
intelligence report alleging that senior African National
Congress (ANC) members were plotting a coup was fraudulent, a
judicial commission probing the matter has found.
</P>
<P>
The report, handed to President Nelson Mandela in February by
South African National Defense Force (SANDF) Chief George
Meiring, had "no substance" and its handling had been flawed,
according to the commission's report presented to Mandela
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would brief the senior leadership of the SANDF
Thursday about the contents of the commission's report, and urge
them to speedily address the "glaring shortcomings" in the
handling of the report, a presidential spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Mandela would soon make public a decision on the
matter after studying the recommendations by the judicial
commission.
</P>
<P>
The government on Wednesday described the report, which hit
newspaper headlines at the weekend, as the work of certain
military elements whose motives were to sow seeds of confusion.
</P>
<P>
Although the people compiling the false report were still not
known, suspicions are running high that right-wing generals
unhappy with the ANC government played a part in its compilation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela appointed a commission last Friday, consisting of
Chief Justice Ismail Mohammed and two Constitutional Court
judges, to investigate urgently "the compilation, verification
and subsequent treatment" of a report handed to him on February
5.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that Mandela's ex-wife Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, former ANC member and now United Democratic
Movement co-leader Bantu Holomisa, suspended Foreign Affairs
official Robert McBride, SANDF Chief of Staff Siphiwe Nyanda and
other senior ANC members were plotting to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
It was suspected that Meiring, who was expected to retire next
year, tried to extend his time in power by implicating his
probable successor, Nyanda, in the alleged plot.
</P>
<P>
The judicial commission worked throughout the weekend calling
witnesses from the SANDF and the government, including Meiring
and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Meiring had reportedly failed to explain to the commission on
a number of issues, including why the report was based on a
single resource, it bypassed official intelligence structures and
it was leaked to the media.
</P>
<P>
He had denied taking part in the compilation of the report and
said he handed the report directly to Mandela without subjecting
it to the normal intelligence checks because it was "too
sensitive".
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the SANDF had made attempts to confirm the
contents of the report but had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The report, which Meiring did not show to his political head,
Defense Minister Joe Modise, was believed to be compiled from
information given by Vusi Mbatha, a now exposed intelligence
informer and the man arrested with McBride in Mozambique for
alleged gun smuggling in early March.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted sources close to the government as saying
that Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki have agreed to fire
Meiring as well as Police Commissioner George Fivaz, who was
involved in the dissemination of the report.
</P>
<P>
The government said with the 1999 general elections drawing
near, it was possible that elements wanting to destabilize the
government would try to launch a disinformation campaign.
</P>
<P>
These elements wanted to destabilize the government not only
militarily but economically, it said, warning that it would be
"naive" to narrow down the destabilization tactics to military
intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Philippine NDF Rebels Consider Ceasefire With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The National Democratic Front (NDF)
rebel group is considering a ceasefire with Philippine government
troops, local Television Station PTV reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Jose Sison, the founding chairman of the NDF,
is mulling over the cessation of hostilities between government
troops and the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Luis Jalandoni, a senior leader and
representative of the NDF, arrived here from the Netherlands to
negotiate with President Fidel Ramos for the release of all
political prisoners as one of the final steps for the proposed
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Jalandoni said Sison, who has been in exile for more than 20
years in Hague, the Netherlands, will come back to Manila if the
government will assure his safety and "if all political prisoners
will be freed."
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat said he would
guarantee the safety and peaceful stay of Sison and his party once
he returns to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been in peace talks with the NDF
for the past three years. However, the two sides made little
progress in reaching a full ceasefire, let alone a final peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos announced a unilateral ceasefire with the NDF
on March 31 to ensure that the May 11 elections would be held
peacefully and the NDF rebels can participate in the polls.

<HEADLINE> Relief Flights to War-Torn S. Sudan Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Relief flights resumed Thursday
to all areas of OBhr El Ghazal Province in war-torn Sudan where a
severe famine is looming, after the Khartoum government turned on
a green light last month.
</P>
<P>
The lift came at a critical moment when about 350,000 people
are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance especially food and
medicine, said a news release from the Operation Lifeline Sudan
(OLS) issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many people in southern Sudan are currently surviving on wild
foods and the malnutrition rate among children is rising, said
the OLS, coordinator for most of the international relief
operations in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Food aid deliveries and urgent supplies of seed and tools are
particularly essential over the next four weeks when people are
cultivating their land before the rains arrive and in preparation
for the next harvest, said OLS.
</P>
<P>
If the next harvest is missed, the Sudanese people will be
reliant on relief food for survival until August 1999, it warned.
</P>
<P>
The new clearance now allows OLS agencies to fly in April to
more than 50 locations in Bahr El Ghazal, and to 180 countrywide,
the highest number of approved locations since June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC)
in Lokichokio, a town 25 kilometers south of Sudan border, told
Xinhua last week that ICRC was also planning to re-start its
relief flights to southern Sudan in mid April.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government suspended all flights into Bahr El
Ghazal on February 4 following the outbreak of fightings around
the town of Wau.
</P>
<P>
The ban was partially eased three weeks later and further
lifted in mid March thanks to the mediation of Robert van Schaik,
U.N. envoy for humanitarian affairs in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
OLS, set up ten years ago, remains the only official channel
through which assistance can be delivered to both government and
rebel locations throughout Sudan, the largest African state
plagued by civil war since 1983.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on Developed Countries to fulfill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China called on developed
countries Thursday to fulfill their commitment made at the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de
Janeiro six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the First Assembly of the Global Environment
facility (GEF) in New Delhi, Jin Liqun, Head of the Chinese
delegation, said developed countries, with only a few exceptions,
have been reducing their official development assistance in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The resources available to the GEF are far from adequate to
meet the increasing financial demands for addressing the austere
global environmental reality, Jin told the three-day meeting which
opened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 164 member countries and international
organizations attended the assembly which was scheduled to review
the general policies and operations of the GEF in the last seven
years since its founding in 1991.
</P>
<P>
As a fund, the GEF has provided the urgently-needed assistance
to developing countries and enabled them to participate better in
the cause of global environment protection, said Jin, who is
Assistant Minister of Finance.
</P>
<P>
And as a mechanism of international cooperation in the
environment arena, Jin added, the GEF has helped enhance the
awareness of the international community about some of the major
global environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
It has also cemented the concerted efforts of developed and
developing countries and some international institutions to
address the climate change and to protect biodiversity,
international waters and ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
However, Jin said, the GEF can not meet the requirements of its
members due to the reluctance of certain developed countries to
make their donations and fulfill their obligations and commitment.
</P>
<P>
Jin told his audience that the Chinese government attaches
great importance to environment protection and made it one of the
basic state policies in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Jin pointed out, China has made notable progress
in environment protection as well as economic and social
development:
</P>
<P>
-- While registering rapid economic growth, China has basically
been able to avoid drastic environmental degradation, and even
improve the environment in certain areas;
</P>
<P>
-- The family planning program has been implemented
effectively, and the nation's natural population growth rate has
dropped steadily;
</P>
<P>
-- The economic growth pattern has begun to transform, the
emission and discharging standards are been enforced nation wide,
and initial success has been achieved in the implementation of the
Cross-Century Green Project;
</P>
<P>
-- Proactive measures have been taken to preserve biodiversity,
a network of nature reserves has taken shape, and the forest
coverage has risen from less than 13 percent in 1992 to about 14
percent at present as a result of the implementation of
nation-wide voluntary afforestation program.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange Index Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)
-100 Index went up by 8.61 points Thursday to close at 1534.37
points against Wednesday's close at 1525.76.
</P>
<P>
A total volume of 51.6 million shares traded Thursday against
45.2 million shares traded Wednesday. There were 75 gainers and 61
losers, while share prices of 51 companies remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the KSE-100 Index appreciated on expectations
that the government will launch an operation to recover loans
written off by public sector banks on political compulsions in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of these loans are a major factor in the
privatization of three major public sector banks, expected to be
sold off in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As part of its program to restructure the banking sector, the
government announced that it would pursue the default cases but
recent indications were that it had failed in its attempts.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believed that Thursday's announcement that
cases against 3,400 loan defaulters had been finalized raised
hopes that the government was serious in recovering the loans.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the market reacted positively to the
government's announcement over pursuing bank defaulters but if
there is no action forthcoming, there could be a reversal in the
stock market in the coming days.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Global telecommunications leader
Lucent Technologies opened a transmission technology training
center at Beijing's University of Posts and Telecommunications
today.
</P>
<P>
The "China Telecom/BUPT SDH Laboratory", the first laboratory
for synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) technology in China, will
be used by telecommunications engineers and university students
and teachers to increase their SDH knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The lab is equipped with some of Lucent's most advanced SDH
systems, high-capacity optical multiplexing equipment, a flexible
digital interconnection system, and intelligent network management
software.
</P>
<P>
SDH technology, which was first developed by Bell Laboratories,
the R&AMP;D arm of Lucent, in the late 1980s, has become one of the
most extensively-used transmission systems in optical
telecommunications today. Lucent introduced the technology to
China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The company has SDH optical cables trunks in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
According to Randy Yeh, chairman of Lucent Technologies
(China) Ltd., Lucent has developed two joint laboratories in
Shanghai Jiaotong University and Beijing University in the past
few months as part of its long-term development strategy in
China. The SDH training system at the University of Posts and
Telecommunications signals a big step forward in the company's
efforts to increase cooperation with China's universities and
telecoms industry here, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Loses 256 mln U.S. Dollars in Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires in East Kalimantan
province, Indonesia, have destroyed at least 150,000 hectares of
forest land, causing an estimated loss of 2.1 trillion rupiah
(about 256 million U.S. dollars), the province's governor said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is difficult to extinguish the fires in the near
future," East Kalimantan Governor H. M. Ardans said after
reporting the fires to President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Ardans said if the rains do not fall until June, the fires will
be even more difficult to extinguish.
</P>
<P>
Another long dry season is expected to start in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires, which started in January this year,
originated from 808 hot spots scattered in thick rainforests and
are still razing forests in the province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a local official said the fires had caused as much
material damage as the total losses from sporadic forest fires in
the province over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
East Kalimantan has 21 million hectares of forests, including
17 million hectares of productive forests and 4 million hectares
of virgin forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a United Nations disaster team, which arrived here a
few days ago, will soon travel to the fire-ravaged East Kalimantan
province to assess the scale of damage and see what relief efforts
are needed, official sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 300,000 hectares of forests were ravaged by
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan islands in Indonesia. In East
Kalimantan province fires destroyed 37,092 hectares of forests.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Dowry Makes Marriage Evil Dream in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Malati Devi, a mother of two
kids, was beaten to death by her husband and father-in-law simply
because she could not afford a TV set as a dowry.
</P>
<P>
Ever since she got married in 1993, Devi's husband and
father-in-law had been demanding for a TV set as a dowry. But her
poor family could not meet their demand. This February, her
husband and father-in-law managed to buy a TV set by selling her
ornaments. When she protested, they beat her to death. Her second
daughter was only 22 days old.
</P>
<P>
Chandra Kala, mother of one kid, did not know her parents had
agreed to build a house for her husband as a dowry when she got
married three years before. When her parents failed, severe
physical torture became part of her daily life. In this February,
her husband and mother-in-law poured kerosene on her in a closed
room and burnt her to death.
</P>
<P>
The stories are just two of the often-heard-of tragedies
carried in the Kathmandu Post daily. Dowry, as a social custom,
has been a major threat to the dream of happy marriage of a lot of
Nepalese women and even to their lives.
</P>
<P>
"It's a social custom, but an evil custom actually," said Dr.
Krishna B. Bhattachan, a sociologist of the Tribhuvan University
of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
There is also a hierarchy in the dowry system in the Nepali
society. Dr. Bhattachan said if somebody is illiterate and poor,
he asks for around 5,000-10,000 rupees (about 80-160 U.S.
dollars). If he receives high school education and is poor, he
might ask for 10,000-50,000 rupees (160-800 dollars).
</P>
<P>
While a college graduate who has a job might demand more than
100,000 rupees (1,600 dollars), a guy with a master degree or a
doctor degree who has a job will ask for 1 million rupees (16,000
dollars) and a doctor of medicine will demand 1 to 2 million
rupees (16,000-32,000 dollars) in cash in addition to commodities
which usually include TV set, car, video cassette recorder,
motorcycle and refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
The more education one receives and the better job he has, the
more dowry he will demand for.
</P>
<P>
Of late a dowry-related story appeared in the Kathmandu Post.
It goes that a newly married engineer threatened his father-in-law
that he did not get enough dowry and wanted more. But his
father-in-law turned down his request. Then the engineer broke
into his father-in-law's home and seriously injured his
brother-in-law and sister-in-law with a sword.
</P>
<P>
The dowry system is evil in many aspects, according to Dr.
Bhattachan. First, it strains the relations between the bride and
her family members including her husband. A bride's status in her
new family depends on the dowry, but she is not treated well even
if she takes a large amount of dowry with her. If demand for more
is not met, her husband and other family members will resort to
violence. The cases of dowry-related deaths have been increasing

Due to the heavy burden of dowry, boys are preferred in Nepal.
It was reported that among the indigenous communities in Terai,
the birth of a daughter is regarded as a curse while the birth of
a son seen as a boon.
</P>
<P>
Every one would agree that the dowry system is bad. But Dr.
Bhattachan said that other big problems like illiteracy, lack of
infrastructure and poverty sideline the issue of dowry. Now the
government is well aware of the problem and has been making
efforts to minimize violence against women.
</P>
<P>
Dharani Dhar Khatiwada, secretary at the Ministry of Women and
Social Welfare, told Xinhua the other day that his ministry sees
the dowry system as a "remnant of feudal social values" which is
hindering the development of women.
</P>
<P>
He said Nepal has signed the U.N. Convention on Elimination of
All Discrimination Against Women and the ministry has drafted a
bill on domestic violence which is being under discussion. To
raise awareness among people about the unhealthy system, more than
20 seminars have been held in different districts of the country.

<HEADLINE> French Loan For Air-Quality Inspections In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 million yuan (4.8 million
US dollars) in low interest French loans will be used to build 16
air-quality automatic inspection stations in this Chinese
capital, one of the most heavily polluted cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital, which boasts approximately 1.3 million
motor vehicles, has eight American air-inspection stations that it
got in 1983. The system is generally used for five years in the
US, but it has been in operation for 15 years, thanks to the
efforts of city technicians.
</P>
<P>
The 16 new stations are allowed to allow the city to make air
quality reports daily, instead of weekly as it does now, which
will help boost the city's image as an international metropolis.

<HEADLINE> Israel Links Withdrawal from Lebanon to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official said
on Thursday that Israel will not withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon until a security arrangement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet's decision to endorse the United Nations
resolution 425 and withdraw from Lebanon is linked to a security
arrangement with Lebanon, Israeli Coordinator for Activities
in Lebanon Uri Lubrani told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the Lebanese government should guarantee the security
of Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way in which Israel can unilaterally withdraw
without an arrangement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli inner cabinet on Wednesday approved the
U.N. resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdraw from south Lebanon. But the Israeli cabinet, meanwhile,
demanded the Lebanese government guarantee the security of the
bordering areas.
</P>
<P>
Lubrani called United States response to Israel's decision "an
important development," saying that it "gave a credibility which
is necessary to get the whole process off the ground."
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Israel approved the U.N. resolution, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Lebanon to hold talks
with Israel, saying that "discussions between the two parties
would be useful."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, on its part, has been cool to the Israel's decision,
which it said is a trial balloon. It insisted that the Jewish
state must withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally under the
U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Lebanese position, Lubrani said the adoption
of the U.N resolution is just the beginning of a new phase of the
peace process between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"we need patience" to advance the process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has ever since been waging a war of attrition with
Muslim resistance forces. The increasing toll of casualties has
forced the Israeli government to consider withdrawal from south
Lebanon.

painstaking efforts of many generations of and of the two
governments and men of insight.

China and Japan should face the 21st century from a strategic
height and exert themselves to build a long-term and stable
Sino-Japanese relationship of good neighborliness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he hopes to strengthen the links and dialogues between
the two nations' youth and to open communications and cooperation
on many levels to pass on Sino-Japanese friendship to future
generations.
</P>
<P>
Tadao recalled his first visit to China in 1972, when the two
countries just normalized diplomatic ties, and said he has since
come to China quite a few times, and every time has been
pleasantly surprised to see the ways that China has developed.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman Jiang Chunyun of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee also met with Tadao and his party this afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>

positively supporting the process of Asia-European cooperation,
according to comments made by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao during today's regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's view of Asia-European cooperation
prior to the forthcoming Asia-Europe Meeting, Zhu said that
strengthening cooperation and dialog between Asia and Europe is an
important reflection of increasing multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
Asia and Europe have witnessed the increasing momentum of
cooperation since the first Asia-Europe Meeting was held in
Bangkok in 1996, said Zhu, adding that follow-up activities have
proceeded smoothly and yielded fruitful results.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the forthcoming Second
Asia-Europe Meeting in London, and sincerely hopes the meeting

<HEADLINE> Article Outlines Propellent Role of Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The propellent role of consumption
should be valued, according to an article published in today's
"People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The article explained that strong consumption advances
production, with weak consumption leading to sluggish production.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that commodities valued at over 3
trillion yuan were stockpiled in warehouses across the country
during 1996 due to the lack of buyers. a fact which forced
numerous manufacturing enterprises to either partially or
completely halt production.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth rate fell from 9.7 percent in 1996 to
8.8 percent in 1997, with the average standard indicator of the
propellent role of consumption to economic growth falling from
54.5 percent in previous years to last year's figure of 34.4
percent, the lowest level during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
China will strive to fulfill 1998 goal for an economic growth
rate of eight percent, and thus it is extremely important to
promote and increase consumption in order to enhance the propellent
role of consumption to economic expansion, according to the
article.
</P>
<P>
Both urban and rural residents have witnessed great
improvements in living standards in recent years, with significant
improvements also recorded in the consumption capacity of
individuals.
</P>
<P>
The article cited State Statistical Bureau information
indicating that food has consumed the lion's share of consumption
expenditures, with urban and rural residents lavishing 46.4
percent and 55.2 percent respectively in terms of total 1997
expenditures for related items. Expenditures for housing,
transportation, telecommunications and services also grew by
varying degrees, but nonetheless accounted for only a small
proportion of total expenditures.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number consumers increased savings rather than
consumption as China forged ahead with various kinds reforms
related to existing medical care, housing and education systems.
</P>
<P>
Various measures, including the introduction of mortgage loans
for private housing, were introduced to promote housing
consumption. However the article noted that very little was
achieved in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Vast potential exists for substantial growth in individual
consumption, according to the article. It further suggested
increasing consumption will require manufacturers to conduct
extensive market research, introduce needed products, and extend
greater efforts to ensure the distribution system is fully
compatible with consumption policies.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Annan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
the role the United Nations plays in world affairs and has
consistently supported the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
Zhu responded to a question at today's regularly scheduled
press conference by noting that the Chinese government also
attaches great importance to Annan's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Annan and Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen held
highly beneficial and constructive talks and exchanged in-depth
views on the current international situation, as well as the role
of the UN and weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin met Annan earlier today,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations currently faces severe challenges in
safeguarding world peace and stability, and in effectively
resolving political, economic and social problems, said Zhu,
adding that Annan shoulders important missions in related areas.
</P>
<P>
Annan has won high praise from the international community for
his extensive efforts to promote the constructive role of the UN,
as well as for his courage and outstanding diplomatic prowess in
handling the Iraqi weapons inspection crisis, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The UN, the world's most powerful and authoritative
inter-governmental organization, plays a unique role in
international affairs and cannot be replaced by any country or
any group of countries, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Annan recently visited Baghdad and successfully mediated an
agreement to defuse the Iraqi weapons inspection crisis, a fact
which fully demonstrates that the UN can play a due role in
effectively promoting the resolution of major international
issues. Zhu stressed that China will continue to expand its
cooperation with the UN.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
has decided to speed up road-related construction to ease traffic
in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be made to expedite 12 road-related
projects this year, according to municipal government sources.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 project is Ping'an Avenue, called the "second Chang'an

<P>
COLOMBO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's Coast Conservation
 Department (CCD) plans to spend 66 million Rs (1.1 million U.S.
dollars) this year to try and solve the problem of sea erosion in
the country, according to the CCD sources here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 square meters is lost annually in Sri Lanka as a
result of sea erosion. Fifty-five percent of the coastal stretch
is now threatened with sea erosion, the sources quoted CCD
Director N. Perera as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CCD had already disbursed money to put up sand pillows and
stone buffers to fight sea erosion, in critically affected areas
like the Southern coast where sea erosion has seriously endangered
coast and villagers have made desperate representation to the
government for action.
</P>
<P>
These would be short to medium term measures as it would
prevent erosion for more than five years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The CCD need at least 1,200 million Rs (19.7 million U.S.
dollars) to initiate permanent measures, said the sources, adding

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
determined to realize the concept of "sustainable development"
which aims to ensure the continued competitiveness of Hong Kong in
the long run and a better living environment for generations to
come.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, made these remarks at the opening ceremony

adhere to the principle of 'sustainable development' and take it
as a blueprint as we march into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with this principle, Tung said, far-sighted and
appropriate planning would enable the government to launch
large-scale development projects while taking due care of the

with our everyday life and hope that this concept can take root in
our community."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador: Progress Made in Ross Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has said the
recent mission by its special Mideast envoy Dennis Ross made "a
little progress" in helping break the deadlock in the peace
process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Cairo Daniel Kurtzer, in a statement to
reporters Wednesday night, rejected claims that Ross has failed to
sell a set of U.S. peace-saving proposals to the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
"Ross did not return home empty-handed. If we listened and read
what was said by the Israeli leadership, we would not say that
Ross' mission is a failure," he said after talks with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Kurtzer said he and Moussa exchanged viewpoints on the outcome
of Ross' five-day shuttle mission between Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ross was trying to bridge the gap between the two sides, he
said, adding that "a little progress has been made."
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on the progress.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said U.S. President Bill Clinton is waiting for
Ross' report on his tour which ended on Monday and would decide
whether to send Ross to the region again.
</P>
<P>
Ross' mission was aimed at selling a U.S. initiative to the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly wants Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank, accompanied by security cooperation of
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But both Israel and the Palestinians were cool to the U.S.
idea.

<HEADLINE> Australian Jobs Growth to Pick up in Next 6-month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Employment growth was believed to
accelerate in the next six months as an Australian official paper
Thursday showed vacancies climbing back to the highest level in
two years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said, total job
vacancies in February 1998 were 71600, an increase of 4.1 percent
from November 1997, and an increase of 14.6 percent from February
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to ABS, the result was the biggest rise in two years
and the 10th consecutive quarterly increase, and the employment
growth was poised to accelerate in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Private sector job vacancies rose 14.6 percent to their highest
level since the ABS began publishing the series in mid-1979, while
public sector job vacancies fell 12.2 percent for the second
consecutive quarterly decline.
</P>
<P>
All industries reported a rise in vacancies during the quarter
except for accommodation, cafes and restaurants, government
administration and defense, and education.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said the increase in vacancies showed
job prospects were growing in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"What do you see is the picture of the economy that's emerging:
a low inflation economy with low interest rates and increasing job
opportunities," Costello told parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Martin Ferguson, spokesman of the opposition on the
employment, said the quarterly rise in vacancies was only a climb
back from the slow jobs growth recorded since the government was
elected in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Coal Stoves Asphyxiate Eleven in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Carbon monoxide fumes from coal
stoves have caused the deaths of eleven people, and sent more than
1,000 people to the hospital over the past four days in the north
China port city of Tianjin, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The victims reportedly suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning
resulting from the use of coal stoves during warm spring weather
experienced over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Abrupt shifts in temperature and barometric pressure
filled homes with carbon monoxide fumes from coal stoves
asphyxiating people while they slept. Changing weather conditions
created an inversion which prevented fumes from escaping through
chimneys.
</P>
<P>
Victims of carbon monoxide poisoning began arriving at Tianjin
hospitals in the early morning hours of March 29. Dozens of the
patients victims exhibited tell-tale symptoms such as vomiting,
unconsciousness and spasms.
</P>
<P>
While most patients recovered following emergency treatment in
hyperbaric oxygen chambers, deaths resulted from some individuals
failing to seek immediate treatment.
</P>
<P>
Half of the families in Tianjin, a city with a population of
over nine million people, heat with coal stove during the winter
season which normally lasts from November to March. Poorly
ventilated homes result in a number of deaths and reported cases of
carbon monoxide poisoning each and every year.
</P>
<P>
However, the most recent cases of carbon monoxide poisoning
represent the worst event of its kind in recent years, according
to a local official.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Bans Fruitless Workshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian new Health Minister Nkandu
Luo has banned fruitless workshops, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper reported that she has with immediate
effect banned the workshops in her ministry for the next three
months because most of them are fruitless as their resolutions
are never implemented.
</P>
<P>
Luo, who was named as the country's new health minister last
month, imposed the ban when she addressed a community partnership
in health workshop held in Livingstone in southern Zambia
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said now is the time for implementation and not planning,
adding that she will personally go round the country to inspect
whether workshop resolutions are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Luo warned health workers to sit up and take work seriously or
risk being sacked for incompetence.
</P>
<P>
She warned workers against laziness and told those unable to
perform to step aside.
</P>
<P>
The new minister cautioned once again health workers not to
join unions that do not promote health ethics and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
But the Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ) advised the
health workers to join any union of their choice and ignore Luo's
advice.
</P>
<P>
CSUZ General Secretary Japhet Moonde said here Thursday that
"workers under the ministry of health have the right to belong to
a union of their choice just like ordinary Zambians have the
right to belong to a political party of their own choice."

<HEADLINE> China's Lawyers' System Taking Shape, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A new market-oriented legal system
with Chinese characteristics has begun to take shape with lawyers
playing a more active role in society, an official with the
Ministry of Justice said today.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech to mark the second anniversary of the
enactment of the Law of Lawyers, the official said China's current
legal system is the result of nearly 20 years of reform and
improvement.
</P>
<P>
Now, the official said, "the former system dominated by
state-funded law firms has been changed completely, with
non-state-funded firms accounting for 30 percent of the total
number."
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the state-funded law firms are
self-supporting and self-managed, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Ministry of Justice is granting
more management authority to the lawyers association at all levels to
enhance the independence of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing demand, the Ministry of Justice also
reformed its examination system and now holds a countrywide
examination of lawyers' qualifications every year instead of once
every two years.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has more than 8,300 law firms and 100,000
lawyers, both double the figures five years ago.
</P>
<P>
As an important part of the endeavor to introduce a legal
system, a better system of lawyers will contribute to deepening
China's market-oriented reform, the official said.

<HEADLINE> German Supreme Court Rejects Suits Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The German Supreme Court in Karlsruhe
Thursday rejected two suits against Europe's future single currency,
the euro, saying the arguments put forward were clearly unfounded.
</P>
<P>
In one of the suits filed on January 12, four German economics and
law professors argued on constitutional grounds that the euro, with
its stability not guaranteed, would result in high inflation and harm
citizens' property rights.
</P>
<P>
Germany is among one of the 11 European Union states recommended by
the E.U. Commission to launch the euro on January 1, 1999 as planned.
</P>
<P>
Debate is under way in the German parliament which is expected to
decide on April 23-24 on Germany's participation in the euro.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, advocate of the single currency, defended the
euro as "the most important milestone in the European unification
process."
</P>
<P>
He expressed understanding to the reluctance of certain German
people to give up German mark for the still untested euro, and assured
that the euro would be a stable currency.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Bank Deal Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The sale of 49 percent shares of
Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) was completed Wednesday with its
Malaysian buyer paying the remaining six million U.S. Dollars,
''The New Vision'' paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 million U.S. Dollars deal was fixed between Westmont
Land (Asia) and the privatization unit of Uganda on October 27,
1997.
</P>
<P>
H.S. Dalliwall, the Westmont vice president in charge of
international sales, told the newspaper that the bank had
deposited the money on enterprise development project divestiture
account of Citibank, New York.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Muganwa, the project executive director of enterprise
development of Uganda, said the contract will be signed most
likely the next week.
</P>
<P>
Westmont has informed private enterprise reform and
divestiture that its managing team is ready to assume management
immediately, said Dalliwall. Chris Chan, the chief executive, has
been in the country to familiarize with the circumstance and the
bank, and three other senior officers will be in place by the
next week, he added.
</P>
<P>
Westmont delayed to pay UCB for several times due to financial
crisis in Southeast Asia restricting remittance from its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the 49 percent share of UCB is one of the steps of
privatization of state enterprises of Uganda. The government
decided to privatize several state enterprises including the
state Airline, Telecommunication Company, Electric Board and
others. Its petroleum company, UPET, has been taken by Shell
Limited Wednesday, but the amount of the deal was not be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
''A deal with a multinational will put us on a strong footing
and pedestal for the future,'' said I. Esmail, the UPET managing
director.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of Nigeria's national team
Super Eagles will go to France '98 World Cup with their wives if
they wish, coach Bora Milutinovic said Wednesday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"When players are with their wives and spouse, it would not
only reduce tension and anxiety but, save them from the hands of
other girls who could divert their attentions," the Serbian coach
said in a chat with reporters.
</P>
<P>
The players, however, will stay with their wives and will be
barred from going to night clubs during the matches, the coach
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Milutinovic also warned over the overrating of the
Super Eagles both in and outside Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"It is good to be optimistic, but it is also good to take it
easy or we may be dragged behind when we (are) over confident," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic returned to Nigeria last Sunday. Since taking over
the job in early January, he had spent most of his time in Europe
to assess Nigerian players playing in various clubs.

<P>
MAPUTO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The interior ministers of
Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland met in Maputo Wednesday
and discussed issues involved in the Limpopo Development
Initiative bordering the three countries.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Noticias Thursday quoted Mozambican
Interior Minister Almerino Manhenje as saying that the three
countries hope to take concrete measures to implement the
initiative concerning the development in southern Mozambique,
norther South Africa and part of Swaziland, which involves
social, economic and security issues.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the three countries also discussed issues of
security and immigration involved in the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Manhenje acknowledged that serious problems still exist in the
field of security and immigration among the three states.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of security will be addressed," said Manhenje,
"Only when security is strengthened, can the economic development
in the region be sustainable."
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed such issues as immigration and smuggling
among these countries," and Limpopo Development Initiative must
be implemented so that a framework would be made to put existing
rules into effect and set up new rules, said Manhenje.
</P>
<P>
He noted that issues like livestocks stolen at the
Mozambican-Swazi border would be discussed by special
institutions of the two states.
</P>
<P>
However, Manhenje said, the approach in which the Swazi
government and its police treat the Mozambicans living in
Swaziland should also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the discussion disclosed that the three
ministers also exchanged views on the restoration and
establishment of border inspection posts, especially smuggle
monitoring ones, agreeing that the procedures of passing customs
must be standardized and some kind of travelers should be granted
exemption of visas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Offer Different Views on Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese experts say that a
buyer's market has emerged across the country in terms of major
farm produce and byproducts, while others disagreed at a recent
seminar held by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's leading newspaper, the People's Daily, today quoted
Kong Xiangzhi, deputy dean of the Department of Rural Economy,
China People's University, as saying that the country's grain
output of 500 million tons in 1996 and of slightly lower in 1997
could be regarded as convergent growth-oriented fluctuation, a
turn from the former divergent disorder-based fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has maintained a 500-million-ton grain
production capacity, with market supplies of grain, oil, meat,
eggs, vegetables, fruits and aquatic products showing apparent
features of a buyer's market.
</P>
<P>
Experts holding the same views said the central government is
able to balance grain supply and demand dependent on imports and
exports as well as storage, as the country has become a grain
exporter because of increased grain production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, other scholars were not so optimistic, saying that
it's too early for that conclusion. Feng Fahai, a research fellow
at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, argued that the
lagging agricultural production conditions remain basically
unchanged because there have been no substantial investment
increases from governments.
</P>
<P>
He warned that China's per-capita grain, fruit and other major
farm products are still low in the world, and that falling prices
for farm produce and byproducts in recent years are the result of
the moderately tight macroeconomic policies instead of grain
oversupply.
</P>
<P>
Ai Yunhang, a research fellow with the Policy Research Office
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attributed the
drastic fluctuations of grain production to disorderly market
distribution and the sector's inability to adapt to a market
economy. Agricultural restructuring and industrialization will be
the major targets in the future, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General

</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Annan issued a written statement in response
to Xinhua reporters' questions concerning his recent five-nation
tour of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>

must build on this and give full support to the mediation efforts
of the United States".
</P>
<P>
He expressed gratitude with the "unprecedented level of
cooperation" between the UN Special Commission and Iraq in recent
years. "I urged the Iraqis to make cooperation a long-term
strategic goal so we can reach a point when the Security Council
could considers lifting sanctions".
</P>
<P>

for London at noon today. also addressed UN peace-keeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he noted, the Security Council recently acted on his
recommendation and approved a new UN peace-keeping mission for the
Central African Republic, and is currently "considering a similar
mission for Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
"This represents a revival of interest in UN peace-keeping, and
I am encouraged by related actions," added Annan.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China, a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, has a "vital role in authorizing peace-keeping
operations".

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that China will continue to support the work of the United
Nations, as always, in a meeting with visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the United Nation's role has drawn ever more
attention during the development of multiple centers of power in
the world, especially after the Cold War. The United Nations,
under reduced restrictions, has become more vigorous and raised
the expectations of all countries.
</P>
<P>
So, Jiang said, the United Nations should exert more effort to
play its due role, which is undoubtedly conducive to pushing the
development of the emergence of multiple influencing powers.
</P>
<P>
He continued that after taking office as the U.N.
secretary-general, Annan has made many attempts at reforming the
United Nations, and that China sincerely hopes the United Nations,
through reform and adjustment, can better adapt itself to the
demands of new situations, and handle international issues in a
more fair and effective way, so as to make further achievements in
safeguarding peace and promoting development.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the U.N.'s success needs the support and
cooperation of all its member states, and spoke highly of Jiang's
and the Chinese government's support and contributions, adding
that China's participation in, and support of, the United Nations
is vital to its role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his thanks for China's firm support for his handling
of the recent weapons inspection crisis in Iraq, Annan said that
in a crucial time China's position on a peaceful resolution and
support for diplomatic efforts played a vital role in solving the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hoped that the cooperative relations between the
United Nations and China would continue and deepen.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Iraqi issue is another serious international
crisis after the Cold War, especially after the Gulf War,
Jiang praised Annan for his courage, wisdom and diplomatic skills
in his successful Iraqi trip for political coordination at a time
when war was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he has been concerned about the situation and has
exchanged letters with leaders of several countries expounding
China's position aiming for a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the memorandum of understanding reached between
the United Nations and the Iraqi government can be carried out in
a down-to-earth manner so that the issue of weapons inspection can
be fundamentally resolved.

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), met with a delegation from South
West Africa People's Organization (SWPO) of Namibia led by its
General Secretary H. Pohamba.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also Chinese vice-president, said that the Chinese and
Namibian peoples have shared a profound traditional friendship
though the two countries are geographically far from each
other. CPC and the Chinese government have consistently supported
Namibian people's just struggle for national independence and
against racial segregation, said Hu.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased with the achievements scored by Namibia under
the leadership of President Sam Nujoma since the country became
independent.

He noted that Sino-Namibian ties have witnessed new progress
in recent years, with frequent exchange of high-level visits and
the expansion of bilateral cooperation in various fields.

Hu expressed the belief that the current China visit by the
delegation would further advance the friendly and cooperative ties
between the two parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu also briefed the Namibian visitors on China's reform and
opening up.

<P>
Pohamba conveyed to Hu a letter from President Nujoma to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who is also the general-secretary

</P>
<P>
He said that the SWPO and CPC started friendly exchanges more
than 30 years ago and the SWPO hopes to expand the existing
cooperative relations with the CPC through the delegation's current
China tour.

their consistent support to Namibia and said that China has won the
respect of the international community through its consistent
support to the just cause of developing countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Records 100,000 Maternal Deaths Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria records about 100,000
maternal deaths annually despite improvements in health care, the
Health Minister disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The deaths occurred from severe bleeding, infections,
pregnancy-induced hypertension, unsafe abortions and
prolonged/obstructed labor.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Iyorwuese Hager disclosed this while
addressing a press conference in the capital Abuja to commemorate
this year's World Health Day.
</P>
<P>
According to Hager, one in 13 Nigerian women faces a lifetime
risk of death during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of expectant women experience acute obstetric
problems during pregnancy, childbirth and post portum period,
while 15 percent develop life-threatening complications, he
added.
</P>
<P>
To stem the rising maternal deaths, the government has
undertaken a number of measures, including reducing population
growth rate and specially limiting to four the maximum number of
children per woman.
</P>
<P>
The government also developed a national maternal and child
health policy in 1994, along with a national plan of action to
achieve policy goals.
</P>
<P>
Training of traditional birth attendants and voluntary health
workers has become regular.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that most of the deaths emanate from preventable
and curable ailments, the minister listed lapses in health
delivery services, lack of public transportation system and good
roads as impediments to safe motherhood.
</P>
<P>
He also canvassed the improvement of socio-economic status of
women and eradication of harmful traditional practices such as
female genital mutilation.

<HEADLINE> Angola: UNITA Begins to Relocate Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-level mission of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) arrived
in Luanda late Wednesday, beginning to relocate its leadership to
the Capital city.
</P>
<P>
The mission headed by UNITA Vice-President Antonio Dembo
includes Alcides Sakala, Artur Vinama and Franco Marcolino, all
of whom are members of the Political Commission of the opposition
movement. But UNITA President Jonas Savimbi has not come.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UNITA delegation to the Joint Committee for Peace
Process Isaias Samakuva told the press that the high-profile
mission has come to set up new headquarters in Luanda and will
not leave.
</P>
<P>
The mission will work intensively to create all necessary
conditions to enable other leaders including Savimbi to come
here, said Samakuva.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNITA-controlled Voice of the Black Cockerel
Radio will shut down after its final broadcasting on Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The only task remaining is the re-establishment of state
authorities in former UNITA's strongholds Bailundo and Andulo, he
said, adding that UNITA and the Angolan government had agreed
that the task will first be carried out in other UNITA-controlled
areas and eventually in Bailundo and Andulo. For this, Dembo
conveyed a letter from Savimbi to Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Minister of Territorial Administration Faustino
Muteka showed the Joint Committee for Peace Process around the
downtown six-story office building the Angolan government
prepared for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that United Nations spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt said Wednesday that the move of UNITA high-level mission
was positive.
</P>
<P>
Carlos hoped that this would be the first step of the
relocation process of UNITA leadership. But he also expressed
regret that UNITA had not completed all the tasks stipulated in
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord before the deadline on March 31.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will make great efforts
to improve air quality within the next three years, today's
Guangming Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Air-quality reports released since February 28 showed that the
air over the Chinese capital is seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
"The air quality in the city is not satisfactory," the paper
quoted Yu Xiaoxuan, vice director of the city's environmental
protection bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some worldwide health organizations regard Beijing as one of the
most seriously polluted cities on the globe.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said they are jittery about the air condition
and hope that anti-pollution measures are taken as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide in motor vehicle exhaust, sulphur dioxide from
burning of coal, suspending particles in the air, and carbon
monoxide are the major pollutants, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years, the number of motor vehicles in
Beijing has increased from 200,000 to 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
To reduce air pollution, the city government has forced car
manufacturers to install exhaust purifiers on their products since
the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also decided to extensively replace coal with
natural gas, which is economical and environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
More trees and grass will be planted in the city to reduce air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the city will release daily air-quality reports
beginning from June.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has established eight monitoring stations to test
air quality in the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign debts stood at
150.3 billion U.S. dollars at the end of February, down 900
million from January, the Ministry of Finance and Economy said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, the government's long-term foreign debts,
including bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
rose 1.7 billion while the private sector's
short-term debt fell 2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
South Korea saw a foreign debt of 150 billion U.S. dollars last
December when the country signed an agreement with the IMF for a
rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars to curb the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's foreign exchange reserves, which stood at nine
billion U.S. dollars when the crisis occurred last year, steadily
rose to 24 billion U.S. dollar at the end of March thanks to trade
surplus in the past several months and the smooth inflow of funds
from the IMF and other international financial institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A high-level mission of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) arrived
in Luanda late Wednesday, beginning to relocate hts leadership to
the Capital city.
</P>
<P>
The mission headed by UNITA Vice-President Antonio Dembo
includes Alcides Sakala, Artur Vinama and Franco Marcolino, all
of whom are members of the Political Commission of the opposition
movement. But UNITA President Jonas Savimbi has not come.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UNITA delegation to the Joint Committee for Peace
Process Isaias Samakuva told the press that the high-profile
mission has come to set up new headquarters in Luanda and will
not leave.
</P>
<P>
The mission will work intensively to create all necessary
conditions to enable other leaders including Savimbi to come
here, said Samakuva.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNITA-controlled Voice of the Black Cockerel
Radio will shut down after its fanal broadcasting on Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The only task remaining is the re-establishment of state
authorities in former UNITA's strongholds Bailundo and Andulo, he
said, adding that UNITA and the Angolan government had agreed
that the task will first be carried out in other UNITA-controlled
areas and eventually in Bailundo and Andulo. For this, Dembo
conveyed a letter from Savimbi to Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Minister of Territorial Administration austino
Muteka showed the Joint Committee for Peace Process around the

<HEADLINE> Optimism Voiced for China's Long-Term Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's State Information Center
forecasts that China's will enjoy a clear economic upsurge in the
second half of 1998 when considering factors such as capital
sufficiency, labor, technological advancement and system
changes.
</P>
<P>
The center released a report today indicating that the
interaction of the aforementioned factors will constitute the
fundamental driving force behind economic growth, and noted that
existing conditions will be highly beneficial for the nation's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Optimism concerning the long-term prospects for China's
economic development prevail if major problems existing in the
present economic arena are properly solved, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
It notes the fact that China's domestic savings rate has
remained higher than the investment rate in fixed assets during
the 1990s fully demonstrates the nation's solid domestic capital
base and that domestic savings deposits will provide reliable
support for both high investment and economic growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Steadily rising income and consumption demand provides China
with the capability of maintaining a high domestic savings rate
for a relatively long period to come. An increased influx of
foreign capital will greatly enhance the feasibility for China to
achieve a high economic growth rate by increasing investments in
fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
China has abundant labor resources, with an increasing number
of university graduates and students returning from overseas
providing providing a vast reservoir of professionals for
high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is paying increasing attention to
investment in human resources, with constant enhancements in the
social status of scientists and technicians. In addition, sharp
increases have been recorded in the number of workers receiving
in-service training. The combined factors have created sufficient
labor resources for economic development.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that scientific and technological advancement
offers vast potential for China's economic development. China has
achieved an average annual GDP growth rate of nearly 10 percent
over the past 10-plus years, with increased investments
representing the driving force behind the economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that technological advancements have
contributed some 30 percent to China's economic growth, but note
that the level is far behind levels of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
System reform also represents a significant driving force
behind sustained economic growth, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China not
only effectively ended disputes concerning "ownership", but gave
the green light for private businesses and State-owned enterprises
to further deepen reform. In addition, competition resulting from
diversified forms of ownership will to some extent
increase productivity.
</P>
<P>
In terms of this year's economic prospects, the report noted
the government's objective for an eight percent economic growth
rate can be achieved if the margin of increased investment is
maintained at about 15 percent. It also noted that capital
resources for fixed asset investments should eliminate all worry
about maintaining the margin.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Removes Cess Levy On Rubber Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
removed the cess levy on all rubber exports, the official Daily
News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Plantation Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake was quoted as
saying that the government has taken this measure to provide
immediate relief to rubber small holders and to protect the rubber
industry.
</P>
<P>
The cess levy which was 5.41 Rs (0.09 U.S. dollars) on every
kilogram of rubber exported, will not be charged in future so as
to enable Sri Lankan rubber to compete effectively in the world
market, the Minister, told the paper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of the cess is expected to provide some measure
of relief to rubber producers by way of an increase in the Colombo
auction price of rubber.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the country's total rubber lands are owned
by small holders. The average unit size in the rubber small holder
sector is around 0.5 per hectare and the majority of the small
holders produce Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) grades 3, 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
The current average production cost of RSS grades of rubber for
the small holder varies from 40 Rs (0.66 U.S. dollars) to 41 Rs
(0.67 U.S. dollars) a kilogram. However, the current market price
of a RSS grade 4 kilogram is less than its cost of production,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the situation will be reviewed once the RSS 4
graded price of the Rubber Development Department reaches 50 Rs
(0.82 U.S. dollars) a kilogram or after six months from the date
of the abolition of the levy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Tighten Security After Death of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli police are on
"heightened alert" after the radical Islamic group Hamas
threatened to avenge the death of one of its activists Muhei
Eddine Sharif, the Jerusalem Post daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Police Inspector-General Yehuda Wilk on Wednesday
decided to put the police on alert on Thursday after discussing
security steps with top police officers.
</P>
<P>
Wilk said there already have been plans to take extra security
measures during the Jewish Pessah holidays in mid-April, but due
to Sharif's death the measures will be reenforced.
</P>
<P>
"There will certainly be a heightened alert of the police," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The body of Sharif was found on Sunday after an explosion in
the West Bank city Ramallah. He was suspected of having
masterminded several suicide bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials contended that Sharif was shot to death
by Israeli forces before his body was dumped in a car rigged with
explosives and detonated the blast by remote control in an attempt
to cover up the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources insisted that Israel was not
responsible for the explosion, noting that Sharif was killed
amid a violent rift within the Islamic movement.
</P>
<P>
Hamas unleashed threats on Wednesday to attack Jewish targets
in retaliation for Sharif's death.
</P>
<P>
"As part of our assessment, we take into account the
declarations of the Hamas. In the past they made declarations and
carried them out," the Israeli police chief said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombing attacks
in Israel since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security troops are bracing against unrest
after the mass funeral of Sharif in Ramallah on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a situation where there are chances of an attack and we
have to take precautions," said a military official.

<HEADLINE> Thai Provincial Schools Get Free Access to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Blessed are those secondary
school students across Thailand who can enjoy free access to the
internet through the so-called schoolnet from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They must thank for the extensive "behind-the-scenes" work
that has enabled free dial-up access from every province in the
country, the Bangkok Post said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This pioneering work, which puts the country ahead of others
in the region, was spearheaded by the National Electronics and
Computer Technology Center (NECTEC).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Princess Sirindhorn declared the network open
during a private visit to NECTEC.
</P>
<P>
Schoolnet offers internet access and uses the ppp protocol. It
is now accessible free-of-charge by all school members who may
dial a single special number from anywhere in the country. No
long-distance phone charge is involved.
</P>
<P>
According to NECTEC Director, Professor Pairash Thajchayapong,
schoolnet began as a pilot project in 1995, which is "a
substantial component for the survival of Thailand in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
The network was enabled without any specific national funding,
thanks to other resources and projects and much behind the scenes
work.
</P>
<P>
Resources include the Thai Social/Scientific, Academic and
Research Network, the country's largest league of higher education
institution network, and NECTEC's own network testing laboratory,
and later the "Golden Jubilee Network Project", which was set up
to celebrate the King's 50th anniversary of accession to the
throne in 1996.
</P>
<P>
International companies such as Compaq, Microsoft, Intel also
lent a hand.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Elina Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze won the gold of the pair program at the World
Figure Skating Championships in Minneapolis, Minnesota on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of the United States bagged the silver
and Germany's Peggy Schwarz and Mirko Muller finished third.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China recorded in the fourth place,
the best mark for both China and Asia at World Championships or
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Their near perfect performance gained a long-time applause from
more than 13,000 spectators, who greeted the Chinese pair in
standing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair, who were from Northeast China, improved their
positions from the fifth at the Nagano Winter Olympic Games and
tenth at World Figur Skating Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
Their free program performance received a second highest mark
after that for the Russian pair, but slipped away from the medal
podium due to a small fault at the short program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair, who was finished second at the short program
because of Sikharulidze's fall, took over the Chinese and other
rivals for their excellent skating.
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult for us to go out and skate after yesterday's
mistake," said Berezhnaya after their skating on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, feeling pretty great last night with their first
position at the short program, said they were glad for what they
did tonight although they made "a few little mistakes," said
Mero.
</P>
<P>
However, Sand said they were fortunate to get a medal.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok to Set Up First Riverside Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK April 2 (Xinhua) -- For the first time ever, Bangkok
citizens will be able to enjoy their leisure hours along the
famous Chao Phraya river as the metropolitan authorities are
planning to build the first public park next to the river.
</P>
<P>
A nine-rai (1.44 hectares) plot of land around a historical
fort along the river will be developed into a public park, which
will become a new tourist attraction of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post newspaper Thursday quoted Bangkok Governor
Bhichit Rattakul as saying that the waterfront was to be developed
on eight and a half rai (1.36 hectares) of land covering three
plots belonging to two government departments and the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration (BMA).
</P>
<P>
A concrete riverside corridor measuring 510 meters in length
and three meters wide will also be built along the Chao Phraya
river.
</P>
<P>
Besides these plots, a nearby four-rai (0.64 hectares) plot of
land which houses an old printing house will be turned into a
public park. The building will be torn down.
</P>
<P>
"Bangkokians live close to the Chao Phraya river but they
hardly have a chance to feel and touch the river because most of
the riverside areas are occupied by private individuals," the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
A BMA official said the project will cost about 130 million
baht (3.4 million U.S. dollars). The government would be requested
to upgrade it as a national project.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to finish before next December.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Cooperating with foreign mining
companies, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has
begun prospecting gold reserves in the region's Kirghiz Autonomous
Prefecture of Kizilsu.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture, located on the Pamirs at the juncture of the
Tianshan and Kunlun mountains, is a likely site for gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Because of its bad climate and inaccessibility, gold reserves
have not been discovered in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
To prospect and develop the prefecture's gold reserves, the
regiona's mining department has signed agreements with Broken Hill
Proprietary (BHP) from Australia, the world's second largest
mining company, and Barrick Resources Corp. from Canada, the
world's third largest.
</P>
<P>
An experimental zone to attract overseas investment for gold
prospecting, the first of its kind in the country, has been
approved for the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Experts have made on-the-spot investigations in six areas,
including Artux, Akto, Akqi and Wuqia. They expect to discover
gold deposits within the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China will organize a 100-member
team consisting of foreign and domestic tourists to climb Mount
Qomolangma in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wansheng, deputy-director of the Tourism Bureau of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, said here today that the activity will be
supported by the China Mountaineering Association to mark the 40th
anniversary of man's first successful peak climb.
</P>
<P>
A 30-odd-member press delegation will also join the adventure
during which they will clean up rubbish left by previous climbers,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Before they reach the foot of the mountain, the two teams will
visit the most famous cities, lamaseries, lakes, mountains and
historical sites in Tibet in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, they will arrive at the base camp on the mountain,
some 5,200 meters above sea level, and start the expedition.
</P>
<P>
May is the best period for climbing Mount Qomolangma, said
Zhang, adding that his bureau will prepare tents, sleeping bags
and oxygen masks for the climbers.
</P>
<P>
Tourists who have received no training usually can reach more
than 6,000 meters above sea level, he said. The mountain is 8,848
meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that he especially welcome foreigners to take part
in the expedition, which will help them know a true Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Some 350,000 tourists visited Tibet last year, up 7.7 percent
over 1996.

NANNING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- An ill jaguar's life has been
saved by timely treatment at the Zhongshan Zoo in Wuzhou in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

ill two weeks ago, and the situation turned grave after several
days.
</P>
<P>
The animal suffered from dirarrhoea and lost appetite day by
day. The amount of meat it ate daily fell to one kilogram from two
kilograms. It fainted away on March 21, with its body temperatures
dropping below 35 degrees Centigrade.

<HEADLINE> New Australian Consul-General in Hong Kong Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Female diplomat Susan Boyd will
replace Geoff Walsh as Australia's next consul-general in Hong
Kong, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I have today announced the appointment of Susan Boyd as
Australian Consul-General in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"Boyd has been Australian Ambassador to Vietnam since October
1994," the foreign minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Boyd, who is expected to take up her appointment in June 1998,
has served in Bangladesh as high commissioner, and in Lisbon, East
Berlin and the Australian Mission to the United Nations in New
York since joining the Australian foreign ministry in 1970.
</P>
<P>
With a bachelor of arts degree and a diploma of education from
the University of Western Australia, Boyd had three years'
experience as a journalist with the Perth Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Her predecessor Walsh has been consul-general in Hong Kong
since August 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR is a major regional and international
financial, trade, services and media center located in the dynamic
southern part of China where Australia has extensive and important
interests," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Australia's eighth largest export market, the 11th
largest trading partner and our fourth largest source of overseas
students, and tourism from Hong Kong to Australia also remains
strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 Australians live in Hong Kong, the largest
Australian expatriate community in Asia, with more than 350
Australian companies represented there, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has welcomed the developments in the Hong Kong SAR
since its establishment in July last year, and strongly supports
the continuation of those elements of Hong Kong's way of life that
have underpinned its success: its free economy, free press, the
rule of law, and its evolving democratic institutions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Aggressive Japanese Banks Burdened with Bad Loans Leave U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese banks, whose aggressive
approach in the United States frightened Americans a decade ago, are
now leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
They paid high prices to get into the U.S., and as they now get
out, they sell at a huge discount.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, Japanese banks were the buyers. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
paid 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for its stake in CIT, Bank of Tokyo
put up 750 million dollars for California's Union Bank, and Fuji
offered 425 million dollars for Heller Financial, a Chicago-based
commercial finance company.
</P>
<P>
Now they are selling their U.S. financial assets. Burdened with an
estimated 592 billion dollars of bad loans, Japanese banks are eager
to raise money. Although banks such as Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Sanwa are
expected to keep their California subsidiaries, more are leaving.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Sumitomo Bank agreed to sell its California subsidiary
for 546 million U.S. dollars, about one-third the price similar banks
are fetching. It was a surprise because the price being paid to the
company's public shareholders was about 24 percent below the market
price.
</P>
<P>
Tokai Bank also agreed to pay junk-bond yields to raise one billion
dollars in a sale of preferred stock last month.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Bank of Japan and other Japanese banks in recent months
sold almost 10 billion dollars in loans they made to U.S. companies.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank last year sold a 20 percent stake in its CIT
Group to the public, raising 850 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the transactions would have been impossible in
the 1980s, when a booming Tokyo stock market and a tumbling U.S.
dollar turned Japanese banks into some of the world's biggest
institutional investors and lenders.
</P>
<P>
While many Japanese banks are exiting their U.S. business, U.S.
businesses are eager to edge into Japan, the world's second-largest
market.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Japan's Big Bang package of economic reforms intended
to deregulate the country's financial markets, U.S. companies, from
financial firms to high-tech providers, hope to find new opportunities
there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. computer companies, software firms and telecome providers also
stand to find new markets amid Tokyo's financial wreckage.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exporters hope the reform as well as 121-billion-dollar worth
of tax cuts and public spending announced last month will kick-start
the Japanese economy. Exports expected to do with in Japan's reform
environment include computer software, computer hardware, and sale
tools such as Website designers, telecom suppliers and telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
Americans also expect buying opportunities as the financial turmoil
in Tokyo has weakened the country's once-strong barriers against
inward investment and foreign takeover.

club of the Federation of Thai Industries says.
</P>
<P>
The decline reflects lower purchasing power and higher
production costs due to tax increases and the baht depreciation,
the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Car production in January and February totalled 16,077 units,
down by 64,781 units, or 80.12 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, motocycle production totaled 89,969 units, down by
119,148 units or 56.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the domestic slump, exports of cars,
motorcycles and parts continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
The value of exported automobile products in January and
February reached 6.096 billion baht (160.4 million U.S. dollars),
recording an increase of 89.1 percent compared to the first two
months of last year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Skaters Lead Short Program in World Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian skaters led the men's
short program on Wednesday, the second day of the six-day World
Figure Skating Championships held at Mineapolis, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Russian Alexei Yagudin, the 1998 European Champion and the
fifth-place at the Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, finished
first with his countryman Evgeni Plushenko taking the second place.
</P>
<P>
The third place went to America's Michael Weiss, who performed
seventh at the 1998 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
China's Guo Zhengxin, the best man's skater in Asia who was
placed eighth at the Nagano Olympic Games, moved to the 14th in
the short program, which is not his strong event, because of a
failure in the last triple axel.
</P>
<P>
However, Guo, who played well the whole program, said he felt
confident to perform better in the second half, the free program
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Also, Yagudin said he did not play his best. "For some reason,
it was too hard to skate. My jumps were not straight." But he said
he did his job.
</P>
<P>
The other Russian, Plushenko, said, "This is my first
Worlds. It's like a debut for me. So, I was a bit nervous. I
landed my triple axel on two feet. But overall, I am proud of how
I did."

NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Kenya Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Kenyans bowed in emotional grief at the Bombolulu Girls
School in the port city of Mombasa during Wednesday's solemn
burial of the 22 young girls who perished in a ghastly dormitory
blaze last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- Botswana's Festus Mogae was sworn in Wednesday as the
country's third president since Africa's oldest democracy gained

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> State Revenue be Used Efficiently, "Outlook" Weekly Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China should tighten its grip over
fiscal expenditures, making a more reasonable use of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) revenue, reports Beijing-based weekly
"Outlook".
</P>
<P>
Some government bodies have been found to be too lavish with
the public funds at their disposal. Some use the money to build
unnecessary training and meeting centers and hotels, some of which
were later found to be used as recreational centers, says an
"Outlook" article.
</P>
<P>
Some rashly use the money to take business trips. Some even use
the money to buy personal luxuries such as mobile phones and
limousines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, blind and repeated infrastructure construction by
many government bodies and bloated institutions drains off large
amounts of public funds, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Finance indicate that every
year the state has to spend over 360 billion yuan (43.48 billion
US dollars) to feed people working in governmental institutions
and organizations, a staggering sum that accounts for almost half
of state revenues.
</P>
<P>
Any waste of public funds is appalling, and can only worsen the
shortage and slow down the economic locomotive, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's current fiscal supply system still reveals strong
vestiges of the old centrally planned economy in which the state
shouldered a heavy fiscal burden of social welfare spending, it reports.
</P>
<P>
The burden of social spending not only puts pressure on the
budget deficit and makes the government vulnerable to political
attack, but almost surely adds inefficiencies to the labor and
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, the article says, the state should cut
back wasteful social expenditures, withdrawing from the role that
should be played by market forces and society.
</P>
<P>
It outlines three measures to change these phenomenon:
</P>
<P>
-- Cut back welfare subsidies to urban residents;
</P>
<P>
-- State money should be spent more on projects embodying
common or long-term interests of the society. Such projects
include science and technology, education, health and a social
security system;
</P>
<P>
-- Reform the system that allows all state-owned enterprises to
always rely on government subsidies to keep running.

<HEADLINE> Donor Countries Agree to Help Indonesia's Social Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- International donors agreed
here Wednesday to work closely together to help Indonesia overcome
the urgent social consequences of the financial crisis and its
worst drought this century, the World Bank said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of Indonesia, the United States, Australia,
Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Britain, France, Italy,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and Canada
as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the European Commission, the UN agencies
and other institutions, assessed Indonesia's needs at an all-day
working-level session chaired by Jean-Michel Severino, Vice
President of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The participants reviewed contributions, priorities and policy
initiatives on poverty alleviation and drought relief and
discussed ways of enhancing support for the crisis-ridden
country. It was acknowledged that many activities were underway
with many more to come, necessitating greater consultation and
coordination.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to develop a full coordination
mechanism in Jakarta, capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on four main areas: the impact of the
three-year-old drought and food security, social services, health
and education, poverty impact, social protection and unemployment,
and protecting Indonesia's physical, human and natural resources
during the crisis period.
</P>
<P>
While donors agreed that the Indonesian government has arranged
adequated food supplies over the short term, the World Bank
estimated that the country may need to import three to four
million tons of rice in coming months depending on the success of
the forthcoming harvest, the overcoming of distribution problems
and the progress of the El Nino effect.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed that aside from financial support
for imports and subsidies for rice and soybeans, the key near term
priority for the Indonesian government and the international
community is ensuring that letters of credit for grain imports are
backed adequately and that trader confidence is maintained to
prevent a repeat of the delays in early January and February.
</P>
<P>
To back Indonesia's economic recovery and return to growth, the
World Bank plans to disburse 4.5 billion U.S. dollars over the
next three years, emphasizing a framework for macroeconomic
stability, financial sector reform, competition policy and
regulatory reform, and sustained economic growth. Of the total
pledged, the World Bank will provide two billion dollars to support
financial sector restructuring and long-term structural policy
reform this year.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the World Bank's lending to Indonesia is nearly 25
billion dollars, with 78 projects currently being implemented with
a 91 percent satisfactory approval rating.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Bank Optimistic About Zhuhai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Standard Chartered Bank of London
believes the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone is a good place for
business, said Lance Browne, the bank's chief executive officer in
charge of China and Macao affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the
bank's Zhuhai Branch, Browne said Zhuhai has standardized banking
regulation and that the market has great potential.
</P>
<P>
As the first foreign bank opened in Zhuhai, the branch during
the past 10 years has established good business ties with local
state-owned and overseas-funded enterprises, and has granted
several billion U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
Though headquartered in London, Standarded Chartered generates
two-thirds of its profits from Asia. It has opened eight branches
and eight representative offices in China.
</P>
<P>
Browne said the bank has chosen Zhuhai as a focus for business
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Vasile Nominated Candidate For Romania's Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania's first ruling party,
the National Peasants' Party, nominated its general secretary and
spokesman Radu Vasile on Wednesday as candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Vasile said after the nomination that the new government will
endeavor to revise the draft budget, work to tap resources and
establish foundations to enhance the development of small-and
medium-sized businesses and to encourage exports.
</P>
<P>
Whatever difficulties are ahead, he said, the future government
will do its utmost to carry out reforms.
</P>
<P>
President Emil Constantinescu is expected to confirm the
nomination on Thursday. Once approved by the president, Vasile
will form the cabinet within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Following former Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea's resignation on
Monday, Minister of Industry and Trade Mircea Ciumara, Chairman of
the State Property Foundation Sorin Dimitriu, and Vasile ran for
the vacancy.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two of the 72 members in the leading group of the
National Peasants' Party cast favorable votes for Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the party Ion Diaconescu said it was within
expectations for Vasile to be chosen as candidate for prime
minister. The result has also been approved by all other parties.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the prime minister has only limited power
since the government's policies need approval of the parliament
before they go into force.
</P>
<P>
Vasile acted as the vice-chairman of the Senate from 1992 to
1996 and was re-elected to the post in the 1996 parliamentary
elections.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns of Food Shortage in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has warned that
the long drought and monetary crisis is threatening Indonesia's
food security and the rice imports could reach record levels this
year.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made here Wednesday by an 11-member team of
officials from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
World Food Program (WFP) which just concluded a three-week study
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the team said that delayed and
irregular rainfall, reduced use of fertilizer and low quality
seeds could also lead to a reduced rice harvest.
</P>
<P>
It said 7.5 million people living in 15 provinces risked
experiencing food insecurity until early 1999 if the prolonged dry
season lasts much longer.
</P>
<P>
"However, the condition still falls short of a famine," said
the release.
</P>
<P>
The team, however, predicted that the production of most
secondary crops such as soybeans, cassava, maize and sweet
potatoes as well as ground nut will increase and should provide a
limited food security cushion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drought, Indonesia is also facing its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. The rupiah (national currency) has
plunged more than 70 percent and this has caused inflation and
unemployment to soar.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Country Director for Indonesia Dennius de Tray said
Tuesday that Indonesia's bill for key imports could be anything
between 1.5 billion and 3 billion U.S. dollars over the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned that Indonesia would have to import at least
four million tons of rice this year to feed its 202.5 million
people.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Create First Securities Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ho Chi Minh Securities Exchange,
the first of its kind in Vietnam, will be established later this
year, the English-language newspaper Vietnam News reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the State Securities Commission (SCC) as saying that
this will be the first step toward the country's long awaited
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government plans to equitise a number of
state-owned enterprises as part of efforts to create a securities
market.
</P>
<P>
As of last month, 28 of the country's 5,790 firms have been
equitised and five of these have been permitted to issue stocks.
</P>
<P>
To increase the attraction of stocks, the SSC has asked the
government to permit equitisation in profitable and fast growing
state industries, including firms in telecommunications, oil and
gas.
</P>
<P>
The first stocks to be traded when the exchange opens will be
those issued by equitised firms and commercial banks, a SSC
official said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure its smooth operation, the SSC is concentrating on
staff training in brokering, consulting and transacting deals.

<P>
HANOI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has recently recorded its
highest temperature in southern areas for the past 80 years, with
a temperature of 40.6 degrees celsius, the press said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hot weather is causing a drought, which has adversely
affected agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the meteorology and hydrology department
attributed the prolonged hot spell to the El Nino phenomenon. They
said that it could affect weather conditions until May.
</P>
<P>
In Ho Chi Minh City, the number of children suffering from
respiratory, intestinal and digestive disorders has increased
dramatically. Most children admitted to hospitals are experiencing
respiratory problems, diarrhoea and high fevers because of the
heat.
</P>
<P>
Many factories in the city are fighting the high temperatures
by installing hundreds of fans and ventilators.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the city have been flocking to swimming pools to
escape the heat wave. The cultural labor house swimming pool has
been overcrowded at times with over 3,000 swimmers, nearly double
the pool's average attendance.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign reserves
increased by 600 million U.S. dollars in the last two weeks of
march, an official of the Bank of Thailand said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official said the increase came as the bank continued to
fulfill its repayment obligations incurred in currency markets
during a futile defense of the baht last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand had repaid 400 million U.S. dollars in
swap-market obligations, trimming its net forward position to 15.9
million U.S. dollars, said the official, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
But he did not provide figures for the present foreign
reserves. Earlier news reports said Thailand's foreign reserves
stood at 26.7 billion U.S. dollars in February.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government had said inflows of foreign capital have
resumed after several months of outflow, contributing to the rise
in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
The official said the rise in foreign reserves would promote
Thailand's efforts to defuse the currency crisis that broke out in
the country and spread to some other East Asian countries last
year.
</P>
<P>
Although Thailand's foreign reserves rose, its exports dropped
considerably, according newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
Export value fell 7.9 percent in March from the same month a
year ago. The International Monetary Fund estimated that
Thailand's export growth this year will be 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance is positive only with a larger 45 percent
contraction in imports, which offset the sharp export decline and
that left the balance with an 869-million-dollar surplus in the
month.

MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia strongly opposes the

Kosovo issue, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the United Nations Security Council's decision on

<P>
He said mediation by the international community should

Enforced sanctions, particularly economic sanctions, he said,
would have a negative impact on the Balkan region and other

</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. Security Council resolution on an arms embargo
was revised to avoid the escalation of regional tension and
facilitate the settlement of conflict through political means
while ensuring the territory integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>

The resolution condemned the activities pursued by the

point to the land borders of the five states on its coast, the
Rvestia newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries also agreed that the five states -- Russia,
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran -- have their own
proprietary rights to the mineral resources, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Russia and Azerbaijan recently held a
consultation in Baku, the Azerbaijan capital, agreeing a deputy
ministerial meeting should be held as soon as possible to
coordinate their stand on the Caspian Sea's legal status.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the countries along the
Caspian Sea have differed greatly on its division.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government has
denounced the United Nations arms embargo as groundless and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the embargo posed
an "unprecedented and unwarranted meddling " in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Pressures and interference from abroad are baseless,
counterproductive and harmful, the statement said, adding that
the embargo can only "encourage those whose aims are unreal and
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Considering the situation in Kosovo posed no threat to
international stability and security, the U.N. was not justified
by its charter to discuss the issue, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo Tuesday to
pressure Belgrade to open unconditional dialogue with ethnic
Albanian leaders in the troubled Serbian province Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Mir cosmonauts carried out a
six-hour spacewalk Wednesday to reinforce a solar panel damaged in
a space collision last June.
</P>
<P>
Cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin began Wednesday
evening by opening a lock on a door that refused to budge a month
ago, forcing the cancellation of a spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
A new set of wrenches arrived recently. The two Russians will
attempt to install a splint to reinforce a solar panel that was
damaged in a collision on June 25 between the Mir and a cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The two cosmonauts are scheduled to make four additional
spacewalks during the first three weeks of April. In addition to
the repair work, they will also try to replace one of the
orientation engines, which keeps the station properly aligned with
the sun.
</P>
<P>
U.S. astronaut Andrew Thomas, also on the station, will stay
aboard the Mir during the spacewalks. In the event of an
emergency, he will withdraw immediately from the station and
return to earth with the two Russians.
</P>
<P>
After a long series of accidents and breakdowns, the
12-year-old Mir has been relatively trouble-free in recent
months.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Croatian Deputy Premier
and Foreign Minister Mate Granic Wednesday encouraged
Croatian-Hungarian refugees fleeing Yugoslav warfare to return
home.
</P>
<P>
Granic made the remark at a news conference following his
meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
There were some 25,000 Croat-Hungarians living in east
Slavonia, now part of Croatia, before war broke out in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula, Granic said
Croat-Hungarian refugees would return home as scheduled. The
Croatian government plans to resettle those who return before the
end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Granic and Kovacs also exchanged views on international issues
of common concern in their talks. They agreed their countries
still had good potential for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian enterprises are preparing to participate in the
Croatian construction, Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
The two also attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the
headquarters of the National Autonomous Government of Hungarian
Croats.
</P>
<P>
Granic said the protection of minority nationalities had played
an important role in Croatian-Hungarian relations. The two
countries' cooperation on this matter could serve as a model for
other East European nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Granic arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit at the
invitation of Kovacs.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Thailand on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Higher prices in both the food and
non-food sectors pushed inflation in Thailand in March to 9.5
percent compared with 4.5 percent a year earlier and 8.9 percent
in February, according to the Thai Commerce Ministry's Business
Economic Department.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the first quarter of this year was running at 9.1
percent compared with 4.1 percent in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The department now believes that inflation for the first six
months of this year will stand between 12.5 percent and 13.6
percent. It also forecasts a 12-month figure of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai consumers will likely see double-digit inflation in April
for the first time in years, Vithun Tulyanond, deputy
director-general of the department, was quoted Thursday by the
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said food and beverage prices rose 10.5 percent in the first
quarter, while non-food prices were up 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vithun said the price increases reflected rising production
</P>
<P>
 costs of consumer products, additional costs of fees, and the
increase in value-added tax to 10 percent from 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Buy British Submarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has decided
to purchase four British submarines, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to announce Thursday that it is buying
the four used diesel subs to replace Canada's three aging Oberon-class
ones.
</P>
<P>
The British Upholder-class subs were built in the early 1990s
and mothballed soon after their delivery since the British navy
decided on nuclear-powered ships.
</P>
<P>
The Upholders cost about 350 million U.S. dollars each to
build. The exact price and financing has not yet been made public.
</P>
<P>
Canada's current subs were built by the British in the
1960s. For years, Canada's navy has been petitioning for new subs
to replace the old ones.
</P>
<P>
With the purchase, Canada's navy will have subs that are
reportedly more quiet, faster, dive deeper and require smaller
crews than the Oberons.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Talks on Debt Settlement Close to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Indonesian and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials on private debt
settlement are close to final, an IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have not yet finished but we are satisfied with the
progress. I hope we can conclude it soon," IMF Director for Asia
Pacific Hubert Neiss said here Wednesday night after a meeting
with Indonesian officials.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said the outcome of the talks would be made known to the
public in time by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began their talks on March 18 on economic reforms
in Indonesia. The talks have focused on corporate debt, bank
restructuring, budget and subsidies, monetary policy and
structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The private debt is believed to be the most difficult issue in
their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December last year, Indonesia's foreign debt
totaled to 137.424 billion U.S. dollars, with government debt
worth 63.462 billion dollars and that from the private sector
amounting to 73,926 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government proposed to follow the "Mexican
Model" in settling the private sector debt and the IMF agreed in
principle.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has been under severe
pressure since July last year. It plunged to its lowest level of
17,000 to the U.S. dollar in January, compared to 2,450 in the
pre-crisis period.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah is trading at about 8,300 per dollar now.
</P>
<P>
This has caused most indebted companies to become technically
bankrupt as their foreign debt surpasses their equity.

<P>
KIEV, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine forces will take part in 99
varied activities of the Partnership for Peace of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) this year, including joint
maneuvers in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian army officer said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Dzyubak, deputy chief of the General Staff of the
Ukrainian Armed Forces, praised the Partnership for Peace as one
of the most effective mechanisms to boost trust and peace on the
continent, adding that maintaining regular and stable ties between
NATO members and partnership countries will contribute to state
security.
</P>
<P>
Dzyubak said all 16 NATO members and 28 partnership nations,
including Ukraine, will participate in the military alliance's two
maneuvers in Ukraine this year, which are code-named Peace Shield
and Sea Breeze.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine senior army officer also said 484 Ukrainian
soldiers are participating in United Nations (U.N.) peace-keeping
operations this year, and the U.N. Secretariat has already
earmarked 68 million U.S. dollars for the Ukrainian army.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership for Peace was created in 1994 to increase
military cooperation between the NATO members and former Warsaw
Pact countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also signed a partnership charter with NATO last July,
which proposed frequent political exchanges and increased military
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Clean-up Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Garbage like plastic-foam food
containers and bottles are a common sight on the waters of the
Yangtze River. But they are expected to disappear soon because of
a state regulation implemented to keep the country's longest river
from solid-waste contamination.
</P>
<P>
The regulation -- issued jointly by the Ministry of
Communication, Ministry of Construction and the National
Environmental Protection Agency -- became effective in March and
prohibits vessels on the Yangtze from dumping garbage into the
river.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also calls for a halt to dumping household
garbage and industrial waste along the banks of the river.
</P>
<P>
the Yangtze river used to be polluted with 30,000 tons of
refuse dumped by ships each year, in addition to more than 360
million tons of liquid containing fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
China has already taken steps to protect the Yangtze. One
measure called for barriers around the ports and harbors to block
the spread of fuel oil from wrecked ships.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of large ships for collecting waterborne refuse has
been patroling the river. These ships are also equipped with
wastewater treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
A group of mobile pollution-monitoring stations have been built
and will become operational before June to help environmental
protection authorities keep a close watch on the river's water
quality.
</P>
<P>
Growing importance has been given to increasing awareness of
the public on environmental protection. Many ships have special
personnel to publicize environmental protection laws and
regulations, and they are authorized to stop crew members and
passengers from dumping refuse into the water.

<HEADLINE> Canada Offers Financial aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada has offered to provide
Indonesia with financial aid totaling 1.6 trillion rupiah (about
200 million U.S. dollars) to help overcome the economic crisis and
natural disasters in the country, a senior Indonesian official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian aid outside the IMF (International Monetary Fund)
package would be a pure grant without any special conditions
attached and could be disbursed any time, Finance Minister Fuad
Bawazier said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The assistance could be used to finance small business
development programs, forest fire fighting, purchase of medical
supplies and wheat imports, said Bawazier after signing an
agreement on the avoidance of double taxation with Canadian State
Secretary of International financial Institute Jim Peterson,
official Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bawazier said the Canadian government had also offered
technical assistance to Indonesia in the financial sector
including insurance, pension funds and other economic
restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been badly hit by the monetary crisis since July
last year and the rupiah has depreciated by more than 70 percent
against the U.S. dollar. As a result of the crisis, the country is
now faced with spiralling inflation, growing unemployment and
other serious economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia signed an agreement with the IMF at the end of
October last year in exchange for a bailout package of more than
40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who arrived here on March 30 for a three-day visit,
said Wednesday that as a member of the IMF, Canada supports
Indonesia in its efforts to implement the reforms it has promised
to the IMF.

<P>
WARSAW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Poles in Warsaw, Krakow and other
cities have staged demonstrations against the country's entry into
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The protesters, mostly from the organizations such as "All
Poland Youth," the Party of Real Politics and the Polish National
Party, took to the streets as the government started formal
negotiations with the EU in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Waving banners, they shouted, "No Entry into EU," "No
Maastricht, Just Poland," "To Hell with the EU" and "Poland for
the Polish."
</P>
<P>
Maruisz Dzierzawsky, chairman of the Party of Real Politics,
said that they opposed Poland's subordination to the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU had been incapable of handling its own internal
affairs, was in stagnation, and all its commitments were frauds.
</P>
<P>
However, some Poles backed the government, organizing rallies
in support of an early entry.
</P>
<P>
Previous public opinion polls by newspapers showed that the
majority of Poles favored entry into the EU, with support at
higher than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
All the major parties in Poland unanimously agree with the
entry application. However, support has declined recently to 65
percent in the opinion polls.

<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy ended border controls with
France and Austria on midnight Tuesday in an expansion of a
European Union (EU) open-border pact.
</P>
<P>
Under the Schengen Accord, border controls between seven EU
states -- Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain -- were eliminated in March 1995. Italy and
Austria were the latest EU countries to become full members of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Grand ceremonies were held Wednesday morning at Ventimiglia on
the Italian-French border and Brennero on the Italian-Austrian
border to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano said at Brennero
that the elimination of border controls would further mutual
understanding and cooperation between member states and benefit
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He added that police in each country would tighten their
exterior borders to guard against illegal immigration and crime
from non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The Schengen Accord was signed in Luxembourg in 1985 to realize
free movement and promote free trade within the EU. The accord
took effect in 1995 but so far only nine members of the 15 EU
nations have implemented it.
</P>
<P>
Italy partially lifted border controls at some of its main
airports last October.

<HEADLINE> Second World Telecommunication Conference Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, Malta, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The second world
telecommunication development conference, attended by more than
1,600 delegates from 151 countries, ended here Wednesday with the
adoption of the Valletta Declaration and the Valletta Action Plan.
</P>
<P>
The most important decision made at the 12-day conference is to
set up two special groups to speed up the development of worldwide
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The research group for decision-making will work out
macro-policies that will include financing development and
coordinating ties between the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) and the telecommunication organization in every
country.
</P>
<P>
Another research group for technology support will study the
overall plan for the development of a worldwide telecommunication
net, the renewal of telecommunication equipment, and the exchange
of new technologies between the ITU and all countries.
</P>
<P>
During the ITU-sponsored conference, the participants presented
schemes for enhancing the development of telecommunications in
rural areas, establishing a fair, just and open mechanism of
competition, training personnel, absorbing private funds and the
investment of world financing organizations. The delegates also
reached consensus on reforming the ITU.
</P>
<P>
Formally founded in 1932, the ITU now has 188 member
nations. In 1947, the ITU became a special branch of the United
Nations. It held its first world telecommunication development
conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in March 1994.

ZHENGZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the first phase
of the Yellow River Grand View theme park in Zhengzhou, capital of
central China's Henan Province, is nearing completion. It is
scheduled to open for tourists in May.
</P>
<P>
The tourist project with Sino-Singapore financing, which will
be finished in three stages, was started in 1993. The total
planned investment for the Yellow River Grand View, covering an
area of 174 hectares, will be 80 million U.S. dollars, of which 18
million is being spent on the first phase.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, first-phase facilities include a
3.7-kilometer water course modeled after the Yellow River, a
30-meter tower, miniature scenes reflecting local customs and
folklore, an exhibition hall, a restaurant and a cinema.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Grand View has been listed by the China
National Tourism Administration and Henan Province as one of the
decade-long tourism development projects running from 1991 to 2000
as well as a key project for a projected Yellow River national
tourism program.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's peanut harvest

increased cultivation and favorable weather, authorities said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Cattle, Fishing and Food, the country's peanut harvest will reach
776,000 tons, up 177 percent over last year, while peanut exports
will be over 450,000 tons, making Argentina the world's largest
exporter of peanuts this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China, major peanut exporters last year,
have suffered reductions in their peanut harvests.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that peanut growing areas in Argentina have
been expanded from 329,000 to 407,000 hectares. The production per
hectare is expected to rise to 1,700 kilograms from 940 kilograms
because of more rain.

<P>
SOFIA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mikhailova said Tuesday that her country would qualify for entry
to the European Union (EU) by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova was speaking after a round of shuttle diplomacy to
promote EU membership for Bulgaria. She also attended a meeting in
Brussels during her visit on the expansion of the EU.
</P>
<P>
She said that Bulgaria's entry depended more on its domestic
reform process than on its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to her optimistic statement, however, the Economic
Institute of Bulgaria's Science Academy argued Bulgaria could only
qualify for membership after 2030.
</P>
<P>
A report by the institute said that based on the country's
gross domestic product alone, it will not be able to reach the EU
standards for at least 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria officially applied for EU membership in December
1995. But, because of a sluggish economy, it is believed to be far
from qualification standards for entry to the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north China
plans to eliminate industrial chimneys pouring out black smoke by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Chimneys churning out black smoke are major pollution sources
in urban areas. According to a survey, the province has more than
60,000 industrial chimneys which were mainly erected for boilers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996 the province has injected a large amount of funds
into renovating urban heating systems to cut the number of
chimneys. Chengde, a tourist city, introduced foreign funds to
renovate its urban heating system, taking the lead in eliminating
all chimneys pouring out black smoke.
</P>
<P>
The provincial city of Shijiazhuang has renovated more than
8,000 coal-burning facilities, demolished 134 boilers, pulled down
117 chimneys, and equipped 96 percent of the remaining ones to
filter out the pollution.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also publicized media telephone
numbers to encourage people to monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
After a two-year effort, 49,000 chimneys among the province's
60,000 have been examined and the province has decided to make 95
percent of the chimneys in urban and tourist areas meet state
discharge standards.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Measures to Ensure Safe Shellfish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt effective
measures to ensure safe shellfish on market, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Shellfish raising areas will be classified in three levels
according to their water environment quality and the standard of
hygiene of the shellfish.
</P>
<P>
Shellfish raised or fished in first-level areas can be sent
directly to the market and that in the second-level should be
purified before being put on the market.
</P>
<P>
The third-level areas, where water and shellfish are heavily
polluted, will not reach the State standard even after treatment
of the shellfish.
</P>
<P>
These areas which had been polluted and not improved for long
periods of time will be closed to raising or fishing of shellfish.
</P>
<P>
Fishing of shellfish from these areas which cause poisoning
will be treated as criminal violation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also ruled that people who raise shellfish
should hold licences.
</P>
<P>
China is a big shellfish producer. Shellfish production reached
8.9 million tons in 1996, accounting for 27 percent of the
country's total aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Delicious as seafood, shellfish is prone to pollution as its
habitats can be easily penetrated by chemical materials and
viruses.

<HEADLINE> China's County Makes a Name by Growing Vegetables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable-marketing agents from
across the country are increasingly traveling to Jingyang County
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The largest vegetable producer and distribution center in
northwest China, Jingyang grows vegetables on 10,000 hectares,
including greenhouses. Last year, it produced 500 million
kilograms of vegetables, earning local farmers an annual per
capita income of 700 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county had only several hundred hectares of vegetables
before 1992. Jiao Zhixue, a farmer turned entrepreneur, began the
effort by spending 100,000 yuan in one year to set up 17
greenhouses in Yunyang Township.
</P>
<P>
The next year, his company raised 15 million yuan to build
another 1,522 greenhouses in 40 villages, with farmers taking care
of vegetable production and sales by contracts.
</P>
<P>
The company formed a vegetable-growing technique association
with experts providing consultation services, and used 300,000
yuan to buy insurance policies for farmers to grow vegetables in
greenhouses. In addition, it also financed a vegetable wholesale
market in the township.
</P>
<P>
Growers tasted the sweet profits of greenhouse-farming and
intensified their efforts when they collected 120,000 yuan of
earnings per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The 10-hectare vegetable market does 800,000 kilograms of
vegetable business daily, or two million kilograms during busy
seasons. Now, 1,500 vehicles from the county are heading for all
parts of the country, carrying vegetables.

<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Faustino Asprilla was plunged into
the sea of sadness when club doctors on Wednesday warned him
against play for a month to heal the leg injury.
</P>
<P>
Officials failed to minute the extent of the injury, but the
Colombian striker has to take the time to nurse his severe thigh
strain since his transfer from Newcastle to Parma in January.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Asprilla suffered another minor knee injury to cast
clouds over his prospect for Colombia in the World Cup finals to
be kicked off on June 10.
</P>
<P>
A Parma official said that medical examinations indicated that
Asprilla's condition worsened after his tour with the Colombian
national team. Earlier, Parma opposed Asprilla's departure for the
tour.
</P>
<P>
Upon his back to the club, the Colombia striker was checked by
team doctors on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He will be sidelined for 40 days and will need more time to
get trained and regain form. His season with Parma is over," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, who has been troubled by injury time and again,
rejoined Parma on a 10 million U.S. dollars transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Newcastle in February 1996, he had played four
seasons with Parma scoring 25 goals in 84 league appearances.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
Wednesday reaffirmed China's determination to provide assistance
within its capacity to some Asian countries and pledged not to
devaluate China's currency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception hosted by China-Britain Trade Group in
central London, Premier Zhu said the Chinese people were
determined to share weal and woe with the Asian friends in such
difficult times.
</P>
<P>
He said although China's economic strength is still very
modest, the Chinese government has provided assistance to these
affected Asian economies within its capacity and made some
concrete contributions to the International Monetary Fund's
bail-out package.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese premier also made it clear that China
will not devaluate its currency because it was against traditional
Chinese values and the Chinese government did not wish to make the
financial crisis develop from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis is a bad thing, but if we could sum
up the experience and learn these historical lessons, it could be
turned into a good thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived in London on Tuesday for an official visit to
Britain, noted that "the financial crisis in Asia has not been
over yet, but the worst has already passed."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out he was confident that the economies of the Asian
countries will be able to recover in a fairly short period of time
and such an economic restructuring would certainly be helpful to
these countries.
</P>
<P>
Although China's commitment not to devaluate its currency has
created some difficulties to the Chinese economy, the Chinese
government was prepared to shoulder its responsibility and make
its sacrifice, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
While briefing China's efforts to reform its state enterprises,
Zhu said the Chinese government is resolving various problems of
its state enterprises with methods of Chinese style and such
reforms can be completed within three years.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu, who promised that China's reform policy remains
unchanged, invited British businessmen to invest in China and take
part in market competition there.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier's 45-minute speech received a warm welcome
by some 800 British businessmen and people from other sectors of
society.

development.
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the province to increase its GDP from the 1985

Government sources indicate that 80 key projects related to the
effort will involve total investments of 353.2 billion yuan.

difficulties involved in achieving significant increases in
consumption and foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Beijing To Host Household Appliances Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A major international exhibition
of electric appliances for household use is scheduled for April
14-17 at the China International World Trade Center in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, China
and elsewhere will participate in the show, which is held every
two years.
</P>
<P>
Demand for household electric appliances in China's domestic
market is expected to grow ten percent this year, with rural areas
being a major growth sector.
</P>
<P>
Studies have found that, over the next three years, at least 70
percent of urban households will get new color TVs, refrigerators,
and washing machines to replace old ones. In addition, some seven
million young people get married each year and want to furnish
their new homes with new electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
China's 900 million people living in rural areas, whose living
standards keep improving, are also a major guarantee of robust
growth in the industry, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Herbal Medicine Used To Treat Drug Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A treatment for drug addiction
made from traditional Chinese herbal medicines has been developed
in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The new medicine, for external use only, was developed by Dai
Qile, a doctor of the Miao nationality, who is an expert in
treating cancer and alimentary canal diseases.
</P>
<P>
Dai has discovered that some traditional Chinese herbal
medicines can decompose the toxicity of drugs such as heroin,
morphine, cocaine and hemp.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, drug addicts just need to put the pills on
their navel. There is no pain or side-effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai explained that, according to traditional Chinese medicine
and that of the Miao nationality, the navel is connected with
vital organs of the human body, and the effective elements of the
medicine can enter the body through the belly button.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that what is different from commonly used anti-drug
medicine is that the new treatment helps eliminate poison inside
the human body through the principle of neutralizing acid and
alkali and adjusting the functions of the alimentary canal.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Guizhou provincial health bureau said that all
indexes of the medicine are up to the standards set by the state
and the medicine is effective in easing toxicity caused by
morphine-related drugs.
</P>
<P>
Tests on animals also show that the medicine can ease drug
addiction caused by heroin with no new medical addiction.
</P>
<P>
Information coming from hospitals and anti-drug centers in the
United States, Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong shows that the
medicine is more effective in reducing drug addiction than
commonly used anti-drug medicine.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Embargo Resolution Denounced by Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua)-- Yugoslavia has denounced a
new U.N. Security Council resolution on arms embargo against it,
saying that supporters of the embargo were trying to break up the
country by encouraging separatists in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted 14-0 Tuesday with China abstaining in
the 15-member Council, was drafted by France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Portugal, Sweden, Britain and the United States. It was
designed to pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic into
concessions aimed at "substantial autonomy" for the majority
Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the vote, Yugoslavia's Ambassador Vladislav
Jovanovic rejected any involvement by the Council in what he said
were purely internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to the United States and Britain,
Jovanovic accused "some permanent members of the Security Council"
of encouraging Albanians who want to secede from Serbia, which
along with Montenegro forms the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"That policy will bring no good to their own countries, to
Europe, to the world," the Ambassador pointed out. "On the
contrary, it is counterproductive and dangerous to the legal
system of international relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that the goal of the Kosovo Albanians "is the secession
of this certain land from Serbia."
</P>
<P>
"Serbia cannot and will not allow it to happen under any
conditions," Jovanovic stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is regarded by Serbs as the cradle of their nation,
church and culture.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution requires all states, "for the
purpose of fostering peace and stability in Kosovo," to prevent
the sale or supply to Yugoslavia of arms and all types of related
material.
</P>
<P>
The embargo will be monitored by a sanctions committee made up
of all 15 Council members.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Senator Brian Harradine's declaration on
Wednesday that he would oppose a key component of the federal
government's bill on native titles, or aboriginal rights to claim
land in Australia, laid the foundations for Prime Minister John
Howard to call an early election on the issue of race.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian High Court, the nation's highest law body, has
asserted its power to strike down laws passed by the federal
parliament which may disadvantage a particular race, but has
failed to clarify whether the government's Wik bill, or the bill
on native titles, is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Hudson Conway, the senior company in Lloyd Williams'
embattled 1.3 billion U.S. dollar casino empire, Wednesday
foreshadowed a shake-up that would separate it from the empire and
probably from Williams.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan marked the first day of its Big Bang financial reforms
with more economic gloom, as its battered banking system revealed
a record 80 billion U.S. dollars in bad loan losses and a huge
property financier suddenly collapsed.

<P>
ROME, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Alessandro Del Piero scored a hat
trick including two penalties to pace Juventus for a 4-1 victory
over Monaco in the first leg semifinals of the European Champions
Cup in Turin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the Delle Alpi stadium, Juventus, winners two season ago,
marked its return to top form with goals through Del Piero and
midfielder Zinedine Zidane.
</P>
<P>
Juventus that lost the title match to Borussia Dortmund last
season, opened the account in the 34th minute when Del Piero hit
the target from a free kick which slipped off the fingertip of
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
First half injury time brought two more goals in the space of a
minute.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Francisco Da Costa fired a low shot from a corner
kick for the Monaco equalizer before Del Piero put Juventus ahead
again with a power shot from the spot.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero then scored his second penalty in the 62nd minute
after Monaco defender Muhammaed Konjik pulled down Filippo Inzaghi.
</P>
<P>
Zidane sealed the game with a brilliant strike three minutes
from the end.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Judge Dismisses Paula Jones Lawsuit Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge Wednesday threw
out Paula Jones' civil lawsuit against U.S. President Bill
Clinton, saying her evidence fell "far short" of proving sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
"While the court will certainly agree that plaintiffs'
allegations describe offensive conduct, the court... has found
that the governor's alleged conduct does not constitute sexual
assault," U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled in
Arkansas, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
"The plaintiffs' allegations fall far short of the rigorous
standards for establishing a claim of outrage under Arkansas law,"
she ruled in a 39 page decision.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is "pleased that he has received the
vindication he has long awaited," said his chief spokesman, Mike
McCurry, who was traveling with Clinton in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Rutherford Institute, which has been paying the legal costs
of Ms. Jones' suit against Clinton, said it will appeal this
decision.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jones has filed a lawsuit alleging Clinton made an
unwanted sexual advance in a Little Rock, Arkansas hotel room in
1991.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Clinton was Arkansas governor and Mrs. Jones was a
state worker. Clinton has repeatedly denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Assess Israeli Offer of Third Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is assessing
some progress in the Middle East peace process as a result of
Israel's offer of a third pullback on the West Bank, and pondering
how to capitalize on the unexpected gesture for a possible break
of the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, the
State Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, we are going to assess whether any of the modest
progress that Ambassador (Dennis) Ross detected is something we
should try to build on," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary (of State Madeleine) Albright will be consulting
with the president and other senior officials about that right
away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources have disclosed that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. special envoy Ross at the end of his
four-day round of shuttle diplomacy that the Israeli government
was willing to discuss with the Palestinians on a third pullback
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's offer to Ross prompted Albright to tell reporters
that "some progress" had been made for Ross's mediation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
But Albright also said the progress was not "nearly enough" to
end the deadlock, while Rubin said that "the peace process is
not on track, and the gaps have not been bridged."

<HEADLINE> Qatar Foreign Minister Sees Iran Shift on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani said Wednesday that he saw a changing
attitude of the Iranian government toward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can see some changes," he told reporters after
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Thani said the changes came as "the Iranians said that the
peace process is belonging to the people of Palestine and the
neighborhood with Israel, and if they accept something, it's their
own fate."
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a positive answer from the Iranians and I hope
this will be in practice their policy for the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thani said Qatar enjoyed good relations with Iran and wanted to
see U.S.-Iranian relations improve. But, in reply to a question,
he denied that he had brought any message from Iran to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Earlier before talks with Qatar's foreign minister, Albright
said she was pleased by the warm welcome Iranians gave to an
American wrestling team a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But she was cautious to say anything about policy changes from
Iran, reiterating that the United States would see actions, not
just listen to words, from the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
"We have spoken about the importance of actions as well as
words," she said.
</P>
<P>
In evaluating the Iranian government, Albright said, it is
"only prudent and responsible" for the United States to look for
changes in Iran's policies on terrorism, the Middle East and
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Owes U.N. 1.6 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States owes the
United Nations 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for past and current
membership dues as of March 15, according to the latest figures
released by the U.N. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its April 1998 Update of the U.N. Financial Crisis at a
Glance, the U.N. said U.S. back dues to the U.N. accounted for
over half of member states' total dues of 2.97 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The debt by the U.S. includes 671 million dollars for the
regular budget and 958 million dollars for peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
Non-payment of dues by members continues to create a bleak
financial picture for the U.N. So far only 46 of 185 member states
have paid in full their assessments.
</P>
<P>
Total dues consist of 1.7 billion dollars for peace-keeping, 1.2
billion dollars for the regular budget and 72 million dollars for
international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
"Our cash position is weak and getting weaker and our ability
to cross-borrow (from peace-keeping funds) is drying up," said
Joseph E. Connor, U.N. under-secretary-general for administration
and management.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. owed some 70 member states a total of 884 million
dollars for troops and equipment as the U.N. was unable to
reimburse them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has a zero-growth budget of 2.5 billion dollars for
1998-99 -- 1.25 billion dollars a year, down 100 million dollars
from 1994-95. Carrying out his reform program, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has cut about 1,000 posts.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and other countries pushed hard for these cuts, but
have not paid their share of the austerity budget they approved,"
the U.N. said in the Update published by its Department of Public
Information.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Reforms on Track: Wolfensohn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's reforms remained on
track despite the recent political shakeup and its economy should
grow between 1 and 2 percent in 1998, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn made the remarks at a U.S.-Russia Business Council
forum in Washington, which was also attended by several senior
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
"(Yeltsin) has not departed from his course," Wolfensohn said.
"I think the way we have to read this recent change is that we are
bringing in a group of younger technocrats who are going to get
the job done."
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the approach we are taking at the bank is to take
that at face value and move forward with it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said Russia's economy would be stronger but for the
economic crisis gripping Asia, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, senior U.S. officials praised Yeltsin's progress on
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"There have been important steps in the right direction in
recent months, in efforts to make budgeting more transparent, to
achieve much higher rates of tax collection and to advance the
enactment of a new tax code," said Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, Russia has weathered the recent storms well," said
Summers. He noted that the Russian authorities "have raised
interest rates not once but twice when that was necessary."
</P>
<P>
But Summers said Russia must step up its law enforcement to put
to rest fears of "gangster capitalism" and create the conditions
in which a market economy can thrive.
</P>
<P>
Russia needs to concentrate on collecting taxes, developing an
effective financial system and entrenching the rule of law,
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade David
Aaron said he thought the Russian economy was showing "greater
resilience than ever."
</P>
<P>
But he said Russia was not ready to join the World Trade
Organization and expressed disappointment with Moscow's latest
offer to enter the Geneva-based global trading body.
</P>
<P>
"It is a good step forward," Aaron told the business council.
"But it falls significantly short of the mark for what would be
necessary to actually enter the WTO."
</P>
<P>
The latest offer by Moscow left open a number of market access
issues, Aaron said. Tariffs were too high in many cases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been negotiating WTO entry for four years, but
Western diplomats say it must take significant steps to reform its
slow customs procedures, open its markets and cut import duties.
</P>
<P>
"Russia must learn the lessons of the Asia crisis. An
important reason for Asia's difficulties has been the closed
nature of many Asian markets," said Aaron.

</P>
<P>
Some 30 American instructors are training 400 Senegalese
soldiers for peacekeeping mission in the military base under the
U.S.-sponsored "African Crisis Reaction Initiative (ACRI),"
which is aimed at helping African countries build a peacekeeping
force of their own.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Malawi, Mali, Ghana and Ethiopia are also joining the
ACRI.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the goal of the United States is not to
"dominate the questions of security" in Africa, but to cooperate
with the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity,
France, Britain "to reinforce means to preserve peace" on the
black continent.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Tuesday evening on the last leg of his
six-nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
He will visit the well-known Goree Island off Dakar on
Thursday, which has become a symbol of black slave trade and
served for three centuries as a base for European slave traders to
sell Africans to America.
</P>
<P>
The most famous construction on the island is "the House of
Slaves," which was built in an elegant European colonial style in
the 18th century to jail like "cattles" slaves from across
Africa, before they were sent off on a "trip without return."
</P>
<P>
U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea
visited the island last year when they visited Senegal. They were
greatly saddened by what they saw.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Not to Further Cut Output Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will not consider to further cut output
by itself if non-OPEC producers reject to do so, OPEC's President
Obeid bin Saif Al Nasir said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This matter depends on consultations with other countries
outside OPEC," said Nasir, who is also Minister of Petroleum and
Mineral Resources of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"The Secretariat of OPEC is to make contacts with some
countries and member countries inside OPEC will also separately
contact with other producing countries outside OPEC," he said in a
statement published by the UAE's official Wam News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Nasir made the statement after returning from an OPEC
emergency meeting concluded in Austrian capital Vienna Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, described by Nasir as "good and creative,"
approved a cut of oil production by 1.25 million barrels per day
(bpd) starting from April 1 till the end of this year in a bid to
save the saggy market.
</P>
<P>
Other cuts will come from non-OPEC Norway, Mexico, Egypt, Oman
and Yemen, which have pledged to trim 270,000 bpd for a total of
1.5 million bpd in overall promised reduction.
</P>
<P>
Nasir said he hoped world oil prices will improve again "once
the markets feel the cuts."
</P>
<P>
World oil benchmark Brent crude slumped a dollar a barrel to
14 dollars in just 24 hours since Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the cuts were not enough to prop up sagging oil
prices, which have lost 40 percent in the past five months since
OPEC decided last November to raise its combined output ceiling by
10 percent to 27.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The price collapse was compounded by a mild winter in the
northern hemisphere, Iraq's return to oil markets and Asia's
economic turmoil which has seriously affected crude demand.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Greets Kocharyan as New President in Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States congratulated
Wednesday Robert Kocharyan on his election as president of Armenia
and wished him well in forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also expressed his hope
that Kocharyan would further implement economic and political
reforms and reach a political resolution to the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Central Elections Commission Wednesday declared
Kocharyan, Armenia's prime minister and acting president, the
winner of the former Soviet republic's presidential runoff
election Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington concurred with the conclusions of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
found that while in some areas the election fell short of OSCE
standards, this did not affect the outcome of the vote.
</P>
<P>
"We endorse the conclusions of the OSCE preliminary report
issued by (U.S.) Ambassador Sam Brown on April 1," Rubin said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
He urged the new Armenian government to take "immediate and
decisive steps" to eliminate the electoral violations and
irregularities which did occur.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Armenian authorities to investigate thoroughly
these reported abuses and take appropriate legal action against
those responsible," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Bill Demands Safe Gun Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Prompted by last week's
schoolyard slayings in Jonesboro, Arkansas of the United States, a
Senate bill proposed Wednesday would punish adults if children use
their guns to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan bill, introduced by Senators John Chafee, a
Republican, and his Democratic colleague Richard Durbin, would
require adults to install safety locks on their firearms or lock
them away altogether. Those who do not would face penalties of up
to a year in prison and fines of up to 10,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Durbin said, "It's a sad fact of life that some Americans are
more concerned about locking up their silverware than their guns.
Those who own guns must accept the responsibility of storing and
using them safely."
</P>
<P>
Fifteen states already have similar Child Access Prevention
laws on the books. But the House shot down a similar proposal. The
senators hope the recent tragedy will give their effort new
momentum.
</P>
<P>
Among the gun control advocates who joined the senators at
Wednesday's press conference was former White House press
secretary James Brady, who was shot and critically injured during
an assassination attempt on former President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
Brady called the number of firearm deaths and injuries to
American kids an "abomination."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 14 children a day are killed in gun-related
homicides, suicides or accidents.
