<HEADLINE> Chirac Warns U.S. of "Immediate Retaliation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today warned the United States of "immediate retaliation measures"
if French enterprises are touched by the d'Amato-Kennedy law.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's warning came as he was joining a meeting of the
cabinet, said government spokesman Alain Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
"If it appears that French enterprises are directly touched by
this kind of measure, France should then take immediate
retaliatory measures," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that under these circumstances, France and Europe
would "be endowed" with an adapted legislation, a mirror image of
the American, and would be able to summon an equally strong stand.
</P>
<P>
He said the French government was "particularly firm, in
liaison with our European partners, in respect of this unilateral
initiative of the United States."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato-Kennedy law on
Monday to reinforce embargoes against Iran and Libya by dissuading
foreign companies and individuals from investing heavily in the
oil industries of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Study: Parents, Peers Are Most Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A newly completed study
concludes that the more critical influence on teenagers'
performance in school is indeed their own parents and peers, The
New York Times said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year study surveyed 20,000 students in 9th and 12th
grade and their families for one to three years, which included a
broad cross section of white, black, Asians and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
Parents have become "seriously disconnected" from their
children's lives and teenager's friends have become largely
negative influences on their attitudes toward school, the paper
quoted an author of the study, Dr. Laurence Steinberg as saying.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that half of the students could bring home
grades of C or worse without upsetting their parents, one-third of
parents have no idea how their children were doing in school, 40%
percent parents never attended school programs, and one-third
students got through the day primarily by "goofing off with their
friends."
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that at least 1 in 4 parents were basically
passive, preoccupied or downright negligent of their children.
Only 1 in 3 students have daily conversations with their parents
and half the parents do not know their children's friends.
</P>
<P>
The study also suggested that peer groups often act as cement
shoes for students, with more than half students never talked
about schoolwork with their peers and crowd such as "partyers" and
"druggies" exist in many schools.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Powerful pull of their children's peers, Dr.
Steinberg argued that parents should not just give up at home or
depend solely on reformers' abilities to fix schools.
</P>
<P>
Parents' attending school programs and extra-curricular
activities was a more effective way to encourage students than
monitoring homework, the study said.

against Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
France has always opposed economic sanctions Washington imposed
on Iran in June 1995, and condemned the d'Amato law signed by

<HEADLINE> EU to Probe Milk Link with Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) scientific
veterinary committee is to examine later next month all available
evidence on whether BSE or mad cow disease can be transmitted
through milk, it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, announced
the decision in response to German calls for research into the
safety of milk following last week's disclosure by British
scientists that BSE can be transmitted from cows to their calves.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU Commission made it clear that there were no
known findings of BSE presence in milk and therefore it was taking
no action on milk at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that there were no plans to bring forward
the scientific veterinary committee meeting, scheduled for the
first week of September, but the veterinary experts would examine
the British evidence on transmission of BSE to calves and all
other evidence on BSE and milk to decide if any further research
was required.
</P>
<P>
The British government has earlier denied press reports saying
that British scientists were urgently conducting fresh research
into the safety of milk amid allegations that previous experiments
held to show milk can not be infected with BSE are unreliable and
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Agriculture Ministry called the
reports of experiments with milk "absolute rubbish, saying that
the ministry has never funded any studies to investigate whether
milk could transmit BSE to calves.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions Act Will Not Succeed, Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The latest U.S. attempt at
imposing economic sanctions against Iran and Libya by punishing
foreign companies will prove to be "highly ineffective" and "will
not succeed", according to local press here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed on Monday into law the "Iran
and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996", which will impose sanctions on
foreign firms that invest more than 40 million U.S. dollars a year
in Iran's and Libya's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Clinton has the option of denying foreign
businesses loans under the Export-Import Bank, banning their
imports, barring U.S. banks from making loans of more than 10
million U.S. dollars to uncooperative firms, and barring them from
bidding on U.S. government contracts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move has already aroused strong opposition from
Canada, the 15-nation European Union, Russia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
It "takes the U.S. further down the road of extraterritorial
application of its commercial law," said an editorial in today's
Financial Post.
</P>
<P>
"Not only is the extraterritorial aspect of the law offensive,
it likely will prove to be highly ineffective," the paper noted,
because many of U.S.'s major allies, such as Canada and the
European Union, will not join in the sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, there is an active attempt by many of the
industrial nations to pass their own legislation designed to
prevent domestic companies from complying with the terms of the
U.S. bill," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A sanctions policy, be it the Helms-Burton law or D'Amato act,
"has all the effect of blowing into wind" if it is not broadly
based and supported by major traders and investors, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
This latest U.S. act, as with the Helms-Burton legislation,
"undermines international trade agreements and antagonizes allies
while doing nothing to address the problem at which it is
supposedly aimed," commented an editorial in the Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The law, which "aims to lasso the rest of the world into the
U.S. embargo on oil coming from and technology going to those
countries", "will not succeed, as the U.S. State Department
knows," said the only national newspaper of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It will, however, greatly irritate friendly foreign
governments," the paper warned.
</P>
<P>
"Like Helms-Burton, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act deserves
to be expunged from the books come 1997, after the United States
gets over this latest case of pre-election syndrome," it noted.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Pakistanis Asked to Invest in Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of Pakistan has
encouraged the overseas Pakistanis to invest in their motherland,
an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international convention of overseas Pakistanis,
Secretary of the Board of Investment (BOI) Syed Mohibullah Shah
said the overseas Pakistanis should play a greater role in the
nation's development.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is capable of accommodating 5 billion dollar
investment annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the direct foreign investment in the country was 300
million dollars, which tripled to more than 1 billion dollars in
1996, Shah added.
</P>
<P>
The BOI will soon set up investment forums for overseas
Pakistanis in many cities, he said, adding that "we will also help
overseas Pakistanis find out joint venture partners."
</P>
<P>
He said the BOI recently started using the Internet to make
itself accessible to more than 300,000 investors, fund managers
and bankers.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to provide free of cost service to Pakistani
companies searching joint venture partners through the Internet,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the investors in Pakistan have the full repatriation to
take money back including the profit and capital, if they desired.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert on Universal Realization of Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese human rights expert Fan
Guoxiang stressed at an human rights forum here on Wednesday that
universal realization of human rights would not be accomplished
without taking into account the historical, cultural and religious
particularities of different nations and regions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ideas and contents of human rights and
their materialization have been developing in a long process of
human history.
</P>
<P>
"They are deeply rooted in and cannot be dissociated from the
social conditions and specific backgrounds of different eras,"
said Fan at the annual meeting of the UN Subcommission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, which
opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that human rights are universally
assimilated in all civilizations which identify, define and
explain the rights and duties of human beings in their own way.
</P>
<P>
He said that while rights of individuals are affirmed in the
Western world as the basis of human rights, "oriental tradition
tends to put more weight to personal commitment to the family, the
neighborhood, the community and the nation".
</P>
<P>
"The moral code of conduct leads to (oriental) people's
acceptance to the priority of social stability and public order,
which serve as the basis of economic prosperity and increasing
personal rights," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that western scholars are of the opinion that
democracy and political freedom would pave the way for economic
development, while experts from the developing countries points
out that economic progress and social harmony determine the
realizations of political and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
Fan pointed out that a few people aiming at other purposes than
the promotion of human rights have made use of a distorted
"universality" of human rights in order to impose on other
countries some self-claimed "universal standards" through
multilateral organizations.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the double standard practiced by a few
people in the field of human rights, and interference in other
countries' internal affairs under the pretext of defending human
rights.
</P>
<P>
"With a view to promote a genuine universal realization of
human rights, we do need a international democratic pluralism. We
want an impartial universality of human rights. We do not want a
disguised power politics covered with a cloak of human rights.
This is a matter needs to be seriously addressed by the
Subcommission, " Fan said.
</P>
<P>
The Subcommission, consisting of 26 experts, was established by
the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1946 to undertake studies and
to make recommendations concerning human rights issue. This year's
annual meeting will run for four weeks, concluding on August 30.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Criticizes Israel for Ignoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
criticized Israel today for offering to resume peace talks with
Syria while ignoring the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
"We all heard that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu
has sent an invitation to Syria, through the United States, to
resume negotiations," he said. "But he did not mention any formula
that indicates hopes in peace prospects."
</P>
<P>
"Any person who reads the invitation will not feel at all that
this invitation is a way to peace or that those who wrote it are
keen on peace," he told reporters following a meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian Mediterranean
port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Mubarak, Assad said that Syria
is ready to resume talks with Israel only on the basis of United
Nations Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Israel wants Syria to return to the peace
process "without any ground, without any basis for action."
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that this will lead to any result," he said at
the news conference broadcast live by the Egyptian television.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syria is committed to peace based on previous
agreements and resolutions and "commitments that were made in the
past five years."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak admitted at the news conference that there is a gap
between Syria and Israel on the basis of peace negotiations though
both sides are willing to resume their talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two sides would reach some sort of
compromise to resume their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The main difference between Syria and Israel is the return of
the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists on its return, while Netanyahu said after his
election in May that Israel hoped to reach a peace agreement with
Syria without returning the Golan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and Assad, which mainly dealt with
the Mideast peace process and bilateral relations, came amid hopes
that the Syrian-Israeli talks may be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the so-called "Lebanon first" proposal
put forward by Netanyahu, Assad said that it should be "Lebanon
and Syria, first and simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu's proposal, Israel will pull out its
troops from the Israeli self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in exchange for Syria's help in disarming the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah guerillas and ensuring security on Israel's northern
border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the proposal. During
their talks in Damascus Monday, Assad and Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on the peace moves with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Assad expressed hope that peace
would be achieved as soon as possible, adding that it would be for
all parties and not for one party in particular.
</P>
<P>
Both Mubarak and Assad stressed that all agreements Israel
signed with the Arabs including the Palestinians should be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the latest of a series of recent
consultations between Arab leaders to explore ways to revive the
stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Assad met with Jordan's King Hussein last Saturday and then
held talks Monday with Hrawi to coordinate their stances on the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979,
has been playing an active role in pushing forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Assad left Alexandria following the news conference, ending his
brief visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> France to Lay Off 6,500-7,000 Public Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France will lay off 6,500-7,000
public employees from the beginning of 1997 in several years in
accordance with a draft budget for 1997, said government spokesman
and Minister of Budget Alain Lamassoure today.
</P>
<P>
Government will end contracts with 5,000 primary and secondary
school teachers, but will create 2,700 jobs in higher educations,
said Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the lay-offs will save the government one billion
francs (200 million U.S. dollars). France now has 2.1 million
public employees.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting today, each minister was given a
"ceiling letter" fixing the limit of spendings for his or her
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Education said that this does not mean
the reduction of the 300,000 teaching jobs in public schools, but
is to "recall the teachers affected to other educational tasks in
the school circuit."
</P>
<P>
Lamassoure also said that the Ministry of Economy and Finance
will lay off 1,700 from a total of 170,000 of its employees. But
he did not reveal the number of lay-offs in other ministries.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 draft budget sharply contrasts with the 1996 budget
which created 1,334 jobs in public sector.

<HEADLINE> Hussein's Peace Initiative Welcomed by Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The latest peace initiative
made by Hussein Mohamed Aidid, son of Somalia's late warlord
General Mohamed Farah Aidid, was today welcomed by the North
Mogadishu faction leader, Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in northern Mogadishu today, Mahdi,
who is the old enemy of General Aidid, called for a national
reconciliation conference for all the Somali factions, saying he
would be happy if Hussein joins the reconciliation efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Hussein, who had been nominated by
the faction loyal to his late father to succeed the "presidential
post", should attend the peace talks as an ordinary man equal to
the other faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi, together with his ally Osman Atto who was General
Aidid's former financier but turned his back against Aidid later,
had offered ceasefire immediately after Aidid's death on August
1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"But Aidid's faction did not respond to our offer as we
expected. Instead, they nominated Hussein Aidid for the post of
his late father," said Mahdi, calling it as "a major setback" to
the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Hussein personally," said Mahdi, who denied the
presidential title for Hussein but recognized him as a faction
leader.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the ceasefire proposed by Mahdi and Atto was
"unilateral", Mahdi said: "The ceasefire will hold only when
Hussein's faction pull out all their forces from the new
positions they occupied in Medina region."
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise the ceasefire will not work," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who succeeded his father after the hardline general
died of gunshots, has shifted his stance by agreeing to hold
peace talks with other faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his first press conference held in his residence near the
former presidential palace on Tuesday, Hussein said he has "no
objection" to meeting all his opponents if they are willing to
work with him in bringing a lasting peace to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is making peace throughout the country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Without specifically mentioning Atto or Mahdi, Hussein said he
will talk to "any Somali leader".
</P>
<P>
"I will reconcile with the opposition factions according to
the Somali style since they are Somalis," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent unilateral ceasefire proposal made by the
enemies of his late father, Hussein said: "I see it as a positive
step. But they should be honest about it."

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Gunmen Kill Three in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- As a latest sign that Islamic
fundamentalist militants may intensify their violent campaign
against the government after a lull in their attacks, unidentified
gunmen killed two policemen and a farmer today in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire at the three and killed them near Abu
Qorqas, a town in el-Minya province some 220 kilometers south of
Cairo, an Interior Ministry source was quoted by the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency (MENA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three victims were walking when they were attacked, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
The assailants were believed to be Moslem fundamentalist
militants who have carried out many terrorist attacks, mainly
targeting policemen, Copts and tourists, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident came just two days after unidentified gunmen
robbed a bank and killed two people Monday in Aiyat, some 50
kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Moslem militants had carried out similar robberies before to
gain money to finance their activities against the government in
an attempt to install strict Islamic rule in Egypt.

MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia welcomed its athletes home
as heroes on Tuesday after attending the Atlanta Olympic Games.

President Boris Yeltsin, in an official statement quoted by
Interfax news agency, said the team, which won 26 gold medals to
the United States' 44, had "upheld the nation's glorious sporting

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was not among officials who welcomed team members in a
low-key ceremony at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.
</P>

Russia's performance in team events in Atlanta was
disappointing compared to individual successes.

Leading sports daily Sport Express gave the fortnight in

A banner claiming "to us you are all worth gold" caught the

<HEADLINE> Radish Sprouts Probed as Cause of Japan's Food Poison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Health Minister Naoto Kan
said today that radish sprouts in school lunches were probably the
cause of series of food poisoning incidents that has sickened
6,309 school children in the country.
</P>
<P>
The radish sprouts became suspect of ill-making food after an
investigation eliminated most other potential infection sources on
the menus in different school districts served on days the deadly
E. coli O-157 bacteria apparently broke out, Kan told the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kan said traces of the bacteria were not found in samples of
sprouts at the grower that provided them to the schools, but the
possibility of infection of the bacteria cannot be ruled out by
way of epidemiological studies.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of E. coli O-157 bacteria, whose symptoms include
stomach pains, bloody diarrhea and kidney failure, has hit Japan
nationwide, killing seven people and sickening more than 9,000.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Authorities had suspected that school lunches were
the cause of the outbreak in Sakai, 480 kilometers (300 miles)
west of Tokyo, the hardest hit city. But they had not been able
to pinpoint the specific food after hundreds of tests on food
samples.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Estimates Latest Flooding Loss at $1.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) said the latest flooding has caused 1.7
billion U.S. dollars loss to the country.
</P>
<P>
Calling it the "biggest floods" in a hundred years, a spokesman
for the Foreign Ministry said here today that the natural disaster
hit 117 cities and counties of eight provinces in late July.
</P>
<P>
It has "a serious impact on the livelihood of the people and
the development of the national economy and, especially, cause a
temporary food problem," the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The economic losses caused by floods are enormous," he
acknowledged, adding that the country needed humanitarian
assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the flooding in August 1995 caused
a damage of 15 billion U.S. dollars, reduced the national output
of paddy rice and maize by more than two million tons and washed
away about a million tons of rice in stock.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he said, another hailstorm devastated 170,000
hectares of arable land and entailed the loss of more than one
million tons of grain in North and South Hwanghae Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed gratitude to the relief materials
offered by the different countries in the world, international
organizations, public organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"We need humanitarian assistance from the international
community," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged To Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The twelve-month inflation rate
targeted by the British government remained a little under 3
percent in the second quarter of this year and it had to raise
interest rates soon to keep inflation in check, the Bank of
England said.
</P>
<P>
Failing to raise interest rates could lead to them going much
higher later on, the Bank warned in its August Inflation Report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's inflation has been much lower over the past three
years than its average over the past 30 years of 8 percent. But
this has been against a background of low inflation in most other
industrialized countries too. Such international comparisons show
the Britain's recent performance to be less remarkable.
</P>
<P>
It was unlikely the British government would meet its 2.5
percent inflation target in two years time, the report said. The
Bank's view on inflation two years ahead showed a central
projection for inflation a little above 2.5 percent and rising,
with the risks more on the upside than the downside.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke ignored the Bank's advice in June
when he cut the basic bank borrow rate by 0.25 percent to 5.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
Treasury minister Michael Jack played down apparent
differences between the Chancellor and the Bank of England on
economic strategies. As the Bank urged an early interest rate rise
to keep inflation in check, the minister said at an interview that
"there is no disagreement on inflation targets".
</P>
<P>
Business circles have urged the Chancellor to resist calls to
raise interest rates. The British Chambers of Commerce said firms
desperately needed stability and did not see a need for an
interest rates increase.
</P>
<P>
While the Confederation of British Industry said it was not
looking for the sort of "pre-emptive" increase suggested by the
Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
Economic Consultants Business Strategies said an early rise
would be unwise. Firms "are taking a long-term view", said
director Richard Holt.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister to Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is to meet Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat soon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a spokesman for Mordechai in an interview
with a Palestinian reporter, though he declined to elaborate on
details.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said that Mordechai would tour the
volatile West Bank town of Hebron next week to prepare a plan on
Israeli forces' redeployment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This signaled that Mordechai would possibly focus his talks
with Arafat on the pullback from Hebron, a major dispute between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
If Mordechai and Arafat actually meet, it would be of high
importance to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been
frozen since the Israeli elections in May.
</P>
<P>
It will also be the second high-level meeting between the PNA
and the Israeli new government since it took power in June.
</P>
<P>
On July 23, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy held the first
official meeting with Arafat, during which both of them stressed
the continuation of Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, where about 400 Jewish settlers live among 120,000
Palestinians, is a major obstacle blocking progress of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israeli forces should have
redeployed from 80 percent of Hebron by late March. But former
Labor-led Israeli government froze the pullback after four suicide
bombing attacks killed 58 people inside Israel from late February
to early March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli hardline Likud-led government has promised to honor
the Oslo agreements by implementing the redeployment, but it has
not formalized a time table.
</P>
<P>
At the meantime, it demanded PNA's fulfilment of its
commitment to combat terrorism, saying some amendments had to be
made in order to protect security of the Jewish settlers.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urged To Address Land Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government was
urged to make urgent policy changes to address land degradation
in the country, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a survey report released in the capital Windhoek, the
Namibian Program to Combat Desertification (NAPCOD) said:
"Radical changes in government policy are urgently needed to
address the immediate and ultimate causes of desertification and
to ensure sustainable resource utilization."
</P>
<P>
The NAPCOD, which was financially assisted by the German Aid
Agency, is a joint initiative by the Desert Research Foundation
of Namibia, Ministry of Environment and Tourism and Ministry of
Agriculture, Water and Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
Although much is being done, there is still no point in giving
farmers or water users new information, technology or skills if
policies and prices continue to encourage overuse, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Among other recommendations, the report said there is a close
link between land degradation and economic incentives provided by
government policies.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said today that he is optimistic
that the wrangling poltical parties in Zanzibar would find a
common stand and bring an end to the political stalemate in the
Isles.
</P>
<P>
Addresing a press conference at the International information
Centre here this afternoon, Chief Anyaoku said he had held
extensive discussions with both Zanzibar President Salmin Amour
and leader of the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) Seif
Shariff Hamad. And he was hopeful that a new chapter of
co-operation between the two parties would be opened.
</P>
<P>
"After extensive discussions with President Amour and Hamada,
I leave Dar es Salaam very hopeful that a new page of
co-operation in the politics of Zanzibar will soon be opened," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Asked what made him so optimistic about the Zanzibar political
crisis, Chief Anyaoku, who just ended his visit to Zanzibar, said
the leadership of both parties had made him believe that a new
chapter of co-operation would be achieved.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say under what mechanism that co-operation is
going to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) has denied that
there is a poltical crisis in the Isles where the CUF has been
boycotting the House of representatives sessions since last
October general elections. The CUF has refused the results of
presidential election, accusing that the election has been
"rigged". It has also been accusing the government of human
rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku will leave here later today for London after his
six-day visit of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> French Government Adopts Austerity Budget for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- French government today adopted an
austerity budget for 1997 by annoucing a tight control of public
spendings and a reduction of taxes from 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting chaired by President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, each minister was given a "ceiling
letter" on the limit of spendings by his or her ministry in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget required government bodies not to spend more
in 1997 than it does in 1996, which is estimated at around 1,552
billion francs (310 billion U.S. dollars), with a variance of 3-4
billion francs.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman and Minister of Budget Alain Lamassoure
said that the objective of fixing spendings in 1997 to the amount
of the current budget has been attained. "It is an effort of
reducing expenditure without precedent which represents a saving
of 60 billion francs (12 billion U.S. dollars)," said Lamassoure.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, government budgets have been growing
by 4-5 percent annually in France.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Le Monde said that considering the 1.6-1.7
percent inflation in the country, the government budget value will
stagnate, if not drop, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Economy and Finances Jean Arthuis said today
that the public deficit in 1996 will not be more than 4 percent of
the Gross National Product, and that in 1997 not more than 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that from 1997, the cuts of taxes "would be visible"
and that the government is working on a five-year plan of cutting
taxes which will be submitted to the parliament in autumn.
</P>
<P>
Taxes increased by 120 billion francs (24 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1996 in France and the government will reduce taxes by 20
billion francs (4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, according to Le
Monde quoting official sources.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Returns Home After Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
returned here this evening from Alexandria, Egypt where he met and
held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the talks, the two leaders
discussed the the new Israeli initiatives to revitalize the peace
process, the issue of terrorism and the relations between Syria
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Assad said at a joint press conference with Mubarak in
Alexandria that he sees no "glimpse of hope" for peace in new
Israeli initiatives because Israel still rejects the
land-for-peace principle, according to reports reaching here from
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"We all heard that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu
has sent an invitation to Syria, through the United States, to
resume negotiations," he said. "But he did not mention any formula
that indicates hopes in peace prospects."
</P>
<P>
Assad said that Syria is ready to resume talks with Israel only
on the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions and
the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Israel wants Syria to return to the peace
process "without any ground, without any basis for action."
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that this will lead to any result," the reports
quoted him as saying at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Assad added that Syria is committed to peace based on previous
agreements and resolutions and "commitments that were made in the
past five years."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, on his part, admitted at the news conference that
there is a gap between Syria and Israel on the basis of peace
negotiations though both sides are willing to resume their talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two sides would reach some sort of
compromise to resume their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The main difference between Syria and Israel is the return of
the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists on its return, while Netanyahu said after his
election in May that Israel hoped to reach a peace agreement with
Syria without returning the Golan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and Assad came amid hopes
that the Syrian-Israeli talks may be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the so-called "Lebanon first" proposal
put forward by Netanyahu, Assad said that it should be "Lebanon
and Syria, first and simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
According to Netanyahu's proposal, Israel will pull out its
troops from the Israeli self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in exchange for Syria's help in disarming the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah guerillas and ensuring security on Israel's northern
border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the proposal. During
their talks in Damascus Monday, Assad and Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi agreed to adopt a common stand on the peace moves with
Israel.

UNITED STATES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
approved a set of monitoring procedures for implementing the
"oil-for-food" agreement between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright announced the decision on
Wednesday by saying that the U.S. government "has prepared to move
ahead on (Security Council resolution )986 and that they would
meet the members of the U.N. Iraq sanctions committee in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
All 14 other members of the Security Council's sanctions
committee had previously given their consent of the procedures.
But the U.S. delegation has been withholding their consent for
some undeclared difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to assure ourselves is that all the procedures
that go along with this are appropriate and we will make sure that
they are carried out very vigorously, because the point here is to
get the assistance to the right people and not in any way to
abrogate the sanctions regime," she said.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that U.S. had had difficulties with some technical
issues, but up to now most of them had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some few technical issues that need to be
really carried out totally, but they do not impose any
conditions," she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army to Discipline "Wandering" Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army has intensified
efforts to enforce discipline among its soldiers by ensuring
prompt arrest of soldiers found "wandering" during official
hours.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers, specially detailed for the task, were observed today
in Lagos, challenging army personnel seen attempting to join
buses at race course during office hours, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The efforts are also being enforced at different parts of the
metropolis, following the determination of the army authorities
to curb the menace of off-duty soldiers who smeared the force by
extorting money from motorists.
</P>
<P>
According to Director of Army Public Relations Felix Chukwuma,
the army authorities remained undaunted in their effort to stop
the misbehavior of some soldiers in the public.
</P>
<P>
The army military police are up to the task and have been
working hard to ensure that such soldiers were promptly
apprehended, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests US Fighters' Violation of Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran today lodged a protest
against U.S. fighters' violation of its airspace, particularly in
Bushehr where Iran is building a nuclear power plant with Russia's
help.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA published the protest letter
delivered by Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's permanent representative to
the United Nations to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities said in the letter that American
fighters violated Iran's airspace for three times in a single day
on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Iran listed the violations as follows:
</P>
<P>
On August 3, at 17:45 hours, an American fighter violated the
Iranian airspace in Bushehr and broke the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
At 23:00 hours the same day, an American fighter flying from
west to east violated the Iranian airspace over Abu Musa island.
</P>
<P>
Also on August 3, at 23:30 hours, more than 20 American F-14
and F-15 fighters were observed flying 30 miles south of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the announcement of the airspace
violation by large number of American fighters indicates that the
situation in the Gulf is very delicate and tense.
</P>
<P>
They said that the tense situation and higher alert of the
military forces of the United States and Iran might lead to some
kind of confrontation or conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since the visit of U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry in
the Gulf, the American forces in the Gulf have been on
highest state of alert and Perry even instructed commanders to
prepare for an "imminent" attack.
</P>
<P>
There are about 15,000 American troops stationed in the Gulf,
including 6,200 in Saudi Arabia, an armored battalion in Kuwait an
the rest aboard warships.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities are feeling in a great danger while the
American forces are threatening to launch a military attack.
</P>
<P>
Specialist analyzed that if the United States decides to
launch military attack against Iran, there will be three main
targets.
</P>
<P>
The first target will be the Bushehr Nuclear Power plant in the
Gulf because the United States and Israel are accusing Iran of
developing mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
The other two targets would be training camps -- one in
northern Tehran and the other near the religious city of Qum, 156
kilometers south of the capital city of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran strongly rejected the existence of any terrorist
training camp inside the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has already appealed
to the United Nations for necessary measures to stop any
military attacks by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Libya Condemns Tougher U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Libya today condemned tougher
U.S. sanctions against it, saying that it was prompted by the
forthcoming presidential elections in November, according to
Libya's official news agency JANA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, accusing Libya and Iran of
sponsoring international terrorism, signed a bill into law Monday
to punish non-American companies investing more than 40 million
U.S. dollars in Libya and Iran's oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
"The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and
International Cooperation is aware of the real reasons behind
issuing such legislation. These include the pressures of the
electoral campaign on the American president," JANA quoted a
statement by the Libyan Foreign Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the bill contradicts with international laws,
especially the U.N. charter which prevents using the economic
sanction as a way to realize political aims, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Libya has repeatedly made its assurance that it
condemns terrorism in all its forms and is willing to cooperate
with the international community to fight against it.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the United States has tried "to impose
political and economic hegemony over the countries of the area and
exerts pressure on those who do not comply with their aims through
threats and the imposition of sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to toughen the sanctions has also drawn sharp
criticism from Iran as well as some European countries which
believed that the American move went against the principles of the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, in his official reaction to
the American legislation, said that the United States is trying to
destroy Iran and change its Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a French Ministry spokesman said that the American
action would "create a particularly dangerous precedent for the
security and the development of commerce."

ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Serbia and Croatia issued tonight
a joint communique in Belgrade following the end of the talks in
Athens between the presidents of the two countries Slobodan
Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two presidents expressed their readiness
to proceed to the full normalization, restoration and development
of relations, based on mutual respect of their independence and
sovereignty, in accordance with the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also undertake to promote a climate of mutual
confidence, to work for peace, stability and development in the
region, to create the appropriate conditions for the free and safe
return of all refugees to their homes, the ascertainment of the
fate of missing persons and the return of properties or the
granting of the appropriate compensation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stated their readiness to continue talks on the
outstanding issue of the Prevlaka Peninsula, and said they will
respect the security of the region, where there are U.N. observers
at present.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expressed their support for the
implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ex-IM Bank Insures $595 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Ex-Im Bank) today announced the approval of export
credit insurance for General Electric Corp.(GE), covering 595.5
million U.S. dollars of power equipment sale to Saudi Arabia over
five years.
</P>
<P>
The policy, one of the largest ever issued by the Bank, will
cover a maximum of 155 million dollars at any one time.
</P>
<P>
The transaction will help sustain GE jobs through the
manufacture of 16 gas turbines, four steam turbines and 20
generators. The equipment will make up four gas-turbine
combined-cycle power plants for the world's largest oil-producing
country.
</P>
<P>
The Bank offered to provide this limited political risk
insurance because the GE transaction did not fit into the Bank's
loan and guarantee structure for Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Usually, this type of single-buyer policy covers short-term
repayments against political and commercial risks for shipments
made over a one-year period. It is the first time Ex-Im Bank has
offered a policy for a multi-year contract. But the cover will be
limited to only two types of political risk, political violence
and export or import restrictions, and commercial risks of default
will not be included.
</P>
<P>
Ex-Im Bank is an independent government agency which finances
and promotes the sale of U.S. goods and services abroad.

JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) --South African President
Nelson Mandela today received four Olympic medalists at his
official Pretoria residence, saying they helped to put the country
back on the world sports map.
</P>
<P>
The four medalists, double gold medalist Penny Heyns (women's
100m and 200m breaststroke), men's marathon winner Josiah
Thugwane, men's 800m silver winner Hezekiel Sepeng and women's
100m backstroke bronzer medalist Marianne Kriel, dedicated their
medals to the president, saying he was worth his weight in gold,
silver and bronze.
</P>
<P>
In a letter presented to Mandela, the four said Mandela's
outstanding leadership had helped them achieve their goals in the
centennial Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"The support of all South Africans made us proud to, for the
first time, compete under a united flag and a united national
anthem," said the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela said he was confident South African
athletes will perform even better at the next Olympic Games in

<HEADLINE> Meteorite May Show Mars Once Had Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientist studying a meteorite
that fell to Earth from Mars have found organic compounds and
certain minerals that they claimed as evidence for early life on
Mars.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, discussed Wednesday by researchers of NASA and
three universities at a new conference at NASA headquarters here,
hailed startling and compelling evidence that microbial life
existed on Mars long ago, but many scientists remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have found quite reasonable evidence of past
life on Mars," David McKay, a Johnson Space Center planetary
scientist who led a 15-member team and first author of "Search for
Past Life on Mars" in the August 16 issue of Science, said today.
"We don't claim that we have conclusively proven it."
</P>
<P>
The research is based on an examination of an ancient Martian
meteorite Allan Hills 84001, one of only 12 meteorites identified
as having come from Mars. The meteorite is the oldest of the
Martian dozen, having crystalized from molten rock about 4.5
billion years ago, knocking from Mars 15 million years ago and
landing on Antarctic ice sheet some 13,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft of the Science paper, Dr. Mckay and his
team identified the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), the
minerals magnetite and iron sulfide on the meteorite. Such
phenomenon are associated with coal and diesel exhaust or
bacterial action on Earth. They also found some carbonate globules
that are similar in textures to materials produced by bacteria in
groundwater on Earth.
</P>
<P>
"When considered collectively... we conclude that these
phenomena are evidence for primitive life on early Mars."
researchers write in their Science paper.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Goldin, NASA Administrator, commented Tuesday that "the
evidence is exiting, even compelling, but not conclusive. It is a
discovery that demands further scientific investigation."
</P>
<P>
"NASA is ready to assist the process of rigorous scientific
investigation and lively scientific debate that will follow the
discovery," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, several experts, some of whom have spent their
professional lives looking for life beyond Earth and speculating
about its existence, scoffed at the claim and said the evidence
would have to be much stronger to be credible.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion is at best premature and more probably
wrong," said John F. Kerridge, a planetary scientist at the
University of California, San Diego. "You should not go public
with evidence that's less than 100 percent sure. This is much less
than 100 percent sure."
</P>
<P>
Carl Sagan, a leading authority on the search for
extraterrestrial life, called the findings "evocative and very
exciting." But he said the organic chemicals reported in the
study "are not evidence of life."
</P>
<P>
"If that's the evidence, I don't believe it," said Jack D.
Farmer, a scientist at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
Calif., who specializes the study of paleobiology.
</P>
<P>
Conjecture about life on Mars dates from the 1700s, when
observers discovered the red planet had seasons, like the Earth.
In 1878, an Italian observer erroneously reported there were
canals on Mars, leading to speculation about intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a lively Mars dimmed in the mid-1960s when U.S.
Mariner spacecraft flew past and sent back pictures of a
forbidding wasteland. In 1976, Vikings 1 and 2 put landers on
Mars, but soil sampling by the robot craft detected no organic
compounds.

MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's largest opposition
movement, the People's Patriotic Union of Russia (NPSR), elected
its governing bodies and endorsed the charter at its founding
congress today.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Coordinating Council, which will have over
150 members, the congress elected a 21-member presidium
including five co-chairmen -- Mikhail Lapshin, head of the
Agrarian Party, Academician Alexei Podberyozkin, regional
communist leader Aman Tuleyev, former Russian vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi and film director Stanislav Govorukhin.
</P>
<P>
Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who was
elected chairman of the Coordinating Council and head of the NPSR,
said the congress was held in a "working and friendly atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Ex-Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who was elected
chairman of the executive committee of the Coordinating Council,
expressed the confidence that the union will not repeat the sad
example of other opposition organizations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NPSR and the party in power will become
Russia's two leading political forces. Experts here believe that
the new opposition movement will be, above all, an instrument of
the opposition's struggle for power.

<HEADLINE> French Franc Continues to Drop Against Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (xinhua) -- The French franc continued to drop
against the Deutsch mark today, breaking the floor of 3.41 francs
for one mark to 3.4120 francs for one mark.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest point the franc has fallen to since the end
of March, which is attributed by local media to the uncertainty
around the government budget plan and social situation in France.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Patrick Mange of the Deutsche
Bank as saying that the markets have launched attacks against the
franc while excusing themselves by saying that the French
government is not able to make an austerity budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The French government adopted a draft budget for 1997 by
announcing tight public spendings controls and fixing public
deficit below 3 percent of the GNP, as is required by the European
Monetary Union for its entry. But this did not seem to be able to
stop the speculation of the franc.
</P>
<P>
This is putting into doubt the realization of the European
Economic and Monetary Union, because whether France can enter the
monetary union by January 1, 1999, depend on the fate of the
austerity budget, said Mange.
</P>
<P>
Besides this, the danger of new strikes in September by public
employees protesting government lay-offs helps darken the prospect
of the franc, said AFP.

</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Chechen rebels, headed by Shamil Basayev who led
the hostage-taking raid on the southern Russian town of
Budyonnovsk in June 1995, launched their biggest offensive in
months Tuesday, seizing several key points in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day fighting, some 30 Russian servicemen were

NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A technical error of America
Online (AOL), the largest Internet access provider in the U.S.,
left 6 million online users off-line today, cutting them off from
e-mail, chat rooms and the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
The system went down at 4 a.m. of eastern time during a
scheduled maintenance update, routine work that is generally done
at that hour to affect the fewest possible members. It was still
down 12 hours later, making it one of the worst outages in online
history in terms of length and number of people affected.
</P>
<P>
AOL hoped to have the system back up later today, according to
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
When America Online users tried to log in, they were greeted by
a message saying "Good-bye from America Online! The system is
temporarily unavailable. Please try again in 1 hour. Thank you for
calling."
</P>
<P>
AOL Chairman Steve Case said every possible resource was being
brought to restore the service.
</P>
<P>
"We regret any inconvenience this may have caused our
customers. We will work to ensure that the problem does not
recur," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Economy Slowing on Its Own, Fed Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported here today that the U.S. economy was still growing at
mid-summer but may be slowing down on its own.
</P>
<P>
In a latest survey of regional business conditions by its 12
regional districts, the Fed said that "the economy continued to
expand in June and July, though in some areas the pace of growth
has moderated since the last report."
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, conducted before July 30, also found few signs
of price pressures, saying the cost of raw materials and finished
goods was "essentially flat."
</P>
<P>
The survey, known as the beige book, will be used by the
Federal Open Market Committee, Fed's policy-maker, at its meeting
on August 20 to consider monetary policy. The panel is composed of
the seven Fed governors and presidents of the 12 regional banks.
</P>

"Retail sales softened in most districts, though sales were
generally up from a year ago," the survey found. "Demand for
non-auto big-ticket durables -- such as home furnishings,
appliances and electronics -- was particularly soft" in more than
half of the districts.
</P>
<P>
The survey said manufacturing continued to expand and housing
markets remained "fairly strong" in most districts and commercial
real estate continued to firm in almost all districts.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were some scattered reports of rising
commodity costs, but said most districts reported that prices for
raw materials and both finished and unfinished goods were "on
balance, flat."
</P>
<P>
"Labor markets remain tight, but there has been no widespread
increase in wage pressures," it said.
</P>
<P>
The findings are consistent with other recent data that the
economy continues to grow while the pace of expansion will slow
down.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in
the second quarter following an increase of 2 percent in the first
three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed cut short-term interest rates for three times between
July of 1995 and last January to spur the slowing economy and
kept the rates unchanged since last February.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Urged to Speed Up Chemical Weapons Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Director of Arms Control
and Disarmament John Holum today urged the Republican-controlled
Congress to speed up the procedure for the ratification of the
global chemical weapons treaty.
</P>
<P>
Signed in January 1993, the Chemical Weapons Convention has not
yet come into effect because only 60 of the required 65 countries
have so far ratified it. Among those yet to do so are the United
States and Russia, the world's two leading chemical weapons
powers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about the convention, Holum said that
Russia, which is concerned about the cost of disposing large
quantities of chemical weapons inherited from the former Soviet
Union, had indicated recently that it would move "promptly" to
ratify the convention.
</P>
<P>
"I'm hopeful that they'll move in the same time-frame that we
will," Holum said. "I'm also absolutely convinced that our
ratification will help accelerate their ratification."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "total nonsense" claims by U.S. Senate
opponents of the convention that up to 8,000 U.S. companies would
be affected by implementing it.
</P>
<P>
Holum said that the true figure was about 140 firms.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Anti-Apartheid Veterans To Get Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's liberation
struggle veterans who fought apartheid for at least 25 years
could get an annual penion of 84,000 Rand (about 19,535 U.S.Dollars)
if they are at the age of 65 or older in accordance with the special
pension bill approved by the cabinet today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria after the cabinet meeting,
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the pension scheme would cost
270 million Rand (about 62.8 million U.S.Dollars) in its first
year and rise to 625 million Rand (about 145 million U.S.Dollars)
after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the cabinet resolved outstanding issues
around the plan, and legislation to put it into practice would go
ahead, said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
The pension would be lifelong one.
</P>
<P>
The plan is in compliance with a constitutional section, which
provides for an act of parliament to ensure that pensions be
given to individuals, or their dependants who had made sacrifices
in the establishment of democarcy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said those qualifying for such pension should be
definded in the act, as well as the conditions under which the
pensions would be granted.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the Act, those 45 and 65 would get 12,000 Rand a
year, plus 1,200 Rand for each year of service exceeding five
years but less than or equal to 20 years, with a maximum total
pension of 30,000 Rand.
</P>
<P>
While those between the ages of 35 and 45 would receive 6,000
Rand a year, with an extra 1,200 Rand for each year of service
exceeding five years but less than or equal to 20 years. Such an
individual could in other words get maximum pension of 24,000
Rand.
</P>
<P>
Individuals at the age of 65 or more would qualify for an
annual 24,000 Rand, with an extra 1200 Rand for each year of
service exceeding five years, with a maximum total pension of
42,000 Rand.
</P>
<P>
However, a fixed pension of 84,000 Rand a year had been set
for those who had reached the age of 65, and who had at least 25
years of service.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that those who qualified would receive their
pensions in monthly amounts from the first day of the month in
which they reached the age of 60.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Overseas PC producers, such as
Compaq, IBM, and DEC, say that China's personal computer market,
which had sales of more than a million units last year, is getting
more mature as customers become more demanding in quality.
</P>
<P>
Digital Equipment Corporation held a conference on Wednesday in
Beijing, where it introduced to the Chinese market four new
designs -- the Venturis FX PC series, the Prioris ZX 6612/6200 MP
server, Windows NT Cluster, and HiNote Ultra II.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Chan, general manager of DEC Personal Computer, said
that China's enterprises know much more about personal computers
now, and hope that computers can help them solve specific problems
in daily business.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the successful cooperation with
Microsoft on Windows NT, DEC has managed to get other big-name
software manufacturers, like Oracle and Novell, as partners,
working together on data bases and on-line products for Chinese
clients.
</P>
<P>
DEC invited many PC agents to take part in the conference to
enlarge its sales network and promote its products not only in
such big cities as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou but also in
other parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Push Chinese Language Study Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- More and more people
worldwide are getting interested in studying Chinese culture and
language, and China is considering promoting the study of its
language worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This message comes from the Fifth International Symposium on
Teaching Chinese as A Foreign Language, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese, a hieroglyphic language with a 4,000-year history, is
now being communicated and used among 36 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
"The world's countries have never in need of the Chinese
language and professionals with Chinese ability as badly as they
do now," said Lu Bisong, chairman of the International Society for
Chinese Language Teaching, who attributes the language interest to
China's reforms and opening up drive, the rapid economic growth,
and frequent exchanges and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qinghua, president of the Beijing Language and Culture
University, says that teaching Chinese as a foreign language will
help spread the influence of the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, more students from various countries and
regions have come to China to study Chinese or have asked China to
provide more Chinese teachers.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will offer more support and assistance
to the world in the teaching of Chinese if necessary and if
possible," said Wei Yu, vice-minister of the State Education
Commission.
</P>
<P>
And China has come up with a six-point plan for Chinese
language teaching:
</P>
<P>
-- Sending a group of senior Chinese language teachers abroad,
and teachers and experts to 37 countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Helping foreign countries to establish Chinese teaching
centers for Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
-- Compiling high-quality Chinese textbooks and supplementary
reading materials for foreign countries, including electronic
media textbooks.
</P>
<P>
-- Developing the Test of Chinese as A Foreign Language
(HSK). HSK has been used in China since 1984, and is widely
considered to be the most authoritative Chinese language
examination.
</P>
<P>
-- Inviting foreign teachers and experts on Chinese language to
visit China, receive advanced training and do academic
research. China also plans to hold international conferences, to
translate, to introduce, and to publish book series selected from
other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Helping Chinese students studying abroad to set up Chinese
language schools for their children.

LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Players' union chief Gordon Taylor
warned on Thursday that English soccer's new golden era faced a
danger of descending into anarchy and disaster.
</P>
<P>
Taylor is leading his union in strike action threat for a ten
percent share of a 38.5 million-dollar agreement with Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
The chief said, the money was being thrown at the zenith of the
football pyramid, the big rich clubs, but the base of that pyramid
was in danger of being ignored.
</P>
<P>
So much of talent has come from the base of that pyramid, he
said, but it was gradually eroding.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the money football was getting had brought a new
golden era and opened the door to a great opportunity. But he
feared it could become a trapdoor to anarchy and, in many cases,
ruin.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also feared that the England national team and the
development of home-grown talent would suffer in the long term as
top clubs had more money to shop overseas.

GUIYANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer has donated to
the provincial museum of southwest China's Guizhou province a
fossil of the cranium of a giant panda's that dates back to the
Upper Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A number of Indonesian companies
have been selling bonds abroad since 1993 and Bank Indonesia, the
central bank, has sold 395 million US dollars worth of bonds in
the united states, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank Indonesia Soedradjat Djiwandono told local
press that the Indonesian government has offered bonds worth 400
million US dollars at an annual rate of 7.75 percent with a
maturity period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
A 0.5 percent discount has enabled the government to earn
395.344 million US dollars from the sale of bonds, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the sale of bonds abroad is expected to boost
Indonesia's foreign reserve and make its bonds comparable to those
of other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The main objective for selling the bonds, he said, is to make
Bank Indonesia's bonds as a benchmark for similar activities
carried out by state and private companies.

KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is planning to hold
joint military exercises in Kuwait, the local press today quoted
a U.S. Defense Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The local Arabic daily Al-RAi Al-Am (Opinion) said
U.S. Pentagon spokesman Scott Kampbell said in a statement to the
paper that ordinary joint exercises with the Kuwaiti army are
planned by the U.S. Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
One or maybe three exercises are scheduled, Campbell was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not say when and where the exercises
would be held and what kind of military forces would be involved
in the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said last Tuesday that the U.S. was planning to
send reinforcements to its 20,000-strong forces in the Gulf
region due to political tension with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been prevailing between Iran and the U.S. since
Washington hinted at Tehran's involvement in sponsoring terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton Monday signed the D'Amato Kennedy bill
that calls for sanctions on foreign companies which make
investments in the Iranian or Libyan oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has held a total of more than 40 joint military
exercises with the allied countries since the end of the Gulf
War in 1991, of which more than 20 were held with U.S. military
forces.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed defense cooperation accords with the U.S.,
France, Britain and Russia. All these agreements call for joint
maneuvers and weapons purchases.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Laos to Be Accepted as ASEAN Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Laos will be
accepted as members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in 1997, ASEAN Secretary General Dato Ajit Singh said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general made the statement to newsmen after a
flag hoisting ceremony in commemorating the 29th anniversary of
ASEAN at the ASEAN secretariat building.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a 10-member big ASEAN plan, two of the ASEAN's
four observers, Cambodia and Laos, will be accepted as ASEAN
members at this time next year, with Myanmar to follow.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when another ASEAN observer Papua New Guinea
will join the ASEAN. Papua New Guinea is not in Southeast Asian
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors and representatives from the seven ASEAN member
countries attended the ceremony which lasted for about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Formed on August 8, 1967 in Bangkok, the ASEAN has evolved from
a grouping of five nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- into a most-respected
regional group that now includes Brunei and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has made great contribution to peace and stability in
the region by conducting political, security and economic
cooperation among the member countries in the past 29 years, Singh
said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN is implementing its Free Trade Area (AFTA by speeding
up targeted tariff reductions, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth ASEAN summit meeting in Bangkok last year, the
association's leaders decided to accelerate trade liberalization
under AFTA from 15 years to 10 years. According to the new
schedule, AFTA would be achieved by 2003 instead of 2008.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN secretariat this evening also held an ASEAN Day
reception which was attended by some local officials and diplomats
from the seven member countries.

<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese geologist, Yuan
Daoxian, has been given the 1996 President's Award by the
International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH).
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-member scientific association praised Yuan, who is
the first Chinese ever to have won the award, for his outstanding
contributions to research on Karst formations, global climate
changes, and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>
"In the 40-year glorious history of the IAH, my career is
relatively short, but I am very proud to be able to see just how
much my country, the People's Republic of China, has been involved
in the work of IAH," Yuan said at the IAH general assembly in
Beijing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is former director of the Institute of Karst Geology in
Guilin, China and is internationally known for his scientific
work. His current position is a senior research scientist at the
Institute of Karst Geology and a professor at the China University
of Geosciences.
</P>
<P>
The IAH President's Award was started by two former presidents

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects Cooperation with Israel to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan expects cooperation with
Israel to increase Jordan's exports and better relations with
Gulf Arab states to cut unemployment in the kingdom, said
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher.
</P>
<P>
"There is an opportunity to export between 200 million dollars
to 300 million dollars worth of Jordanian products to Israel and
Palestine," said the minister, quoted by today's local daily
Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real opportunity that would help the Jordanian
economy to a great extent without any effect on the Israeli
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic, trade and transport agreements between
Jordan and Israel are not activated due to many political,
administrative and economic factors.
</P>
<P>
"Things don't just happen overnight," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that, naturally, the target is to establish an economic
coordination and cooperation and that it is not true that such a
cooperation between Jordan and Israel is not beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Muasher indicated that there are many relative advantage in
the two economies, which, if joined, will have a competitive
weight in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Initial cooperation between Jordan and Israel utilizing these
advantages is manifested in the textile sector, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector, he said, employs talented and low cost
labor as well as low-priced land in Jordan and makes use of the
Israeli marketing network and the agreements that the Jewish
State have with world countries which allow customs-free exports
under free trade accords.
</P>
<P>
He added there are also similar possibilities to cooperate in
the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister rejected some criticism of the government for the
rapprochement policy toward the Arab Gulf countries, saying that
it is the only policy that would provide an adequate and fairly
quick solution to the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that better ties with Gulf Arab countries have
opened the door for the employment of around 6,000 Jordanians in
that region.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the Saudi and other markets in the Gulf
will soon be opened for Jordanian products.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows by 8.9 Percent in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew
strongly by 8.9 percent in the first half of this year, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in his National Day Message
today, as this island republic will celebrate its 31st anniversary
of independence on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of the year, a total of 43,600 new
jobs were created, and the country's productivity growth was 2.3
percent, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, "we attracted 3.8 billion dollars (about
2.68 billion US dollars) in manufacturing investments, and are on
target to hit a record 7.5 billion dollars (about 5.28 billion US
dollars) for the whole year."
</P>
<P>
However, Goh also noted that in recent months, Singapore has
been affected by the slowdown in the electronics industry
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly half (44 percent) of our manufacturing is
electronics-related, so growth in the second half of the year will
slow down, although we still cannot tell if this slowdown will be
serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his message, the prime minister also called on the
Singaporean people to unite and work hard to make Singapore "A
Better Home for All."
</P>
<P>
"My vision is a Singapore where every citizen strives to make
Singapore a better home, where people are considerate and
well-behaved towards one another, where everyone is well-educated,
trained and employed, gracious, happy and enjoying a high quality
of life," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China's Developments in Antarctica Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have done
extensive research in Antarctica over the past decade, and have
come up with results that are attracting attention worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Tingyu, of China's Institute of Geology (CIG),
addressed the meeting of the 30th IGC, and outlined the country's
achievements in geology on the frozen continent.
</P>
<P>
The young scholar, Ren Liudong, did a careful study of ore near
China's Zhongshan Station in Antarctica, discovering that it was a
rare lode, and proving that it contained silicon, boron, magnesium
and aluminum. Other geologists had mistakenly taken it for
tourmaline for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Zhao Yue found, in other research, that the age of
most antarctic rocks is approximately the same as that of the
ancient continent of Gondwana in geological history.
</P>
<P>
The name refers to what was once the largest continent on
earth, and is believed to have separated into Antarctica, the
South Asian Subcontinent, and the southern part of Africa about
200 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhao's findings further proved that Antarctica was one part of
the ancient continent, meaning that the South Asian Subcontinent
was a neighbor of Antarctica millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen also said that China published a geological map
of Antarctica this year, which is said to be the latest and most
accurate one in the world.

<HEADLINE> Iran Outlines Policy toward Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed wishes to
improve its relations with neighboring countries such as Iraq,
Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a nationwide seminar on border security held in
Mashhad, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific Affairs
Alaeddin Bourujerdi said, "Iran is keen on peaceful, calm and
friendly relations with its neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
On Afghanistan, he said, "We are interested in peace and
security in Afghanistan and believe that the problem of
Afghanistan can be resolved inside the country."
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's mediation efforts have been successful due to
his country's good intention and the existing relations with all
groups involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi noted that some countries follow their own interests
under the current circumstances in Afghanistan which is
detrimental to the country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey, he said the new government led by pro-Islamic
Welfare Party Chairman Necmettin Erbakan would serve as a turning
point in Tehran-Ankara relations.
</P>
<P>
Bourujerdi said the slight border issues between Iran and
Turkey would be settled in light of the current relations with
the new Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the Iranian relations with Iraq, he said, "We don't
have any problem with Iraq except for the issues remained from
the war (1980-1988). There is no concern over border security with
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He voiced the Iranian willingness to normalize relations with
Iraq in the framework of national interest.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the UAE, Bourujerdi said the UAE's "claim on
ownership of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf has emanated
from the big powers' influence over the Emirates."
</P>
<P>
He added that the UAE's claim can not pose a serious problem
for Iran.
</P>
<P>
About the Iranian borders with Pakistan, he said this
neighboring country has the least border problems with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA did not specify whether the
deputy foreign minister mentioned in his speech the relations with
Iran's other neighbors of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and
Oman.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Decide on Hebron Redeployment Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli ministerial
committee will, in the next few days, decide on the redeployment
of the Israeli army in the West Bank town of Hebron, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior source as saying that the
Palestinians will be told that the Israeli army will continue to
patrol in the Arab neighborhood in the town, as long as the
security situation remains unstable.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Israel will retain responsibility for the
areas that include the Jewish cemeteries, the Jewish quarters, the
Cave of the Patriarch inside the town and the roads reaching
Kiryat Arba, a Jewish settlement just outside Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In fact, said the source, Israel had decided to keep control of
these areas in the past, but it was reduced during negotiations
with the Palestinians last year. Now Israel is returning to the
original demand, he added.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to this report, Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh said
that the Palestinians will not agree to Israeli troop patrols in
the Arab neighborhood as part of an Israeli redeployment in the
disputed town.
</P>
<P>
Natsheh said the negotiations on Hebron took into a countless
security need of the Jewish residents in the town, adding that
any changes in the original redeployment plan will be violations
of the interim accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed
to pullback from about 85 percent of Hebron by March 28, however,
following a series of Islamic extremist suicide bombing attacks,
the redeployment was delayed.
</P>
<P>
Israel's withdrawal from Hebron was postponed again in May due
to the general elections for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat sharply criticized Israel for delaying
its army redeployment in Hebron
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli media reported today that Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would present his new plan of Israeli
army redeployment in Hebron to the government next week.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, who had already visited Hebron three times since
taking office in July, is reportedly to pay another trip to the
town early next week.
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in
most other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, American sources revealed that Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu, during his first official visit to the U.S., told
President Bill Clinton at their private meeting that he would
seek a way to implement the redeployment in Hebron.

<P>
"We watched your matches on TV, and we are very pleased with
what you achieved," Jiang said to Sun Fuming, standing at the
front in the first row.
</P>
<P>
A group photo was also taken with the officials, who included
Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, head of the Olympic delegation, delivered a brief
report on the athletes' participation in the games, and Deng
Yaping, Li Xiaoshuang, and Mao Dezhen talked about the work it
took to win honor for the motherland.
</P>
<P>
World women's single table tennis champion Deng Yaping said: "I
met with challenges on behalf of our motherland and our team, and
my achievements should be attributed to the Party and to our
glorious team."
</P>
<P>
Mao Dezhen, who coaches women's 5,000 m gold medal winner Wang
Junxia, said that they have embarked on a new course with the
close of the Olympic Games and they are determined to win even
more and greater honors for the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks while meeting with the athletes and
their coaches, joining other top Chinese leaders in congratulating
the Chinese delegation on its significant achievements.
</P>
<P>
There were many excellent scores at the sports event, he said,
and Chinese athletes gave a full demonstration of patriotism,
collectivism, heroism and sportsmanship, and overcame many
unexpected difficulties and won one victory after another, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
In describing the athletes as good sons and daughters of the
Chinese people, Jiang said that they demonstrated the great spirit
of the Chinese nation and showed their determination in
representing the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang referred to them as "ambassadors of friendship", since
they made friends with athletes from other countries during the
games.
</P>
<P>
This international sporting event is a test of the level of
China's athletic ability and work, Jiang said, noting that "we
should not only admire our achievements, but should consider our
demerits and shortcomings."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you athletes will draw on you experience, improve
your work, have greater achievements in the future," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Humanitarian Situation in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds are displaced in the
areas between Afgois and Shalambood districts where many more
others just put up at the residence of their relatives in
Mogadishu whose abilities themselves are limited.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1,500 shallow wells in Mogadishu. However,
only 500 are registered and thus eligible to have chlorine given
by the UNICEF to prevent the water carried diseases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are only five mother and child health care
posts throughout Mogadishu of which only two are situated in the
severely malnutrition affected area of south Mogadishu, while the
other three operate in the mainly stable part of the city, north
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The aid agencies were frightened by three mortar shells that
landed one each at a time in the compounds of the ICRC, the Somali
Red Crescent Society (SRCS) and Care International.
</P>
<P>
these mortars have claimed the lives of three local staff
working for these agencies and wounded four others. These
agencies said they would evacuate from the whole capital if the
fighting reaches their areas of operation.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about this, the European Union Liaison Office in
Mogadishu has offered their relief workers for immediate
evacuation from Mogadishu once their lives are threatened by the
factional fighting in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
ICRC and SRCS have made several attempts to deliver drugs to
Medina health centers and Digfer and Banadir hospitals of south
Mogadishu, but due to the travel restrictions made by the on
going hostility, only two trucks of medicines have reached the
besieged Medina and Bosnia neighborhoods controlled by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed and Osman Atto who are allies against late General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
What is more, starvation persists in the southern part of
Somalia since the down fall of the late regime in 1991 and severe
river floods have hampered the expected crop harvest of the
season, cutting it down to less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaria broke out after the floods, spreading along the river
banks and to the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 people were killed in the area between the
southern port town of Kismayo and Jilib district, according to
the local health authority.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi, faction leader of north Mogadishu, said yesterday
that Somalia is facing total starvation, while his new opponent,
Hussein Aidid in south Mogadishu, has also worried about the
intensity of the humanitarian plight and on Tuesday called on all
the international agencies to return to help the needy Somalis.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks US Influence to Facilitate Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Wednesday sought U.S. help
to remove Israeli-imposed obstacles in trade with the Palestinian
territories as well as to ease the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The request for help to remove the barriers in Jordanian
exports to the Palestinian self-rule areas was made by a Jordanian
ministerial team which met with a visiting U.S. delegation
headed by Commerce Department Undersecretary Stuart Eizenstat,
according to the English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was renewed by Investment Promotion Corporation
Director-General Taleb Rifai.
</P>
<P>
Rifai said that Jordan was not focusing on increased outright
American financial aid but seeking American intervention and
influence with others.
</P>
<P>
He also said that one of the best ways Washington could help
the kingdom is facilitating Jordanian exports to the Palestinian
territories and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bassam Saket, a former minister and current chairman of the
Jordan Trade Association, referred to a request made by the
Turkish government for partial exemption from the sanctions
against Iraq and asked what chances Jordan stood to secure a
similar arrangement.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether the Jordanian government
had made a formal request for a partial lifting of the sanctions
against Iraq to the U.N. or the United States, which effectively
controls many of the decisions of the U.N. Security Council where
it has veto power.
</P>
<P>
Saket said Jordanian businesses wanted to add "consumer
products" to Jordan's exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Present exports from the kingdom to Baghdad are limited to
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Smadi, secretary-general of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade who attended the meeting with the U.S. official
Wednesday, said the U.S. official promised Washington's help in
removing the Israeli-imposed obstacles in the way of Jordanian
exports to the Palestinians, the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Rifai said the full potential of Jordanian exports was being
blocked because of the hurdles in the movement of goods to the
Palestinian market through Israeli-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
He added the sanctions on Iraq had a serious impact on
Jordanian trade.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat noted that the U.S. was providing 100 million
dollars in inspection equipment to Israel, which will be
installed at the bridges and entry points to Israeli-controlled
territories, facilitating the quick inspection and movement of
cargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who praised Jordan's commitment to honor the
international sanctions against Iraq, said he was not fully aware
of the nature of the sought-for exemption but promised that he
would have a reply for the kingdom as soon as he returns home.

<HEADLINE> Irregular Salary Payment Leads to 94 Deaths in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-four employees of local
government councils in Enugu state, eastern Nigeria, have
reportedly died as a result of starvation and non-payment of
their salaries for the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
To this end, members of the Nigeria union of local government
employees in the state have embarked on a four-day work-to-rule
action beginning today to mourn the collapse of local government
administration in the state, the Nigerian Tribune newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of a series of protests from our union," said Nwakwe
Ezeja, a labor leader, successive deduction from local government
statutory allocation has continued unabated, making many local
governments unable to pay salaries regularly."
</P>
<P>
According to the labor union, local government workers have
showed restraint, understanding and self-sacrifice over the
continued deterioration and dislocation of local government
service, noting that the government has not shown genuine
commitment to saving their members from mass hunger.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the report said, state administrator Colonel Mike
Torey said efforts were being made to address the problem of
excessive deduction from local government statutory allocation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today described the Chinese sports delegation to the Atlanta
Olympic Games as having achieved great things and having honored
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general-secretary of the Communist Party
Central Committee, called on the whole country to learn from the
athletes, to uphold the patriotic tradition, and to contribute to
a better China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here today while meeting with the
athletes and their coaches, joining other top Chinese leaders in
congratulating the Chinese delegation on its significant
achievements.
</P>
<P>
There were many excellent scores at the sports event, he said,
and Chinese athletes gave a full demonstration of patriotism,

said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the coaches, staff members, and press people
for their arduous efforts in helping the athletes have better
scores and in getting the news to people in China.
</P>
<P>
In describing the athletes as good sons and daughters of the

representing the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang referred to them as "ambassadors of friendship", since

</P>
<P>
All the Chinese people, the overseas Chinese, the students
studying in the US, and foreign friends also did their part to
contribute to the victories of the Chinese athletes in Atlanta, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This international sporting event is a test of the level of
China's athletic ability and work, Jiang said, noting that, "We
should not only admire our achievements, but should consider our
demerits and shortcomings."

"I hope that you athletes will draw on you experience, improve

</P>

Stressing the importance of promoting sports and improving
people's health, Jiang said that party committees and governments
at all levels should pay more attention to China's athletics and
bring it to a new level.
</P>
<P>
China's athletes won 16 gold medals, 22 silver, and 12 bronze
at the Atlanta Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test Ban Talks Situation "Promising": U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior United States States
diplomat said today he is optimistic about a quick conclusion for
a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty after the U.S. and China
clear away a key obstacle.
</P>
<P>
The situation was promising and the appetite to move was very
powerful, Stephen Ledogar, the U.S. disarmament ambassador in
Geneva told reporters before a plenary session of the Geneva-based
Conference on Disarmament, which has managed the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after reports on Wednesday that the U.S. and
China had reached an agreement for the first time on procedures
for investigating suspected treaty violations, following more than
a week of talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, international inspections at the sites of
suspected violations would go forward if 30 of the 51 nations in
the treaty's executive council agreed, rather than by the simple
majority vote suggested by the current draft treaty, the
Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. would offer assurances that it
would not include espionage and human intelligence as a basis for
making a request for an on-site inspection. This, however, would
not require any change to the draft text.
</P>
<P>
Ledogar said: "We are not going to reopen the (draft) text. We
hope for broad acceptance of the small but important adjustment
and clarification."
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here said that for the moment, objections by
India could be the only potential hindrance to reaching a global
treaty on the test ban.
</P>
<P>
India threatened earlier that it might block the treaty's
transfer from the Conference on Disarmament to the UN General
Assembly unless it dropped the requirement for India, Pakistan and
Israel -- the three so-called nuclear "threshold states" -- to
sign and ratify the pact before it could go into force.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, India reiterated at the
plenary meeting Thursday that it would not sign the treaty if
India's concern was not addressed. But some diplomats said this
remark might hint at a softening of India's position.
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of procedures of the Disarmament Conference, a
transfer of the treaty to the U.N. General Assembly requires
consensus.
</P>
<P>
"The issue now is whether or not India will prevent the rest of
us from giving the text we want to have considered by the entire
international community," said Ledogar.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he did not think India would do so, and
added: "I believe there is a way that we can move the text forward
without requiring their consent to the text."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Washington and its allies had devised a
legal stratagem to sidestep India's veto. A group of states might
be able to present the treaty to the General Assembly without a
specific endorsement by the Disarmament Conference.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc committee meeting on the nuclear test ban is
scheduled for Friday when chairman Ramaker is expected to report
the progress made during the consultations he conducted with
delegations over recent days.

<HEADLINE> India Willing to Settle Issues with Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- India has expressed its willingness
to settle outstanding issues with Bangladesh in the shortest
possible time.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources here said today that the pledge was made by
Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda when he met with Bangladeshi
Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan Wednesday, who handed over a
letter to the Indian leader from Bangladeshi Prime Minister Shiekh
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
On the sharing of the Ganges water, Deve Gowda hoped that the
forthcoming foreign secretary level meeting could create the
groundwork for foreign minister and water resources minister level
meeting and if necessary, there could be a head of government
meeting to settle the issue permanently, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that in her letter to Deve Gowda, Hasina has
expressed her firm belief that "given the vast fund of goodwill on
both sides, our two governments will be able to work together in
addressing all bilateral issues in a serious and constructive
manner in the spirit of cooperation and understanding."
</P>
<P>
Some outstanding problems, especially the issue of water
sharing, have been affecting the development of bilateral
relations between the two neighboring countries. Since the
formation of the new government in both countries, Bangladeshis
have laid great hope on the solution of the outstanding issues.

<HEADLINE> EU Grant for Bosnia-Croatia Mine Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
granted 4.6 million U.S. dollars to finance mine clearance in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, EU officials said today.
</P>
<P>
This additional grant to the U.N. Mine Action Centers (MACs)
follows the EU's four million dollar donation to the United
Nations last year for mine clearance in Angola and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The MACs are designed to provide a focus of expertise and
information in countries where there is a recognised mines problem.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over three million mines have been sown in
the former war zones of Bosnia and Croatia and these are major
obstacles to reconstruction of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the support provided by the EU funds, the MACs will be
able to develop their data base on mine contamination, assist the
process of surveying and marking mined areas, carry out mine
awareness training, and coordinated mine clearance programs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Humanitarian Situation in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The humanitarian situation in
Mogadishu, particularly in the south, is getting worse following
the withdrawal of all international aid agencies and the
intermittent clashes which erupted between opposing factions.
</P>
<P>
The international non-governmental organizations' (ngo)
currently based in northern Mogadishu are unable to continue
their humanitarian operations due to the endless hostility.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 1.5 million people living in
Mogadishu, the unemployment rate rose to 80 percent and is
growing even higher as there's no central administration in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country which has some eight million people,
about half a million, most of them being women and children, are
at present facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
Importation of food on small boats is going on and it is now
impossible due to the closure of Mogadishu's air and sea ports.
</P>
<P>
The Italian aid agency Commitatto Italiano Svoluppo Del Populo
(CISP) is concerned about the food prices and particularly the
merchants who are storing up food to make high profits.
</P>
<P>
The feeding centers run by the international organizations
cannot efficiently function due to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The French aid agency, Action Contra la Faim (ACF), has also
expressed concern over the fate of 10,600 children in their
therapeutic feeding centers throughout Mogadishu since the
fighting escalated early last month.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that 1,200 out of the above-mentioned
10,600 children were in a rehabilitation, makeshift feeding
center in Medina and only 90 of these children are confirmed to
be present in the center currently. Others have either escaped to
unlocated areas or presumably died as a result of the fierce
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Because of the closure of the feeding centers in Mogadishu,
thousands of families whose daily living depended on those
centers escaped from the man made inferno and their fate remains
unknown so far.
</P>
<P>
Among them are 60 - 100 families who fled from the fighting in
Medina and currently taking refugee in Jasira beach, 5 km south
of the capital without food, water, shelter and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some of them drank from the sea and caught diarrhoea. There's
also an acute shortage of drinking water throughout the city
which itself could spread epidemic diseases.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President: Enemies Infuriated by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said here today that Iraq's enemies have been infuriated by his
country's reconstruction of facilities destroyed during the 1991
Gulf war and the steadfastness of the Iraqi people in face of
six years of U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in a nationwide address during a ceremony held
at the presidential palace to observe the 8th anniversary of the
cease-fire for the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war which Iraqis called the
victory day.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also held to celebrate the reopening of the
palace which was targeted in the war. The reopening of the palace
was delayed although work on the reconstruction of the palace
had been completed long ago, Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that he had personal accounts in Swiss banks and that
his brother was appointed ambassador there to supervise those assets
on behalf of him.
</P>
<P>
The president also lashed out at those who call palaces and
houses built in Iraq as Saddam palaces, saying that enemies wanted
to delude whoever does not know Saddam Hussein into believing that
he builds palaces for himself and keeps Iraqi people's money for
himself.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to continue the building of people's palaces and other
facilities such as factories, hospitals and irrigation canals.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the president did not give any comment on the
relations between Iraq and Iran which have not yet been on the
track of normalization.
</P>
<P>
Nor did he mention the implementation of the oil-for-food deal
agreed by Iraq and the U.N. in May, which is likely to be
implemented later this month to ease the sufferings of Iraqis
under the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Election Faces Dilemma after Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Constitutional Court
announced today that it judged parts of a controversial election
law, which was passed by the House on July 10 to organize the next
parliamentary elections this month, as "unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
After ten days of closed sessions, the 10-member court reached
the verdict Wednesday in line with a petition lodged by opposition
parliamentary members who challenged the constitutionality of the
law and called on the court to cancel the legislation.
</P>
<P>
In advance of making it to the public at noon today, the court
had informed the country's top leaders of the verdict's contents.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the court members "in a unanimity,"
the Constitutional Court stressed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
held urgent consultations, in the presence of Deputy Prime
Minister and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr, in the Beirut
Presidential Palace this morning.
</P>
<P>
Before heading for Damascus, Hariri announced that the three
top leaders, namely President Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri
and the prime minister, would have a meeting Friday, which would
be followed by an extraordinary session of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister ruled out the possibility that the
parliamentary election, which had been scheduled to start on
August 18, would be postponed for a long time. But he noted that a
two-week postponement was possible "if it is technically
necessary."
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the extension of the present parliament,
whose term expires in October.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent part overruled by the Constitutional Court,
whose decisions cannot be appealed against, is an article dividing
the Mount Lebanon Governorate into six electoral constituencies
while keeping all other four governorates as single
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Labeled as "exceptional," the division was widely believed to
be aimed at appeasing Druze leader Walid Jumblat who feared a
overwhelming defeat of his minor community in the predominantly
Christian Mount Lebanon if the governorate was declared a single
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Other articles ruled against by the Constitutional Court
included one extending the next parliament's mandate to four
years and eight months from the present four years, and another
barring civil servants who fail in the elections from returning to
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Beirut described the verdict as an
"earthquake," which would particularly shock the government of
Prime Minister Hariri in the middle of a heated election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Some expected that the upcoming parliamentary election, the
second since the country's civil war ended in 1990, would be
delayed for two weeks, and others said that the postponement
would last eight months at most.

Rescue work was begun by the police and paramilitary Civil Guard
officers soon after the catastrophe occurred. Many volunteers also
took part in efforts to evacuate people and search for the bodies
of victims, but the work was hampered by a black night.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Sue US in International Court for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government announced
here today it will soon bring a law suit against the United States
in the international court for its latest tougher sanctions
against Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati and broadcast by the state-run Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "We have made the initial preparations to file a
complaint, particularly in relation to the allocation of a
20-million-U.S. dollar special fund for undermining the Iranian
government."
</P>
<P>
"We will submit our case to the International Court of Justice
at Hague in the next few days," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran is now resorting to legal
action in the wake of strong condemnations against the United
States for the tougher sanctions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill into law
to punish non-U.S. companies investing annually 40 million dollars
or more in Iranian or Libyan oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the main reason for Clinton to sign the bill
against Iran to the U.S. presidential election aspirations,
Velayati noted, "As they get closer to the U.S. Presidential
election date, we see the influence of their national political
needs on their foreign policy decisions."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Bill Clinton signed the bill into
law, despite opposition from what he termed as all U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of such an unwise measure is that within a
short time after the announcement of the decision, there will be a
wave of negative and angry reaction from all major countries,"
the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said the international wave of opposition to the
U.S. decision is testimony to the fact that the world is not
ready to accept domestic U.S. laws on the destiny and the
independence of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lesson that the world has taught the United
States so they would not think that they are the main
and sole decision-maker in the international political scene,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Lottery Sales Up In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- There has been a sharp increase
in sales of social welfare lottery tickets over the past nine
years, going from 170 million yuan the first year, in 1978, to 6
billion yuan (722 million US dollars) in 1995, the Civil Affairs
Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
"Sales in recent years have especially delighted us," said Doje
Cering, minister of civil affairs, at a press conference
today. The ministry is the sole issuer of welfare lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
More than 13.3 billion yuan worth of lottery tickets were sold
over the past nine years, with 55 percent of that being used as
the premium, and 15 percent covering costs, giving 4.18 billion
yuan to the country, of which 2.6 billion yuan has been invested
in over 50,000 welfare projects.
</P>
<P>
More than 5 million elderly without family support, orphans,
and those with disabilities directly benefit from those profits,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister and Chairman of the China Social Welfare Lottery
Committee Yan Mingfu attributes the increased sales of lottery
tickets to improved management and growing public interest in this
part of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
Lotteries were long regarded as a form of gambling and were
strictly prohibited until the welfare lottery was approved by the
State Council in 1978.
</P>
<P>
State auditing and finance offices have been inspecting and
running checks on the lottery and report that, "no major problems
have been discovered," according to Yan, who maintains that China
still need more lottery funds for welfare.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimates that the country needs 32 billion yuan
over the next five years to renovate welfare, make additions, buy
new medical equipment, support 100,000 orphans, and help
disaster-stricken and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
"Lottery sales at the current level are far from enough to meet
the demands," Yan said, but, compared to other countries and
regions, and taking the huge population of China into
consideration, the lottery market potential is immense.
</P>
<P>
Welfare lottery sales in Hong Kong, whose population is around
6 million, could reach 78 billion HK dollars a year, it has been
reported.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sacks Coaches for "Humiliating Failure" at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has sacked a number of
coaches following what the local press described as the
"humiliating failure" of Egyptian athletes at the Atlanta Olympic
Games, which concluded on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coaches whose contracts were terminated include Yehia
Kazarian in wrestling, Alexander Maroushkin in shooting, Zoltan
Miller in rowing, Hassan Abdallah in swimming, Mohamed Abdel-Aziz
in boxing and Helmi Hussein in judo.
</P>
<P>
American Tim Hatrich, who had coached Egypt's swimming hopeful
Rania Elwani, was also fired. Before the opening of the Olympic
Games, Elwani was believed to stand the greatest chance of winning
a medal for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which fielded 29 athletes at the centennial games,
failed to grab a single medal. Its men's handball team put up
somewhat a consolation performance for the whole delegation by
finishing sixth, a result nearest to a medal.
</P>
<P>
Elwani, who placed seventh in the women's 50-meter freestyle at
the 1994 World Swimming Championships, failed to enter the finals
in any of the events in which she participated this time.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council for Youth and Sports, Egypt's highest body
governing sports, has demanded a full report on the efficiency of
all foreign coaches working in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian press has fiercely criticized the poor performance
of Egypt's athletes in Atlanta, saying that it is high time for
serious action to be taken to improve the level of the country's
sports.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which finished second in the overall medal standings
only behind South Africa in the 6th All Africa Games in Harare
last year, has been short of world-level athletes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also failed to win a medal at the 1988 and 1992 Olympic
games. It only snatched a bronze at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.

<HEADLINE> Tension Rises Over Ban on Ulster Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Tension is rising across Northern
Ireland following Britain's ban on the controversial Apprentice
Boys march planned for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
A huge army and police operation was mounted in Londonderry
Wednesday night to block off part of the city's walls overlooking
the nationalist Bogside area, said reports here from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The move was ordered by the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, Patrick Mayhew, after a day of talks with Protestants
failed to agree on a route for the march.
</P>
<P>
Bogside residents, while welcoming the decision, fear new
violence in the city as anger spreads among Apprentice Boys
marchers and Unionist politicians.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Northern Ireland experienced some of its worst
rioting after police first banned a Protestant march and then
allowed it to go ahead. Two people died, hundreds were injured and
a hotel was bombed.
</P>
<P>
The march, held to mark the 308th anniversary of the
Apprentice Boys' shutting of the city gates against invading
Catholic troops in 1688, lacks an agreed route. Talks between
Bogside residents and the Apprentice Boys in the past have failed
to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Mayhew said the ban could be lifted if the two sides
reached an agreement before the planned march.

<HEADLINE> China Has Launched 17 Land Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Augest 8 (Xinhua) -- China so far has launched 17 land
satellites, signifying the country's achievements in space
observation technology.
</P>
<P>
This information was released today in Beijing at the ongoing
30th International Geology Congress by an official from the
Science and Technology Department of the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, 15 remote-sensing returnable science
and technology test satellites, and two polar orbit satellites,
have been launched since 1970.
</P>
<P>
The official added that a set of globally-advanced
remote-sensing instruments, including a thermo-infrared scanner,
have been successfully developed in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of permanent stations to position the
satellites have been set up. Some have already become the standard
or key stations of the Coordinating Network For Global Satellite
Positioning and the International Geodynamics Serving System.
</P>
<P>
The land satellites' stations are said to be able to receive
data from satellites similar to those sent by the U.S., Japan and
the European Union (the European Communities). The stations have
contributed much to the nation's observation of the movement of
the earth's crust, regional land use, the change in resources,
crop output evaluation and forecasting natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China is expected to promote its
cooperation with other countries in this field, and increase the
use of satellite technologies in environment protection,
agriculture development and ocean exploration.

<HEADLINE> Australian Trade Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia saw a blowout in its
current account deficit as its foreign trade imbalance
deteriorated in May.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted current account deficit surged to 2.153
billion Australian dollars (1.701 billion US dollars) in May after
rising to 1.970 billion Australian dollars (1.556 billion US
dollars) in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figure was worse than market expectations, with most
local forecasters predicting that the current account deficit
would drop to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.343 billion US
dollars) in the month.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit widened to 437 million Australian dollars
(345.23 million US dollars) in May from 232 million Australian
dollars (183.28 million US dollars) in April.
</P>
<P>
The blowout of trade deficit was mainly due to a stronger
Australian dollar that encouraged imports and discouraged exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell over 4 percent to 6.184 billion Australian dollars
(4.885 billion US dollars) in May, while imports decreased merely
one percent to 6.621 billion Australian dollars (5.231 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the monthly current account deficit
climbed above 2.0 billion Australian dollars (1.58 billion US
dollars) in near one year.
</P>
<P>
The worse-than-expected current account deficit figure is
expected to undermine the strength of the Australian dollar.

"the signing of the agreement will be an important political and
economic achievement for Iran despite U.S. efforts to isolate
Iran economically."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iran would export some 4 billion cubic
meters of natural gas to Turkey, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will build a 260-kilometer long pipeline from
the vicinity of Tabriz, northwest Iran, to the Turkish border
within a period of two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said Iran-Turkey natural gas agreement is going to
last at least until the year 2020. Iran would be getting an annual
profit of 1 billion dollars from the gas sale a year.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Iran and Turkey failed to reach the gas
deal to transfer Iran's gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Sinasi Altinar, former Turkish minister of energy and natural
resources, said that the two sides had agreed on 99 percent of
the agreement, but there was still one percent left unsolved.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, Iran and Turkey signed a memorandum of
understanding for sale of Iran's gas to Turkey as well as setting
up a gas pipeline between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in Macao
has urged better cooperation between Macao and the Chinese
mainland to expand Macao's economy through wider use of high
technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said that he hopes Macao entrepreneurs would step up cooperations
with mainland high-tech research institutions or companies so that
Macao's economy would come out of the current slow-down.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to some local factories which produce
technology-intensive products, Wang said that his branch office
will offer help in boosting such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Although Macao is a small place, its economy has grown in
multiple directions," he said. "Tourism and gambling business
should continue, and the development of such industries as
processing, finance and real estate should also grow in a
coordinated pace."
</P>
<P>
He said that he found high-tech played an important role in the
upgrading of Macao's industry, and it should be an orientation of
Macao's processing industry."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Textile Industry Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's textile industry,
which has been going through a sustained multiple crisis, is
facing tougher challenges due to an acute shortage of cotton and
consequent rises in cotton prices.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, more than 200 textile mills in the
provinces of Sindh and Balochistan were forced to close down as a
result of the cotton shortage and high cotton prices.
</P>
<P>
The gap between demand and supply of cotton in Pakistan has
reached its peak. The monthly need of the country's textile sector
is around 600,000 bales while the cotton available in the month of
July was only about 400,000 bales.
</P>
<P>
As the local production of cotton will be no more than 100,000
bales in August, the shortage will be around 500,000 bales.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Textile Commissioner's
Organization show that local spinners have consumed six million
bales of raw cotton during the last eight months of the current
crop season (September 1995 to April 1996), which was much higher
than the figures of the corresponding periods in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector believes that the shortage of cotton has
been caused by unbridled and excessive exports of the material
during the 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan produced around 10.3 million bales of raw cotton in
the last fiscal year, of which more than 2.5 million bales have
been registered for export.
</P>
<P>
After the cotton output touched a peak of 12.9 million bales in
1991-92, there was a large fall in production during the next
three years, which kicked up prices and necessitated marginal
imports as well.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector, however, does not see any short-term remedy
for the cotton shortage. It has asked the government to make
special arrangements for the import of cotton from India because
cotton is far cheaper in India than in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, Anwar
Ahmad, has suggested immediate suspension of further shipment of
cotton and withdrawal of regulatory duty on the import of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad believes that no cotton should be exported unless and
until the needs of the local textile industry are met.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's textile industry occupies a pivotal position in the
economy. The textile industry accounts for 8 percent of the gross
national product and 42 percent of total employment in the
large-scale manufacturing sector. The textile industry also
contributes 50 percent of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the textile sector fear that with the shortage
of raw cotton and its high prevailing prices, more textile mills
will be forced to shut down their operations in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts here believe that the immediate problem
of Pakistan's textile industry is neither the trade liberalization
nor the free trade of cotton but prevailing inefficiency, lower
productivity, high cost of production as well as non-pragmatic
policies.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, as one of the top five cotton producing countries in
the world, contributes only about two percent of the world's
textile exports.
</P>
<P>
As many local economists believe that as the largest
contributor to the national economy, the textile sector deserves a
separate ministry for its smooth running, so all concerned
organizations will be gathered under one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
It will help Pakistan to obtain and maintain the largest market
share in value added textile products internationally.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Companies Taking to Short-term Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in Shanghai, the
largest industrial city in China, have taken to issuing short-term
bonds as a means of raising capital.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months this year, such bonds amounted to 913
million yuan (110 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Shanghai Branch of the People's
Bank of China, since 1987, nearly 1,000 local firms have acquired
over 10 billion yuan by issuing various kinds of short-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, banks began to help local enterprises raise funds on a
trial basis in order to meet demands of the firms. The move proved
so successful that, beginning in 1989, more local companies got
involved.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the bank say that short-term bonds issued by local
firms have played a positive role in easing the pressure on banks
and are useful for the enterprise reform move. Moreover, local
investors have been enthusiastic about buying the bonds, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
They say that the city will encourage more local firms and
non-bank financial institutions to participate in the practice and
want to change it from an investment activity between legal
persons to public investment.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Oil Company Renews Technical Services with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Kuwait Oil
Company (KOC) announced today it has renewed the technical
services agreement with British Petroleum (BP) for another three
years.
</P>
<P>
Executive assistant of the KOC managing director for planning
and development Ahmad Al-Arbeed said today the British company
will continue to "provide the required technical consultancy in
the core activities of KOC in the exploration, development and
production of oil and the related support services in Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
The company's old service accord with BP ran out earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arbeed said the agreement renewed Wednesday would continue
to benefit the KOC as it did in the past four years, during which
important technologies were transferred from BP to Kuwaiti oil
fields.
</P>
<P>
KOC is an umbrella oil corporation in Kuwait which earns
around 85 percent of the national income through crude oil
exports and other relevant activities in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
According to other sources, the company had also held talks
with France's Total, Total Dutch/Shell Group and U.S. Exxon
Corporation and Amoco Corp about the possibility of entering
technical service accords.
</P>
<P>
The proposed technical services agreements would be similar
to the ones KOC already has with BP and Chevron, it is
learnt.
</P>
<P>
At present, BP and Chevron have offices and staff in
Kuwait and are also providing support in production and
development, geoscience and systems technology.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say international oil giants wanted to use the
technical accords as platforms from which to lobby for
involvement in a planned long-term, multi-billion dollar
introduction of secondary recovery injection technologies in the
Kuwaiti oil fileds.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arbeed said that "the need for new agreements comes from
work demand that is derived from our strategic plan."
</P>
<P>
The KOC "will continue to exert all possible efforts to
conserve the natural resources endowed by God and to optimize
utilization of these resources by using the latest technologies
in the world, in order to achieve maximum benefits for the
present and future generations of Kuwait," he said.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said today the
United States cannot dictate to other countries who their trading
partners should be.
</P>
<P>
"They have no business dictating to us who we should or should
not do business with," she was quoted by Malaysia's official news
agency Bernama as saying after discussions with visiting
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer who arrived here
Wednesday for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
She said Australia shared Malaysia's sentiment on the issue and
was also against America's stance which is tantamount to
interfering in the domestic policies of a country.
</P>
<P>
The United States encountered certain problems with countries
like Libya and Iran and claimed to penalize foreign companies
investing in these countries.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia and Australia have their own domestic policies on
economic relations with the outside world, and America cannot
dictate to us who we can and cannot do business with," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said both Malaysia and Australia also held the view that no
social clauses such as child labor and forced labor to be included
in the work schedule of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which
will meet in Singapore this December as those issues should be
dealt with by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the WTO should not have its focus distracted by
these issues as it has many other issues on its agenda for
discussion.

LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 178,000 tons of

vigorous enforcement of the appropriate regulations.
</P>

FEPA will continue to advocate for the joint establishment of

<HEADLINE> Velayati Plays Down US Sanctions against Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati has played down the impact of a recent U.S. law
which will punish non-American investors in Iran's energy sector
in an interview with the London-based Al-Hayat daily issued in
Beirut this morning.
</P>
<P>
"The measures by the United States do not worry us because we
consider the U.S. economic boycott of our country an advantage
rather than a disadvantage," Velayati said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need U.S. investments to develop our country,
especially in the oil industry which has been developed by the
Iranian revolution, not by U.S. aid," he told the Saudi-owned
Arabic newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. accusations that Iran was behind an explosion in
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 American servicemen on June
25, Velayati said, "All U.S. allegations are false."
</P>
<P>
"We do not condone the Dhahran explosion nor the bombing of TWA
plane, nor the explosion in Atlanta, nor any other explosion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has time and again condemned such terrorist activities
and denied its involvement in them," he said, "nonetheless, the
U.S. insists on blaming others every time it fails to solve its
internal problems," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Disdaining the prospects of a U.S. military attack on Iran,
Velayati said, "The U.S. media and military campaigns do not
concern us. The Iranian people have proved to be tough facing any
foreign challenge."
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. attacks us, it will not be the first attack and
the Iranians will teach any aggressors a lesson they will never
forget," he added, "irrespective of the aggressors' identity, our
people will make them regret for their aggression."
</P>
<P>
Attempting to appease the oil-rich Arab neighbors of the
Islamic republic, Velayati asserted, "We do not have territorial
ambitions outside Iran and we do not intend to attack any one."
</P>
<P>
He ruled out that the Arab countries would be involved in a
possible American-Iranian military confrontation, and expressed
his country's desire to build up confidence with the neighboring
Gulf countries in order to "realize the security and stability" in
the region.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a bill into law
to punish foreign companies that invest annually 40 million
U.S. dollars or more in the oil and gas projects in Iran or Libya,
the two countries which Clinton termed as "the most dangerous
supporters of terrorism in the world."

On July 18, the same day when Neeman sworn in as justice
minister, a petition was filed by Globes journalist Yoav Yitzhak,
alleging that Neeman committed a variety of criminal acts, and is
therefore not fit to be a minister.
</P>
<P>
One of the affairs cited in the petition was related to a
document submitted in the ongoing trial of Deri, according to
which Neeman had told a witness not to cooperate with the police
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Neeman then responded to the petition by lashing out at
the State Attorney's Office, charging it with leaking
information to the press to prevent the appointment of an
observant Jew as justice minister.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly intended to
appoint a temporary replacement for Neeman, in the hope that
no charge will be filed against the justice minister.

<HEADLINE> Geologists Doubt US Discovery of Martian Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Geologists from all over the
world today expressed doubt about the claim by US scientists that
they have discovered evidence of life on Mars from remains of a
meteorite that plunged to Earth.
</P>
<P>
NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) of the
United States announced in Houston yesterday that American
scientists have discovered evidence of ancient single-cell life on
Mars in remains of a meteorite that fell to Earth 13,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Umberto Gordani, president of Sao Paulo University of
Brazil, said that the earliest life substance discovered on the
Earth dates back 330 million years.
</P>
<P>
The substance was a single-cell life, found in a sedimentary
seam in South Africa, said Gordani, who is attending the 30th
International Geology Congress now in session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a statement about the discovery, NASA used many
indefinite words, such as "possibly," "probably" and "perhaps,"
leaving scientists and others unable to ascertain how NASA
determined the meteorite found by the US in Antarctica is the same
as the meteorite from Mars.
</P>
<P>
Still less can scientists ascertain how they determined the
period for the meteorite from Mars, added Gordani, former
president of the International Union of Geologists.
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a fantastic story," said Gordani, who is
considered the world's most renowed scientist in the study of
early-stage rocks, and dividing history into periods for such
rocks.
</P>
<P>
In fact, scientists throughout the world have long conjectured
about the existence of life on Mars.

<HEADLINE> Geologists Doubt US Discovery of Martian Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Research findings show that Venus, Mars and Earth were in
roughly the same state when they were formed. The formation of an
environment on the Earth suited to the existence of life is the
result of mutual effect between living things in gradual evolution
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
In its early stages, the Earth did not have oxygen, and our
planet's water was different from today's.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yun, professor of the Biology Department of Beijing
University, said, "It is not absolutely impossible that primitive
life existed on Mars some three billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The crux of matter lies in how to determine that the stains of
life substance on the meteorite come from Mars, and are not
pollution from life on the earth after the meteorite plunged to
the Earth," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Many scientists attending the 30th International Geology
Congress agreed that evidence of any organic life on the surface
of a meteorite is usually burned off as it passes through the
atmospheric layer.
</P>
<P>
If evidence of life exists within the meteorite, it would also
be impossible for it to remain intact, they noted.
</P>
<P>
US president Bill Clinton reportedly issued a statement in
Washington yesterday, pledging that the US will step up its
exploration of Mars.
</P>
<P>
The US Congress also indicated that the appropriations for
exploring Mars are likely to be increased rather than cut
substantially, as was originally planned.
</P>
<P>
Fake research findings by two American scientists in
discovering "cold fusion" was laid bare a few years ago. Now more
and more scientists across the world have begun to doubt the
sensational scientific discoveries made over the past few years in
the US.

<HEADLINE> World Needs Iranian Oil: Iranian Oil Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The tougher U.S. sanction against
Iran and Libya is doomed to failure because the world needs energy
sources in Iran and other countries in the Persian Gulf region,
Iranian oil minister was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried in today's Persian daily Jumhuri
Islami, Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said that it would be
impossible for the world economy to run without energy from the
Persian Gulf region, which provides two-thirds of total crude oil
in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the fourth largest oil producing country in the world
and the second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. It pumps
3.6 million barrels of oil per day and exports 2.5 million barrels
of crude every day.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil exports amount to about 5 percent of the total crude
oil in the international market, and it boasts of 92 billion
barrels of oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, accusing Iran and Libya of
sponsoring international terrorism, signed a bill into law Monday
to punish non-American companies investing more than 40 million
U.S. dollars in Iran and Libya's oil and gas industries.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said that the imposition of such law and
punitive measures against Iran would have no impact on the Iranian
oil industry in view of its situation and possibility.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are fully aware that they can not damage
the Iranian oil industry by adopting such moves and the future
would demonstrate the fact," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that one country, which endorsed the law against
another country, would undermine the honor and dignity of
other countries. That is why European and other countries are
obliged to confront the American sanction.
</P>
<P>
Based on international laws, he said, the new U.S. law
is not implementable and non-American companies would certainly
take their case to international judicial courts, and the United
States is sure to face defeat there.
</P>
<P>
"If American approach of legislating laws against other
countries gains firm footing, then the whole international trade
and economic system would come under question with chaos," he
said.
</P>
<P>
With huge oil and gas reserves, he said, Iran plays an
indispensable role in the world economy and its energy
procurement. "Iranian oil industry has never been in such
favorable conditions both before and after the Islamic revolution
in 1979," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian oil industry is self-sufficient in all
energy-related fields such as production, marketing, refining
and petrochemical processing.
</P>
<P>
As to the impacts of the American punitive law against Iranian
energy industry and investment plans, he said, all projects, whose
agreements have been signed such as the exploitation of Sirri oil
field by French Total, are advancing as planned.
</P>
<P>
"We have received numerous proposals from foreign firms for
the execution of other projects and we have nothing to worry
about," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military experts started
investigation into recent rocket attacks by Turkish helicopters in
an Iranian border region, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Iran News said that a Turkish top-brass
military and security delegation headed by Major General Loybash
arrived in the border city of Sarv Wednesday to make the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The joint Iranian-Turkish team of military and security experts
inspected the Silvana district of West Azarbaijan, which was
attacked by Turkish Army's helicopters on June 27, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
On that day, two Turkish helicopters violated the Iranian
airspace and fired two rockets, killing six citizens and injuring
15 others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi had
said that the report of the military experts' findings will serve
as a basis for future decision-making on closing this undesirable
case.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Door Still Open for Renewing Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel has said that it
regarded the door as "still open" for resuming talks with Syria
even though Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had turned down its
"Lebanon first" proposal.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, was commenting on Wednesday night on al-Assad's refusal
to Israel's "Lebanon first" initiative after his meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian port city of
Alexandria earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in a proposal conveyed to al-Assad via the U.S.,
recommended Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon before making
full peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, the Syrian president dismissed the offer, describing
it as providing little hope for resuming the peace talks, and
demanded a formula of "Syria and Lebanon first, at the same time
and in the same steps."
</P>
<P>
Bazak, in a statement, said that the Israeli government did not
regard al-Assad's remark as the last word and still awaited a
positive response from Damascus to Netanyahu's peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We clarified in the past and again that we are willing to
negotiate without prior conditions. Israel does not see Syria and
Lebanon as separate issues," Bazak said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Mubarak on Wednesday night phoned
Netanyahu to brief him on his talks with al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president, playing a leading mediator's role, has
been active in seeking a quick resumption of the Israeli-Arab
peace process on all tracks stalled since Netanyahu won the
Israeli elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at the joint press conference with al-Assad,
Mubarak said Israel's talks with Syria and Lebanon should be
reopened as soon as possible. He said that he believed Israel
wanted to renew talks, but a gap remained on the basis of future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have demanded the resumption of peace talks
based on relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of land-for-peace
while the Likud-led government of Israel insists on the "Lebanon
first" option.

Al-Assad said Netanyahu's proposal for resuming talks "did not
mention any formula which indicates to anybody that there is a
glimpse of hope for any future peace."
</P>
<P>
Syria is apparently worried that Netanyahu's offer would
derail peace moves launched at the 1991 Madrid peace
conference. It has consistently insisted that Israel should
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon and the Golan Heights
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government has ruled out compromise on its
self-claimed sovereignty on the Golan Heights, seized from Syria
in the 1967 War, under the pretext of protecting Israel's
security and water sources.

<HEADLINE> China Needs Modern Entrepreneurs: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Greater efforts should be made to
foster a generation of modern Chinese entrepreneurs to meet the
need of establishing an up-to-date enterprise system and better
managing state assets, Zhang Youcai, director of the State
Administration of State Property, said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the first national correspondence
training course for enterprise board members, Zhang said that
great changes have taken place in the operation and management
systems of China's state-owned enterprises since 1978.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of a modern enterprise system,
especially a modern corporate system, Chinese entrepreneurs are
being challenged to adopt new management concepts and upgrade
their bank of knowledge, said Zhang, who is also vice-minister of
finance.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, many enterprises have failed to
significantly improve their operation mechanism, though some of
them have been restructured into companies in which the state has
a stake that is sometimes controlling.
</P>
<P>
"An important factor is that our enterprises' management
concept and overall quality fall short of the demand of a
corporate system," Zhang explained, adding that "it is not
uncommon that our board members often know little."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of 302,000 state-owned enterprises whose
assets and capital volume have recently been appraised, only 7,325
have been restructured into corporates in which the state has a
controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming majority of China's state-owned enterprises in
the competitive sectors will be turned into corporations as the
country introduces a modern corporate system.
</P>
<P>
In response to the change, Zhang said, the system of board of
directors will become important for China's state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"And therefore, we must foster a contingent of new-type
entrepreneurs represented by board members," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the drawbacks in China's current regime of
training entrepreneurs are an important element behind the chronic
loss of state property in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue, Chinese enterprises should no longer focus
solely on capital management, and instead pay equal attention to
the management of capital and people, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The training course is attended by a total of 3,700 board
members across the country.

<HEADLINE> New Pattern Formed For Hangzhou's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou, a city considered to
be a famous tourist attraction in east China, has expanded the
focus of its tourism business from the West Lake to include newly
developed scenic sites.
</P>
<P>
The West Lake has long been the symbol of Hangzhou's renowned
scenery.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, city authorities have built and promoted other
scenic spots to further promote the area's tourism business. Two
of these - the Zhijiang National Tourism and Holiday Zone and the
Mount Xiaohe Forest Park -- have risen as new tourism centers.
</P>
<P>
Song City in Zhijiang Tourism and Holiday Zone, a theme park
featuring the customs and cultural characteristics of the Song
Dynasty, received an average of 20,000 visitors each day since it
opened to the public last year.
</P>
<P>
And the forest park on Mount Xiaohe is expected to be built
into a large holiday zone at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the three tourism centers have injected new
vitality into the local tourism business, according to Zheng
Xiefang, the city's top tourism official.
</P>
<P>
About 21 million domestic tourists and 360,000 from overseas
visited the city in 1995, contributing six billion yuan and 125
million US dollars, respectively, to Hangzhou's revenues from the
business.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambia Aims at Markets for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is targeting four regions
in the world as markets for its wide range of non-traditional
products.
</P>
<P>
The four destinations are the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), Europe, Asia especially the far east,
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is the largest among the four. Zambia exports to COMESA
member states its agricultural commodities such as maize, sugar and
soya bean.
</P>
<P>
Other exports to the region include building materials
comprising cement, pvc asbestos pipes and wood products.
</P>
<P>
Among the neighboring countries, Zaire is the largest single
importer of Zambia's non-traditional products followed by
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zambia exports cotton lint, coffee, tobacco and other primary
agricultural goods, textiles, gemstones, flowers, vegetables, west
blue leather crocodile skins and handcrafts to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Nethelands is the large European importer of Zambia's
horticultural products, Britain imports vegetables and textiles
from Zambia, Germany and Switzerland buy Zambia's textiles.
</P>
<P>
Zambia sells gemstones to Asian countries, especially to India
and the far east. Its products to the United States are
handcrafts and garments.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zambia has made efforts to develop
non-traditional exports from its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Most duty exemptions and suspensions are eliminated, duties
are lowered and tariff rates are restructured in this year's
budget speech of Finance Minister Ronald Penza.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the new set up, raw materials which
are duty free will maintain that status, duty on productive
machinery for agriculture and mining has been reduced from 20
percent to zero percent, duty on other raw materials and
productive machinery has been reduced from 20 percent to 5
percent, duty on intermediate goods has been reduced from 30
percent to 15 percent, and duty on final products has been
reduced from 40 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government is proposing the removal of
anomalies in the tariff within COMESA in order to make Zambian
producers more competitive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Thanks for the efforts to promote non-traditional production,
Zambia earned 200 million US Dollars from non-traditional exports
in 1995, marking a big jump from 69 million US Dollars in 1987.
Non-traditional exports both in value and volume are expected to
surpass that of last yerar.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Late Panchen Lama in Eyes of Old Friend (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Before he died in 1989, the 10th
Panchen Lama, a former religious leader in China, told a friend
that supporting the Communist Party of China for 40 years had
proved to be a wise choice.
</P>
<P>
That friend, Li Zuomin, has spoken out in response to recent
Western media reports that portray the late Panchen as a man
deeply prejudiced against the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), and
who claimed that the Party also was on its guard against him.
</P>
<P>
Li recently disclosed stories about the late Panchen Lama for
the first time to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Li, who speaks Tibetan, Chinese and English,
was the Panchen's translator and long-time close friend.
</P>
<P>
"Those reports are not true," Li said, "and as an old friend of
the Great Master Panchen, I should clarify the rumors."
</P>
<P>
Panchen Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincian was vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and
vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Li met the 12-year-old Panchen in 1950.
</P>
<P>
"Intelligent and steady, this is my first impression of the
Living Buddha," Li recalled.
</P>
<P>
Li gradually became an important figure in the Panchen's
entourage. Li said that the Panchen often called him "my old pal."
</P>
<P>
Li frequently traveled to Tibet with the Panchen. Li remembered
a trip they took through 33 counties of the Autonomous Region on
horseback. Because they were the only good riders in the group,
the rest usually lagged far behind, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Once, during an inspection tour, the Panchen asked Li to "work
as my personal secretary when I wrote my memoirs."
</P>
<P>
Li's last tour with the Panchen to Tibet was in 1989, when the
Panchen came to Zhaxi Lhunbo Monastery, residence of all Panchen
Lamas in Xigaze, to preside over the inauguration ceremony for a
new tower under which 5th through 9th Panchen Lamas are buried.
</P>
<P>
"He was excited, and somewhat nervous at the same time. He
attended to every detail himself and slept for no more than two
hours everyday," Li recalled.

<TEXT>
<P>
After the successful ceremony, the Panchen was too excited to
sleep and invited Li to his living room to talk. They chatted till
2 o'clock the next morning.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen told Li of his worries about the separatists, and
said he would continue to fight against them.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the joint burial of the previous five Panchen
Lamas had been his wish for a long time, and he thanked the
central government and the Tibet Autonomous Region for helping him
fulfill it.
</P>
<P>
He said that he faced a huge choice at the age of 11: the
Kuomintang Nationalists had arranged a flight to take him to
Taiwan, and at the same time the Tibet local government wanted him
to return to Tibet from Qinghai Province where he was enthroned.
</P>
<P>
He sent a representative to the People's Liberation Army and
the Central People's Government, under the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party, to learn the details of the situation. He
later declared his support for the central government and
expressed his hope for the early liberation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first major political decision I made," the
Panchen told Li.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen told Li that he felt uneasy about the flattery of
some scholars, but that he believed Li was unlike his
colleagues. "You are honest and I trust you," the Panchen told Li.
</P>
<P>
This was to be their last talk. The Panchen died of a heart
attack five days later, at the age of 51.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, I feel very sad about him," Li said, adding that
with the Panchen's death, he lost a true friend, and the state and
religious circles lost an outstanding leader.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent reports in the Western media that the
Panchen once said before his death that Tibet lost more than it
gained under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
Li refuted this in his recollection of the Panchen.

<P>
The Panchen was imprisoned for eight years during the Cultural
Revolution (1968-1978). Li said he regrets this, but explained
that the Cultural Revolution was a nationwide calamity, certainly
not intended particularly against Tibet, nor the Panchen
alone. Even the then Chinese president Liu Shaoqi died in prison,
where he was kept as a political prisoner during this period, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
When the Cultural Revolution ended, the central authorities
immediately announced the Panchen's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the Panchen said on the day he was returned to
his former post, that "should there not be the Chinese Communist
Party, I would not have been what I am today."
</P>
<P>
Li also told a story about the Panchen's last haircut. The day
before the ceremony for the joint burial of the five Panchen
Lamas, the 10th Panchen wanted his hair trimmed.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in Xigaze found a female hairdresser, whom they
considered to be the best in town. However, according to religious
traditions, women are not permitted to serve living buddhas.
</P>
<P>
Li said to the Panchen, "I'm a barber in my spare time, can I
help you?" He used the Panchen's homemade barber tools and gave
the leader a haircut for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Half a year after the Panchen's death, Li paid respects to his
friend's remains. "His muscles were still flexible, and his skin
looked as if he were still alive," Li recalled.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen's remains are in a gold tower in the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Monastery, which was built by the central government at a cost of
70 million yuan (10.29 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thai Shrimp Boats to Be Fixed with Turtle Extruders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- About 400 to 500 Thai
shrimp-catching boats are expected to be equipped with
turtle-extruders by the end of the month, the Thai Fisheries
Division said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is in response to the United States' ban on imports of
wild shrimps from countries that do not have turtle-extruder
devices installed on boats used in catching sea shrimps.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's shrimp prices have fallen by 32 percent due to the
ban, although most Thai shrimps sold to the U.S. are from shrimp
farms, the division said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Trade Department is organizing a three-day
seminar this week in Songkhla in southern Thailand to teach
fishermen to install and use turtle-extruders.
</P>
<P>
The government is also preparing to legislate the use of the
devices to avoid sale losses that could exceed 10 billion baht
(400,000 U.S. dollars) a year.

<HEADLINE> Vast Geothermal Resources Discovered in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Geothermal resources have been
spotted in 672 areas in Tibet, making it an important area
for geothermal research and utilization.
</P>
<P>
Widely-dispersed high-temperature geothermal resources were
discovered during investigations and research of geothermal fields
in Yangbajain, Nagqu, Lungjug and Yangyi, said Tibetan geologists
who attended the ongoing 30th International Geological Congress in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The temperature of 87 percent of the geothermal resources
discovered is higher than 90 degrees centigrade. Out of 672
geothermal spots, 140 are as hot as 150 degrees centigrade, or
higher.
</P>
<P>
The first geothermal well in Yangbajain has reported a
temperature of 329.8 degrees centigrade in a depth of 1,850
meters, which geologists said is rare.
</P>
<P>
Enormous heat energy has been stored in the course of
geological activities in the Himalayas, and is mainly released
across the ground surface of Tibet, the geologists explained.
</P>
<P>
Tibet Autonomous Region will build geothermal power stations on
some of the geothermal fields. The Yangbajain Geothermal Power
Plant, the largest in China, now provides more than half of the
electricity needed in winter in Lhasa, Tibet's capital.
</P>
<P>
In addition, huge geothermal resources in Tibet are waiting to
be utilized in many fields, using investment from home and abroad,
the geologists said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would uphold
sanctions against the military government of Burundi, the cabinet
decided yesterday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to appoint a special envoy to work with
representatives of other countries in a bid to restore democracy
in the strife-torn Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said yesterday the
appointment might be announced within a week.
</P>
<P>
Burundi was taken over by a military junta about two weeks
ago. The local press said the central African state might seek
outlets in South Africa to side-step sanctions once they were in
place.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told the press that South Africa "should then stop all
such loopholes".
</P>
<P>
A cabinet statement issued to the public today said Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and Nzo had visited Tanzania on monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They met Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and former
president Julius Nyerere to discuss the problems in Nurundi.
</P>
<P>
They also held talks with Secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa Salim Ahmed
Salim.
</P>
<P>
During these meetings, Mbeki were briefed on the efforts by
Nyerere and the OAU to resolve the crisis in Burundi, and on the
decision by a regional summit in Arusha on July 31 to impose
sanctions against Burundi's military government.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on Teaching Chinese Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth International Symposium
on Teaching Chinese as A Foreign Language opened in Beijing today,
with the aim of promoting the Chinese language worldwide.
</P>
<P>
About 400 scholars and language experts from 27 countries and
regions including the United States, France, Japan, Hong Kong and
Macao, as well as Taiwan Province of China, attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice-minister in charge of the State Education
Commission, said at the symposium that learning the Chinese
language provides the greatest potential for the world to know
about China, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in addition to Chinese universities, the
world now has more than 1,000 universities in 60 countries that
offer Chinese language courses.
</P>
<P>
More and more foreign students have come to China to learn
Chinese since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
China opened the first international symposium on teaching
Chinese as a foreign language in 1985, and the country has since
held the symposium every three years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid much attention to the
event. Premier Li Peng said at the third symposium in 1990 that
many countries know about China from English, and that he hoped more
foreigners will learn about China by studying Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The experts will also discuss Chinese language teaching
methods, teaching reform and Chinese culture research at the
symposium.
</P>
<P>
The five-day event was sponsored by the International Society
for Chinese Language Teaching, the China Society for Teaching
Chinese as A Foreign Language, and Beijing Language and Culture
University.

<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- American scientists announced Wednesday that they have
detected trails of life in a meteorite which fell from the Mars on
the South Pole 13,000 years ago. They found an extremely small
structure resembling bacteria on earth. It could be proof that
life had developed on the red planet 3.5 billion years ago. But
the scientists themselves said that the discovery has to be
verified.
</P>
<P>
-- After less than 48 hours of fighting, Chechen rebels have
taken control of the streets of Grozny and driven Russian troops
back.
</P>
<P>
-- In Haiti, the ceremonies of the Voodoo gods have turned into
a banquet for all with the dish and recipe interconnecting the
community. All the neighborhood are taking advantage of the
festival to have a big meal.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government Wednesday adopted an austerity draft
budget for 1997, freezing public spendings in the next year to the
level of the present year, which is around 1,552 billion francs
(310 billion U.S. dollars). Only education, labor, health and
justice ministries survive the austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
-- Scientists of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) of the United States announced Wednesday
that they have observed trails of bacteria life in a meteorite
which fell on the South Pole 13,000 years ago. The fragment of
rocket with trails of life originated from the Mars as is judged
from its apparence. Scientists are more and more convinced that
life can travel easily in space, leading to speculation of how
many planets in the universe are populated.
</P>
<P>
-- On the second day of fighting in Grozny, Chechen rebels have
controlled the streets of the city while fierce fighting continue
around key buildings fortified by Russian troops.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Fish Export to EU Expected to Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's fish export to the
European Union is expected to soar in the coming months, "the New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing sources in the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries, the paper said two more Ugandan firms
obtained late last month the export licence to EU coutries,
bringing the number of the east African country's fish exporting
plants to seven.
</P>
<P>
Fish export of Uganda has been rising since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Currently the highest demand for Ugandan fish is reportedly
coming from France. Other destinations include Italy, Belgium,
Netherlands, Kenya, Zaire and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Recent rise in demand of fish was prompted partly by the
mad-cow desease discovered in Britain that gripped Europe earlier
this year.

<HEADLINE> US Denies Eyeing New Military Base in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The US embassy here denied reports
that Washington is negotiating with Manila to set up a military
base in Mindanao, southern Philippines, the Philippine Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, US embassy Press Attache Bruce Byers
also said on Wednesday that there are no negotiations for
refueling or ship servicing arrangements in Mindanao for American
ships.
</P>
<P>
"The report is baseless. there is no official US government
interest in or plan to set up any kind of base (anywhere in the
Philippines), these reports are just speculations," Byers said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know the source of the news stories, which
reported that Washington was supporting the creation of the
proposed southern Philippines council for peace and development in
exchange for a new basing arrangement in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were unofficial negotiations going on, Byers
replied: "no. None."
</P>
<P>
After the Philippine senate refused to extend the Philippine-US
military bases agreement, the US troops were forced to withdraw
from all its six bases in 1991 and 1992, ending its 93 years of
military presentation in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the US navy ships have been making port calls in
Manila and Subic Bay. Singapore has also offered its port for ship
repairs, and the Americans continue to maintain a base in Okinawa
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Things are subject to change," Byers acknowledged, but added
that Washington has no plans "at this time" to negotiate for a new
basing arrangement with Manila.
</P>
<P>
The reports that the United States is eyeing the establishment
of a new military base in Mindanao has raised the anger and
protest of the Philippine public.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia Affected Little by Export Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Statistics have shown
disappointing export performances in many Asian countries and
regions so far this year, but the setback seems unlikely to have
any severe impact on their economy, which looks strong to sustain
its healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics prepared by Asian
governments or economic research institutions, export growth has
declined from 1995's galloping pace in many parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Thailand's year-on-year export
growth rate dropped from 24 percent last year to six percent,
South Korea from 33.2 percent to 11.8 percent, and China's Taiwan
from 23 percent to 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the region, export growth rates in the first
quarter slowed to six percent from 20 percent in Hong Kong, to 17
percent from 23 percent in Malaysia, and to 10 percent from 20
percent in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In East Asia, only the Philippines' export kept close to last
year's pace, registering a 26 percent gain, slightly below last
year's 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Causes of the export downturn are varied. Many analysts put
part of the blame on a weakening electronics market. In
Singapore, for example, non-oil exports fell by six percent in
June from a year earlier because two thirds of them depended on
the electronic industry.
</P>
<P>
According to investment house Crosby Securities, Singapore's
non-oil domestic export growth will slow to around nine percent in
the second half of the year due to the lower demand for
electronics.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, exports fell by 3.1 percent in July from a year
earlier as overseas shipments declined in semiconductors. A
similar story also took place in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that to a certain degree, the export slowdown is
a statistical sleight of hand. They noted that the dollar's
weakness and the yen's strengthening in the early months of 1995
had exaggerated Asia's export growth measured in dollars last
year, just as this year's stronger dollar and weaker yen
exaggerated the slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in Asian exports could also be attributed to
rising wages that make their products less competitive, and a drop
in imports by their major partners in Japan, the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in Asian exports could push some Asian
economies into unsustainable balance of payments deficits, which
in turn could undermine foreign investors' confidence and cause a
Mexican-style currency crisis, some analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
But economists generally expect a brighter picture in the
region, arguing that some slowdown in expanding the gross domestic
product (GDP) is needed in at least parts of Asia where there are
signs of overheating, such as rising inflation and labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
Many economists predicted that Asian economies would grow at a
slower pace this year but they would remain sustainable and
healthy despite the export declines.
</P>
<P>
In January, London-based Consensus Economics Inc., after
surveying more than 120 experts on the Asian-Pacific region, had
forecast that real GDP expansion in Northeast Asia would moderate
to 7.8 percent this year from 8.9 percent last year and that of
Southeast Asia to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey dated July 15, the Consensus regional
forecast figures were much the same as half a year ago despite the
weak export figures for Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Possible Large Gold Mines in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Geological structures that
indicate the presence of both a large and an extra-large gold mine
have been discovered in western areas of Mount Tianshan, in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Institute of Remote Sensing Applications
(IRSA) reported the findings after analyzing satellite and
remote-sensing data, researching remote-sensing data from gold
mines near similar structures in bordering countries, and taking
samples from selected areas, according to Wang Zhigang, an
associate researcher at the institute, which is linked to the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang said an extra-large gold mine usually has a gold reserve
above 100 tons; a large gold mine has more than 20 tons.
</P>
<P>
The research of large precious-metal and nonferrous-metal mines
in Xinjiang is one of China's 50 major state scientific and
technological research projects during the country's Eighth
Five-Year Plan period, from 1990 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, IRSA led the country in applying remote
sensing procedures to precious-metal and nonferrous-metal mine
exploration. Earlier, IRSA researchers found a large gold mine and
a large tin ore mine in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The institute recently sent another group of scientists to the
western Kunlun-Altun Mountain area in Xinjiang to begin a
three-year investigation of large precious-metal and
nonferrous-metal mines.
</P>
<P>
Chinese departments of geology, nonferrous metal and metallurgy
have applied the remote sensing in exploration.

<P>
KUNMING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A large deep-processing company
for potatoes will be established in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, to beef up the province's program to develop local
biological resources.
</P>
<P>
Located in Xuanwei, famous for its annual potato production of
250 million kg, the company will be jointly formed by the Sanjiu
Group, the province's biological resources development project
office and the local government.
</P>
<P>
The company will be set up at a cost of 10 million yuan, of
which six million yuan will come from the Sanjiu Group.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the company is expected to generate
more than 500 million yuan in annual output value, which will help
200,000 destitute people in the region overcome poverty.
</P>
<P>
Sanjiu Group, one of China's top 100 large firms, has 61
subsidiaries. It generated 1.6 billion yuan in output value and
more than 200 million yuan in pre-tax profits in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In order to exploit the local abundant biological resources,
the provincial government will invest four billion yuan into 18
biological projects, which are expected to bring in 10
billion yuan in output value by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province currently has invested 457 million yuan in ten of
the projects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Urged to Improve Breast-Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- the Indonesian Consumers
Protection Foundation (YLKI) today called on the government to
improve its campaign on breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement published today in commemoration of the
international breast-feeding week which falls on August 7, the
foundation said breast-feeding is the best step to develop the
quality of Indonesian human resources.
</P>
<P>
Bottle-fed babies are not only twice more prone to cancer than
breast-fed ones, but also likely to die from diarrhea, the
foundation said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a study made by Cambridge University's
Child Health Department, the foundation said breast-fed children
have IQs 8.3 points higher than those bottle-fed.
</P>
<P>
However, the foundation noted that despite the advantages of
mother's milk on babies, the number of women breast-feeding their
babies ironically tends to decline.
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted by the foundation from 1993 to 1994 indicated
that only 15.7 percent of mothers in the country surveyed
breast-fed their new-born babies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a study conducted in 1995 by the Jakarta-based
Atmajaya University shows that 5.7 percent of mothers in Jakarta
and its environs breast-fed their babies from birth to four
months.

Lamasery to form their village, named Rongmatsan.
</P>
<P>
The Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery was built in 1447, and is one of the
six most famous centers of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism.
It formerly owned many farming areas, one of which is Rongmatsan.
</P>
<P>
Some lamas worked on the farmland, but their status was lower
than that of others who recited scriptures in the temple.
</P>
<P>
"Under the government's religious policy, we are free to choose
whether to leave the temple or not," said Tobje, a former lama,
now a village leader. "So most of us settled here and began a
completely new life."
</P>
<P>
He said the village now has 27 households and a population of
more than 100. Most of the families have built new homes, and a
primary school has also been set up.
</P>
<P>
"Our living conditions are now much better than before," he
said.
</P>
<P>
From the school comes the sound of children reading out
loud. Hearing this, Tobje said, "Our new generation will go to
colleges and see the outside world. In the old days we only had
ourselves. Now we truly feel that we all have a future."

<HEADLINE> Australia calls for Renewed Relationship with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer today called for a renewed relationship between
Malaysia and Australia that will offer unprecedented opportunities
for mutual advancement.
</P>
<P>
Australia and Malaysia are entering "an exciting new stage" in
their relationship, defined by transformation in both countries
and by historic changes in the Asia Pacific region, he said in a
talk on "Australia-Malaysia Relations: Cooperating for a Better
Future" at the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Downer, who arrived yesterday for a four-day visit, said "we
not only have longstanding ties but, as young and dynamic
economies, Australia and Malaysia have common interests in the
Asia Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's relations with Australia hit a low point in late
1993 after the then Australian prime minister Paul Keating called
his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad a "recalcitrant" for
not attending the first Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the new Australian government wanted to get the
political foundations of the relationship right from the
beginning. "That is why (Australian) Prime Minister John Howard
and I were delighted to meet Prime Minister Mahathir so early in
the term of the new Australian government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Howard met Mahathir in Brisbane early this year when the later
made a stopover after a visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
On political and security cooperation, Downer said what was
needed now is strengthening the political dialogue at the
ministerial level. "Closer cooperation at the bilateral level will
naturally strengthen both countries' joint efforts in the region,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian minister described the bilateral trade and
investment as "impressive" and reflecting the changes in the
respective economies and said the opportunities to expand trade
are "enormous".
</P>
<P>
On regional economic cooperation, he said Australia would
welcome Malaysian participation in the South Pacific forum's
post-forum dialogue process.

HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Coffee production in Zimbabwe is
this year expected more than doubled to an estimated 11,000
tonnes of "excellent quality" beans following a good rain season.
</P>
<P>
"Reaping is presently taking place and it is evident that a
large percentage of the coffee is of gourmet standard, which is
very much the result of good management on the part of our
growers," said Chairman of the Coffee Growers Association David
Scott.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a congress of the Commercial Farmers Union in
Harare on Wednesday, Scott said production last year was 4,000
tonnes of green coffee as a result of the 1994 black frosts.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Allowed to Be Listed on KLSE Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government has
approved that foreign companies would be allowed to be listed on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) market to enable it to
expand its capital raising capability.
</P>
<P>
The government approval for the listing of foreign companies on
the KLSE was announced here today by deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, foreign companies with substantial foreign
assets or operations but owned or controlled by Malaysians would
be listed as foreign companies on the KLSE main board and shares
of the companies would be listed and traded in ringgit (local
currency).
</P>
<P>
Anwar said at a social function that detailed guidelines
concerning the listing conditions, disclosure and accounting
requirements and corporate governance were being prepared by the
KLSE and the Security Commission and would be announced earlier
than next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the guidelines would be stiff as the government will
not allow any company with minimum track record or asset to be
listed here to ensure the market is credible and the relevant
authorities would monitor the foreign companies' activities.
</P>
<P>
In line with the gradual liberalization of the market, he said,
the approval is intending to gradually widen the scope of foreign
companies allowed for listing beyond those allowed under the first
phase.
</P>
<P>
The approval for listing is to further enhance the Malaysian
capital market and to position Kuala Lumpur as a regional
financial center, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Peace Talks to Resume in Jakarta Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) are set to initial their
final peace agreement during the fourth round of peace talks on
August 28 in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today, George Asi, MNLF liaison
officer for Southern Mindanao, said that legal experts from the
two panels are rushing to fine-tune details of the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indonesian government, being the host of the
talks, have set the date after several postponements.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari said earlier that their group is only
waiting for the advice on the schedule of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, we are ready to sign the peace
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that the government and the MNLF have
resolved two contentious issues hindering a final peace pact. The
two stumbling blocks to a final peace agreement are the creation
of a regional security force in Mindanao as well as the
integration of MNLF fighters into the government army and the
national police.
</P>
<P>
The government reportedly conceded to the MNLF demand for the
integration of 5,500 rebels into the army and another 2,000
fighters into the police force.
</P>
<P>
After the peace pact is initialed in Jakarta, it will be
finally signed in Manila.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Diplomat:Turkey to Sign Gas Deal with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to sign a 20 billion
U.S. dollars agreement to transfer Iran's gas to Turkey for 25
years during the forthcoming visit by Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, a Turkish diplomat disclosed here today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that Turkish Energy and Natural Resources
Minister Recai Kutan arrived here this morning to make
preparations for Erbakan to sign the document.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the
Turkish energy minister is to meet his Iranian counterpart
today. The two sides will discuss the details of the big gas deal.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey have said that the imminent visit to Tehran by
Turkish Prime Minister Erbakan would be as an illuminating
prelude to the expansion of Tehran-Ankara trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the visit would improve the
relations between the two countries, which were strained since
Turkey signed a military accord with Israel in February, under
which Israeli Air Force is allowed to train in Turkish skies.
</P>
<P>
However, there will not be any dramatic change in the
political relations between Tehran and Ankara since there are
still some problems in such fields as religion and borders between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat said that the Ankara-Tehran ties can not be changed
overnight and the trend will be up and down.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Iran's First Vice President Hassan
Habibi, Prime Minister Erbakan will pay a two-day visit to Iran
from Saturday as the head of a high-ranking political and
economic delegation.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the visit, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi said the trip is the Turkish prime minister's
first overseas visit since he took office. He will hold talks with
Iran's top government officials on issues of mutual interest,
bilateral relations, regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that during the visit, the two sides will
exchange views on ways of expanding bilateral economic relations
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister is accompanied by 200 high-ranking
officials and reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman did not mention the signing of the
gas contract.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Iran and Turkey failed to reach the gas
deal to transfer Iran's gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Sinasi Altinar, former Turkish minister of energy and natural
resources, said that the two sides had agreed on 99 percent of
the agreement, but there was still one percent left unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Turkey will pay 20 billion dollars for
buying gas from Iran in the next 25 years. But the Turkish
official did not specify the cost of building a 1,319
kilometers gas pipeline from Iran to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the contract, Iran will initially export some 2
billion cubic meters of gas annually, starting from the year 1,999,
and will increase the volume to 10 billion cubic meters by 2,006.
</P>
<P>
In April 1995, Iran and Turkey signed a memorandum of
understanding for sale of Iran's gas to Turkey as well as setting
up a gas pipeline between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> China Destination Marketing Council Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The China Destination Marketing
Council recently was launched by Chinese and overseas tourist
circles in a move to broaden the country's travel industry.
</P>
<P>
Founded during a meeting in Hainan Province of the China
National Tourism Administration (CNTA) and the World Travel and
Tourism Council (WTTC), the council is designed to consider
actions that will expand China's travel market through research,
product development and coordination between the public and
private sector's destination marketing programs.
</P>
<P>
The council brings together top executives of Chinese and
international travel companies, and senior Chinese tourism
officials. The Hong Kong Tourism Association and the Pacific Asia
Travel Association will also participate.
</P>
<P>
The discussions at the Hainan meeting focused on the forecasts
for China's International and domestic travel in the coming years,
and effective economic measures to encourage market development,
sustainability and service.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also exchanged views on a wide range of issues,
including improved air services, simplified visa processes and new
market opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting set in place an international cooperation
mechanism to consolidate the strong growth momentum in China's
travel and tourism markets seen in recent years, and the new
council will help China enhance its tourism products and promote
its image more broadly in the world," said CNTA Vice-Chairman
Cheng Wengdong.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Lipman, President of WTTC who co-chaired the Hainan
meeting, said, "China is destined to be one of the world's top
travel destinations in the 21st century, with a wealth of unique
cultural, scenic and resort attractions."
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996, travel and tourism will generate more
than seven percent of China's gross domestic products (GDP) --
about 50 billion US dollars. This figure is expected to jump
fourfold over the next decade, which is twice the global average
growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new council will advance understanding of the
enormous benefits of travel and tourism for China's economy and
identify ways to eliminate barriers to competitiveness in the
global marketplace.

<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A selection of 300 English poems
with Chinese translations was published Wednesday to serve Chinese
readers.
</P>
<P>
The book, published by the International Culture Publishing
Co., contains poems from Britain and America.
</P>
<P>
Poems selected by Chinese translator Gu Zixin include ancient
folk rhymes from England and Scotland, as well as modern
poems. The poems are regarded as outstanding pieces in their
native countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Gu has effectively translated the English
poems into Chinese in a way that is faithful to the original
meaning of the compositions and is also clear to readers.
</P>
<P>
With both English and Chinese versions, the book will help
readers improve their ability to understand the English language,
and also expose them to what many Westerners believe is great
writing.
</P>
<P>
In China, a selection of 300 ancient poems composed by poets
who lived during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) has been very popular.
</P>
<P>
Gu and his publishers hope the translated poems will promote
poetry and further the exchange of Chinese and Western culture.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Fighters Attack Hezbollah Base in Eastern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli fighter-bombers launched
two successive air raids earlier this morning at a base of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, no words of
casualties has been given by police sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources in Baalbek, the biggest Shiite Moslem city in the
Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, said that the Israeli warplanes
carried out the airstrikes at Hezbollah guerrillas on the
outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
The first air raid took place at 2:45 a.m. (23:45 GMT) and the
second an hour later, during which the Israeli jet fighters fired
air-to-surface missiles at a hilltop transmitting station of
Hezbollah's radio, some five kilometers southeast of Baalbek and
destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio claimed that the air raids came in retaliation for
the killing of an Israeli soldier and the wounding of several
others in operations mounted by Hezbollah guerrillas in the
Israeli self-claimed "security zone" in southern Lebanon since the
week.
</P>
<P>
Big fires were inflamed on the hill targeted by the Israeli
warplanes, the police sources added, noting that informations on
casualties were not available at the moment because Hezbollah
militants have blocked the venue since the incident.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that its guerrillas fired
anti-air weapons at the invading planes, but missed the targets.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for Israel to use its air forces to
attack Hezbollah bases near Baalbek, some 90 kilometers east of
Beirut, since a cease-fire was enforced in southern Lebanon on
April 27.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces shelled Wednesday afternoon Iglim Al-Tofah, a
mountain area some 50 kilometers southeast of Beirut which is
often used by Shiite Moslem guerrillas of Hezbollah as a
springboard for hit-and-run attacks at Israel's buffer zone in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery bombarded a number of hills and heights
in the area, especially Jebal Rafih and Wadi Akhdar and the
bombardment went through the evening.
</P>
<P>
A volley of artillery shells surprisedly hit a densely

BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A book on the ethics of the

<P>
The book is the first of its kind in the country, and is
replacing press regulations set by many press organizations.

Edited by the All-China Journalists' Association, the book is
one of a series of books on professional ethics education in
China, which is sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.

<P>
The book adopts the thinking, ideas and methods of Marxist
press theory, and systematically illustrates the history,
characteristics, roles, principles and regulations of the
professional ethics that are to guide the Chinese press.

</P>
<P>
The book is expected to influence the establishment of an
ethics system for the Chinese press, and to help tighten the
supervision over the media, and strengthen the self-discipline of
journalists and others who work in the field.

LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- An England soccer official said on
Wednesday that players in the English first, second and third
divisions should exercise the right to strike if the growing dispute
over Sky Television cash is not resolved to their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Brian Marwood, commercial executive with the Professional
Footballers' Association (PFA) and a former England international
said that club chairmen had reneged on a deal that was struck 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think any situation can be resolved, but the problem is that
a lot of football chairmen come into the game on a short-term
basis," Marwood told BBC Radio. "They put their investment into
football and are looking for a quick return."
</P>
<P>
Marwood also expressed his anger that clubs who have received
financial help from the PFA during times of hardship now seem to
be turning their back on the union.
</P>
<P>
And he revealed: "We can't predict how many players will vote
to back a strike action but, when we went down this road with the
Premier League a few years ago, 97 percent of players were in
agreement."

<HEADLINE> Leaking Houses in Beijing Get Reconstructed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials and workers from
Beijing's housing administration service are busy repairing leaks
in walls, floors and roofs, taking advantage of the sunshine after
a week of heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Many of the leaking houses were repaired temporarily while the
rain continued. Now they are being fixed properly or reconstructed
to withstand any future downpours, officials with the Municipal
Bureau of Land and Housing Administration said.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" reports that continuous rain caused many
houses across the capital, both single-storey and high-rise
buildings, to leak or even partially collapse. Figures on the
number of homes affected are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
The situation was particularly serious in the Xuanwu and
Chongwen districts, in which there are more traditional one-storey
houses than in other districts of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted an official with Xuanwu District's
housing administration as saying that the office had received 100
phone calls a day about leaks.
</P>
<P>
The rain on Monday night alone caused problems in 1,900 houses
in Chongwen District, but no casualties were reported thanks to
timely evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Health Bureau warned that drinking water and food
supplies can easily become polluted after heavy rain. Some
preventive measures against infectious diseases have already been
adopted.

<HEADLINE> Nepali lawmaker Calls for Separation of Bhutanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali lawmaker has called
the government to separate Bhutanese refugees in eastern Nepal
from local communities by surrounding refugee camps with wire
fence.
</P>
<P>
Guru Baral, MP of the opposition Communist Party of Nepal
(UML), made the call at the Lower House on Wednesday, saying that
more than 25 percent Bhutanese refugees in Nepal had been involved
in marital relationships with local Nepali citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to a newspaper report today, he also suggested to
issue identity cards to refugees so as to track them down easily
when the time comes to send them back to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lahani said on
Wednesday that the Bhutanese refugees will be kept in the camps
till they are repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will resume talks with Bhutan on the issue of nearly
100,000 refugees living in eight camps in eastern Nepal's Morang
and Jhapa districts since 1990, Lohani said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, seven rounds of bilateral talks between the two
countries had made no progress in the solution of the refugee
problem, which was triggered six years ago after the Bhutanese
authorities adopted a "one nation one people" policy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Bhutanese, mostly of Nepalese origin,
had since flooded into Nepal via India and settled in eastern
Nepal, causing much headache to Nepal with social and security
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government is making efforts to draw international
attention to the Bhutanese refugee problem in Nepal.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has imposed a jail
sentence of seven years and a fine of 150,000 rupee (2,730 US
dollars) for those found guilty of devastating the country's
forests, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Offenders will also have to pay a compensation of 200,000 rupee
(3,640 US dollars) to the government, the reports said, adding
that the vehicles used by them will be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Among the offenses listed are the setting fire to forests or
destroying them in any other manner, such as stealing timber from
them.
</P>
<P>
The Forest Department noted that it is necessary to take such
drastic punitive action because the vast erosion of forest cover
through the years has created an imbalance in the rainfall
schedule and resulted in a severe electricity shortage.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the forest coverage in Sri Lanka has
dropped to the current 20 percent from the 70 percent at the start
of this century due to illegal jungles clearing.

coexistence based on social justice."
</P>
<P>
The negotiators expressed their satisfaction over the signing
of the accord on the socio-economic aspects and agrarian situation
of the country.

A senior U.N. official said that the United Nations was
satisfied to have received the decision to sign a definitive peace
accord for Guatemala.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Court Orders Release of Detained General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A court of appeal in
Paraguay today ordered the release on bail of former army chief
Lino Oviedo for lack of evidence for his alleged role in an April
coup, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The court's decision brought ministers to an urgent meeting in
the government seat. President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and his
ministers refused to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The decision to free Oviedo came just a few days before the
internal elections of the ruling Colorado Party to choose
candidates for mayors and governors throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo was taken into custody on June 14 this year in
connection with a barracks revolt against President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo holed up in the barracks on April 22-23 in defiance of
the president's order to resign. He threatened to topple the
president with the tanks under his control, but later backed down
when offered the post of defense minister in exchange for his
resignation -- an offer Wasmosy later withdrew.
</P>
<P>
The general became famous in a 1989 coup which ended the
36-year dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessmer. He helped
Wasmosy become the first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources pointed out that investigation into the case
will continue in spite of the court's decision.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan security forces
launched a massive operation in and around the capital city of
Colombo and rounded up over 100 Tamil rebel suspects in the past
two days, according to security sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The operation, covering all the crowded zones in Colombo and
its suburbs, followed information that some leaders of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had infiltrated into the
city, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, several teams of police officers are carrying out
surveillance around possible rebel targets, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
At least 78 people were killed and some 500 others injured in
Dehiwala near Colombo last month in the explosion of a train bomb
allegedly installed by LTTE rebels, who are fighting for a
separate Tamil state in the north-east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Germans Angry With U.S. Sanctions Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Germans, long considered docile
allies of the Americans since World War II, finally rose to utter
their anger as well as anxiety, led by a tirade from the press
today.
</P>
<P>
Headlines and editorials lashing out at the U.S. Iran-Libya
Sanctions Act filled newspapers, from national broadsheets to
local tabloids.
</P>
<P>
Readers were bombarded with such stories as "American Crusaders
on Their Way," "War on a Wrong Front," "Provocation by (Bill)
Clinton," "Clinton Runs Counter to All Norms" and "Anxiety Clouds
European Union."
</P>
<P>
Newspapers Die Welt, Frankfurter Allgemeine, Sueddeutsche
Zeitung and General-Anzeiger led the media denunciation, joined by
a score of others such as Berliner Zeitung, Der Tagesspiegel,
Berliner Morgenpost and Neues Deutscheland, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
All the newspapers were airing anger and anxiety in reaction to
Clinton's signing into law the anti-Iran and Libya bill and to
(U.S. State Department Spokesman) Nicholas Burns' cynicism about
Germany's relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Though the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act was much watered down for
fear of perplexing U.S. allies, especially the European Union
countries which get one-fifth of their crude oil supplies from
Iran, the U.S. president still made it a punishable act of any
non-U.S. company doing business with Iran or Libya, both of which
the U.S. State Department has put on its list of nations alleged
to sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
What the State Department spokesman did seemed to have added
insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
Burns asked Germany to avoid a U.S. clampdown by dropping the
"critical dialogue" it has maintained with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Then German companies would be exempted from the sanctions, the
spokesman said, adding that if any European country decides in the
next couple of months to take concerted action against Iran or
Libya, its companies could possibly receive a waiver from the
sanctions act.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spokesman went even so far as to say that "If the
Europeans don't want to go along with us they should at least get
out of the way," Frankfurter Allgemeine reported.
</P>
<P>
Die Welt (The World) quoted Friedhelm Ost, chairman of the
German Parliament's economic committee, as telling a newspaper
interviewer: "It is really an unusual method that a superpower
passes laws and announces that the entire world must abide by them.
</P>
<P>
"It is overt infringement upon the sovereignty of other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such views were common in the newspaper editorials, which
maintain that the U.S. move, like the previous Helms-Burton
legislation against Cuba, illustrates U.S. attempts at domination.
</P>
<P>
The German press was worried that if Uncle Sam goes on to act
as he prefers, a trade war may have to be fought across the
Atlantic and instead of closing ranks, the NATO allies will have
to suffer from an in-fighting among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The deepest worry, however, is that if the Europeans bowed to
the Americans this time, it would only encourage the U.S. to act
without heeding the opinions or feelings of its allies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The German parliamentary committee chief said that the United
States should not exaggerate its seemingly unrestrained role and
power and that it is unacceptable for a superpower to try to call
the shot wherever it wants and police the whole world for others.

MADRID, August 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people were killed and
86 others injured in flash floods which deluged a camping site in
the Pyrenees mountains, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The floods, caused by two days of torrential rains during
Spain's vacation season, swept through the Las Nieves camp site at
the foot of a mountain near Biescas, some 30 kilometers from the
French border.
</P>
<P>
The campsite was packed with some 700 tourists, when an
avalanche struck.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers evacuated hundreds of victims Wednesday to a
sports stadium in Biescas, and at least 40 people have been
admitted to a hospital in the nearby town of Jaca.
</P>
<P>
Officials feared that the death toll would rise as rescue
efforts continued.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows Slowly in Latin America: UNDP Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- An official of the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) said here today that Latin
America's economy has been growing too slowly in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Zumbado, the Costa Rican Latin American and the
Caribbean regional director for the UNDP, said in a report that
the economic growth rate in the region was 1.8 percent and not a
single country there achieved a sustained growth rate of 3 percent
required to double its per-capita income in one generation.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 31 countries in the region now have the highest
per-capita income in their history.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bahamas,
Bolivia, Guyana and Peru are worse off now than they were in 1960,
as far as income is concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
The director attributed this to effects of a serious crisis in
the last decade, a widening income gap and a low investment rate.
</P>
<P>
The income gap between the richest 20 percent and the poorest
20 percent in Asian countries does not exceed a ratio of 8:1 while
that ratio can rise as high as 32:1 in Latin America, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Investment accounts for more than 30 percent of the gross
domestic product in several Asian countries, but the rate is
hardly 20 percent in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP regional director pinned hopes of faster economic
development in the region on education and much-needed structural
reforms.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard
today put the damage caused by the recent flooding to his province
at around 440 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard said both the local and federal governments will have
to grant upward of 300 million dollars to help rebuild homes,
businesses and farm ranches that have been destroyed in the
Saguenay region, 250 kilometers north of Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed as swollen rivers overflowed their
banks on July 20 and 21 in Saguenay and drove 12,000 people away
from their homes. There are some 300 people still staying in
emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people were left without electricity and
telephone service while flooded roads cut off traffic between
neighborhood communities and towns in central and eastern Quebec.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Says Sanctions Cannot Eradicate Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today urged other nations to take coordinated actions in combating
terrorism, saying that "sanctions cannot eradicate terrorism."
</P>
<P>
During an interview with America's Cable News Network (CNN),
Prodi said, "Anti-terrorism actions should not contradict the
interests of Western nations."
</P>
<P>
Prodi stressed that the European Union (EU) should make a
common reply to the so-called d'Amato Law of the United States
that threatens to punish foreign companies making new investments
of over 40 million U.S. dollars in the energy sector in Iran and
Libya, which are accused by the U.S. of sponsoring terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Italian companies could be among those most at risk as Iran and
Libya provide almost 45 percent of the 85 million tons of oil
imported annually by the country.
</P>
<P>
Prodi pointed out that the unilateral U.S. decision ran counter
to the spirit of the G-7's anti-terrorism meeting held last month
in Paris, at which participants agreed to stand together to combat
terrorism. The U.S. decision was "inefficient" and would increase
the danger of a conflict between the EU and the U.S., Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local reports said Prodi exchanged views on the
issue with French President Jacques Chirac in a telephone talk
tonight.
</P>
<P>
In another development, several Italian parties voiced strong
condemnation of the U.S. legislation.
</P>
<P>
Marco Pezzoni, a politician from the Democratic Party of the
Left, said today that "it is wrong for the (Bill) Clinton
administration to impose sanctions on Iran and Libya." He
described the move as an error similar to the one the
U.S. government had committed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Party of Communist Refoundation of Italy, the
Northern League and the Forza Italia also put their signatures on
Pezzoni's speech at the Italian Parliament to show their support.
</P>
<P>
Alfio Nicotra, who is responsible for peace affairs of the
Party of Communist Refoundation of Italy, today released a
statement, calling on the Prodi government to forbid any country
to use NATO and U.S. military bases in Italy to deal with any
possible consequences of the anti-Iran and Libya sanction act.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Press Lashes U.S. Sanctions on Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting international
protest against the United States' sanctions on foreign investment
in Iran and Libya, the Austrian press today condemned the law and
called on Europe to hit back against this "despotic
neocolonialism".
</P>
<P>
The electoral motive behind President Bill Clinton's signing of
the law was so obvious that it not only annoyed friends of the
United States, but would probably create opposition, a commentary
in Die Presse said.
</P>
<P>
It said that although no one with any sense would object to a
government's effort to combat terrorism, the way the United States
imposed its policy on others was "disgusting", which "reminds
people of the neocolonialism of a superpower acting like a world
police".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton signed a bill on Monday punishing
foreign companies investing 40 million U.S. dollars or more a year
in the oil or gas industries in Iran and Libya, which the U.S. has
accused of sponsoring international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The move has sparked a worldwide outcry.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union (EU), which imports a fifth of its
crude oil from Iran and Libya, said it is concerned about the
impact of the extra-territorial law and is preparing retaliatory
measures.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is not weak and easy to bully," the article said,
calling on all EU members to react against "Washington's
interference in other countries' domestic affairs and despotic
punishment of foreign companies".
</P>
<P>
It said Europe is justified in retaliating since the law
affects its trade. "The United States itself, anyway, does not
care much about human rights whenever money is concerned," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel said Tuesday that
his country has taken "very serious diplomatic measures" against
"the unilateral U.S. measures" which would inflict losses of
hundreds of millions of dollars on Austrian business.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Japan, China and Australia also joined the
international condemnation, calling the legislation as a violation
of free-trade rules under the World Trade Organization.

on the charge of causing a loss to the state Commercial Bank by
opening nine letters of credit (LCs) in the bank between February
1994 and June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Those accused include the then chairman and general manager of
the bank, Guru Prasad Neupane, and proprietors of six local
trading firms.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption commission claimed damages to the bank
equivalent to 1.66 million U.S. dollars and demanded a maximum
punishment for the accused.
</P>
<P>
In the 14 months to last October, a series of LC frauds had
caused a loss of 10 million U.S. dollars in Nepal's customs
revenue and swindled out some 36 million U.S. dollars of foreign
exchange from the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An investigation report, commissioned by the Finance Ministry,
has reportedly found that some 100 individuals, 175 firms and
almost all the commercial banks in the capital were involved in
the banking scandal.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Develops Mining with Private, Foreign Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government is
cooperating with the local private sector and foreign
entrepreneurs on mining projects to meet domestic needs, boost
exports and generate more jobs, the official daily New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Mines Lieut. Gen. Kyaw Min made the remark
Wednesday at a signing ceremony of a contract between the
ministry's Myanmar Mining Enterprise and the local private Haw
Seng Mining Co. Ltd. on mining lead and zinc ore in Muse and
Kutkai townships of Shan state.
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Min said that his ministry has formed several joint
ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs to boost mining
production.
</P>
<P>
The government has allowed local private individuals,
organizations and cooperative societies to participate in the
process of mining since 1991 and has invited technical know-how
and investments from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 foreign companies from five countries are
involved in conducting mineral prospecting and exploration in
Myanmar. The five countries are Australia, Canada, Singapore,
Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, foreign investment
in the country's mining sector exceeded 322 million U.S. dollars
in 28 projects as of the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings of Myanmar's mining sector amounted to 174.56
million kyats (29 million U.S. dollars) in the 1995-96 fiscal year
while the sector's annual gross product is projected at 726.1
million kyats (121 million U.S. dollars) for the 1996-97 fiscal.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Denies U.S. Seeking to Oust Samper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to
Colombia Myles Frechette today reiterated that the United States
is not trying to oust President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the two countries had gone through a very
difficult period, with the U.S. continuing to allege that Samper
used money from the Cali drugs cartel to finance his campaign for
the 1994 presidential election and revoking the president's
U.S. visa last month.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "I am determined to do everything I can to ensure
that cooperation continues."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat was speaking at the Jose Maria Cordoba school
of cadets on Army Day.
</P>
<P>
He said new mechanisms are being sought to fortify the war
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"As you all know, the United States will continue to provide
aid for the war against drug trafficking. In the past two weeks, I
had been discussing anti-drug cooperation issues with Colombian
Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia and Defense Minister Juan Carlos
Esguerra in Washington, " Frechette said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Colombia and the U.S. have deteriorated
sharply over the past year, amid charges that Samper used drug
money to fund his 1994 campaign. Although an investigation by
Colombia's Congress in June cleared Samper of any wrongdoing in
connection with his campaign, the U.S. continues to believe that
he has helped drug traffickers.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- World number two Thomas Muster
of Austria breezed past Poland's Wojtek Kowalski 6-1, 6-1 to reach
the third round of the 2.2 million U.S. dollar ATP Championships
in Mason, Ohio, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Former French Open champion Muster, well known as a clay-court
expert, needed only 50 minutes to brush aside the 28-year-old
Pole, ranked 217th on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
World's third ranked American Michael Chang, winner of his past
two events, also moved into the third round after winning 6-2,
4-6, 6-3 against 35th-ranked Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Medvedev won four titles as a teenager but only
one since turning 20.
</P>
<P>
Chang will now face Italy's 26-year-old Cristiano Caratti, who
surged back to upset Swedish veteran Stefan Edberg 3-6, 6-4, 7-5
in two hours and 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, world number five Goran Ivanisevic
of Croatia rolled over Swede Jonas Bjorkman 6-0, 6-4, while
Wimbledon winner Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands continued his
winning momentum from earlier in the summer to beat American Vince
Spadea 7-6 (10-8), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
The ninth ranked Wayne Ferreira of South Africa and world
number ten Swede Thomas Enqvist both won, but world number 12

<HEADLINE> German Press Reports React Strongly to U.S. Sanctions Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Local press have reacted strongly
to a new U.S. law, signed Monday by U.S. President Bill Clinton to
punish foreign companies investing in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Berliner Zeitung, Berliner Morgenpost, Der Tagesspiegel and
Neues Deutschland, among other major newspapers, gave wide
coverage to the legislation, which has been greeted by a fierce
outcry from the 15-member European Union and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The law imposes sanctions on foreign companies that make new
investments of over 40 million U.S. dollars in the energy sector
in the two countries, which Washington accuses of backing
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Berliner Morgenpost on Tuesday quoted German Economics Minister
Guenter Rexrodt as saying, "the threat of extra-territorial
sanctions against European companies ... is not the right way to
fight the growth of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Another report published on Wednesday quoted Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel as saying, " U.S. intentions and laws contradict the
bases of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ... we will not accept
them." Kinkel warned of possible European retaliation, but ruled
out a trade war.
</P>
<P>
Apart from articles on Europeans' anger toward the law,
Berliner Zeitung on Wednesday published a story from Washington
about the U.S.' tough stance in implementing the controversial law.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department spokesman warned Europeans not to take
counter-measures or their interests will be harmed, said the story.
</P>
<P>
The EU's concern about the long-term effect of the legislation
on its oil and gas industries, who have major investments in Iran
and Libya, was also reflected in those press reports.
</P>
<P>
More countries worldwide, including Russia, Japan and China,
have joined Europe in condemning the law, passed in the wake of
bomb attacks in Saudi Arabia in June and and the explosion of TWA
Flight 800 off the New York coast in July.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Exports Up in Value, Down in Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports declined
in volume but rose in value in the first seven months this year,
the Foreign Trade Department said today.
</P>
<P>
During the said period, rice exports dropped by 13.5 percent to
3.2 million tons but their value jumped by 7.7 percent to 29.2
billion baht (1.168 billion U.S. dollars), compared with 3.7
million tons valued at 27.1 billion baht (1.084 billion U.S.
dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The department predicted that demand for Thai rice would remain
high in Latin America, the Middle East and some other countries
and regions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the department Pracha Jarutrakulchai said
that Thailand should be able to export five million tons of rice
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Thai rice exporters won a contract to supply Japan
with 119 tons of rice -- 68 tons of fragrant and 51 tons of
short-grained.
</P>
<P>
Calling the deal a breakthrough for Thai exporters, Pracha said
that the volume of the country's rice exports would go up once
Thai fragrant rice secures a place in the Japanese market.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI)
was reportedly to step in to help tackle the troublesome election
of a new soccer federation chief on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said CONI president Mario Pescante would interrupt
his post-Olympic holiday in the United States to fly home for a
special meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's soccer suffered a heavy blow on Tuesday when
representatives of 5,500 professional and amateur clubs failed to
pick a replacement for federation boss Antonio Matarrese despite
two rounds of voting at a 14-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
A bitter clash between Luciano Nizzola, president of the
football league, and Serie C president Giancarlo Abete
highlighted deep splits between the three national divisions and
deadlocked a decision on the sport's top job.
</P>
<P>
CONI is expected to appoint an interim figure on Monday,
before the new season gets under way on September 8.
</P>
<P>
A CONI spokesman said another vote was not likely to happen
immediately. Federation officials anticipated it could be two to
three months before a fresh election was called.

<HEADLINE> Prices Rise Sharply in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Public grumble is to aggravate
in Hungary as the government announced today that prices rose by
25 percent in the first six months of the year over the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics also reported that government
employees have still not got their promised salary increase of
19.5 percent while the pay raises for non-government employees have
lagged behind price rises.
</P>
<P>
Workers have been given a wage increase of 19.8 percent, 5
percentage points less than the price hike.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government had promised to raise wages for its
people to keep up with the price increases but it has obviously
failed to fulfill the promise.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some labor unions and groups in the
country are considering going on strike to show their discontent.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Sports Chief Raps Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- President Ivan Slavkov of the
Bulgarian Olympic Committee (BOC) lashed the recently-concluded
Atlanta Olympic Games here on Tuesday, saying they were the
"worst-ever" that he had attended.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov told the press that it was a mistake to stage the
Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta, since the event the city
cares for most is the final of the American football Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov added that it was rediculous for Olympic organizers
that their taxi drivers had no idea of where the five biggest
venues were, let alone the explosion in the Centennial Olympic
Park that led the city to "great chaos".
</P>
<P>
The BOC chief spoke high of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, saying
they were the best in terms of organising.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Premier: Lifting of Sanctions, Priority Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said today Yugoslavia's priority task was the lifting of
the sanctions of the international community against his country.
</P>
<P>
This task would be realized immediately following the September
elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, the U.N. sanctions against
Yugoslavia, which was suspended last November, will be completely
lifted 10 days after the first post-war general elections are held
successfully on September 14 in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In talks with local businessmen in the northwestern town of
Niksic in the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, Kontic said the
country's second most important task in foreign policy was the
normalization of relations with former Yugoslav republics, which
he said was important also because of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his Croatian
counterpart, Franjo Tudjman, agreed today in Athens to establish
diplomatic relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia, an important
step toward peace and stability in the Balkan region. Yugoslavia
has already recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
With regard to domestic politics, Kontic said Yugoslavia would
continue with its firm option to maintain the stability of the
national currency and the monetary system, and the restrictive
policy would be pursued in this area.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that due to the lack of international
financial funds and loans, Yugoslav products were not competitive
in the world market and the export plan was not fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is eager to join the international financial
institutions and the United Nations to get credits and loans it
needs badly to recover its economy devastated by the international
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leader, IFOR Commander Meet in Pale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik said today it was the stand of the Serb
authorities to implement all obligations of the Dayton accords in
order to preserve peace.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik made the remarks while meeting commander of the
NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) Admiral Joseph Lopez on
the implementation of the Dayton peace accords, the Tanjug news
agency reported from the Serb capital of Pale.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between Admiral Lopez, who recently
replaced Admiral Leighton Smith as the IFOR commander, and Serb
leaders concerning the Bosnian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the U.S. admiral said he hoped he would
have the opportunity at every meeting to speak about progress
which would come from peace and democratic institutions, as well as
free entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said that the exchange of prisoners of war would be a
priority issue over the next few days. The talks with Lopez had
also covered arbitration on inter-ethnic demarcation around the
northern Bosnian town of Brcko, and cooperation with the Hague
tribunal for war crimes committed in former Yugoslavia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brcko is a controversial town located in the bottleneck of the
corridor which links the eastern and western parts of Republika
Srpska. Both the Serbs and the Muslims claim sovereignty over the
town. Under the Dayton agreement, a decision on the future of the
strategic place will be made at the end of the year by an
international arbitration commission.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Credit Up 8.7 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer credit shot
up by an annual rate of 8.7 percent in June, the largest gain
since last March, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report showed that U.S. consumers increased their use
of credit to finance many of their purchases and it resulted in an
growth of 8.3 billion dollars in the consumer installment debt in
June, the largest increase since it jumped by 10.4 percent last
March.
</P>
<P>
The gain of 8.3 billion dollars in consumer debt boosted the
total credit in the U.S. to 1.15 trillion dollars by June 30 of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer debt includes all household debt that was not secured
by real estates.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that growth in auto loans shot up by 17.6 percent
in June, more than four times the 3.9 percent gain in May.
</P>
<P>
But revolving credit, which includes credit cards, increased
just 7.6 percent, down from 15.6 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said in a regional survey earlier today that the
U.S. economy is slowing down on its own without the increase of
short-term interest rates. Many analysts believe the high level of
consumer debt is partially behind the slowdown in economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey also found increased demand for commercial and
industrial loans but demand for consumer and mortgage loans was
softening in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Serbs: Muslims, Croats Do Not Comply With Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb government
criticized today the Muslims and Croats for not complying with the
agreement on resuming the exhumations of Serb bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Serb government said the Muslims and Croats did not comply
with the agreement reached with the deputy to the High
Representative of the international community, Michael Steiner,
with regard to the exhumation of bodies of Serb soldiers and
civilians in the Glamoc area in southwestern Bosnia, and Mt. Ozren
in northern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The government consequently "insists on equal treatment by the
international community and requests the respect of the principle
of reciprocity concerning exhumations," a Tanjug news agency
report from the Serb capital of Pale said.
</P>
<P>
"If these requests are not met, Republika Srpska will not allow
exhumations in its territory," the Serb government said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
In the Glamoc region, the Croat authorities had prevented four
times the resumption of the exhumation of the 65 remaining bodies
of Serbs in the mass grave in the village of Kamen from which 42
bodies of Serbs had hitherto been exhumed, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb state commission for the missing persons has claimed
that 1,156 more soldiers and 808 civilians are still missing.

<HEADLINE> France Marks Great Teacher's 100th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- France will mark on October 15 the
100th birthday of the founder of modern pedagogy, Celestin Freinet
(1896-1966).
</P>
<P>
Freinet is the man who first introduced the ideas of
free-thinking for school children, progressive training, training
of expression, full individual development for children and
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
The celebration, initiated by the Cooperative Institute of
Modern School of France (ICEM) which he founded, will include a
conference to be attended by children, exhibitions, seminars,
video-shows, sales and book publishings.
</P>
<P>
Born at a small village called Gars in the Alpes-Maritimes near
Grasse, Freinet graduated from a normal school in Nice, and joined
World War I during which he was wounded in the Battle of Verdun.
</P>
<P>
Freinet joined pacifist and communist movements after the war
and took a teaching job in a school near his hometown, where he
introduced the ideas of free-thinking and proletarianism in
teaching, while initiating many teaching techniques such as using
printing in school and publishing children's writings.
</P>
<P>
He set up a private school Vence with his wife Elise in 1935
and set up the Children's Front together with the famous writer
Roman Rolland in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Arrested in 1940 for spreading the ideas of the leftwing
People's Front, he joined the resistance to the Nazi occupation
after being released. He bought back his school Vence in 1947 and
founded the ICEM in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Today, some 20,000 teachers around France claim to be followers
of Freinet, 100 public schools use his pedagogy and some 500
schools are heavily influenced by him.
</P>
<P>
Activities will also be held in Mexico, Germany, Switzerland,
Brazil, Canada, Spain and Belgium to mark the great teacher's
birthday.

<HEADLINE> Iran's UN Envoy Blames US for Gulf Instability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian ambassador to the
United Nations today said the United States should be blamed for
instability in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN's "World View" program, Ambassador
Kamal Kharrazi said, "The United States is motivated to sell more
arms to the countries in the region and its presence has added
instability in the region."
</P>
<P>
He was denouncing the claim U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry made Tuesday when he said that there still exists a threat
to the Gulf and "the threat from Iran has increased since 1990 and
is still growing."
</P>
<P>
Tension between Iran and the United States is mounting up after
Perry hinted over the weekend that Iran might be behind the June
25 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 American
soldiers, and he vowed to take "strong action" when he would have
"impelling evidence" that Iran should have sponsored the terrorist
group responsible for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Gulf states can settle their problems
including security without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the best way to have a secure Persian Gulf and free
flow of oil is to have security mechanism by states of the Persian
Gulf without foreign intervention," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a non-intervention and security pact be
signed by Gulf states under the auspices of the United Nations,
saying it would establish a mechanism to settle regional disputes.
