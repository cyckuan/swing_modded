COLOMBO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka is taking a census of
all houses within the cleared areas of northern Jaffna Peninsula,
according to official sources here today.
</P>

Foreign countries, Japan in particular, would provide assistance
for emergency relief work such as reconstruction and
rehabilitation in the north at the request of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The president recently has asked for 70 million US dollars of
assistance from foreign governments to carry out the emergency
relief work in the Jaffna Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> British Unemployment Continues to Fall in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell again
last month, but by much less than expected, the Office for
National Statistics said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seasonally adjusted figures show a drop of some 3,200, which
compares with the 10,000 or more expected in the City and left the
overall jobless rate unchanged at 7.8 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment had fallen by a unusually sharp 25,600 in March.
But April's seasonally adjusted total still amounted to a
five-year low of 2.18 million.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Eric Forth welcomed the data, saying that
the United Kingdom now has the lowest unemployment rate of any
major European country, lower than Germany, France, Italy or Spain
and well below the 11 percent average for Europe as a whole.
</P>
<P>
But Michael Meacher, the shadow employment secretary, said that
job losses sparked by the scare over mad cow disease could lead to
unemployment rises over the next few months.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The MasterCard of the United
States is going to test a fingerprint-identification system next
month that could be used worldwide to combat credit-card fraud.
</P>
<P>
The USA Today reported that fraud losses at Mastercard amounted
to 450 million U.S. dollars last year, or 9 cents of every 100
U.S. dollars in charges.
</P>
<P>
Biometric technologies are the latest to be tried in
fraud-busting devices. They are based on unique personal
characteristics, such as a finger-print, retina scan or
voiceprint.
</P>
<P>
The Chemical Bank is testing a voice-verification system at two
New York branches, the paper said. Customers make a voiceprint,
which is kept on file. When they want to cash a check or withdraw
cash from a teller, they speak into a telephone, which matches
their voice to the voiceprint.
</P>
<P>
While using the fingerprint system, a card holder's fingerprint
is scanned, and a numerical code is assigned to it. The code is
previously loaded onto a computer chip imbedded in a so-called
smart credit card. A fingerprint can't be reproduced from the
numerical code on the smart card, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The use the car, customers touch a screen with their finger.
The reader matches the fingerprint to the numeric code in the
card.
</P>
<P>
To make the system applicable, it must be cost effective,
reliable and easy to use, according to experts. And they must
not reject legitimate customers.

<HEADLINE> Family Has to Adapt to Global Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The family has to adapt to
both rapid and far-reaching global change affecting not only the
material condition of humankind, but also values and beliefs, U.N.
secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the International Day of
Families, the secretary-general noted that the family is the most
living social institution that mediates between the individual and
society at large.
</P>
<P>
"The setting aside of one day every year for this observance is
an important means of maintaining the momentum and interest
created by the International Year of the Family (1994) and
focusing on policies to address different problems and concerns of
the contemporary family all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the global change, what the family can offer its members
in economic, social and spiritual support is changing, and what
members expect from the family also is changing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, families have been important in providing an
economic base and protection against extreme want by pooling
resources and engaging in productive activities, as well as by
sheltering and caring for weaker or dependent members. These
functions continue to be important and are often enriched when
there is material progress in the wider community," he said.
</P>
<P>
As this year's theme for the International Day of Families is
"Families...victims of poverty and homelessness," he noted that
the family has been and continues to be a bulwark against poverty.
</P>
<P>
But, poverty can be corrosive, affecting family solidarity and
family relations. Other contemporary forces also place strains on
families. These include changes in population structure,
widespread migration of people, especially youth in search of work
and economic opportunities, and mass displacement of population
because of war or civil strife.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that through observance of the International Day of
Families, governments and civil society at large with an
opportunity to examine their respective actions and consider what
measures might promote the adaptation of families to new
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Steps up Attack on Eurosceptics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke Tuesday lashed out at Eurosceptics in the
Conservative Party, saying it was "absurd" to imagine that Britain
could prosper outside the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"When you consider Britain's future in Europe, you are
considering Britain's economic and political well-being. The two
are inextricably linked," he said in a speech to the
German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The EU is vital to Britain's national interests, both
commercial and political, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eurosceptic members of the ruling Conservatives have recently
questioned whether Britain should even remain within the 15-nation
EU, let alone sign up to adopt a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Clarke told the businessmen that Britain faces a bleak economic
future unless it remains at the heart of the EU where it can
influence key decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be relegated to the margins of the great
economic and political debates of the 21st century," said the
chancellor, "I want the UK to have clout, to punch above its
weight and to have a large say in setting the agenda for Europe."
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain had suffered in the past from not being at
the center of European decision-making, but added that the
decision on whether to join the single currency will be carefully
weighed when the time came.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, U.S., Japan to Persuade DPRK to Accept Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, the United States and
Japan agreed Tuesday to continue efforts to persuade the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to accept "four-party
talks" on a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement at the end of a two-day policy
coordination meeting, policymakers from the three countries said
they shared the view that the convening of four-party talks is the
"most practicable means for replacing the current armistice
agreement with a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks, proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and South Korean president Kim Young Sam last month, would involve
the DPRK, South Korea, the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, on South Korea's southern island of Cheju, the
U.S. and Japan also ruled out immediate food aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told a joint
press conference after the meeting: "We have no plans at this
point for additional rice aid to North Korea (the DPRK) or further
easing of economic sanctions on North Korea."
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no change in the U.S. position, which is
that the future of the Korean Peninsula must be worked out between
South Korea and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We will not talk about peace separately with North
Korea ... although we would like to improve relations with it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Yanai Shunji told the press
conference that his government has "no plans to extend new food
assistance" to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Chung Tae-ik stressed that
"once the four-party talks are realized, all of those issues
including economic cooperation with North Korea will be discussed."
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the three countries said that the Cheju
meeting served as "a very useful and constructive forum" to
discuss the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to hold their next meeting in Japan within the next
few months.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia Faces Looming Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- With increased population and rapid
urbanization in the region, Asia is facing a looming water crisis
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations' estimate, the population of
Asia is expected to increase from 2.9 billion at present to 4.2
billion in 2025.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the urban population in Asia is
expected to increase from 35 percent of the total to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
These trends will place increasing stress on available water
resources as more water is required to sustain food production, to
support economic growth and to provide municipal water supply and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
In Asia at present, about 40 percent of cropland is irrigated,
which produces up to 70 percent of the total food.
</P>
<P>
However, only 60 percent of urban population and 40 percent of
rural population in the region are served by safe drinking water
supplies and few have adequate sanitation.
</P>
<P>
As a result of economic growth and rising incomes in connection
with urbanization, pressures on water resources in many parts of
the region is already severe.
</P>
<P>
Not only are there growing numbers of people, but water demand
per person is also increasing.
</P>
<P>
During a seminar on water resources management held this week,
President Mitsuo Sato of the Asian Development Bank said, "the
growing imbalance between supply and demand for water resources
has inevitably led to shortages, competition, rising pollution and
other environmental pressures."
</P>
<P>
"The costs of responding to such pressures have significant
implications for economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "the concern on the sustainable development further
focuses our attention not only on the needs of this generation,
but also on our responsibilities to those who follow."
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing held at the Asian Development Bank today,
experts indicated that the economic and financial instruments can
play an important role in ensuring the efficient use of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
They noted that irrigation sector still takes about 80 percent
of total water use with low efficiency, thus providing margin to
deal with water supply crisis.
</P>
<P>
This will require the integrated view of all water uses in
formulating water policy, they added.
</P>
<P>
They also urged private sector to participate in water
resources development and management.

LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Matra of
France, the two major defense industry groups, have agreed to
merge their missile businesses to create Europe's largest missile
producing company.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached on Monday after three years'

</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the joint venture will be based in Britain
with a British Chairman and French chief executive and the
turnover of the company will expected to be over one billion
pounds (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although a BAe spokesman is quoted as saying that the merged
business would be more effective in cometing for missile
contracts, local analysts say that the aim of the merger is to
match the leading American missils makers Hughes and
Raytheon.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Investment in Europe Increases in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies' appetite for
investment in Europe is rising for the first time in six years,
according to a report today in the Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese companies setting up new operations in
western Europe rose last year for the first time since 1989 and 36
manufacturers set up operations, taking the total to 727, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
This is a sharp increase from 19 new companies in 1994 and 26
in 1993. While the total is well short of the peak of 88 new
companies recorded in 1989, the increase suggests Japanese
companies' investment plans are recovering from the impact of the
recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that companies with existing European
operations are also significantly more enthusiastic than a year
ago about investment plans.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters plan to invest in the next two years,
compared with 55 percent in 1995, the report said, citing a survey
by the Japan External Trade Organisation and covering 437 Japanese
companies in European Union countries, Switzerland, Norway and
Iceland.
</P>
<P>
Britain remains the most attractive place to invest in
production plants for 41.9 percent of those surveyed, and of the
727 Japanese companies in western Europe, 215 are in the UK, more
than double the totals for France and Germany, which have 109 and
105 respectively.
</P>
<P>
But eastern European countries are gaining ground, with 23.6
percent of companies putting the Czech Republic or Slovakia at the
top of their list, and 16.2 percent naming Poland.

Workshop on social policy, practice and research in Mutare, east
Zimbabwe, Manyonda said edcucated Africans must transform what
they know to suit the development needs of their countries.
</P>
<P>
He told 15 participants from Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe that most social policies adopted by
African countries were borrowed from colonial powers without due
regard for their suitability for a developing African country.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''It's therefore not surprising that social policies
in Africa have, with little exception, led to under-development."
</P>
<P>
" I blame our academics and technocrats and, to some extent,
politicians for this because they have the capacity to bring out
what is truly an African idea to solve an African problem,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
''It is important for us in Africa to begin to develop our own
indigenous social policies that address the real issues of
development. To enable these policies to yield more social and
economic rewards, they have of necessity to be informed by
research,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President's Visit Hailed Notable Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
newspaper "The Ethiopian Herald" said today that the three-day
state visit to Ethiopia by Chinese President Jiang Zemin has been
described as "an incomparably notable success".
</P>
<P>
In its editorial entitled "Tone Set For Wider Contact", the
newspaper said the intimate, wide-ranging and detailed talks
between presidents Jiang Zemin and Negasso Gidada on not only
bilateral relations and cooperation but also international issues
of mutual interest and concern are believed to have set the tone
for newer and far broader vistas of collaboration.
</P>
<P>
"This was emphasized in cooperation agreements signed at the end
of the visit," the editorial said, adding that "These are all
believed to help greatly strengthen existing relations and cooperation-
tion in key economic and social sectors."
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that "Ethiopia moreover remains
committed to a policy that recognizes the government of the people's
republic of China as the sole representative of the entire Chinese people.
This was a point stressed by both President Negasso and Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi during President Jiang Zemin's state visit."
</P>
<P>
The shared policy of non-interference, the peaceful settlement
of conflicts and strict adherence to the Charter principles of
the UN was likewise reiterated during the top-level talks and
lays the basis for continued and greater cooperation on bilateral
and key international issues, the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Pledges to Develop Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China attaches importance to the Arab League's role in
international and regional affairs and will continue to develop
the friendly ties with the league and its member states.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks here while visiting the headquarters of
the 22-member Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid greeted Jiang,
describing his visit to Egypt as "historic" and thanked China's
support to the Arab cause on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Since the Arab League opened its office in Beijing in 1993, its
relations with China have been strengthened, Abdul-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is seeking to push forward the Middle East
peace process and hopes to win more support from China in this
aspect, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Arab League, as an important regional political
organization in the world, is playing a positive role in
safeguarding the interests and solidarity of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
It will play more important roles in international affairs if
the Arab countries consolidate their solidarity, the Chinese
president noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the current new international situation, Jiang said,
China and the Arab League hold identical or similar views on many
regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can further strengthen their coordination and
cooperation in international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to make joint efforts with the Arab League in
pushing forward the Middle East peace process, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"You can believe that China will always be a friend of the Arab
countries," Jiang told the Arab League chief.
</P>
<P>
Founded in Cairo on March 22, 1945, the Arab League aims to
promote cooperation, coordinate the political activities among its
member states and safeguard the independence and sovereignty of
the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Among those accompanying Jiang on the visit to the Arab League
headquarters were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, Special Assistant Zeng Qinghong, Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi and Chinese Ambassador to
Egypt Yang Fuchang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also viewed the Egyptian Museum, the Pyramids in Giza,
the Sun Boat Museum and the Sphinx here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chines president arrived in Cairo Monday on a five-day
state visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the third leg of his six-nation African tour which has
already taken him to Kenya and Ethiopia. He will also visit Mali,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Go to Chechnya Despite Death Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin will go to
Chechnya despite Chechen rebels' threats of killing him there,
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Medvedev said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yeltsin "does not understand and does not accept
the language of threats."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin announced earlier this month that he would visit the
breakaway republic of Chechnya later this month.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev also flatly rejected allegations that Yeltsin is going
to Chechnya for election purposes.
</P>
<P>
"His upcoming trip to Chechnya has nothing to do with
advertising," the spokesman said, adding that the head of state is
fulfilling his duty of the president.
</P>
<P>
Nobody but the president can make the warring parties sit down
at the negotiating table, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said today
that it is impossible to ensure the safety of the president in
Chechnya now and he would try to persuade Yeltsin to postpone the
trip.
</P>
<P>
Moscow-backed Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev, contradicting
Kulikov's opinion, declared that the security of Yeltsin during
his visit to Chechnya scheduled for mid-May would be fully
ensured.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian NTV television network on
Tuesday, Chechen terrorist master Shamil Basayev threatened that
his fighters would do their best to kill Yeltsin if he arrives in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
" We will try to meet him well so that he would never leave
this place," Basayev said.
</P>
<P>
Basayev, 31, had led a terrorist attack on Budennovsk city in
southern Russian last summer.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Starts 4-Day State Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived here this afternoon for a four-day state visit, indicating
that France would back the European Union (EU) proposal for a
partial lifting of the EU ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, the first French president to visit Britain since 1984,
was welcomed by his host Queen Elizabeth II at the Horse Guards
Parade ground before riding in an open carriage to the Buchingham
Palace for lunch.
</P>
<P>
The Buchingham Palace announced that the French president was
served with the best British beef fillet with noodles, which is
carefully prepared for Chirac in an effort to persuade France to
support an early lifting of the global ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
France was the first European country to declare a unilateral
ban on British beef when the British government announced in March
a possible link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for London earlier today, Chirac told reporters
that the French government would back an EU proposal for a lifting
of the embargo on some beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
However, Chirac maintained that the BSE problem required a
European solution and that the ban as a whole must be lifted by
the EU Commission with scientific backing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was quoted
by the BBC television as saying there were clear indications that
France would eventually support a partial lifting of the ban.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Chirac and British Prime Minister John
Major Wednesday morning, the beef crisis will also be considered
to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The French president is also to make a rare address to both
houses of parliament Wednesday afternoon, in which he will urge
Britain to play a full part in the development of European
integration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Outlays $227 Million on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore said
Tuesday that the federal government is spending 227 million U.S.
dollars to support the Atlanta Olympics, mostly for security and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The amount is a conservative estimate that includes only
expenditures made particularly for the Atlanta Games, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
It does not include millions that the Department of Housing and
Urban Development is spending to rehabilitate public housing in
Atlanta in time for the Games, which is to start on July 19.
</P>
<P>
He said compared with the 8 billion U.S dollars the Spanish
government spent on the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the U.S.
government's role in the 1996 Olympics has been very small. The
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, the city of Atlanta and
the state of Georgia will bear most of the costs.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the Atlanta committee is spending 1.7
billion dollars raised from private sources on the Games.
</P>
<P>
The federal expenditures will include 104.9 million dollars for
transportation and 69.8 million dollars for security.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government is putting more than 2,500
federal law enforcement agents and 8,500 military personnel to
ensure security during the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Olympics committee is providing 12,000 to 13,000
private security agents in addition to 4,800 state and local law
enforcement officers.

the hope here today that all Chinese, both at home and abroad,

China and to peaceful reunification.

unchanged," and added that President Jiang Zemin's proposition on
the issue is in the common interests of all the Chinese people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we refuse to promise not to use force is not
directed against the Taiwan compatriots, but against foreign
forces' interference and the idea of 'Taiwan independence'," he
explained, saying he hopes that more Taiwan compatriots will tour
the mainland to increase mutual understanding.

HANOI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Singapore today began
building their first joint industrial park near Ho Chi Minh city,
which will cost more than 200 million U.S. dollars and create more
than 50,000 jobs over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his Singaporean
counterpart Goh Chok Tong attended a ground-breaking ceremony for
the park, about 20 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh city, southern
Vietnam, this morning.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, proposed by Goh during his
first visit to Vietnam in March 1994, will cover 100 hectares and
cost about 52.5 million dollars. It is expected be completed
within two years.
</P>
<P>
A further 400 hectares will be developed over another six years
at a cost of 156.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to create more than 50,000 jobs and
create industrial output of more than 1 billion dollars for Song
Be Province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Nationwide Crackdown on Crime Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have solved a
significant number of cases involving major criminal offenses,
since the start of a nationwide anti-crime campaign on April 28.
</P>
<P>
These included apprehending six people who were on the Public
Security Ministry's most-wanted list, arresting some escaped
criminals, and confiscating a large number of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, police in east China's Fujian Province
have cracked a kidnapping case that involved a Chinese-American
gang and one from Hong Kong, and a total of 1.3 million yuan (some
160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces joined hands in work
on a drug smuggling case that involved a total of 600 kg of
heroin. Thirty-nine drug traffickers were arrested and ten
vehicles used to ferry the drugs were seized.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hunan Province, an eight-member gang of
thieves who were connected with 141 thefts involving 370,000
yuan-worth of stolen articles, has been put out.
</P>
<P>
Police in northeast China's Liaoning Province arrested a person
who had killed and wounded three victims and been at large for ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to stop the manufacture and sale of firearms have been
increased because of the obvious harm to society.
</P>
<P>
In east and northeast China's Shandong, Liaoning, and
Heilongjiang provinces, more than 8,000 illegal firearms have been
confiscated in each of the provinces, and the numbers for Hebei,
Hubei and Shanxi provinces are more than 3,000 each.
</P>
<P>
A number of criminals have voluntarily surrendered to police as
well. Over 600 escapees had given themselves up in central China's
Henan Province, by May 6, and the number for Hunan Province stood
at 490.
</P>
<P>
A senior police official attributes these achievements in the
nationwide crackdown on major crimes to the positive attitude and
participation of ordinary citizens everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, 80 percent of the criminal cases
cracked in east China's Shandong Province, in fact, were the
result of tips provided by citizens, and 45 percent of the
criminal arrests came about because of help from the people.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official pointed out recently that government at
all levels should take this opportunity to improve rules and
regulations, management, and precautionary measures in order to
make the social order much better.

<HEADLINE> State Copyright Bureau on US Trade Sanctions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of China's State
Copyright Bureau today expressed deep indignation over the US's
announcement that it would impose trade sanctions on Chinese
exports to the US.
</P>
<P>
On May 15, the US unilaterally announced the imposition of
trade sanctions on a total of three billion US dollars worth of
Chinese exports to the US. The tariff rates for these products
will be raised to 100 percent and the sanctions will take effect
30 days later.
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the US government unreasonably accused the Chinese
government of not sticking to the intellectual property rights
agreement signed by the two countries in 1995, and threatened
China with trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore express our strong indignation over the actions
taken by the US government," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the two countries signed the Agreement on
the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in February 1995,
Chinese departments have stuck to the commitments in a resolute
and responsible way, and have done a lot of work in protecting
such rights, setting up related systems and combatting piracy.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the spokesman said, China has re-registered
all factories engaged in the manufacture of CDs or VCDs and
revoked licenses of those found guilty of piracy.
</P>
<P>
All audio-visual companies are required to have contracts with
and copyright authorization from overseas institutions before they
begin copying in China, the spokesman said, and they will face
administrative or legal punishment if they violate the rules.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China has also tightened protection on computer
software and requires users to buy or use only legal software in
its effort to fight piracy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has sent inspectors to software factories to
prevent pirating, he said.

<HEADLINE> How Did "Foreign Garbage" Get into China? (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The recent discovery of
American-garbage in a suburb of Beijing has aroused a great deal
of concern and anger among the Chinese people, with many asking
the same question: "How did 'foreign garbage' sneak into our
country?"
</P>
<P>
In an interview today, a high-ranking Chinese official heading
an investigatory group that came from Beijing to this coastal city
in east China's Shandong Province yesterday for an in-depth probe,
answered the question.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the major reason is that some developed
countries, including the U.S., keep trying to transfer their
harmful waste to developing countries, such as China, in order to
avoid their own troubles.
</P>
<P>
He cited an article in an American newspaper, which he said
described China as a "favorable place for dumping waste" and
showed that some people in the U.S. pay importers from other
countries to get them to accept waste.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1995 alone, he said, customs discovered
22 cases of illegal imports, involving as much as 3,000 tons of
foreign garbage.
</P>
<P>
He went on to blame a small number of Chinese businessmen
unscrupulous enough to stop at nothing to make money for
collaborating with some immoral foreigners in importing foreign
garbage.
</P>
<P>
"Driven by profit motive, these people have completely lost
their dignity and integrity, searching for any way to get foreign
garbage into the country," he said, adding that foreign garbage is
often disguised as "industrial raw materials" or "recycling
plastics" in order to clear customs.
</P>
<P>
"Once discovered, they use the excuse of mistaken delivery to
cover themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also conceded that the incompleteness of laws and
regulations and weaknesses in port management have made it easier
for foreign garbage to be brought into China.

agreed to set up diplomatic missions in each other's capitals in
what came as a preparatory step toward normalization of ties
between the two countries.

<P>
The fact is that the Chinese side is serious and has been
effective in implementing the Sino-US intellectual property rights
agreement, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the US government's accusation about the
Chinese government not implementing the agreement is groundless,
and that it is reckless and unwise for the US government to
flagrantly employ trade sanctions against China, disregarding
China's great efforts and remarkable progress in intellectual
property rights protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that the Chinese government can in no way
accept," the spokesmans emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He added, "we still hope the two sides can solve the issue of
intellectual property rights protection through dialogue and
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"Our position on this matter is that whatever actions the US
side takes, China will always stick to the international treaties
and relevant bilateral agreements, and will strictly and sincerely
implement our intellectual property rights protection policy," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China will continue its fight against piracy and perfect its
laws and regulations on copyright and to promote the development
and growth of its literature, arts, and science, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
issued a statement today, expressing strong indignation and utter
dissatisfaction with the US decision, saying that, in order to
safeguard state sovereignty and national unity, and to keep in
line with the country's foreign trade law, China has no other
alternatives but to take counter-retaliatory actions in the face
of the US trade sanctions.

<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China will further tighten controls
on its audio-visual market to further protect intellectual
property rights, according to the first national audio-visual
conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongde, minister of culture, said the country will set up
the main state-owned audio-visual channels to ensure that
publications are legal and to prevent piracy.
</P>
<P>
Another step is to better manage projection rooms, require that
they have licences, and ban the showing of pirated films, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will further develop the tape leasing
business and let better audio-visual programs be seen.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that controls of audio-visual products' transportation
will also be strengthened in an effort to prevent pirated tapes
from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
China has 298 audio-visual publication houses, 270 reproduction
factories, 25 CD production lines, over 1,000 wholesale units,
100,000-plus retail and renting points, more than 80,000
projection rooms, which attract more than 100 million visitors

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Company to Build Cement Silo in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Tongyang Cement Company
today announced its plans to build a cement silo in Rajin-Sonbong
Port of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) sometime
this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed silo project would be a joint venture with the
DPRK's External Economy Commission, a Tongyang official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Tongyang, whose officials visited the DPRK twice last year, is
nearing an agreement on technical details of the project after
negotiations with the DPRK earlier this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To implement the 3-million-U.S.-dollar project, Tongyang is to
apply to the South Korean National Unification Board (NUB) for
approval as an inter-Korean venture.
</P>
<P>
The cement manufacturer is also planning to dispatch a survey
team to the DPRK for the cement silo, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The cement silo project, if approved, would be the second
Seoul-Pyongyang joint project, following South Korean Daewoo
Company's joint-venture plant in the DPRK's Nampo, which is now
under trial operation.

<HEADLINE> How Did "Foreign Garbage" Get into China? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"According to the old regulations, customs and environmental
departments can only reject the foreign garbage if discovered, and
have no right to punish the importers, let alone the foreign
exporters," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"And the weakness in our port management becomes clearer when
we consider the large amount of American garbage that passed
Qingdao customs to arrive in the capital," he went on to say.
</P>
<P>
He said China has always paid close attention to the problem of
"foreign garbage".
</P>
<P>
In March 1991, he said, the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection and the General Administration of Customs issued a
circular for tightening controls on the import of all sorts of
foreign waste.
</P>
<P>
On October 10, 1995, he said, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's legislature, passed a law on
the control of solid wastes.
</P>
<P>
It clearly stated that any imports of solid waste from foreign
countries will be rejected, and the importer can be fined at least
100,000 yuan, as well as be charged with smuggling, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, and the General Administration of Customs also issued
circulars making stipulations stricter on foreign wastes imports,
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
State environmental protection, customs, and commodity
inspection departments are now working on new laws and regulations
to punish those responsible for garbage imports, no matter whether
they are Chinese citizens or foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that with a more complete legal system,
heightened environmental protection awareness by the general
public, and strong port management, 'foreign garbage' will have no
way of sneaking into China," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Opposition to Campaign Against Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The three South Korean opposition
parties have decided to launch a political campaign against the
ruling party's move to gain a parliamentary majority by recruiting
independent and opposition lawmakers-elect.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP), the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) and the Democratic
Party (DP) here today.
</P>
<P>
They will stage a public display of information on election
campaign irregularities allegedly committed by the ruling New
Korea Party (NKP) and political rallies denouncing those
lawmakers-elect who recently joined the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The three opposition parties will also boycott the new National
Assembly opening early next month if the government fails to meet
their demand for a thorough investigation of all alleged election
frauds.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam secured
139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP led by Kim Dae-jung won 79 seats, the ULD headed by
Kim Jong-pil got 50 seats and the DP obtained 15 seats. The
remaining 16 seats went to independents.
</P>
<P>
The NKP's seats in the National Assembly are expected to
increase to 149, only one seat short of majority, after
independent lawmaker-elect Baek Seung-hong promised today to join
the NKP before the end of this week, following the example of nine
others.

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The beleaguered British beef
industry was given a boost today by a supermarket chain ASDA which
announced that it is banning all foreign beef from its shelves.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it had always been its policy to stand
behind British beef.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that British beef was the best and safest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The company urged the beef industry to stop squabbling and to
give customers what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey published in Daily Express tabloid today
showed that more than half of British meat-eaters, around 15
million people, have changed their diet as a result of the BSE
scare, known as mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Consumers' Association said that
right after the BSE scare took place, 23 percent of those
questioned gave up all beef products, while one in seven are
continuing the boycott.
</P>
<P>
Despite reassurances over the safety of British beef, the
survey said, 28 percent of those questioned still did not think
beef could be eaten with confidence.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the survey also raised serious
questions about the government's handling of the BSE crisis.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Incident Occurs in Israeli Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Labor Party campaigner was
shot and wounded today, two weeks before Israel's May 29 general
elections, in the first violence of the current election
campaigns, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in Herzliyya, north of Tel Aviv, when
Ortor Yarusky, a new immigrant from Russia, was putting up
election posters for the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
A car rented by the Likud Party election center drove up, and
four people got off the car and demanded Yarusky to stop,
according to Yarusky. One of them was armed with a knife and
another with a gun.
</P>
<P>
When Yarusky refused to do so, one of the four people fired
the gun three times, hitting Yarusky twice in the leg, and then
they drove away.
</P>
<P>
Herzliyya police later recovered the car and detained two
suspects, both with criminal records, and the police said they
will arrest the other two suspects, whose identities are known.
</P>
<P>
Yarusky was rushed to a nearby hospital where his condition
was described as not serious, and there he was visited by
officials from the Labor Party and phoned by Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
Both Peres, also chairman of the Labor Party, and Likud
chairman Binyamin Netanyahu immediately condemned the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Peres said he will make every effort to ensure such incident
would not occur again in the election campaigns, while Netanyahu
urged activists of all parties to exercise restraints.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Knesset (parliament) Speaker Shevah Weiss has called
on all parties to urge their supporters to run clean campaigns and
called for removement of guns and violence from the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Election Central Committee said
in a statement, issued after an urgent meeting following the
incident, that the shooting is unprecedented and should send a
warning signal to the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
At a request of Meretz Knesset Member Ran Cohen, the shooting
incident will be addressed at a special session of the Knesset
next Monday.

<HEADLINE> World Information Conference Ends (by Ye Xingzeng and Liu Yegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND, South Africa, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The International
Conference on Information Society and Development (ISAD) ended
today with the adoption of ''chair's conclusions'', urging to
narrow the widening gap between the developed and developing
countries in access to global information society.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 representatives from about 50 countries and 20
international organisations attended the three-day ISAD
conference in Midrand, north of johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech, South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, who proposed the hosting of the ISAD, said information had
played a pivotal role in almost every field of human life.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the great success of the conference contributed to
the participation of the developed and developing countries and
international communities.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the chair's conclusions, the ISAD accomplished its
three primary objectives, namely:
</P>
<P>
--Launching a dialogue between the developed and developing
worlds and within the developing world on the emerging global
information society,
</P>
<P>
--Initiating the process to define a shared vision for the
global information society between the relevant societal sectors
in the developed and developing countries,
</P>
<P>
--Working towards ''common principles'' and ''collaborative
actions'' to strengthen the shared vision and meet the challenges
of the global information society.
</P>
<P>
While concerning the daunting technology gap between the
developed and developing nations in creating a truly global
information society, the conclusions said information and
communication technologies and services had the potential to
offer a significant contribution to the promotion of sustainable
growth in all countries.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, special attention should be paid to the
tremendous and diverse needs of the developing world and the
developed should be urged to help the former narrow the current
gap in economic and social development in terms of information
infrastructure, the conclusion said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that it was of equal importance for the
developing countries to build networks which could enable all
people to gain access to the global information infrastructure
and participate in the global information society at affordable
prices.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions acknowledged that the information technoligies
have tremendous potential to meet joint challenges faced by all
humanity,such as economic growth, human resources development,
delivery of public services and promotion of a participatory
democracy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Principles in Sino-US Joint Communiques Should Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
stressed that the principles enshrined in the three Sino-U.S.
joint communiques should be strictly abided by in order to make
relations between the two countries grow normally and stably.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the development of
Sino-U.S. relations in an interview with Egyptian and Chinese
journalists here, the visiting Chinese head of state said the
issues concerning Sino-U.S. relations, particularly the
U.S. attitude toward the Taiwan issue, should be properly handled
on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that to maintain the healthy and stable relations
between China and the U.S. not only is in the interests of both
countries but also will be conducive to peace and stability in the
world.
</P>
<P>
While progresses have been made in bilateral relations between
China and the U.S. in the recent years, he went on, difficulties
and problems still exist. He described the Sino-U.S. relations as
still being marked with rises and falls and troubles, adding that
this runs counter to the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to make joint efforts with the U.S. side to
increase trust, reduce troubles, expand cooperation, and avoid
confrontation so as to ensure that the bilateral relations will
grow stably and healthily," the Chinese head of state said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent visit to China by Russia President Boris Yeltsin
and the agreements signed by China and Russia, Jiang said that
China and Russia have anchored the basic principles and direction
of development in Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's visit and the China-Russia Joint Declaration proved
that the relations between the two neighboring countries have
reached a new level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the strategic partnership between China
and Russia is a new type of state-to-state relations and is in
keeping with the post-Cold War international situation and the
development of international relations.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Partial Lifting of UK Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chiriac said today that the French government backs the European
Union (EU) Commission recommendation for lifting a ban on some
British beef by-products exports in an effort to calm the BSE or
mad cow disease crisis across the EU.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after his talks with
British Prime Minister John Major at the Downing Street, Chirac
said that France would support the EU Commission proposal of
allowing Britain to export gelatine, tallow and semen.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU standing veterinary committee is
convening a special session today in Brussels to discuss the EU
proposal, which is expected to face intense opposition from
Germany and other EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The French President stressed that "It is now up to Europe to
express solidarity when solidarity is needed and I hope that
strong solidarity" will be expressed at today's EU conference.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here for a four-day state visit to Britain,
made it clear that lifting the total global ban on British beef
products exports would have to be achieved step by step, but
easing the ban on some British beef by-products would be an
important move "in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
France was the first the European country to impose a
unilateral ban on British beef products in early March when the
British government announced a possible link between the BSE and
its human equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jacob disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Major expressed his gratitude
for President Chirac's support of a partial ban, saying that
France would play a "leading role" in ensuring the other EU member
states that the ban should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
On the possible outcome of the EU veterinary conference, Major
said that he "see no scientific reasons for the ban not to be
lifted and no "proper justifications" that Britain's EU partners
would not agree to ease the seven-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister also made it clear that if the EU
veterinary committee rejected the EU ban-lifting proposal, the
British government would take immediate appropriate action upon
the decision.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission imposed the global ban on British beef
products exports on March 27 in a bid to calm the public fears
over the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also exchanges views on a
series of bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
On the EU Intergovernmental Conference (IGC), Major said that
there are a large number of areas where the two countries share
communal interests and both sides have agreed to make great
efforts so as to reach "a joint position" at the IGC.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Go Up Rapidly In Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian territories have
witnessed a tangible rise in consumer prices during the months of
March and April largely due to the border closure, a report from
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem, said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report based on a study conducted by the
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the price index for
April reached 105.4 to that of November 1995, a 5.4 percent
increase in prices in five months. The increase in prices in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip is higher than that of east Jerusalem,
which is strictly tied with the Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
The higher prices of foodstuff have been a major element in the
increase of price index in general. The increase of price index in
the past three months is attributed to the closure of the
Palestinian territories, which has influenced the trade exchange
between the Palestinian territories and Israel, according to the
survey. As a result, raw materials prices sharply increased in the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the decrease in the Shekel's value and the increase
of unemployment rates due to the border closure to its extremist
levels, have led to a general decrease in buying abilities and
citizen's living standards, and to an increase in poverty and
hardships of the Palestinian people.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that boosting Sino-Egyptian ties will
benefit the peoples of the two countries and set an example for
promoting equal cooperation among the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian and Chinese journalists, Jiang,
who is on a five-day state visit to Egypt, described Egypt as a
major country in Africa and the Middle East which plays an
important role and enjoys great influence in international and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that during his current visit to
Egypt he has exchanged views with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak on bilateral ties, the international situation, the
Middle East peace process and the developing countries' role in
safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate Egypt's independent foreign policy of
self-determination and non-alignment," he told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Monday for the state visit, the first by a
Chinese president to Egypt since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that Egypt has made important contributions to
pushing forward the Middle East peace process, eliminating
nuclear threats and maintaining regional and world stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China has taken positive measures to promote
economic cooperation with Egypt. The trade volume between the two
countries surpassed 450 million U.S. dollars in 1995, a 53.5
percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has built a bonded warehouse in Port Said,
some 210 kilometers northeast of Cairo, to streamline the sale of
commodities in Egypt and the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We will encourage the commercial and trade departments of the
two countries to expand their supply of goods and to increase
Egypt's export to China," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, China and Egypt signed three agreements on
promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, the joint efforts of China and Egypt will help
push their friendship and cooperation up to a new level," Jiang
told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Jiang visited The 10th of Ramadan Industrial
City. This new industrial satellite city, some 50 kilometers east
of Cairo, was built in 1975, aiming to attract Arab and foreign
investments and create more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the third leg of Jiang's six-nation African tour
which has already taken him to Kenya and Ethiopia. He will also
visit Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The National Executive Committee
(NEC) of the Tanzanian ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) has nominated
President Benjamin Mkapa to contest the party's chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kingunge Ngombale Mwiru, CCM's Publicity Secretary, told

general meeting in Dodoma, Central Tanzania, on June 22 to elect the

Mwiru said that the NEC's move to nominate President Mkapa to
contest the post was in respect to CCM Chairman Ali H. Mwinyi's
suggestion that the Tanzanian president should also be the party
chairman. Mwinyi will retire next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the NEC agreed with Mwinyi's request to retire and his
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The publicity secretary, however, said that any CCM member could
contest the post.
</P>
<P>
"Members have the constitutional right to contest the post but NEC
also has the constitutional right to nominate a member to contest the
post," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mwiru said other CCM national leaders would be elected during
the party's general meeting to be held next year.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council urged today all parties in Burundi to engage in a
comprehensive political dialogue aimed at achieving national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement adopted at a council meeting today, Qin Huasun,
president of the Security Council for May and Chinese ambassador,
said that the council was gravely concerned at the continued
deterioration of the security situation in Burundi, in particular
at reports of the downward spiral of violence which has resulted
in further large-scale killings in Buhoro and Kivyuka, and at the
increasing flow of refugees from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council strongly condemns any use of violence and
emphasizes its conviction that a lasting settlement of the
situation in Burundi can only be found through peaceful means,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council urged once again the authorities and all parties
concerned in Burundi to set aside their differences, renounce the
use of force and demonstrate a firm political will for a prompt
settlement of the conflict, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its full support for the
ongoing efforts of former President Nyerere to facilitate
negotiations and political dialogue to resolve the crisis in
Burundi and looked forward to a successful outcome of the upcoming
meeting in Mwanza, Tanzania on May 22.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized the importance of the continued cooperation of
the United Nations with the Organization of African Unity, the
European Union and other interested countries and organizations in
coordination with former President Nyerere aimed at achieving the
objective of a comprehensive political dialogue between the
parties in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also stressed the importance of the
contingency planning and requested the U.N. secretary-general and
member states concerned to continue to facilitate contingency
planning for a rapid humanitarian response in the event of
widespread violence or a serious deterioration in the humanitarian
situation in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Nujoma Calls For S. African Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Namibian President
Sam Nujoma today spelt out a list of incentives to attract South
African investors to improve their business in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Namibia trade and investment
seminar in Johannesburg, Nujoma said given the close
institutional and economic relationship between the two
countries, it was natural that Namibia should look to South
Africa for capital, technology and managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said South Africa accounted for about 80 percent of
Namibia's imports and about 35 percent of its exports, reflecting
the strong presence of the South African private sector in the
Namibian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government had embarked on a ''new era of
economic reconstruction and development'' based on the strategy
of economic diversification, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the economy would shift away from its traditional
reliance on the production and export of raw materials to
manufacturing, tourism, transhipment and energy.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma extended an invitation to the South African tourism
industry to set up facilities that would develop Namibia as an
international tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
He also called on South Africa to invest in the development of
Namibia's two large electricity projects, which had the potential
to generate sufficient power for the domestic requirements and
for exports to South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Nujoma claimed his government had developed a
package of incentives to give the country a distinct competitive
advantage over other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors in Namibia were guaranteed the right to
repatriate their capital and profits, added the president.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived in South Africa on Monday, was paying a
four-day state visit to the country at the invitation of
President Nelson Mandela. enditem

LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's controversial constitution
amendment bill (the draft constitution) passed its second reading
at parliament today with a unanimous support from MPs of the
ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Voting in the house, 121 MPs from the ruling party were in
favour of the bill while two MPs from the National Party, the
second biggest opposition party in parliament, voted against it.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 MPs of the United National Independence Party (UNIP),
the largest opposition party in parliament, walked out of the
house again today to protest some contentious clauses in the
draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda urged MPs from opposition
parties to reconsider their stand and contribute to the
amendments in the 1996 draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to donor community to help Zambia become a
trully economically independent nation.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution stipulates that only
a second generation Zambian is qualified for presidential
candidate. The UNIP claims that it will prevent its leader and
former President Kenneth Kaunda from contesting the forthcoming
general elections, because Kaunda's parents are Malawians.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Britain to Join Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French President Jacques
Chirac has strongly urged Britain to join the European Monetary
Union (EMU) and play a full part in the construction of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the British Parliament here this
afternoon, Chirac implicitly acknowledged the growing hostility in
Britain to closer European integration by saying that France was
just as determined as Britain to preserve its national identity,
meaning that closer integration would not jeopardize national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived in London on Tuesday for a four-day visit,
stressed that the future demanded increasingly close cooperation
between nations and the European Union (EU), which could not
properly flourish without Britain's participation.
</P>
<P>
"A strong, influential Europe that is capable of playing a full
role in the world is a Europe in which the United Kingdom makes
its voice heard," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted although cooperation between Germany and France
would remain decisive in the development of the European
integration, Britain's participation and Anglo-French friendship
were also vital.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, which is planned to be
launched at in early 1999, Chirac expressed the hope that Britain
would eventually not exercise its right to opt out of the grand
project.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, France wants you to take part in this great
undertaking," he said.
</P>
<P>
The French President also reaffirmed his country's firm
commitment to the EMU by saying "France will be there when the
monetary union goes ahead and I would like to reaffirm here my
determination to stick to the timetable that has been laid down."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-European tide is gathering more and more
momentum in Britain, as the EU remains refused to scrap the
seven-week-old global ban on British beef products exports, which
has given a crippling blow to the British beef industry.
</P>
<P>
A group of Tory Euro-sceptics are campaigning to stage a
national referendum on all the principal guidelines of the
country's European policy.
</P>
<P>
However, British Prime Minister John Major has ruled out the
possibility of holding a national referendum on the country's
European policy, saying that "Britain must be part of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Chirac held talks with Prime Minister
Major and both sides exchanges views on various issues of common
concern and Chirac expressed strong solidarity with his British
host by supporting an EU recommendation of lifting a ban on some
British beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Chirac is planned to meet some British business
and financial leaders to discuss bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> New York City Set to Grind Butts to Submission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- New York City has started a pilot
program to grind butts to submission, in face of the avalanche of
butts that has been mounting, New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Smoking in nearly all public buildings in New York has been
severely restricted since 1995 when the City Administration
enforced a new smoking law.
</P>
<P>
But huddles of smokers puffed away on the doorsteps of their
smoke-free office buildings which have become a new and widespread
feature of the municipal landscape.
</P>
<P>
The Times Square, the commercial and tourist center of the
city, is a case in point. According to estimates by the Times
Square Business Improvement District, its workers sweep up 12,672
butts a day, or more than 4.6 million butts a year, weighing 18
tons.
</P>
<P>
As part of the pilot program, the city is to pay for "Can Your
Butts" signs, to be printed on sanitation trucks and trash baskets
serving the district. Some 3,000 little tin ashtrays with the same
slogan will be supplied by the improvement district and given out
by its cleaning crew to smokers who will accept them.
</P>
<P>
The B.I.D. is offering to pay half of the cost of outdoor
receptacles installed by any building in its district and has set
up a 10,000 fund for this purpose.

</P>
<P>
China will urge and push the parties concerned to work actively
to overcome obstacles in a realistic manner to achieve a

more and more important roles in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to make unremitting efforts with the Arab
states for peace and stability in the Middle East and the world as
a whole, and for safeguarding the interests of the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The latest developments of the Middle East peace process have
created necessary conditions for economic reconstruction and
cooperation in the region," Jiang said, adding, "The achievements
of the economic cooperation will also help consolidate peace."
</P>
<P>
China supports all efforts for promoting regional economic
cooperation in the Middle East and has sent high-level government
delegations to attend the past two Middle East and North Africa
economic summits, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China enjoys traditional, friendly ties with the
Middle East countries and is willing to develop bilateral and
multi-lateral cooperation with these countries based on equality
and mutual benefit.

On the Palestinian issue, Jiang said China always supports the
Palestinian people's just struggle for restoring their national
rights, returning to their homeland and establishing an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate and support the autonomy accord signed by the
Palestinians and Israel. We sincerely hope that the final phase

of the Palestinian issue," Jiang told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Sino-Israeli ties, Jiang said the development
of normal relations between China and Israel will help realize
peace and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is willing to develop friendly ties with
all countries in the Middle East region on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (mutual respect for territorial
integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and
peaceful coexistence).
</P>
<P>
China and Israel established full diplomatic relations in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China also supports Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's initiative to free the Middle East region and the
African continent from nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the third leg of Jiang's six-nation African tour
which has taken him to Kenya and Ethiopia. He will also visit
Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests against US, UK Violation of Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today renewed its protest to
the United Nations on the continuous violations of its air space by
American and British warplanes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali by Iraq's permanent representative to the U.N.,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said these
warplanes violated Iraq's air space seven times in late April. The
warplanes flew over from Kuwait and dropped phosphoric materials
on farms in the north of Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes also dropped "provocational aggressive" leaflets
on Deer District in Basrah Province and on Basrah international
airport in the south of the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq demanded in the letter that the U.N. Secretary General
should exert efforts to stop such acts and prevent their
repetition, which threaten Iraq's sovereignty and territorial
integrity as well as arouse terror among civilians and cause
damage to private and public places.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also emphasized its right of seeking compensations on the
damages caused by the warplane flight.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets Fyodorov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15(Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin held
a closed-door meeting with famous eye surgeon Syatoslav Fyodorov,
one of his 10 rivals in the upcoming presidential elections, today
to discuss whether they may form a coalition.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this meeting, the Itar-Tass news agency said it
is unlikely to result in Fyodorov's withdrawal from the race but
in his support for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov told reporters here, after his one-hour meeting with
the president, that he and Yeltsin discussed an idea of creating
of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Under the idea, proposed by the eye surgeon, the coalition
government would comprise in equal proportions representatives of
all political forces of the country -- communists, socialists and
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is now "thinking over Fyodorov's proposal," Itar-Tass
said. If the president agrees to the idea, the proposed government
may be created after the elections scheduled for June 16,
according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, held such meetings with two other
presidential candidates, retired General Alexander Lebed and
Yabloko bloc leader Grigory Yavlinsky, respectively with the same
aim to win their support.
</P>
<P>
Although the consultations have not led to any formal
agreements, they have shown that neither of the three candidates
are Yeltsin's real political opponents.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if the so-called "democratic coalition" is not
established before the first round of election, it may well emerge
when Yeltsin will compete with his top rival, Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov in by-election.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Yavlinsky, Lebed and Fyodorov made efforts
reportedly to create a tripartite bloc with a view of becoming the
"Third Force" in addition to Yeltsin's and Zyuganov's camps.
However, the three men never came to agreement who will become
their "single candidate."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's campaign chief Sergei Filatov stressed today that if
Yeltsin secures the support of the presidential contenders win
even the first round.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yeltsin is expected to continue his talks with the
three men even before June 16 when the polls are scheduled to be
held throughtout the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces More Grants for Hiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday announced 604 million dollars in grants for hiring
nearly 9,000 police officers in more than 2,500 locations.
</P>
<P>
The grants, Clinton said, would be used to hire 8,646 full-time
and 472 part-time officers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement in a conference call with a dozen
mayors, including four from the states of California, Florida and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
The officers primarily would be used in community policing
programs.
</P>
<P>
"I know you'll do a lot with these additional officers to make
the streets of America safer," Clinton said to the participants.
</P>
<P>
Later, Clinton addressed an annual memorial service on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol for 161 police officers slain in the
line of duty.
</P>
<P>
The grants were issued under the Community Oriented Policing
Services program, created under an anti-crime bill approved by
Congress two years ago. That legislation called for hiring 100,000
new police officers by the year 2000. So far, 43,000 officers have
been hired.
</P>
<P>
California received the largest grant, 102 million dollars for
1,360 new officers. About 53 million dollars will go to Los
Angeles to hire 710 officers.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey received 37.6 million dollar for 503 new officers,
and Florida was given 34.1 million dollars for 467 officers.

<HEADLINE> 34 American Finance Ministers Meet to Push Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of Western
Hemispheric finance ministers is scheduled to be held this weekend
in New Orleans, Louisiana, to continue the Summit of the Americas
process, announced U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin here
today.
</P>
<P>
While making brief remarks at a press briefing in the Treasury
Department, Rubin noted, the Latin American region has undergone a
remarkable turnaround from the 1980s as the result of an initial
round of reform.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, there continues to be an important need to raise
and sustain growth rates, and a critical need to address the
problems of poverty.
</P>
<P>
If the growth rates were to increase to some 5 or 6 percent
annually, it would be a major move toward addressing a second tier
of problems -- poverty and a serious inequity in income
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that in order to push forward continuation of
economic reform in the region, the two-day meeting will focus on
three topics which comprise reinforcing commitments to sound
economic policies, seeking agreement on a program for developing
the process in the Hemisphere and strengthening efforts to combat
financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from 34 countries in the Hemisphere are
expected to attend the meeting from May 17-18 in the U.S. Southern
coastal city. The Inter-American Development Bank will also hold a
seminar on liberalization, development and integration of
financial markets in the Americas during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Increase Of Fish Production Urged In SADC Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
Natural Resources and Tourism Juma Ngasongwa today called on SADC
member countries to increase fish production to meet the demand
in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to open a two-day workshop on strategic planning
on fishery in the region in Bagamoy, 50 kilometres north of
here, the minister said the 135 million people in the region
needs 350,000 tons of fish a year.
</P>
<P>
He said the six coastal member states of SADC, namely Angola,
Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Mauritius, have a
coastline of 5,000 kilometers and produce 3 million tons of fish
a year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the region had abundant inland fish resources
since it has many lakes and rivers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that though fish-farming was gaining
popularity in the region, production was still stagerring at
5,000 to 7,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
He further said it was quite obvious that fish was a source of
cheap animal protein and the sector could employ a significant
number of the population in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ngasongwa stressed that in order to get these benefits
fully, there was an urgent need to have short and long term
development programs with a view to utilize these resources on a
sustanable basis for their own benefit and the future
generations.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was need for improvements in fishing
methods, fish processing and distribution, and above all, to get
additional trained manpower in critical fields such as resource
assesment, fisheries planning and management and extension work.
</P>
<P>
He said that the region had resolved to develop a regional
fisheries training program.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, attended by 22 participants from SADC member
countries will end tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
SADC member countries are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Rules out Resumption of Iranian-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
today lashed out at some Iranian officials who attempted to
resume relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei warned that relations between Tehran and Washington
will have no benefits for the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the strongly-worded statement while he
was meeting with a group of clergies and theology students here.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran should not resume its relations with
the United States, saying "the United States has been thirsty for
blood of the Iranian nation. However, Iran and Islam have managed
to advance both in reconstruction and international arena."
</P>
<P>
He criticized those Iranians who constantly "grumble" about the
absence of ties with the United States and regarded those ties as
a necessity for improvement in economic and political fields.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's criticism was pointed to
the liberals and some government officials backed by moderate
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani and his government have been under hash attacks by
hardliners and extremists supported by Khamenei for abandoning
the Islamic value, corruption, runaway inflation and soft
attitude toward the American government.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said, "A great success of the Iranian nation has been
achieved despite the hostility of the U.S. and its allies to the
Islamic system."
</P>
<P>
"The Mashhad-Sarakhs railway is one of the great jobs done in
spite of America's enmity with the Iranian people. Such a great
progress gives a lesson to those who thinks that they can do
nothing without relying on the United States," Khamenei said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Welcomes Greece's Temporary Lift of Veto to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed Greece's
temporary lifting of its veto to the Mediterranean funds which
Turkey is expected to get a share.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan
said, "We consider this a positive step in carrying out the
European Union (EU) financial obligations toward Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The financial assistance package is part of the EU
obligations for the realization of the Turco-EU customs union,
but the persistent Greek veto prevented any funds from being
channeled to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Greece, under strong pressure from its EU partners, did
not use its veto to prevent the so-called MEDA regulation, a
legal framework for the EU's vast Mediterranean basin funding
program, from being sent to its next legislative destination,
the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Nurkan said that MEDA was only one of the funds that
constituted the EU financial aid to Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Warns Against Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government risks
breaching its tough inflation target unless interest rates are
raised at some point to damp down the long-term effects of rising
consumer spending, the Bank of England said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly inflation report, the bank said that it
was "marginally more likely than not" that underlying inflation
would be above the government's 2.5 percent target in two years
without a rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that inflation will drop from its current
2.9 percent to below 2.5 percent over the next year, reflecting
the recent weakness of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, inflation is then expected to pick up, reaching 2.5
percent or perhaps just above that level in two years' time as
growth accelerates, driven by stronger consumer spending and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The bank referred to the current economic situation, in which
manufacturing output has been stagnant but consumer spending
appears to be picking up, with a warning about the dangers of
making policy against such a mixed background.
</P>
<P>
The inflation report said, "It was precisely at this juncture,
with apparent short-term weakness in some sectors masking signs of
more buoyant future activity, that policy mistakes tended to be
made in the past."
</P>
<P>
Economists interpreted the report as a signal that the bank
would oppose another interest rate cut. Most of them think rates
will not be changed until the general election next May.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Adopts Principles for Opening Tribunal's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government today
adopted basic principles for an agreement on opening a liaison
office in Belgrade of the Hague-based International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The office will operate in keeping with the Yugoslav
constitution and other laws and the liaison officer and bureau
officials will enjoy diplomatic immunity and all privileges in
accordance with international law, the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It is in Yugoslavia's interest that all persons who violate
international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia should be
punished, regardless of their nationality and religion, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the bureau will meet with all those who
wish to testify in connection with war crimes.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people have been indicted as war criminals by the
international tribunal, most of whom are Serbs and only a few are
Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The statement explained that most indicted people are Serbs
partly because there is no liaison office on the Serb side and
investigators can't get relevant information about Muslim and
Croat criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government and the international tribunal have
agreed recently that the tribunal will open an office in Belgrade
to facilitate the investigation in war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Introduce Sliding Rouble Rate from July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has decided
to replace the fixed exchange rate corridor with a sliding rate
for the rouble that will be linked to inflation, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the rouble would fluctuate between 5,000 and
5,600 to the U.S. dollar, compared with the current limits of
4,550 and 5,510, the news agency quoted a presidential decree
issued today as saying.
</P>
<P>
It added that the fluctuation limits will be fixed at a range
of 5,500 to 6,100 rubles to the dollar from the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The rouble's fixed corridor was established last July to
stabilize the currency and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lower the value of the rouble against the
dollar was made after a meeting between President Boris Yeltsin,
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kadannikov, Central Bank
chief Sergei Dubinin and presidential economic aide Alexander
Livshits this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dubinin told a news conference after the meeting that as of
Friday the bank will quote the rouble exchange rate every day on
the basis of transactions on both the interbank and the hard
currency markets.
</P>
<P>
The rouble closed at 4,970 per dollar today at the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The sliding rate, which will be slightly behind inflation and
will thus continue to curb price growth, would make the Russian
market more predictable, a local financial newspaper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Research institutes managed by the
Beijing municipal government have achieved substantial increases
in earnings over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology
Commission said that Beijing currently manages such 235 institutes.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the earnings of the institutes from
technology transfer, industrial production and trade grew at an
annual average rate of 45 percent during the 1991-1995 period. In
1995 alone the earnings amounted to 1.86 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The earnings of the Solar Energy Research Institute, the
Metallurgy Institute attached to the Capital Iron and Steel
Company, the Machinery and Electronics Institute, the Construction
Engineering Institute and the Chemicals Research Institute each
earned at least 100 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The institutes exported 39.66 million US dollars-worth of goods
during the 1991-1995 period, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During that period 1,112 research findings achieved by the
institutes won prizes from the municipal government and various
central departments, 19 percent more than during the 1986-1990
period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institutes transferred 6,124 findings to
manufacturers, resulting in a total extra production value of 7.27
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The fixed assets of the institutes were valued at 1.3 billion
yuan at the end of 1995, up 80.5 percent from the end of 1990.

<HEADLINE> Communist Leader Zyuganov Awarded Literary Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov has been awarded the 1996 Sholokhov Literary
Prize, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The prize was awarded by the Russian Writers' Union for
Zyuganov's "outstanding statements, imbued with civic feelings,
which has attracted the attention of a broad public in Russia,"
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The well-known writers Alim Keshokov and Yevgeny Nosov were
also named winners of the Sholokhov Prize.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Bondarev, leader of the Writers' Union, said Zyuganov had
"proved by his remarkable talent the viability of Russia's great
culture."
</P>
<P>
His books "Believing in Russia", "Across the Horizon" and
"Power" followed the literary traditions of Mikhail Alexandrovich
Sholokhov, author of "And Quiet Flows the Don", Bondarev said.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is seen as President Boris Yeltsin's strongest rival
in presidential elections scheduled for June 16.
</P>
<P>
The union awarded the Sholokhov Prize in 1994 to Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic, who has since been indicted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague for crimes against
humanity, and to Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Education and Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Schools must stress the overall
quality of their students instead of just teaching them how to
take exams, Vice-premier Li Lanqing, member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out during a visit to
central China's Hunan Province, between May 10-16.
</P>
<P>
"It is of critical importance in attaining our magnificent
goals for the coming century that the overall quality of all
people be improved," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Because Chinese parents often judge the quality of a school by
the number of its students who pass university entrance exams, it
puts great pressure on the schools. Li pointed out that schools
must help their students to develop in an all-round way --
morally, intellectually and physically rather than merely show
them how to get good results in examinations.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the State Education Commission do more work to
change the situation and help schools reform their manner of
teaching.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with 28 local foreign-trade companies that was
also part of his week-long visit, the vice-premier emphasized that
enterprises engaged in foreign trade must make a greater effort at
becoming efficient and improving quality.
</P>
<P>
"Only by getting more market-oriented and adopting a new mode
of intensive operation can the foreign trade sector overcome its
current difficulties and increase exports," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Li also had a close look at local markets to
check the price of commodities and listened to work reports by the
provincial leaders.

<HEADLINE> Bruton Praises Major's Promise on Ulster Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
praised the promise offered by his British counterpart John Major
today that the planned all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland scheduled for June 10 would be "genuine and serious".
</P>
<P>
In an article written for the Irish Times newspaper, Major
indicated that the row over arms decommissioning by rival
paramilitary groups would not be allowed to impede all-party
talks on Ulster's future.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament would be tackled at the start of the talks without
blocking the negotiation process on Ulster's future, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he once again repeated that Sinn Fein, political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA) would still not be admitted to the
talks until the IRA renewed its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Bruton immediately urged Sinn Fein and the IRA: "Please restore
your cease-fire now. Don't delay any longer, and restore it
straight away."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dublin, British and Irish ministers
will meet in London next Wednesday to review the Northern Ireland
peace process and may five further details on the planned
all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
But unionists in Northern Ireland cast gloomy views on the
promise made by Major.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
complained that the talks process was designed by Major to appease
the IRA and dilute British sovereignty over Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Major's proposals just to talk about arms decommissioning
parallel to the negotiations were not acceptable to the UUP, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The more radical Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been
infuriated by Major's proposals.
</P>
<P>
DUP's spokesman Sammy Wilson vilified the British prime
minister as a "pathetic man of putty".
</P>
<P>
He accused Major of surrendering to the IRA and claimed that
"eventually he gets his political throat cut".

<HEADLINE> One Million-strong Anti-Piracy Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide campaign to collect
one million signatures was begun here today by the China Software
Alliance (CSA), an alliance of 12 major Chinese software
producers, to promote awareness of protecting intellectual
property rights of software.
</P>
<P>
The program is to last in 44 cities until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chong, deputy director of China's Ministry of Electronics
Industry, said that China has a system of laws protecting
intellectual property rights and has made great advances in this
field.
</P>
<P>
The anti-piracy campaign will have a great influence on the
Chinese and will provide a sound environment for software
developers, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China adopted its Copyright Law, which listed software as one
of the key intellectual products to be protected, in 1991, and
passed the Computer Software Protection Regulations in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
It is vital for China to develop its software industry as
quickly as possible, because the country is in urgent need of new,
high-tech products to improve its industries, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
A manager of the Lianbang Software Company in Beijing, which
sells more than 3,000 types of domestic and foreign software, said
that the crackdown on pirated software has proven to be good.
</P>
<P>
His company's daily sales volume this year doubled after the
crackdown, and is up from last year's 50,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan
daily.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Existing Hong Kong laws that do not
contravene the Basic Law should be adopted as laws of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, the Legal Panel of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR decided at its two-day
meeting which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing a proposal of the legal panel of the Preliminary

their future work and that they will study Hong Kong's laws
further.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's existing laws, except
for any that contravene the Basic Law, are to remain in effect,

matters that concern Hong Kong residents' right of abode at its

<HEADLINE> US Criticized for Trade Sanctions Against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese intellectual property
rights experts have criticized the United States for its
politically-motivated trade sanctions against China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a State Council IPR Office discussion here today,
the experts accused the United States of ignoring the fact that
China has made remarkable progress in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
Duan Ruichun, director of the IPR office, said, "China has
lived up to the terms of the 1995 Sino-US IPR protection
agreement, and improvement has been made in enforcing IPR
protection laws and regulations with the nationwide campaign last
year against infringement."
</P>
<P>
He said the US's actions are politically motivated, and that it
is putting pressure on China by distorting facts, nitpicking about
IPR protection in China, and waving a big stick of trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The United States published a list of Chinese goods that face
punitive sanctions on Wednesday, after China refused to go along
with its unjustifiable demands last month.
</P>
<P>
After April 7, the US put forward "an emergency action plan"
that included many unreasonable and ridiculous demands, Duan said,
adding that the plan also told China what it must do in 30-day,
60-day, and 90-day stages.
</P>
<P>
Duan described the US's actions as interference in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Professor Guo Shoukang of People's University pointed out that
China has had a law protecting IPR since 1978, and that the
nationwide crackdown on infringement last year demonstrated
China's achievements that have won it praise from unbiased
international IPR groups.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Jiabin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
criticized the United States for its unreasonable demand of China
to close 13 innocent Chinese CD factories. He told the US that
China is gradually becoming a country ruled by law and it will not
shut down CD plants unless there is enough evidence that they are
breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Economist Wang Dongjing explained that China is open to all
other countries, not just to the United States, and the US demand
to close the plants while allowing US enterprises to replace them
is not in keeping with the principles of a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
Most experts speaking at the discussion called on the United
States to give up its call for sanctions, and proceed from common
ground to solve the differences through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Reports Better Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Deposits balance in domestic
financial institutions in this special economic zone in south
China's Guangdong Province rose to about 126 billion yuan by the
end of April, about 4.7 billion yuan more than in March.
</P>
<P>
Their loans balance jumped to nearly 83 billion yuan, about
three billion yuan up from the beginning of the year, according to
statistics released by the local branch of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Funds flowing into the city exceeded those flowing out by more
than three billion yuan, said officials at the electronic
clearance center here.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise deposits, reversing a sharp downward trend over the
previous months, grew by about three billion yuan in April, while
individual deposits expanded by nearly 1.9 billion yuan from March.
</P>
<P>
The increased loans were used as circulating capital for
commercial and industrial entities and foreign-funded firms, and
as loans for fixed assets investment.
</P>
<P>
"The bullish local securities market has attracted funds from
other parts of China as well as individual deposits," an official
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A relaxed financial environment across the country has helped
local enterprises receive previously delayed payments, promoting
their sales revenues and settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
"Shenzhen is expected to have a better financial situation
soon," said Wang Xiyi of the local branch of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Banks in Shenzhen offer a big margin of profits for local
enterprises because of their recent cut in interest rates, and this
will spur their transactions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the domestic financial institutions in
Shenzhen will continue to lead other large and medium-sized cities
in China in creating profits. Their profits this year should top
last year's 4.7 billion yuan, he said.

<HEADLINE> Georgia and Breakaway Region Sign Peace Memo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Georgia and its breakaway region of
South Ossetia signed a memorandum here today aimed at building
confidence and providing a framework for settling more than five
years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum "on measures to ensure security and strengthen
mutual trust between the parties in the Georgian-Ossetian
conflict" rejects the use of force or political and economic
pressure.
</P>
<P>
It was signed in the Kremlin after talks between Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze, South Ossetian leader Lyudvig
Chibirov, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President of North
Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said Galazov had brokered the
agreement, partly because North Ossetia and neighbouring South
Ossetia are populated by ethnic kin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described the signing of the memorandum as "a historic
event."
</P>
<P>
"It is not the final document, but an important beginning, a
memorandum of trust which, with the help of further talks, can
bring a final settlement to the misunderstanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believe the document may help promote peace in
other "hot spots" in the Caucasus, such as Russia's breakaway
republic of Chechnya and in the conflict between Armenia and
Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
However, the document does not address the root of the conflict
-- South Ossetia's demand for independence which has been rejected
by Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began in December 1990 when Georgia annulled South
Ossetia's autonomous status and South Ossetia responded by
declaring itself part of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union
collapsed, the South Ossetians declared themselves fully
independent.

<HEADLINE> More for Health Sector in Pakistan's Next Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
planning to make significant increase in allocation for the health
sector in the coming budget of the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Federal Secretary for Health Mueen Afzal said here today that
more than 2.5 billion rupees (72 million US dollars) has been
planned for the health sector in the next budget (July 1996-June
1997) against the 600 million rupees (17.3 million dollars) given
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said that to make viable modifications in the national
health policy major emphasis has been laid on primary health care.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, apart from the ongoing service training
programs for 32,000 lady health visitors (LHVs) in Pakistan, more
than 100,000 women are expected to be inducted for the post of LHV
by June this year, according to Afzal.
</P>
<P>
These women from both rural and suburban areas are expected to
serve 62 to 65 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Afzal said, appropriate arrangements have also been made to
monitor and evaluate the scheme and a team of senior medical
professionals are scheduled to submit their report next month.
</P>
<P>
Due to a major shift in the government policy towards primary
health care, it thus becomes necessary for tertiary health care
service to seek maximum public-private joint ventures and ensure
constant improvement in the health services, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Condemns Dismissal of Serb PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today condemned
the dismissal of Serb prime minister Rajko Kasagic by Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Igbal Riza, special envoy of
U.N. secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the assistant
secretary-general responsible for former Yugoslavia, said: "The
United Nations joins the chorus of the distinguished individuals
and international organizations that have condemned the dismissal
of prime minister Kasagic by a certain individual whose legal
status is nonexistent and whose place of residence should be in
the Hague".
</P>
<P>
He was refering to Karadzic, self-styled "president" of the
Serb republic, who has twice been indicted by the International
War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic ousted Kasagic on Wednesday accusing him of
threatening the "vital interests" of the Serb Republic. Kasagic
has reportedly refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will continue to deal with Kasagic as legal
representative of Republic Srpska," said U.N. spokesman Alexander
Ivanko.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic has committed himself to full implementation of the
Dayton peace accord and is regarded as a moderate alternative to
hardliners in the Bosnian Serb leadership.

<HEADLINE> Shangri-La Expanding Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotel
Group is interested enough in the Chinese market, according to a
senior executive, to open another two hotels, in Shenyang and
Changchun, in northeast China, this year.
</P>
<P>
Two others, scheduled for operation next year, are under
construction in the coastal cities of Dalian in northeast China
and Qiandao in east China, Esther Chan, vice-president of the
group, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Pudong Shangri-La Grand Hotel and the Wuhan
Shangri-La are to open for service in 1998, Chan said, noting that
the soon-to-be-built Shenyang Trade Hotel, which has about 600
rooms, is designed to cater to business travellers.
</P>
<P>
The one in Changchun will be more expensive, and have more than
450 rooms, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Shangri-La Beihai, in southwest China, was just opened for
service early this year, the eighth, after those in Beijing,
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xi'an, and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
It built its first Chinese hotel in 1986 in Hangzhou, a popular
scenic city in east China.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that China's growing economy, especially that of the
tourist industry, with its great potential, guarantees the number
of hotel guests.
</P>
<P>
The lack of hotels in some medium-sized cities, the new areas
opening to the outside world, and the newly-developed tourist
zones provide an opportunity for the group, which is the largest
hotel management group in Asia, she said.
</P>
<P>
The group has also placed importance on renovating old hotels,
to keep its competitive edge in the market, she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The hotel in Beijing is a good example. In recent years it has
poured about eight million US dollars into improving its
facilities, and the refurbishing of guestrooms, restaurants, and
public areas is nearing completion, according to the hotel's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
The five-star hotel, which was built in 1986, is expected to
see a rise in its occupancy rate, which was already running around
70 percent last year, after the renovation work, the general
manager said.
</P>
<P>
The term "Shangri-La" comes from the British writer James
Hilton's 1933 classic "Lost Horizon", where it meant an imaginary
mountain utopia.
</P>
<P>
The Shangri-La Hotel Group now has more than 30 luxury and
holiday hotels around the globe, with more than 14,000 rooms,
including those in China, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

adviser to the caretaker government Wahiduddin Mahmud said that

<HEADLINE> Bildt Throws Support Behind Serb Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the international
community's high representative in Bosnia, arrived in Banja
Luka in northwestern Bosnia this morning to support embattled
Serb Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Bildt is to meet Kasagic, who was dismissed by
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic yesterday, Bildt spokesman
Colum Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
The ousting of Kasagic is "illegal and unjustified" both under
the Serb Republic's constitution and under the Dayton peace
accords which ended the war in Bosnia, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Karadzic's office Wednesday said that the
prime minister was removed for policies that caused a government
crisis and damaged Serb state interests.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic has reportedly rejected the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and NATO's top military
commander George Joulwan will join Bildt in the meeting with
Kasagic, Murphy added.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic, who committed himself to full implementation of the
Dayton peace accords when Bildt toured Banja Luka last week, is
regarded as a moderate alternative to hard-liners in the Bosnian
Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, twice-indicted for war crimes, is believed by
diplomats here to be working against the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Government to Improve Education Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Special Assistant to the Prime
Minister on Social Sector, Shahnaz Wazir Ali said the Pakistani
government plans to improve education standard of the country
through a revised curriculum and teacher training courses.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Pakistan Television (PTV) here

She believed that if the teachers are trained properly and a
correct curriculum is provided Pakistan's standard of education
could improve.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's educational sector requires budgetary allocation of
4.5 percent of GNP, but the government is now spending only about
2.5 percent. There is a need to spend more on education, and its
budget should be increase gradually, she added.

schools, but only 16 million are admitted. Out of the 16 million,
about 50 percent children dropout after class five.

and by the year 2000 about 85 to 90 percent of the children will
be able to attend primary school, she said, adding that the
government plans to universalize primary education by the year
2005.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Price War Sweeps HK Home Loan Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A spate of interest rate cuts
have swept across the local high-yielding, low-risk mortgage
lending market, with both domestic and foreign banks trying to
take a bigger slice.
</P>
<P>
A Dutch bank, ABN Amro Bank, fired the first salvo last
September by slashing the standard mortgage rate by 50 basis
points to 10.25 percent. American banks -- Citibank, Chase
Manhattan and American Bank of Asia -- followed suit, as did a
collection of domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April the housing loan rate fell to 9.25
percent, merely 75 basis points above Hong Kong's benchmark
rate. Bank of China Group (BOC), a heavyweight on the local
mortgage lending market, saw eight of its member banks join the
queue to offer lower rates.
</P>
<P>
The low price frenzy is believed to have spread across half
of the market, though two giants -- Hong Kong Bank and Hang Seng
Bank -- refused to join in. It is estimated that the two big
banks and the BOC dominate 80 percent of the local mortgage
market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaohui, a researcher at BOC said that a glut of
deposits in tandem with the sluggish loan demand made banks
eager to find a way out for their money.
</P>
<P>
Residential mortgage lending has long been considered as the
most profitable banking business.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics provided by Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) show that total deposits in March 1996 increased 11.6
percent over the same month of 1995, while the total loans and
advances merely rose 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The amount of loans to trade and manufacturing sectors, the
traditional money borrowers, has decreased as the growth rate of
trade slowed down and the overwhelming majority of local factories
moved to China's mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the property market has bottomed out and started
to pick up strength, with prices expected to rise in the
foreseeable future. No wonder banks regard the residential
mortgage market as a secure way-out for their over brimmed money.
</P>
<P>
The current mortgage price war will not have a strong impact on
the banking sector's earnings as the overall interest rate spread
is wide, according to Dio Wang, vice president of Bankers Trust
Fund Managers.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage loans grew sharply by almost 20 percent in the
first quarter of 1996, showing that the low pricing has little
effect on banks' marginal profit.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts predicted that the mortgage price war will
not last long though ABN Amro took a new move to offer a
nine-percent loan to home buyers from the beginning of this month
-- the lowest mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
As required by the HKMA, the mortgage portfolio of a bank
cannot surpass 40 percent of its overall loan. Therefore, banks
cannot lend money to home buyers as much as they like.
</P>
<P>
Considering that further reduction on rate might cost their
profits by a big margin, banks are likely to stop the price war.

<HEADLINE> HKMA Reviews LAF Credit-rating Criteria: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) is looking at relaxing credit criteria to enable more
private sector debt securities to be repurchased through the
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), local English-language
newspaper "South China Morning Post" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, Wednesday ruled out
overtly diluting LAF criteria, but said the rating requirements
may change.
</P>
<P>
"There are rating agencies other than those that we have
specified under our criteria for LAF, and we are looking at that
particular matter," he said, adding "that may actually enable more
people to qualify."
</P>
<P>
At present banks and corporates issuing paper eligible for the
LAF, Hong Kong's equivalent of a discount window, must obtain
minimum credit ratings from the United States-based Moody's
Investors Service of Standard &AMP; Poor's. LAF-status is sought
after as buyers of the securities will usually accept lower yields
in return for the extra liquidity provided by the repurchase
agreements, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Yam did not specify the agencies under consideration, although
the strong presence of Japanese banks in the Hong Kong capital
market, together with a history of favorable Hong Kong ratings
from entities such as the Japan Bond Research Institute, may
indicate that Japanese agencies will be allowed to issue
LAF-status ratings.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to be welcomed by banks, some of whom have
pressured for a relaxation of criteria so that their paper can
become eligible, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Major Promises "Genuine" Talks on Ulster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that the row over arms decommissioning by rival
paramilitary groups would not be allowed to impede all-party talks
on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an article written for the Irish Times newspaper, Major also
promised that the planned all-party talks scheduled for June 10
would be "genuine and serious."
</P>
<P>
He said disarmament would be tackled at the start of the talks
without blocking the negotiation process on Ulster's future.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister reiterated that Sinn Fein, political
wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), would not be admitted to
the talks until the IRA restored its cease-fire, which was
shattered by a huge blast in east London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Sinn Fein has repeatedly demanded that Major give
specific assurances that the planned all-party talks will be real
and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator with
the British government, repeated that the IRA's cease-fire could be
best achieved if Major made an "unambiguous statement" that the
talks process on Ulster's future would be real and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
Hence the promise made by Major today is seen an olive branch
to Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams called for more
clarification of Major's offer, according to a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Major has "ignored some issues and fudged others," he argued.

<P>
ABU DHABI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri ended his two-day visit to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) after his talks with UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan
al Nahyan here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders reviewed the development

</P>
<P>
After his arrival here Wednesday, Hariri held talks with UAE
Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Sultan Bin Zayed al Nahyan and

</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sultan said the UAE would spare no effort in supporting
the Lebanese people to defend their country against Israeli
aggression.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country calls for implementing the
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls on Israeli
forces to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rely on Science to Accelerate Economic Growth: Liu Huaqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, a top Chinese leader,
has called on workers and officials in east China's Jiangxi
Province to speed up economic growth by using science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the old Chinese revolutionary base of Jiangxi,
Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission visited
military factories, research institutes and major state-owned
enterprises in the cities of Jingdezhen and Nanchang.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that
manufacturers turning out either civilian goods or military
products must overcome their present problems by upgrading
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said, "On the one hand, we should independently develop our
own technology and products. On the other hand, we should step up
the reform and open China wider to the outside world and seize
every opportunity to cooperate with overseas companies."
</P>
<P>
The leader expressed support to the Jingdezhen Huayi Group for
its import of technology and equipment for producing
ozone-friendly CFC-free refrigerator compressors.
</P>
<P>
"Green products" have an enormous market potential, he told
local officials and workers.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nanchang, he visited the site of the
headquarters for the "August 1" Uprising launched by the Chinese
Communist Party in 1927 against the Kuomintang regime.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition in
the course of the reform, opening up and the modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
He added: "A nation armed with modern science and technology,
as well as a fine revolutionary tradition is powerful and
invincible. Only such a nation can always be in an impregnable
position."

<HEADLINE> Trying To Get Away From The Mercy Of Tough River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A mighty sea wall, capable of
holding back one of the world's most powerful tidal waterways,
will help protect millions at the mercy of China's Qiantang River.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province of Zhejiang in east China is preparing to
build sea walls capable of resisting floods or hurricanes never
seen in a century.
</P>
<P>
Under the organization of the provincial government, a project
to build sea walls at the mouth of Qiantang River, has recently
passed appraisal by a group of experts.
</P>
<P>
The world-famous Qiantang River has a tide nearly nine meters
high. Every day, it has two tidal movements at a speed as fast as
12 meters a second. The impact of tide is as heavy as seven tons
every sq m, rarely seen in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qiantang River is the province's largest. Along the river are
over 10 million population and 10 million mu of cultivated land,
all at the mercy of the river.
</P>
<P>
The turbulent tide has frequently damaged existing sea
walls. Since the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), it has smashed
up the sea walls 230 times, causing heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Governments of various dynasties have attached importance to
the harnessing of the river's sea walls.
</P>
<P>
The sea walls were first built in the Tang Dynasty (618-907)
and completed during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). Sea
walls on the north and south side of the river stretch for 160 km
and 176 km, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The province will first consolidate the northern sea wall. Most
of the wall was built in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The part,
named "Yulin Sea Wall," has been a well-known water conservancy
project in the ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The northern sea wall has come of age with the passing of
time. Besides, due to the restriction of ancient technology, the
wall was lower than it should be. The foot of the wall has been
seriously eroded by tidal washing, leaving some sections in grave
danger.
</P>
<P>
The province will harness the northern sea wall in phases. In
the first phase, the province will repair sea walls in Haining,
Haiyan and the Old Town of Hangzhou, sections which have most
important geography and suffered most serious erosion.
</P>
<P>
Total length of the three sections is 44.7 km. Investment in
them will exceed 500 million yuan (about 61 million US dollars)
within six years, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
On completion, 80 percent of these sections will be able to
resist tide and flood unseen in 100 years, and ensure the
Hangjiahu Plain, Shanghai and southern Jiangsu province are free
from the suffering brought about by floods or tides, officials
said. The people of the areas will no longer be at the mercy of
the mighty Qiantang.

WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hubei, known as "the province of a
thousand lakes", is striving for its biggest catch of all -
netting the title as China's leading fresh water fish catcher in
five years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the province plans to raise its annual catch
to two million tons, the per capita consumption of aquatics to 33
kg and fishermen's annual income to 3,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic production recorded a rapid growth in the past five
years, with the annual capture climbing to 1.5 million tons in
1995. The area for fish-raising has expanded to 93,300 ha.
</P>
<P>
By readjusting its production structure, the output of turtle,
crab, prawn and valuable fish species increased by a big margin to
meet market needs. A number of villages combined their efforts to
specialize in turtle, crab or aquatic production.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Another 80 cholera cases were
reported today, bringing the total number of confirmed cholera
cases nationwide to 446, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama
said.
</P>
<P>
Bernama quoted a spokesman from the country's Health Ministry
as saying that Pulau Pinang continued to record the highest
increase of 47 new cases, bring its total to 337 while the State
of Kedah saw 27 new cases.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government was very much concerned about the
rapid spread of the disease, and the government has ordered all
food outlets in Pulau Pinang to close for a week to help check the
cholera epidemic that has spread rapidly from the island to a
number of states in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry announced cholera alert in Pulau Pinang on
Tuesday to control the spread of the disease, and Health Minister
Chua Jui Meng flew to the island last night. Chua said his
ministry had sent five medical teams and some experts to Pulau
Pinang to help local medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Pulau Pinang, there is still no sign
of any tapering off of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said ice water sold by some peddlers in Pulau
Pinang was the possible source of the disease, and some 11 dirty
food outlets were ordered to close on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur,
where two cholera cases have been reported now, yesterday advised
residents to take precautions in the wake of the cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that some schools in Pulau Pinang have also
been asked to close to prevent the further spread of cholera.

"There is no way out for confrontation," Cui said when asked to
comment on the failure of the Sino-US IPR talks at a routine press
conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the great efforts China had made and significant
achievements it has gained in protecting IPR, the US unilaterally
announced a list of retaliation measures against China, which
China will never accept, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of the most-favored-nation treatment between China
and the US is a mutually-beneficial arrangement which lays
foundations for normal bilateral trade ties, he noted, adding that
the treatment is in the interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining and developing normal Sino-US ties and bilateral
economic and trade relations complies with the fundamental
interests of the two countries, and their differences on IPR
protection can only be solved through consultation on an equal
footing, rather than through imposing pressure or retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The US government should correct its erroneous decision in this
regard in order to retrieve the damage it has made on bilateral
ties, the spokesman added.

Zhao's treatment center is quite different from psychiatric
clinics in other Chinese cities. It boasts not only advanced
electronic testing instruments and video equipment, but also
treatment, observation and control rooms.
</P>
<P>
The patients range from officials to ordinary workers, old and
young, and they come from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that a survey carried out in 12 provinces and cities
in 1982 showed that the incidence of mental disorders stood at 2.2
percent of the population, and there were some 60 million persons
who needed psychological treatment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police to Rely More on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Robotic firemen, able to tackle
dangerous blazes, are to be recruited in China.
</P>
<P>
The use of robots, and special fire fighting airplanes, is part
of a wide-scale plan to use advanced science and technology to
help safety, fight law and order problems and maintain social
order.
</P>
<P>
The robots, as well as special fire fighting aircraft, will be
used to deal with emergencies in skyscrapers or hazardous petrol
refineries which catch fire.
</P>
<P>
China's police also plan to rely more on science and technology
in its work of maintaining social order and fighting crimes in the
coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Sources from an ongoing three-day Conference on Science and
Technology Concerning Public Security revealed that public
security-related researchers will concentrate on research and the
development of special techniques for obtaining, verifying,
transmitting and processing information and material evidence
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the public security ministry is scheduled
to strengthen the building of an information command system, in a
move to facilitate unified command, and make it possible for local
police forces to share information and respond quickly to
accidents.
</P>
<P>
At a time when more crimes tend to be cross-regional, and more
complicated, the ministry is to put more emphasis on the research
of criminal investigation technology and development of a
comprehensive information network, in a bid to effectively deal
with the trend.
</P>
<P>
Preventive methods and fire-control technology for dealing with
fires in skyscrapers, high-rise homes, underground buildings, as
well as petrochemical factories will be the focus of research in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Plane and robot technology will be applied in fire fighting,
and is expected to be transformed into new equipment for fire
brigades across the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to accelerate the training of
scientific and technological researchers, and fully upgrade the
comprehensive quality of police ranks in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, a team of young researchers is
expected to become the leaders in the field of science and
technology concerning public security work.

<HEADLINE> New Way to Build Seaport Proves Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will soon have one
more route to the sea as the Jingtang Port is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Starting in August, 1989, the construction of the port, which
is 90 km from Tangshan City, had finished eight berths with a
combined handling annual capacity of 6.6 million tons by the end
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the speed of the construction is unprecedented
because of the successful employment of a unique financing method.
</P>
<P>
The Jingtang Port is said to be one of the finest in north
China, capable of accommodating 60 berths for at least 10,000-dwt
ships and the only one on the Bohai Sea capable of housing berths
for 200,000-dwt ships.
</P>
<P>
While traditionally the construction of such a port relied on
State investment, Jingtang has obtained financing through a
variety of channels.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government is one of the investors in the
port. Its participation has not only provided badly-needed funds,
but also helped expand the port's reputation, since it changed its
name from Tangshan Port to Jingtang Port, which implies the
involvement of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Other investors include several major coal mines in Hebei and
Shanxi provinces. They took part in the construction in the
special way of buying the property right of the wharves into which
they injected funds.
</P>
<P>
The port is also buying machinery worth 14 million US dollars
from the Samsung Company of the Republic of Korea and providing
Samsung with some one sq km of land for industrial and trade
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has set up a
special fund of 450 billion rials (150,000 U.S. dollars) to help
young people get married, local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Late marriage has become a social problem in the Islamic
country. Some people aged over 30 could not afford to pay the high
cost of marriage because they earn less than 100 dollars a
month. A marriage costs at least 20,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, young people now face many problems such as
unemployment and the ever rising cost of living and housing.
</P>
<P>
Some parents have to prepare dowry for their daughters even at
the age of six.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that the number of marriages has dropped
considerably since the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian girls would prefer to go abroad and marry
foreigners. But the Iranian authorities maintain that the marriage
between Iranian girls and foreign men is illegal.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Commerce, Trade Corridor Shaping Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to this capital of Anhui
Province, are surprised to find along the streets so many branches
of big department stores of its more developed neighbors such as
Shanghai and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Hefei is only one of the cities representing commercial
co-operation between the developed and less-developed regions
along the Yangtze River, China's longest.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that Shanghai, the country's leading
commercial center, alone has already launched more than 190
commercial and trade entities in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui
provinces. They have combined annual sales of 2.5 billion yuan
(301.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This year, Shanghai plans to set up eight to ten large shopping
entities and 20 to 30 wholesale and retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
The less-affluent regions are also catching up with the wealthy
ones, taking advantage of their rich natural resources and
abundant farm produce.
</P>
<P>
For example, Anhui has invested over 500 million yuan (about
60.24 million US dollars) to build in the Pudong New Area of
Shanghai the Yu'an Plaza, which will be a show-window of import
and export commodities.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation is aimed at making full use of the abundant
resources and geographical conditions to form a commercial
corridor along the Yangtze River, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Now already thriving in the river areas are a large number of
powerful regional and national commodities exchanges, including
the Shanghai metal and grain exchanges, Suzhou commodities
exchange, Nanjing oil exchange, and numerous markets of textile
and light industrial goods, including the famous Hanzheng Street
Market in Wuhan, a rice market in Wuhu and the Chaotianmen Market
in Chongqing.

<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance announced
in Beijing today that a nationwide finance and tax auditing netted
a total of 22.693 billion yuan (about 2.7 billion US dollars) in
illegal funds last year.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that 16.57 billion yuan was in tax frauds,
about five percentage points higher than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Irregularities were found in 771,300 of the almost 1.7 million
enterprises and units targeted by auditors, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The percentage of rule violators, though four percentage
points lower than the previous year, failed to drop by a more
desirable extent," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that some state-owned enterprises had repeated their
past malpractices. Illegal funds uncovered in the 410,000 audited
state-owned enterprises were worth as much as 12.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A weak sense of observing laws and rules among management of
some enterprises and units is said to account for many violations
of financial and tax disciplines, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that an inadequate supervisory mechanism and lax
law enforcement are also to be blamed.

<HEADLINE> China's Computer Upgrading Easier with Kingston Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's leading computer company,
the Legend Group and Kingston Technology Corporation, a
well-renowned US RAM supplier, today signed an agreement at
Beijing's State Guesthouse, for the joint development of the
Chinese computer upgrading market.
</P>
<P>
With the technology, most existing low-grade computers can be
easily upgraded by installing a special Kingston RAM product,
enabling the most popular software to be run on upgraded computers.
</P>
<P>
Experts in China predict that an increasing number of Chinese
people are expected to upgrade their low-grade computers after the
introduction of the new technology, which is likely to lead to
brisk sales of both software and hardware products.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of Legend Group, Guo Wei, said that PC sales
topped one million in China last year, but 79 percent had internal
memories smaller than eight megabytes. This means that popular
software such as Windows 95, multi-media application software and
INTERNET technology can not run on them.
</P>
<P>
Kingston Technology Corporation, a US semi-conductor
manufacturer and a leading computer RAM product supplier, scored a
sales volume of 1.3 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianxing, director of the Computer Department of the
Ministry of Electronics Industry, said that the new technology is
suitable to the actual conditions in China since most Chinese
cannot afford expensive computers at present.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new technology is also good news to some
institutions of higher learning and research institutes which
bought low-grade computers earlier than others.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth International Moulds
Exhibition opened here Wednesday in the Shanghai International
Exhibition Center, drawing some 300 exhibitors from 14 countries
and regions across the world.
</P>
<P>
On display at the exhibition are first-class moulds,
manufacturing equipment, processing centers, machine tools and
testing and measuring equipment.
</P>
<P>
China's mould industry is not in good shape, according to
officials at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Moulds are crucial for industry - they are the raw material for
shaping everything from computer cases to machine parts.
</P>
<P>
But China's backward mould industry has meant spiraling
imports, with more moulds than ever shipped in.
</P>
<P>
Now China is focusing on developing large, precise, complex and
durable moulds, with plans to invest 2.1 billion yuan on 47
projects in the future.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that China imported 811 million US dollars
worth of moulds last year, up from just 240,000 US dollars worth
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Yang Keng, head of the China Mould Industrial Society, said
that the increased imports indicate that the country's mould
industry still remains backward. However, it has a great
potential.
</P>
<P>
To help modernize the industry, the society already has
cooperated with the Shanghai International Exhibition Company to
stage five international mould exhibitions. The current exhibition
continues through May 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Large amounts of superior-grade fruit
in Shandong Province have been well packed and are ready for
shipping overseas.
</P>
<P>
The eastern coastal province, well-known in China for its
high-quality fruit, sold 100,000 tons of top-grade apples, pears,
cherries and other kinds of fruit overseas last year, ranking as
the biggest fruit exporter in the country, according to a local
report.
</P>
<P>
Fruit trees cover 1.3 million ha of land in the province, and
the output came to 6.5 million tons in 1995, the report, released
by a fruit research academy, added.
</P>
<P>
Following its good sales records in Hong Kong, Singapore, and
some other Asian countries and region, Shandong found new markets
in Eastern Europe and the Middle East last year, a provincial
official said.
</P>
<P>
More superior-grade pears, grapes and chestnuts are being
shipped overseas from Shandong instead of apples, which accounted
for 60 percent of the province's fruit exports in the past.
</P>
<P>
To meet the strict demands of the international fruit market,
the province has made great efforts to select improved breeds of
fruit, improve packaging and register trademarks, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, courses on orchard management and fruit growing are
expected to appear soon in some of Shandong's colleges and
universities, he added.

<HEADLINE> Small Towns Become Into China's New Economic Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- They have become China's mini
boom-towns, home to 75 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
And the thousands of small towns spread across the country have
witnessed a rapid economic growth over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The number of towns with a population no more than 20,000 in
rural China increased by one third in the six year period,
climbing to 15,000, according to the latest statistics issued by
the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The booming rural towns have developed into new economic,
cultural, scientific, information and service centers, attracting
more and more Chinese farmers yearning for a new life.
</P>
<P>
The farmers started their urban lives by buying apartments,
which led to a construction boom in both new and existing rural
towns.
</P>
<P>
In the 1979-1995 period, new residential houses with a floor
space of 10.3 billion sq. m. have been built in small towns,
providing new homes for 130 million households.
</P>
<P>
The per capita living space in rural towns and villages has
expanded from 7.8 sq.m. in 1978 to last year's 21.2 sq.m.,
approaching the world's average level.
</P>
<P>
This is a remarkable progress for a country with 1.2 billion
people, a Chinese observer said.
</P>
<P>
A state plan designs to raise the rural per capita living space
to 23 sq.m. by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that rural towns across China have
built 50,000 wholesale or trade markets, yielding 440 billion
yuan in business volume a year, and set up 10,000 industrial zones
attracting a million industrial firms and 60 million rural
laborers.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to stimulate the upgrading and development of rural
towns, the state has invested much in infrastructure projects and
cultural, educational and public health facilities at rural areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 98 percent of the towns and 70 percent of villages
now have access to electricity, 3 million km of road have been
built and 310 million people now have clean running water.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that by the end of the century some 200
million farmers will leave the farmland and migrate to towns all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to step up measures for the
construction of new towns and turn 20 percent of the existing
towns into well-distributed industrial centers with good
infrastructure and convenient transportation services by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Go to Chechnya Despite Death Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will go to Chechnya despite Chechen rebels' threat to kill him
there, a presidential spokesman made it clear today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here, Spokesman Sergei Medvedev
stressed that Yeltsin "does not understand and does not accept the
language of threats."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned the successors of late Chechen separatist
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev that they would be eliminated if they
continue to fight.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin announced earlier this month that he would visit
Chechnya later this month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Russian NTV television network
Tuesday, Chechen terrorist master Shamil Basayev threatened that
his fighters would do their best to kill Yeltsin if he arrives in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to meet him well, so that he never leaves this
place," Basayev said, adding that he opposed peace talks with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"I am standing for war," stated Basayev, who led a terrorist
attack on Budennovsk city in southern Russia last summer.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin's visit is the height of insolence. It is a spit in
the face of our people, using our pain, our blood for advertising
purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, however, flatly rejected the allegation, saying, "The
head of state is fulfilling his duty as the president and is
sincerely interested that peace reigns in the Chechen republic
while the Dudayevists do not conceal their interest in the
continuation of the war."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Yeltsin's statement that nobody but the president
can make the warring parties sit down at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov stressed today that
he would try to talk Yeltsin into postponing the trip since it is
impossible to ensure his safety in Chechnya at present.
</P>
<P>
But Moscow-backed Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev, contradicting
Kulikov's opinion, declared today that the security of Yeltsin
would be fully ensured during his visit to Chechnya scheduled for
mid-May.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Another Telecommunications Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a
telecommunications satellite aboard a locally-made Long March
KM-3B launch vehicle in late 1997, said Hao Weimin, General
Manager of the China Orient Telecom Satellite Company Ltd, here
today.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, named ChinaStar-1, is being assembled by the
Lockheed Martin Corporation of the United States and will be
delivered to the Xichang Launching Center in September next year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hao, the satellite will comprise 24 C-band and 24
Ku-band transponders of 36MHz equal bandwidth, which is equivalent
to the total number of transponders at present being used by
China's broadcasting and telecommunications enterprises.
</P>
<P>
With an orbital lifetime of over 15 years, the satellite is
expected to meet the increasing demands of telecommunications and
broadcasting enterprises for space resources. It will also help
improve communications in China's remote countryside so that all
Chinese villages will have access to telephone communications by
the end of the century, Hao said.
</P>
<P>
Already overseas and domestic enterprises such as Intelsat and
Inmarsat have contacted China Orient, the owner of the satellite
about leasing services. In addition, a number of overseas
industrial, telecommunications, financial and insurance companies
are negotiating with the company to join in the financing,
insurance and launching of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
China Orient is jointly organized by domestic investors as a
state-owned limited company. It operates the orbiting phase of
satellites used for communications and broadcasting, satellite
control systems, satellite data communications, VSAT satellite
navigation and mobile satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will utilize A2100 satellite technology, regarded
as "state-of-the-art" in satellite capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Battle Against Drought Pays Off In Henan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A good harvest of wheat is
promised in central China's Henan Provinces, thanks to farmers'
efforts to combat serious drought and rainfall in late April.
</P>
<P>
Serious drought affected 80 percent of the 4.9 million hectares
of wheat fields in Henan, a major producer in China, according to
the Provincial Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The area north of the Yellow River had only 10 mm of rain
during the period from the beginning of winter to March 30, 80
percent less than the same period in a normal year, an official of
the department said.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels earmarked a total of 10 million yuan
for the campaign to fight against drought, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Henan Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China
extended 2.41 billion yuan in loans to farmers to support their
efforts to combat drought, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, farmers had irrigated 3.3 million hectares of
wheat fields by mid-April, ensuring normal growth of their crops.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall averaging 35 mm fell throughout Henan in late April
and early May, further easing the effects of the drought, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Criminal in Macao Jetfoil Robbery Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A leading criminal in last year's
jetfoil robbery case was sentenced to 19 years and six months
behind bars plus heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
A judge announced at the Macao District Court this afternoon
that Wu Shu Cheong, 37, was guilty of piracy, robbery and illegal
possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced him to 19 years and six months
imprisonment plus 6.50 million Patacas (about 823,000 US dollars)
of compensation to security company and 17,400 Patacas (about
2,200 US dollars) of damage repairs to the Macao Tourism and
Entertainment Company.
</P>
<P>
Wu has been held custody since June 15 last year. He was
arrested two days after the jetfoil armed robbery in Chinese
waters between Macao and Hong Kong, which involved more than one
billion Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
The court said that he was convicted on leniency given his
crimes. The leniency was based on the fact that he had a good
record as a police officer and his crimes were caused by debts due
to his wife's gambling losses.
</P>
<P>
Several other criminals in the case were either executed or
sentenced suspended death penalty, life imprisonment on the
mainland or Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Protest Against Violence on Campus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 Iranian university students
have voiced their anger at and protested against extremists'
violence on their campus in Tehran in an open letter to the
authorities, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the open letter, students of Sheriff Technical University
demanded stringent measures to prevent any violent behaviors by
Ansar Hezbullah, an extremist group in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Akhbar said that their letter has been sent
to Iranian Supreme leader Ali Khamenei's office, President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani's office, Parliament and the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, some extremists from the Ansar Hezbullah
intruded into the university campus and stopped a scheduled
speech by liberal-minded professor Abdolkarim Soroush by beating
some students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group has also held frequent demonstrations in
Tehran University, mosques and other public places in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
They are responsible for setting book-shops on fire and causing
disturbance in universities. Their actions have become the talk of
the town and the attention of domestic and foreign circles.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbullah faction is opposed to the changes and reforms
implemented or proposed by the moderate Rafsanjani government and
some newly-elected parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
They regard any relaxation of strict Islamic traditions like
black chadore, the separation of sexes and introduction of western
academic values as a breach of Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group is supported by hardliner clergyman
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati who called for a purge of westernized
professors and administrators who criticize religious ideas in
their lectures at the university.
</P>
<P>
Despite the purge during the Cultural Revolution, many
professors at Iran's universities are Western-educated and are
in favor of separation of religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
The most important crusader for the separation of religion
and politics is Abdolkarim Soroush.

<HEADLINE> Bees Thrive On Poisonous Desert Plant in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A wild poisonous weed that can
survive harsh conditions can provide the sweet scent of success
for China's desert areas.
</P>
<P>
Ironically the plant has long been on the list to be uprooted
as a hazardous weed. Now researchers have found that the cynanchum
komarorii is a fine nectar rich plant, able to fix desert sand and
at the same time provide rich pickings for bees.
</P>
<P>
The poisonous shrub grows in desert areas in Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in north China, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region and Shaanxi Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that the plant is strong enough to grow in
extremely dry areas with strong sunlight, making it ideal as a
sand-fixing plant, according to Liang Shikui, a research fellow at
the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Although the plant is poisonous, its nectar contains as many as
35 kinds of nutritious elements which meet edible standards, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the nectar of the plant can be appealing to
bees. It is estimated that more than 800,000 ha of the plant can
be used to raise 1.5 millions flocks of bees which might produce
one-third of the country's honey.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the seeds of the plant can produce cooking and
industrial oil, and sugar can be extracted.

<HEADLINE> China's Solar Geyser Market Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China has become the biggest solar
water heater manufacturer and market in the world, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country now has 300 manufacturers of
solar geysers and sold one million sq m of solar geysers last year.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the ministry said that the potential market for
the country's solar geysers is very promising, as there are only
4.3 million sq m of solar geysers in China at present, that is,
about one sq m per household.
</P>
<P>
The expert also added that the rural regions of the country
will be the largest potential market, saying that three fourths of
solar geysers are sold in large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
China has set an ambitious plan to manufacture 12.5 million sq
m of solar geysers by the year 2000. According to the plan, the
country will input some one billion yuan to support the key
companies in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Other solar heat-utilizing products such as solar greenhouses
and solar desiccators are widely used in the country, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The output of the more than 500 companies making solar
heat-utilizing products was worth 600 million yuan last year, an
increase of 20 percent over the previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGZHOU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A 16-year-old Chinese girl
suffering from a rare huge tongue illness is undergoing treatment
after workers at a factory collected 26,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now part of Liu Yuxue's tongue has been removed, but the legacy
of her enlarged tongue - protruding teeth - still need to be
corrected, according to doctors at the No. 44 Hospital of People's
Liberation Army, where Liu is undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a girl in Furong Village, Pingtang County of southwest
China's Guizhou Province, was found to have a larger than usual
tongue at birth. But as she grew so did her tongue, making eating,
drinking and speaking very difficult and painful.
</P>

Soon after Liu's illness was highlighted by local media, the
army hospital offered to perform an operation and hospital staff
collected some 7,000 yuan. But her family were still unable to
meet the large cost of surgery.

Sun Fulin, manager of a machine-building plant in Nanyang City
- thousands of kilometers away in Henan Province - called on
employees to give donations for the sick girl.

<HEADLINE> New Measure Treating Cancer Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A new method for treating cancer
which uses recycled urine is undergoing clinical tests in China.
</P>
<P>
The treatment, which helps to fight cancer through cell
differentiation, is being used in an east China hospital.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically the method improves the body environment through
the adjustment and control of cell differentiation preparation, a
kind of micromolecule proteolipid which is abstracted from human
urine. It treats cancer by leading cancer cells towards benign
terminal differentiation, according to sources with the hospital
attached to Anhui Medical Sciences University, the only hospital
in the country which is allowed to conduct such clinical tests.
</P>
<P>
Medics say the treatment can kill targeted cancer cells, but
causes no harm or side effects to the human body.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 15 cancer patients have received the
trial treatment since October last year. Two liver cancer
sufferers have become better, with the ascites reduced markedly;
tumors of a lymph cancer patient basically disappeared and a
sufferer of carcinoma of uterus has seen the spread of cancer
cells halted.
</P>
<P>
Similar forms of treatment are being tested in a few hospitals
in the United States, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Policy Paves Way For Self Sufficiency (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have
optimistically predicted that the country will be producing enough
grain to feed its anticipated 1.6 billion mouths by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
The way is being paved for grain self-sufficiency under an
ambitious new policy that has seen ex-farmers rush back to the
land to work the fields once again.
</P>
<P>
The policy controls grain prices in favor of farmers, helped by
government-controlled structure to ensure that the costs of
fertilizers remain stable, and in sufficient supply.
</P>
<P>
The measures have substantially stimulated enthusiasm for
farming among China's massive army of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in major grain-producing areas, are busy expanding
production, and those who left their farmfields to work in urban
areas are going back to the land - to engage in farm production.
</P>
<P>
Under the new grain purchase policy introduced in Jiangxi,
Anhui, Sichuan, Hunan and other key grain-producing provinces,
state grain purchase prices will rise to between 140 yuan and 150
yuan per 100 kilograms this year in comparison with around 100
yuan per 100 kilograms last year.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhong, an official with the Jiangxi Farm-use Material Supply
Company, said that Jiangxi's price index for chemical fertilizer
dropped from 30 percent last year to seven percent this year.
Included was the price for urea, which reduced by 150 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces including Jiangsu and Fujian also have cut and
unified prices for chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are said to be in high spirits and enthusiastic for
farming.
</P>
<P>
"It is profitable to grow grain," said Zhao Changgeng, a farmer
in Nanchang county, Jiangxi Province, while tilling abandoned
lakeside areas.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old farmer estimated that he would earn additional
4,500 yuan per hectare from his paddy field.
</P>
<P>
The county is expected to increase cultivated areas by 40,000
hectares to 70,000 hectares this year.

Jiang Zhongping, assistant to the provincial governor,
disclosed that Jiangxi's farmland under early rice this year has
reached 1.34 million hectares, up ten percent over last year, and
its investment in agriculture risen by one third to 1.64 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has played an important role in filling the grain
shortages of Southern China by selling at least one billion
kilograms of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the province is able to turn out an additional
500 million kilograms of grain this year.
</P>
<P>
"This means that Jiangxi will supply more grain to other
parts," he said.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that Fujian province has vowed to increase its
grain output by 130 million kilograms in way of stabilizing its
grain areas at two million hectares, transforming more low-yield
farmland, and raising the multiple crop indexes.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang province is undertaking a project to help the province
increase grain output by 400 million kilograms by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
According to the Statistical Bureau, China's grain cultivated
areas will reach 110 million hectares this year, up 1.1 million
hectares over last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the new policy will bring about a
favorable turn for China's agriculture, which had paced up and
down over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the transfer of more farmland to experienced
farmers as a result of more surplus rural labor force shifting to
non-farming work, the popularization of hybrid rice, and the
improvement of cultivation system are helping raise farmers'
productivity.
</P>
<P>
The economists are optimistic about China's ability to feed its
1.6 billion people in the year 2030.

<HEADLINE> Sites of Long-vanished Ancient State Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered the site of an ancient state that disappeared more than
13 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
And the discovery has resolved a controversial question -
slaves in the state were buried alive with their dead masters.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists have unearthed 1,000 graves belonging to the
ancient state. Records existed about the state but no sites have
ever been found until recently.
</P>
<P>
The graves are scattered around the deserts and mountains of
the Qaidam Basin in northwest China's Qinghai Province, according
to Xu Xinguo, an archeologist in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe the graves were left over from the
Tuyuhun state under the rule of Tufan, a regime established by
ancient Tibetans between the seventh and ninth centuries.
</P>
<P>
Tuyuhun, a branch of an ethnic group in northeastern China,
began to move westward from early fourth century and established a
state beside the Qinghai Lake, with its political center at Dulan
County.
</P>
<P>
The state had close contact with Tufan and the Central Plains
region of China. Historical records show Tuyuhun was conquered by
Tufan in the year 663 and then became inter-mixed with the
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xinguo said the ancient Tuyuhun graves and other ancient
traces and cities in the vicinity can be dated back to the Bronze
age 3,000 years ago and to the Tang and Song Dynasties between the
seventh and 13th centuries.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists in the province have been working in the area for
some years, first discovering 60 graves and unearthing a large
quantity of antiques of high archeological value, including goods
made from stone, bone, copper, iron, ceramics, wood, lacquer,
gold, silver and silk.
</P>
<P>
"Funeral ways in the graves, such as distorted limbs, cremation
and sacrificial horses, extremely resembled the ways in southern
and northern parts of Tibet," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
During the Tufan period the Tibetan tribes scattering across
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, began to form a strong ethnic community
which later developed close ties with the Han people and other
ethnic minorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of wooden tablets and artifacts with ancient
Tibetan writing show that ancient Tibetan became popular at that
time, and Tuyuhun burial customs were part of the Tufan culture.
</P>
<P>
"Excavation of the graves also confirmed the long-disputed
supposition that slaves were buried alive with their deceased
masters during the Tufan period," he said, adding different
quantities and kinds of sacrificial goods show there existed a
social estate system and disparity between rich and poor, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Hubei to Dig New Canal to Boost Waterway Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province in central China is
preparing to dig a new canal to substantially shorten the waterway
transportation distance between two major cities and to drain
water from the Yangtze River to the Hanjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Listed on the national inland waterway development plan, the
project will help shorten the waterway distance between Shayang
City on the Hanjiang River and Shashi City on the Yangtze, from
the present near 800 km to some 60 km.
</P>
<P>
At present, the waterway passenger and cargo transport from
Hanjiang, which is a tributary of the Yangtze, to the upper
reaches of the Yangtze has to make a detour via this provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The canal will also drain water from Yangtze to Hanjiang, thus
providing more water for the generation of electricity and
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the digging of the new canal, the province
will make use of the present waterways to open a new 160-km route
on the Hanjiang River to avoid the detour via Wuhan and shorten
the distance by over 300 km.

<HEADLINE> New Sino-US Oil Exploration Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corporation and Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc of the United
States signed a contract today to explore for oil and gas in the
South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC President Wang Yan said the contracted area - 63/15 block
- lies 70 km south of Sanya City, in south China's Hainan
Province, and covers an area of 2,030 km. It is close to two other
Chevron exploration blocks of 62/23 and 50/20 contracted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that exploration work has proved that the contracted
blocks are rich gas-bearing areas and have good prospects for oil
and gas development.
</P>
<P>
Under the new contract, Chevron will undertake the risks in
exploration alone and will begin a 3-D seismic survey in 63/15
block during this summer.
</P>
<P>
Exploratory drilling will start following the interpretation of
seismic data.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC and Chevron started their cooperation in Chinese offshore
oil and gas explorations in 1983, and have so far signed seven
contracts and agreements.
</P>
<P>
The most outstanding results achieved so far by Chevron are the
four Huizhou oilfields in the South China Sea, which included the
cooperation of American-owned Texaco and the Italian company Agip.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- To foster good-neighborly ties
and multi-faceted cooperation with Russia and China has been a
priority in Mongolia's foreign policy in recent years, the
country's top diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian Minister of External Relations T. Gombosuren spoke
highly of the incumbent government's performance in handling
foreign affairs, saying the government has done a brilliant job of
meeting the diplomatic objectives laid out in its administrative
program.
</P>
<P>
These objectives have laid the legal groundwork for the
adoption of a legal document on foreign policy by the State Great
Hural, the country's parliament, two years ago, the minister said
in an interview with a local newspaper, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has been holding regular meetings with Russia and
China as a means to jointly tackle the problems popping up in its
relations with neighbors, said Gombosuren.
</P>
<P>
The regular summit and high-level meetings between China and
Mongolia have enhanced their mutual trust and understanding,
enriched the substance and forms of their cooperation and
consolidated the legal basis of their ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between Mongolian Prime Minister
P. Jasray and Chinese Premier Li Peng has given a great impetus to
the two countries' relationship, leading to the renewal of a

HUHHOT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Liu Xiaochun, the first woman doctor
of the Oroqen nationality, a ethnic group mainly living in
northeast China, has been awarded 10,000 yuan by the local
government.
</P>
<P>
With 4,000 people who live mainly in the vast forests in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Heilongjiang province, the
Oroqens today are still engaged in both hunting and breeding
animals.
</P>
<P>
After the foundation of new China in 1949, the government in
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region adopted various effective
measures to develop education among the Oroqens, who had a rich
store of folk tales handed down orally, but no written form.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, primary schools have opened in every village, and
spending on education has increased by 20 percent annually, and
nearly 20 million yuan has been used in the construction of school
buildings.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1995, more than 700,000 yuan have been accumulated
to develop ethnic education. And the local government exempted the
Oroqen children from tuition fees, to ensure they continue their
studies, while giving each student 100 yuan for stipends per month.
</P>
<P>
The local government formulated various policies to ensure
teachers earn more, and allocated 100,000 yuan each year to
provide training for the secondary school teachers, aiming at
improving their quality.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage more children of the local hunters to
seek higher education, the local government aided students who
have passed college entrance examinations by paying their whole
tuition fees, and so far, over 80 students have benefited from the
policy.

<HEADLINE> Olympics, Paralympics Accessible to Disabled Spectators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The US Justice Department
has worked with the organizers of the Olympics for years to ensure
that the sports venues were built to be accessible to disabled
spectators, said assistant Attorney General on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Deval Patrick toured the Olympic Stadium, home to
the Atlanta Summer Games and the 10th Paralympics, calling it "the
most accessible stadium in the world."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will be able to see world class events in a world
class stadium providing world class access to athletes and
spectators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dated back to three years ago, the Justice Department started
to focus its efforts on the Olympic Stadium as well as other
venues including the Olympic aquatic center, the Stone Mountain
Memorial tennis center, and the Morris Brown college and Clark
Atlanta University field hockey stadiums.
</P>
<P>
Patrick said that the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
(ACOG) has agreed to ensure that these five newly-built venues are
completed in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA).
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Stadium, which has a capacity of 85,000 seats, will
designate one percent of its seats for wheelchair users with each
space next to a conventional seat so that disabled spectators can
sit next to family member and friends.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement sets a new standard for stadium access, and the
Olympic Stadium will serve as a model for all future stadiums,"
said Patrick.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working closely for some time with the Olympic
organizers and are pleased with their efforts to make their
facilities accessible for all people with disabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Olympics, scheduled to begin on July 19, will host over
12,000 athletes, while the Paralympics, slated for August 15, will
attract more than 3,500 disabled athletes from 120 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Following the Summer Games, the Olympic Stadium will be
converted for use by the Atlanta Braves, while the other venues
will continue to be used as sporting facilities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Eliminate Illiteracy by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam aims to eliminate illiteracy
and achieve universal primary education in 16 southern provinces
before the year 2000, official report here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong delta is a strategic economic region in Vietnam and
has a great potential in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of the region's population are suffering from
poverty and hunger, 50 percent of the communes and districts are
in mountainous, remote or flood affected areas and 32 percent of
the communes have no roads and 33 percent of them have no
electricity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
These difficulties lead to slow cultural and social
development, especially in education. Illiterate people make up
more than 19 percent of those of working age, while people
receiving high education account for only 0.15 percent of the
population (the country's average rate is 0.36 percent).
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period, southern provinces eliminated
illiteracy among more than 89,000 people aged between 15 and 35,
and encouraged 3.4 million children (aged six to 14 years) to go
to school in the 1994-1995 academic year, an increase of 0.7
million compared to the 1990-1991 academic year.
</P>
<P>
However, 500,000 children in the region are illiterate
(representing 20 percent of children aged between six and 14), six
percent of the children drop out of school every year and 750,000
people from 15-35 years old are illiterate (making up 30 percent
of the number of illiterate people of this age in Vietnam at
present).
</P>
<P>
The region is now lacking 11,000 primary education teachers and
a great number of schools.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held early this week, the government was urged to
pay more attention to education, with budgets for education to be
increased and more resources to be mobilized from the people and
enterprises for education.
</P>
<P>
The meeting proposed that a plan on educational development,
illiteracy elimination and universal primary education be
developed under the general plan on economic, political, cultural
and social development.
</P>
<P>
To date, 15 provinces and cities in Vietnam are recognized as
having met national standards on illiteracy elimination and
universal primary education.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Nine people held hostages for more
than four months in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province left the
remote jungle there after being rescued in an operation by
Indonesian Special Forces Wednesday, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Indonesian military spokesman confirmed that the
bodies of two missing hostages, both Indonesians, were found in
Irian Jaya today.  But he did not give any details about the
deaths of Navy Panekenan and Yosias Lasamahu.
</P>
<P>
The freed hostages -- four Britons, a pregnant Dutch woman, a
Dutch man and three Indonesians -- have been taken by helicopter
to the town of Timika in Irian Jaya for a medical check-up before
being flown to Jakarta, said the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Free Papua Movement (OPM) seized the hostages on January 8
and demanded the recognition of an independent state in Irian Jaya
in exchange of their release.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian military sources said the special forces decided to
launch the swift and bloodless rescue operation after several
rounds of peaceful efforts failed to persuade the OPM into
releasing the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ministry Feeds Over One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Ministry of Health
and Child Welfare is feeding more than one million children under
the age of five years in a supplementary feeding program, with
the number expected to decrease owing to the good rains.
</P>
<P>
Some feeding points had closed because mothers were no longer
bring their children for the program. A total of 1,198,000
children were being catered for at present, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare Tsungirirayi
Hungwe said on Wednesday the number of beneficiaries had dropped
as food became available at homes after a fairly good rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
However, the program was continuing because some areas had not
received adequate rain, the report said. The program began in
1992 to combat malnutrition among the under-fives.
</P>
<P>
The ministry buys food and distributes it to the communal
areas where the community forms feeding groups and mothers
prepare food for the children. Donors have been supporting the
program. However, because of the drought, supplementary food has
become the main meal.

After heavy rain poured down and interrupted the game for half
a hour, Corintians tested Gremio goalkeeper Danrlei to the most
with several dangerous shots which were all blocked away from the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
World Bank has reached an agreement to further improve projects
assisted by the bank.
</P>
<P>
Vinay Bhargava, the World Bank resident representative to the
Philippines, said today that the agreement was reached after a
joint review by the World Bank and key Philippine government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that implementation progress of 25 out of 28
ongoing World Bank-assisted projects were rated satisfactory or
highly satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
A total loan for the projects under the joint review was 2.96
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the World Bank audit reports showed that
about three-quarters of 100 completed projects from 1959 to 1995
had a satisfactory outcome in terms of sustainability and results
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing the progress in the implementation of the
projects, the World Bank and Manila both noted that there is room
for improvement.
</P>
<P>
They cited five implementation areas for improvement, which
include procurement, disbursements, accounting and audit, capacity
building and sustainability.
</P>
<P>
Of these issues, slow procurement actions have been noted to
lead to low disbursement across several projects.
</P>
<P>
As of January 1996, there is still an undisbursed balance of
1.42 billion dollars from the current portfolio of 2.96 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Releases Kuwaiti Missing since End of Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has released a Kuwaiti
woman listed by Kuwait as missing since the end of the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait in February 1991, the Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The woman, who arrived in Kuwait Wednesday night, was the first
missing Kuwaiti national released, the agency said. She was not
identified.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has insisted that more than 600 Kuwaitis missing during
the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait are still detained in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
The woman was released to the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) and then handed over to the Kuwaiti side.
</P>
<P>
The handover took place at the Abdali frontier post on the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, KUNA said without giving details as to when
she was released.
</P>
<P>
The release followed the 13th monthly Technical Committee
meeting on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders on May 6, which was aimed at
bringing about the release of the missing Kuwaiti nationals. The
U.S.-led multinational forces ended the Iraqi occupation in
February 1991 by driving the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, Iraq delivered a body of a dead Kuwaiti
prisoner of war (POW) to the ICRC office in Iraq. The body was
later handed over to the Kuwaiti National Committee for Missing
and POWs Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has presented to the ICRC, which has presided over
regular Iraqi-Kuwaiti border meetings in its capacity as a neutral
intermediary, more than 600 files documenting the circumstances
under which the Kuwaitis were detained by Iraqi troops during the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
So far Iraq has given accounts for the files of 130
prisoners. But Kuwait and its Western allies in the Gulf war have
declared the Iraqi responses as incomplete and required
clarifications.
</P>
<P>
Iraq admitted that it had taken 128 Kuwaitis prisoner since its
occupation of the country in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Georgia Agree to Build Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Georgia have agreed in
principle to build a 120-kilometer railway that would link the two
countries, the Turkish Daily News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study of the project is still being carried
out, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze agreed to accelerate the
project when they met on May 13 in Iran for the inauguration
ceremony of the 295-kilometer Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railway which
links landlocked central Asian Turkmenistan with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Asian railway, 165 kilometers in the Iranian
territory and 130 kilometers on the soil of Turkmenistan from
Sarakhs to Tajan, would eventually tie Central Asia via Georgia
and Turkey, the paper quoted Turkish President Demirel as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes that the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan line would also be
linked to Van, one of the major centers in eastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Research Center Formed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
upgraded the Coffee Research Program under the National
Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) to the Coffee Research
Center (COREC), the local daily ''the New Vision'' reported
today.
</P>
<P>
COREC, formed on Monday, will have its headquarters at Kitiza
in the coffee-growing district of Mokono, about 32 kilometers
east of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The first COREC Director is Peter Ngategize. He has been
working as manager for research and development with the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
The center has been mandated to carry out research on coffee
and assume research responsibilities of some other tree crops
such as cocoa, oil palm and tea, the paper said, adding that the
commodity program for COREC will be Arabica, Robusta and Arabusta
and other tree crops.
</P>
<P>
The COREC will start its research work in July this year. Until
now the country's research has been part of the research activities
carried out at Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute, about 20
kilometers north of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
A joint World Bank/Government of Uganda task force recommended
two years ago that the existing coffee research program at the
institute be upgraded to a coffee research center and that
funding for coffee research be gradually met by the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is Africa's second largest coffee producer only after
Cote d'Ivoire. Coffee has been its biggest foreign exchange
earner.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Host World Meeting on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will hold a four-day
international conference in June to assess progress in the drive
to guarantee education for children and reduce adult illiteracy
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Munther Masri, quoted by the
English-language daily Jordan Times today, said Wednesday that at
least 200 delegations from around the world and the concerned
U.N. organizations will take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he said, will be "a follow-up and evaluation
meeting of the World Conference on Education which was held in
Thailand in 1991 where 155 countries pledged to take the
necessary steps to provide primary education for all children."
</P>
<P>
The concerned U.N. agencies, which will sponsor the meeting in
cooperation with Jordan, are the the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank, the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the U.N. Population
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The four U.N. agencies said in a statement that the meeting
has been called to assess what has been accomplished by nations
and the international community to fulfil the commitments of
providing education and reducing illiteracy by the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
Much progress has been made in terms of higher enrollments
and better and more relevant education in many countries, noted
the statement.
</P>
<P>
But it said much more needs to be done, noting that there are
still 130 million children who have no access to school, the
majority of them girls.
</P>
<P>
It is unacceptable that the world that spends approximately
800 billion dollars a year on weapons can not find the money, an
estimated 6 billion dollars a year, to put every child in school
by the year 2000, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that decisive and radical solutions must be found
at both international and national levels to the problems that
countries face in meeting the basic learning needs of their
populations.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Re-register Non-state Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Non-state enterprises in Vietnam will
be re-registered and certain relevant legal documents be revised,
in the government's efforts to rein in the country's fraud-ridden
private business sector.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's 26,654 non-state enterprises, valued at 1 billion
U.S. dollars in total capital, are mostly centered on services,
often traditional professions, which can quickly recover the
capital invested, the English "Vietnam News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a big-time tax-payer, they paid 376.2 million dollars to the
state coffer in taxes in 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the business activities of many
non-state enterprises have shown evidence of fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
According to local economic police, in Hanoi alone there are
150 illegal enterprises as well as more than 300 fraudulent
private companies which had registered false addresses for the
purpose of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
To add to the confusion, a large majority of private companies
used receipts different from the form stipulated by the Ministry
of Finance.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the non-state sector in several provinces
and municipalities found that 20-30 percent of private enterprises
had changed their addresses without informing the authorities and
10 percent were registered but remained inoperative.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani-Hekmatyar Alliance Can't Solve Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The reported reconciliation
between Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his arch rival
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar could not solve the long-running Afghan
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made here Wednesday by Pir Syed Ahmed Gillani,
chief of the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan during an
interview with the local press.
</P>
<P>
Gillani suggested an early meeting of all Afghan leaders under
the name of Shura-i-Aali, or the Supreme Consultative Council.
</P>
<P>
Gillani, who returned here from the eastern Afghan city of
Jalalabad Tuesday night, said that "with the reconciliation of the
two parties, the matter couldn't be resolved."
</P>
<P>
He said that Rabbani and Hekmatyar are only two leaders of the
many warring factions in Afghanistan, and unless leaders of all
these factions are assembled, no one could ensure an end to the
bloodshed, uncertainty and confrontation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Two, seven and 12 people don't own Afghanistan as it is a
country of millions of people and its problems could only be
resolved by all of leaders and representatives," Gillani added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from Kabul said that President Rabbani and
ex-Premier Hekmatyar have agreed to join hands again. And about
10,000 Hekmatyar's troops have reportedly been posted in and
around Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, such reports have been firmly denied by Ghairat
Baheer, Hekmatyar's representative in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Gillani said that before a meeting of the highest-ranking
leaders, the second-ranking leaders and stalwarts of all forces
need to sit across a table for finalizing arrangements for a
meeting of Shura-i-Aali.
</P>
<P>
He said that before building up a consensus for transfer of
power, all of them need to discuss ways and means for
establishment of the security force to restore a peaceful
atmosphere all over the country.
</P>
<P>
They should also find ways and means for organizing the
national army, he said, adding that by so doing the Afghan
leadership could easily resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this process should be monitored by the United
Nations and representatives from the Organization of Islamic
Conference.

<HEADLINE> Waterfowl Populations Rise Again in North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Waterfowl populations in North
America are rebounding dramatically from the late 1980s, thanks to
efforts covering millions of hectares of wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
"There are 20 million more birds on the wing now than there
were in 1985," said Rich Goulden of the North American Waterfowl
Management Plan in a statement issued today to mark a conservation
agreement's 10th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed May 14, 1986 by Canada and the United
States after years of alarming declines in waterfowl
numbers. Mexico joined the agreement in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1985 bird count was only 55 million migrating waterfowls,
30 million fewer than in 1979, said Goulden, communications
committee chairman of the plan's Canadian organization.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 count, just compiled by officials in Canada and the
U.S., totaled 77 million, 22 million more than a decade
ago. There has been a dramatic rise of some 18 million in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the plan has covered about 2 million
hectares of wetlands and other habitat.
</P>
<P>
However, Goulden said the job is far from over and that this
progress can be offset by climatic conditions, especially long
droughts.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a long way to go to reach the levels of the
1970s and must work even harder to do everything we can to ensure
long-term stability of waterfowl populations," he added.

<HEADLINE>   Controversy Surrounds Dominican Republic Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 4 million voters go to the
polls in the Dominican Republic Thursday to elect a new president
to replace the disgraced seven-times president Joaquin Balaguer
who has been banned from standing for re-election.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held two years earlier than scheduled
after opposition forces demanded Balaguer's mandate be cut from
four to two years following accusations of his involvement in
electoral fraud during the 1994 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Voters have a choice of three candidates in the election which
is being monitored by international observers from the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
The current favorite is Pena Gomez, from the opposition
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and Balaguer's opponent in the
1994 election. He has the backing of most blacks and mixed races
who together make up 69 percent of the Caribbean country's 8
million population.
</P>
<P>
Young Dominicans support 43-year-old lawyer Leonel
Fernandez, nominated by the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD).
</P>
<P>
President Balaguer's ruling Social Christian Reformist Party
(PRSC) is backing millionaire businessman Jacinto Peynado who was
vice-president of Balaguer's government.
</P>
<P>
The president has opposed the monitoring of the elections by
international observers, claiming it is an interference in the
country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
But pressure from the the international community, mainly the
United States, its biggest trading partner, has forced the
government of this tiny island nation to accept their presence,
but has denied them access to computer centers.
</P>
<P>
A pre-election poll shows Pena Gomez with 46 percent of the
vote, followed by Leonel Fernandez with 37 percent and Jacinto
Peynado with 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate wins an outright majority in the first round, a
second round will be held on June 30 between the two candidates
with the largest number of votes.
</P>
<P>
That could be dangerous for the favorite Pena Gomez. Some
observers say that if a second round is held, he may face an
alliance between the other two candidates to try to beat him.
</P>
<P>
President Joaquin Balaguer, who has been president seven times
since he first came to power in 1966, was accused by the PRD
of election fraud in 1994 elections in which he triumphed with a
margin of less than one percent over the main opposition candidate
Gomez.
</P>
<P>
Serious irregularities in the election were later confirmed by
an investigative committee and Gomez threatened to call for national
strikes in protest.
</P>
<P>
With mediation of the Organization of American States (OAS)
and the Roman Catholic Church, talks aimed at ending the political
crisis were held in early August 1994 leading to the signing of
the Pact for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Balaguer's term of office was cut to 18
months and he was banned from seeking re-election. But a later
session of the legislative body National Congress voted to extend
Balaguer's mandate from 18 months to two years.

<HEADLINE> Canada Enjoys Good Ties With Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing visit to Canada by six
Central American leaders marks another step forward in the
relations between Canada and these countries.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Costa Rican
President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen, El Salvadoran President
Armando Calderon Sol, Guatemalan President ALvaro Arzu Irigoyen,
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina and Belizean Prime
Minister Manuel Esquivel arrived here for a two-day visit as
guests of Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
This visit is a follow-up to Prime Minister Chretien's visit in
January 1995 to Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
It forms part of Canada's overall strategy toward the
hemisphere, including a commitment to democratic development and
economic growth in the region, according to a statement from
Chretien's office.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the meetings and discussions will be "economic
cooperation, sustainable development and the promotion of civil
and human rights," it said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years, Canada has "enjoyed good relations"
with Central American countries and "worked to deepen this
relationship," said a document issued today by Foreign Affairs and
International Trade Canada.
</P>
<P>
During this period, diplomatic ties, trade, immigration and
travel have all increased significantly, and Canada has become a
full, active member of the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
Canada pays attention to its good relations with the region,
and seeks to expand its commercial ties there. In 1995, the
two-way trade between Canada and the six countries reached 375
million U.S. dollars, of which Canada exported over 100 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its two-way trade last year with Belize stood at 11.6 million
U.S. dollars, with Costa Rica at 152 million, El Salvador at 48.4
million, Guatemala at 98.7 million, Honduras at 50.9 million and
Nicaragua at 13.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Canada is also assisting Central American efforts to achieve
economic integration in preparation for the Free Trade Area of the
Americas and possible links with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has also provided development
assistance to the countries, which are trying to rebuild their
nations with the end of most internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Canada has also given priority to regular political
consultations with the Central American countries so as to obtain
their cooperation on security issues such as demilitarization and
combating drug trafficking and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Approves Ambitious Energy Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Energy-starved Ukraine today approved
an ambitious 15-year power development plan which gives priority
to the coal-mining, oil and electricity-generating industries.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which has been plagued by energy shortages since its
independence from the former Soviet Union, aims to revive its
ailing coal-mining industry to become self-sufficient and plans to
increase coal production to 170 million tons a year by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, Ukraine will stabilize its coal-mining industry,
restructure funding for the industry and dig new mines," said
Ukrainian National Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
The country will also step up the development of oil and
natural gas deposits under the Black and Azov seas. Oil production
is forecast to nearly double from four million to 7.5 million
metric tons by the year 2010 and natural gas is to increase from
18 billion to 35 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
More thermal-electric power stations and nuclear power plants
will be built and the maintenance of existing power plants be
strengthened, the plan says.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, rich in energy resources but lacking money to develop
them, has been highly dependent on energy from Russia, which has
regularly cut off supplies over unpaid bills, leaving Ukrainians
shivering in bitter winters.

2000, a shift of focus from the past decade during which a wealth
of cheap labor served as the economic catalyst.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Thailand is now already importing cheap foreign
labor, Olarn stressed that the development of technology and human
resources would be keys to the success of the nation's economy by
2000.
</P>
<P>
He added that financial institutions in Thailand would have to
improve themselves to become globally competitive as the local
economy opens wider to the outside world under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
Olarn predicted that Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP)
would grow by seven to nine percent during the next five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the devastating
tornado in Bangladesh Monday has exceeded 500 while some 350
people were still missing in the affected areas in the north of
the country, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
District administrative officials put the toll figure at 475,
but hospital sources said over 550 people were killed in Monday's
twister that leveled at least 80 villages in Tangail and Jamalpur
districts.
</P>
<P>
Tangail Deputy Commissioner Sattar Khan said 425 people had
been buried by Tuesday night and "we are also continuing our
search for bodies in the rubble."
</P>
<P>
Many of the people in the affected areas were waiting for
relief and building materials as the tornado with a speed of 200
kilometers per hour blew off their homes, damaging all their
stored food.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated two million taka (about 50,000 US
dollars) and a large amount of relief goods to the affected areas
while some foreign donors will reportedly offer relief to this
disaster-prone country.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich beat Bordeaux 3-1 in
the second leg tie on Wednesday for a 5-1 aggregate win in the
UEFA Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Bayern became the fourth club that won all three European
soccer tournaments after the trio of Ajax, Juventus and Barcelona
all triumphed ealry in the Cup Winners' Cup and the Champions' Cup.
</P>
<P>
Against Bordeaux, Juergen Klinsmann also scored his 15th goal
in the UEFA Cup matches, becoming the top scorer in one season in
European competition.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark of 14 goals was shared by AC Milan's Jose
Altafini in 1962-63 and John Wark of Ipswich Town in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Mehmet Scholl unleashed the
German attacks by netting the first in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Emil Kostadinov added the second in the 65th minute before
Klinsmann scored his record-breaking goal in the 79th minute.
</P>
<P>
The lone goal for Bordeaux was scored by substitute Daniel
Dutuel in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Early, Bayern won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967 and the
Champions' Cup in 1974, 1975 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
The German club also won the world club championship in 1976, a
feat achieved by Ajax and Juventus but not Barcelona.

<HEADLINE> Smaller Ricebowls, More Meat and Fish For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people will be chewing
their way through more meat and fish in the coming years, experts
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They have said the the trend towards smaller bowls of rice and
less grain consumption will create a new demand - for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
By the start of the 21st century the average Chinese family
will be eating less grain in a dramatic change to the country's
eating habits, according to latest research results from the
Chinese Academy of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A research report, "Chinese Grain in the 21st Century"
forecasts that by 2000, the demand for grain - mainly rice, corn
and wheat - will decrease, while the consumption of meat and
aquatic products will increase.
</P>
<P>
Chinese per capita consumption of grain will drop to 223
kilograms in 2000, and to 214 kilograms in 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the total demand for grain in
the country will be nearly 289.9 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the per capita consumption of meat and aquatic
products in 2000 will increase to 29.7 kilograms and 10 kilograms
respectively, and to 38.9 kilograms and 17 kilograms in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jikun, one of the authors of the report, attributed the
change to the families being better off financially, urbanization
and developments of markets.
</P>
<P>
He added that the increase of population and demands for meat
and aquatic products will pose greater demands for animal
feed, such as forage, which are expected to reach 109 million tons
by the year of 2000, accounting for 24 percent of China's total
demands of grain.
</P>
<P>
"To a great extent, the real problem of China's grain is
forage," Huang said, urging the government to make favorable
policies for the development of forage.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Visit Macedonia After NATO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Russian military delegation has
just ended a visit to Macedonia only a week after a senior NATO
official came to the former Yugoslav republic to brief its leaders
on NATO's eastward expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
During a four-day visit which ended Tuesday, the Russian
delegation discussed possible military cooperation between Russia
and Macedonia and visited military installations in the Balkan
country, information from the Macedonian capital Skoplje said
today.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, NATO's Assistant Secretary General Anthony Cragg
came to Macedonia for talks on the western military alliance's
enlargement plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan has long been strongly opposed by Russia, which says
the expansion eastward will endanger its security.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia is currently a member of NATO's "Partnership
for Peace", a transition program for former eastern bloc
countries before obtaining full membership of the alliance. But it
is one of 12 countries seeking to join the organization.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Macedonian Foreign Minister Lijbomir
Frckovski called on NATO to start its planned eastward expansion
from its southern edges, admitting Macedonia and Albania first.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the Dayton Peace Accord which ended the
war in Bosnia, ethnic unrest in the southern Serbian region of
Kosovo and disputes between Greece and Turkey, it is important for
regional stability for NATO to accept Macedonia and Albania as
members.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian officials said that Russia is now increasingly
interested in the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said although Russia is exerting influence on
the country, which declared independence from the former
Yugoslavia in 1991, Macedonia has now fallen within the U.S.'s
sphere of interest.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has 500 U.N. peacekeeping troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
Christopher has reassured central and east European countries
of NATO's determination and obligation to admit new members
including Macedonia, saying they will not be kept waiting forever.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia should have a place in Europe and should not be
isolated, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan has asked
the Chrysler Automobile Company of the United States to launch new
projects for co-operation in developing new products in China.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a Chrysler delegation here yesterday, Li
said, "The Beijing Municipal Government is paying close attention
to the growth of the automobile industry because the industry is a
pillar one enjoying priority in development."
</P>
<P>
"I think your company will enjoy bright prospects in
co-operating with Beijing in the automobile industry," he told the
American guests.
</P>
<P>
The mayor expressed support for Chrysler's plan to build new
automobiles at the Beijing Jeep Corporation, a joint venture
established by Chrysler and its Beijing counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Vice-President Thomas Gale said that his company will
be Beijing's best co-operation partner.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Rejects Revision of Criteria for Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany rejects any revision of
the criteria for launching a single European currency under the
Maastricht Treaty, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said here today.
</P>
<P>
Germany is opposed to any changes in the criteria because it
would help bring about economic development and create more jobs
within the European Union (EU), Kohl told a press conference after
meeting with European Commission (EC) President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
The measures to cut budget deficit, announced by the German
government last week, demonstrated the German stand on the
implementation of the criteria for EU economic integrity, Kohl
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, the budget deficit and national
debts of each EU member state should not exceed the 3 percent and
60 percent ceilings of the gross domestic product (GDP) of that
year.
</P>
<P>
Any country which fails to meet the criteria will not be
allowed to join the European Monetary Union, to be operational on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany's budget deficit for 1996 will be 3.9 percent of its
GDP, while its national debts will account to 61.5 percent, showed
data released by the EC today.
</P>
<P>
The EC predicts that in 1997, Germany's budget deficit may drop
to 2.9 percent of the GDP but the national debts will probably
rise to 62.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the EU is now at a "critical moment," Kohl urged
governments of all member states to exert greater efforts to make
a success the scheduled EU inter-governmental conference on
revising the Maastricht Treaty next year.
</P>
<P>
The EU held a special summit of the inter-governmental
conference in Turin, Italy in March to revise the Maastricht
Treaty. The conference is likely to conclude in June 1997 in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Australian Housing Finance Drops in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian housing finance
dropped by an unexpected 6.4 percent seasonally adjusted in March,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
The volume of loans for purchase or construction of dwelling
houses fell to 38,051 units in March from 40,634 units in
February, said the ABS.
</P>
<P>
The total value of loans fell to 3.7032 billion Australian
dollars (3.0366 billion US dollars) in March from 3.8964 billion
Australian dollars (3.195 billion US dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures were worse than market expectations. Local
economists had expected the housing finance to fall one percent in
March after a 0.5-percent rise in February.
</P>
<P>
The worse-than-expected housing finance figures indicated that
the Australian building market still had a long way to go to shake
off the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures are expected to have a negative impact on the
local financial market, which has long waited for some domestic
directions.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Dispute Over Arms Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A dispute over Russian military
deployment along its western borders is likely to dominate an arms
limitation treaty review conference and block reaffirmation of
unanimous support for the pact.
</P>
<P>
As delegates from 30 signatory nations to the 1990 Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty gathered on the first day of the
two-week conference, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy
Mamedov called for the pact to be amended to take account of the
significant changes which have taken place in the continent's
political landscape since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has failed to meet the treaty's stringent arms control
conditions imposed on its so-called "flank zone" stretching from
St. Petersburg in the north to the volatile Caucasus region in the
south.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said the issue of "flank limitations" --
the amount of weaponry states may amass on their borders -- had
presented "difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Lynn Davis, U.S. undersecretary for arms control said,
"Resolution of this flank issue will require flexibility on the
part of all of us... We need to resolve this problem and resolve
it now for the treaty to be fully implemented," she said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has already admitted failing to implement the treaty,
saying that its provisions for arms reductions in specific zones
have been overtaken by events.
</P>
<P>
The country has many times the maximum level of military
hardware permitted on its "flank zone", with its deployment in
Chechnya alone far exceeding the CFE ceiling.
</P>
<P>
"The treaty needs urgent reinforcement, improvement and
adaptation," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov told
the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov and Davis failed to reach agreement on the issue in
their last-ditch talks before the treaty review.
</P>
<P>
The CFE treaty was signed in November 1990 by countries from
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the now defunct Warsaw
Pact to cap levels of weapons and troops around the continent. It
took effect on November 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 pieces of military equipment have been
dismantled in the three-year reduction period ending last November.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held to review the treaty, discuss the
implications of the political changes in Europe since 1990 and
recommend changes to the pact.

<HEADLINE> Italian Economy Grows Slower Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy's inflation will drop by 1.25
percentage points to 4.1 percent in 1996 from last year's 5.35
percent, the European Commission (EC) said today in its spring
forecast.
</P>
<P>
Italy's budget deficit will fall by 2.4 percentage points from
last year's 8.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) to 6.3
percent in 1996, while its GDP will increase by 1.8 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
But these indexes are not encouraging as compared with the
previous forecast in last November, which predicted that Italy's
inflation would fall to 3.5 percent and budget deficit to 6.0
percent of GDP, while GDP would increase by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the year 1997, the economic situation could be better,
said the EC report, with a GDP growth of 2.4 percent, an inflation
rate of 3.5 percent and a budget deficit accounting for 5 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic growth, the country's employment will
deteriorate, with a jobless rate of 12.4 percent for this year and
11.9 percent for 1997.

<HEADLINE> State Approval for Inter-Provincial Railway Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a new railway
line, linking Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province,
and Handan, an industrial city in north China's Hebei Province, is
to begin soon, with the initial design having been given state
approval Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The design calls for a 232-km single-track railway that can
handle 20 million tons, and can be increased to double-track if
necessary. The project will be managed by a corporation formed of
the Ministry of Railways and Shandong and Hebei provinces.
</P>
<P>
Economists point out that the railway will provide a new means
of moving coals from Shanxi Province, China's largest coal
producer, to other parts of the country, and will greatly improve
transport in the northern provinces and economic growth in central
China, because it is connected to the country's three railway
arteries linking Beijing and Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kowloon.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Six Central American leaders arrived
here today for a summit meeting between Central America and Canada
on May 16-17.
</P>
<P>
The presidents from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras and the prime minister from Belize are
hoping to win Canada's support for their countries' participation
in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which consists
of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The six Central American leaders will meet with Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and Governor General Romeo LeBlanc on

countries.
</P>
<P>
Issues high on their agenda are economic cooperation,
sustainable development and the promotion of civil and human

</P>
<P>
The leaders will also attend a ceremony at the Peacekeeping
Monument on Thursday to pay homage to Canada's participation in
the Central American peace process.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Trusts Arms Sales to Ecuador Will Be Clarified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori said he was confident the investigations into alleged
Argentine arms sales to Ecuador during its border war with Peru
would clarify what really happened.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Argentine President Carlos Menem, delivered by
visiting Peruvian congressional leader Martha Chavez, President
Fujimori makes no judgement of the government's responsibility in
the alleged sales, but says he is waiting for the results of the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
President Fujimori's was replying to a letter from Menem at the
end of last month in which the president of Argentina promised his
colleague "there will be no coddling of those public officials who
participated in the sale of Argentine arms to Ecuador."
</P>
<P>
In April, the Ecuadoran company "Prodefensa" claimed that the
"Fabricaciones Militares Company" in Argentina had offered arms to
Ecuador in March to compensate for the nondelivery of the last of
four shipments destined for Guayaquil in February 1995 during
clashes between Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of the sale of Argentine arms to Ecuador have had
immense repercussions in the country as well as abroad since
Argentina is one of the guarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro
Protocol designed to halt the war between Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are running high in Peru against the Argentine
government, especially in light of the latest revelations that the
Ecuadoran arms purchaser negotiated directly with military
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Menem has ordered the lifting of secrecy on a 1993 decree
related to the sale of arms abroad to clear up the matter.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's justice authorities have initiated investigations
to identify those responsible.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Organization in Nepal Opposes Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A consumer rights organization in
Nepal has started a signature campaign protesting price hikes of
daily commodities and other necessities in the country in recent
months, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Forum Nepal said it expected its campaign to
collect over 500,000 signatures within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 150 members of the forum's central committee earlier
handed over a memorandum to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
protesting against the government's decision to raise prices of
daily necessities, including milk, water, cooking gas, cement,
fertilizer, rice, edible oil and transportation fares.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu-based organization charged that with higher
prices, the burden caused by the weak management of state-run
enterprises had been passed over to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the forum said that the signature campaign would
later be extended to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A protest letter along with all the signatures will be
submitted to the government after the campaign concludes, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Smaller Ricebowls, More Meat and Fish For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people will be chewing
their way through more meat and fish in the coming years, experts
have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They have said the the trend towards smaller bowls of rice and
less grain consumption will create a new demand - for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
By the start of the 21st century the average Chinese family
will be eating less grain in a dramatic change to the country's
eating habits, according to latest research results from the
Chinese Academy of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A research report, "Chinese Grain in the 21st Century"
forecasts that by 2000, the demand for grain - mainly rice, corn
and wheat - will decrease, while the consumption of meat and
aquatic products will increase.
</P>
<P>
Chinese per capita consumption of grain will drop to 223
kilograms in 2000, and to 214 kilograms in 2010.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the total demand for grain in
the country will be nearly 289.9 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the per capita consumption of meat and aquatic
products in 2000 will increase to 29.7 kilograms and 10 kilograms
respectively, and to 38.9 kilograms and 17 kilograms in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jikun, one of the authors of the report, attributed the
change to the families being better off financially, urbanization
and developments of markets.
</P>
<P>
He added that the increase of population and demands for meat
and aquatic products will impose a greater demands for animal
feed, such as forage, which are expected to reach 109 million tons
by the year of 2000, accounting for 24 percent of China's total
demands of grain.
</P>
<P>
"To a great extent, the real problem of China's grain is
forage," Huang said, urging the government to make favorable
policies for the development of forage.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Cures to Be Researched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The State will soon set up a
national foundation to subsidize major scientific research
projects on traditional Chinese medicine, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(SATCM) will establish a national team to guide research in new
traditional Chinese medicines, said Zhang Wenkang, administrator
of SATCM yesterday at the opening of a conference on science and
technology development for traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that priority will be placed on researching
traditional Chinese drugs which have been found effective against
major health risks such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, viral
diseases and gerontological ailments.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that at least 10 such new traditional Chinese
medical products or therapies can be put to use over the next five
years, with one or two of them to be exported.
</P>
<P>
Less than 500 million US dollars of traditional Chinese
medicinal products are currently exported each year.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Peng Peiyun called on local governments to
boost the development of traditional Chinese medicine and make it
a global science to serve peoples from all parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine is an important component of
Chinese traditional culture and has played a big role in disease
prevention and health care, she said, adding that the science must
be further developed to keep up with changing conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, SATCM pans to introduce several strategies
this year to upgrade the development of traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The administration is mapping out several ministerial
regulations to encourage science and technology development in the
field.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Trade Sanctions Against China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Wednesday moved further down the road of confrontation with China
by announcing large-scale trade sanctions on 3 billion dollars
worth of Chinese exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky called
this action "a result of China's failure to satisfactorily
implement the 1995 intellectual property rights agreement."
</P>
<P>
She threatened that if China fails to do more to meet the U.S.
requirements for IPR protection, Washington will impose as of June
17 prohibitive tariffs of 100 percent on about 2 billion dollars
of Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement marked a serious move taken unilaterally
by the United States after no progress was reported in the latest
round of working-level talks in Beijing over the IPR disputes.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Chinese side, out of utmost sincerity,
once again made it clear that it had already comprehensively
fulfilled its obligations stipulated in the Sino-U.S. agreement on
IPR and that it had already taken a series of measures and made
great successes in IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
It also briefed the U.S. side on additional measures it is
planning to take.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, in disregard of the widely-recognized
progress made by China in the protection of intellectual property,
blacklisted China as the "priority foreign country" in its special
301 review for this year and decided to impose sanctions on China
at any time.
</P>
<P>
The 3-billion-dollar preliminary retaliation list released
today by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) today
is composed of about 2 billion dollars in textile and apparel
imports from China, 500 million dollars of electronics products
and 500 million dollars of other consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The list will be trimmed to about 2 billion dollars at the end
of a 30-day waiting period for "public comments" from American
importers and "public hearings" to be held by the USTR.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that today's move taken by the Clinton
administration, to a large extent out of the needs in domestic
politics in an election year, is certain to exacerbate the tense
relationship between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
American companies that have business relations with China fear
that the U.S. trade retaliation will inevitably meet with
counter-retaliation from China, thus making their interests and
those of American consumers a prey of a possible trade war between
two big powers.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia's Tourism Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 400,000 overseas tourists are
expected to visit Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region annually over
the next five years to see the vast grassland and unique ethnic
culture, according to a five-year tourism development plan just
released.
</P>
<P>
Eight million domestic tourists from all over the country are
expected to visit the region in north China yearly for summer
holidays.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the needs of the growing number of tourists,
the region plans to focus on developing five tourist zones and six
tourist routes on the grassland, which feature Mongolian folklore,
according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Inner Mongolia is ready for further tourism expansion based on
previous development," a regional tourism official has said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the central and regional government
injected about 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) into
tourism projects in the region to open up two state-level routes,
allowing tourists to live in a yurt on the pastureland, hunt in
forests, participate in a traditional Mongolian fair, and visit
relics such the tomb of Genghis Khan, who succeeded, in 1206, in
unifying various Mongolian tribes.
</P>
<P>
The region has built over 100 tourist hotels with over 6,000
standard rooms, 27 of which are highly-rated, and has convenient
railway, highway, and air links with 22 major inland cities and
with Hongkong and Ulan Bator.
</P>
<P>
The region has established business ties with over 100 travel
agencies in other countries and regions and over 100 countries and
regions can be reached directly by telephone, telegraph and
fax. Russia, Mongolia, Japan, Southeast Asian countries, and
Hongkong, Macao, and Taiwan have become tourists sources of
the region.

<HEADLINE> Thomas, Uber Cup Finals to Open in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The world's top eight teams
are to open their respective clashes for badminton's most
prestigious trophies, Thomas Cup and Uber Cup, here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two events, in fact the world badminton men's and women's
team championships, are scheduled to close on May 26.
</P>
<P>
Asian badminton powerhouse Indonesia, holders of both cups
since the last Grand Finals two years ago in Jakarta, are to face
tough challenge from China, South Korea, Denmark and, to some
extent, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
England and Russia are making their bids from Europe.
</P>
<P>
As badminton has long been in the hold of Asians, the only time
that the Thomas Cup has been held by Europe was when the trophy
was presented in 1939 from George Thomas, its donor and then
president of the International Badminton Federation (IBF).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has dominated the Thomas Cup competitions, winning
nine times including at the last event in Jakarta, followed by
Malaysia with five wins and China on four victories.
</P>
<P>
And the Uber Cup missed the Asian Zone in its first three
contests when the Americans came out the winners. As the United
States have disappeared from the Uber Cup stage, China and Japan
have taken five wins each and Indonesia tasted the triumph again
after missing it for 20 years since its first victory.
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Cup belongs to Indonesia!" The banner long held aloft
by the Indonesians would probably be put in doubt here as their
team faces a strong Chinese side and others.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team is boosted with such stars as world number one
Dong Jiong and Sun Jun, who, ranked 14th in the world, brought
about a shock last year when he beat Indonesian star Heryanto Arbi
at the Sudiman's Cup event.
</P>
<P>
But Lu Shengrong, president of the IBF, predicted a consecutive
second win for Indonesia here. "They are the only side with more
chances than others for the Thomas Cup," she said after arriving
here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The eights each for Thomas and Uber Cup finals are divided into
two groups of four. In Thomas Cup Group A are defending champions
Indonesia, China, Sweden and England while in Group B are
Malaysia, South Korea, Denmark and hosts Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As in Uber Cup final, holders Indonesia are pooled in Group A
with China, Japan and Russia while in Group B are South Korea,
Denmark, England and hosts Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The winners of each group shall face the runners-up of the
other group in the two events and the winning team of these
encounters are qualified for the final clashes for the trophies.
</P>
<P>
Roger Johansson of Sweden, vice-president of the IBF, said that
drug tests are to be carried out as usual. The urine samples taken
from the players are to be sent to Beijing, the nearest site from
Hong Kong where the analysis of the samples are to be carried out
in the laboratory recognized by the International Olympic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The total budget for doping tests for the Cup Finals here is
20,000 pound (30,000 US dollars), according to Johansson.
</P>
<P>
The player tested positive will be suspended for two years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The IBF mainly rely on national associations for carrying out
doping tests and itself carries test during major events such as
Thomas and Uber Cups and world championships.
</P>
<P>
"Badminton is comparatively a very clean sport as the latest
positive test occurred some five years ago," Johansson
said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav National Bank Governor Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chamber of Citizens of the
Yugoslav Parliament voted today to dismiss Dragoslav Avramovic
from the post of the National Bank governor after a two-day
debate.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five deputies supported the motion in an open ballot
while 33 deputies opposed it with no abstainers in the voting, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The motion to dismiss Avramovic had been made by parliament
deputy Ivko Djonovic of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
After the Chamber of Citizens (lower house), the Chamber of
Republics (upper house) also voted for Avramovic's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic declined to comment on his dismissal after the voting
in the Chamber of Citizens. He only said that he had proposed the
MPs vote in answer to a roll call so that their votes were clear.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic, who saved the Yugoslav economy from collapse in
early 1994, had open disputes with government hardliners who favor
to maintain state-owned economy. He also opposed the government
decision to insist on being the sole successor of the old Yugoslav
federation shattered in 1991, which he said had brought to the
failure of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund early
last month.

<HEADLINE> EC Economic Forecast: Growth Remains Disappointing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth in the
European Union (EU) in 1996 and 1997 remains disappointing, showed
Spring Economic Forecast for 1996 presented today by the European
Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
According to the forecast, for 1996, expected growth in the EU
gross domestic product (GDP) is 1.5 percent; it will accelerate
during the second half of 1996 to reach 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding figures from the Autumn 1995 forecasts were
2.6 percent in 1996 and 2.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this forecast today at a press conference, EC
Commissioner for economic and financial affairs Yves-Thibault de
Silguy listed three factors for this revision.
</P>
<P>
First, the effects of the monetary turbulence in March/April
1995 were greater than anticipated;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the rate of budgetary consolidation was lower than
hoped-for, which had a negative effect on the markets;
</P>
<P>
The third factor is the high level of interest rates in 1994
and much of 1995: the average of long-term interest rates in the
EU was 9 percent in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1996 began with an initial handicap," he said.
"However, the EC believes that the conditions continue to exist for
growth to accelerate during the second half of 1996 and 1997."
</P>
<P>
The forecast said that even though 840,000 new jobs were created
in the EU in 1995, unemployment started to turn upwards at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
It indicated that the jobless rate should be about 10.5 at the
end of 1997 despite the creation of 1.25 million new jobs in 1996
and 1997.
</P>
<P>
On economic convergence, the forecast showed that in 1995, 11
of the 15 EU member states already respected the inflation
criterion.
</P>
<P>
Inflation should further decline to a level of less than 2.5 on
average for the EU in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1997, it said, on the basis of the hypothesis of
unchanged policies, seven countries (Denmark, Germany, France,
Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland) would have
deficits below 3 percent, which was set by the Maastricht Treaty,
and six others would have a deficit between 3 percent and 3.7
percent (Austria, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Portugal and the United
Kingdom).
</P>
<P>
"The treaty timetable is realistic," argued de Silguy, "the
commission is convinced that a significant number of member states
will meet the necessary conditions to participate in the EURO from
1 January 1999."

<HEADLINE> FAA Expands Review of ValuJet Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) will inspect every ValuJet plane every
morning as part of an expanded review of the airline following
Saturday's fatal crash that killed more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said today that the new
measures also included a check of every plane's maintenance
history and weekly fly-alongs by FAA inspectors on every plane.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely determined to ensure that these aircraft
meet the most rigorous aviation standards of the FAA," Pena said.
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator David Hinson said this morning that the FAA
would take the additional steps as part of a 30-day intensified
review the FAA announced Sunday which is an expansion of a 120-day
special emphasis review of the airline beginning February.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that we take all steps possible to continue to
maintain the unmatched safety record of the American aviation
system," Hinson said.
</P>
<P>
The other additional measures include top-to-bottom inspections
of all ValuJet planes during heavy maintenance and comprehensive
re-inspections of ValuJet airport maintenance facilities.
</P>
<P>
The airline has also agreed to take other safety measures such
as hiring a "safety czar" and will put together a new inspection
scheduled by Friday.
</P>
<P>
These measures were made following last Saturday's deadly crash
of a ValuJet DC-9 in the Florida Everglades near Miami, in which
104 passengers and a crew of five were killed.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash is under investigation. But
investigators said the data recorder and other pieces of the plane
recovered indicate a fire or explosion on board the plane before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
The Jet's crew had reported smoke in the cockpit and cabin
shortly before the Atlanta-bound flight plunged into the swamp
near the Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The 50 to 60 past-shelf-life oxygen generators that were being
carried for the airline's Atlanta headquarters by the crashed
plane have come under suspicion in the crash.
</P>
<P>
The generators, eight-inch long stainless steel containers that
produce oxygen in emergencies through a chemical reaction, can get
hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit while in use.
</P>
<P>
A fire blamed on an oxygen generator destroyed an American
Trans Air DC-10 in Chicago in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said today that ValuJet was not authorized to carry a
cargo load of the oxygen generators.

<HEADLINE> Socialist System Historical Choice of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese president Jiang
Zemin said here today that it is a historical choice of the
Chinese people of all nationalities to adopt the socialist road.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during an interview with Egyptian and
Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on reason why China must stick to the
socialist system, Jiang said China's modern history has proved
that only when the Chinese people adopt the socialist road under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can China realize
the goals of national unification, economic development, social
stability and improvement of the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the results China has made since the implementation
of the economic policy of opening to the outside world in 1979,
Jiang said that thanks to the rapid growth of the national economy
for more than 10 years, China has achieved five years ahead of
schedule the goals: redoubling the 1980 GNP volume at the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
China is speeding up its process of establishing a system of
the socialist market economy and has scored successes in
developing the country along a socialist road with Chinese
characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The general objectives of China's socialist road are to focus
on economic construction, stick to the reforms and the policy of
opening to the outside world, adhere to the four basic principles
on socialism and the Communist Party leadership, expand the
socialist market economy, develop the socialist democratic
political system, and establish a socialist legal system, Jiang
explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, elaborating on China's economic reforms,
said that although China's socialist market economy system has
some points in common with the capitalist one, it is different
from that.
</P>
<P>
While the socialist market economy system embodies the general
rules of the market economy, it is characterized with the public
ownership, he said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to initially establish a system of the socialist
market economy by the turn of the century and to achieve a rather
perfect form of the system around the year 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new economic system, he added, China's state-owned
and collective sectors of the economy will be developed along with
the supplementary sectors, including the individual, private and
foreign-funded ones, simultaneously and in a long period.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether China regards itself as a world political force
like the U.S. or merely a force in East Asia, Jiang said China, as
a developing country and a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, is fully aware of its international responsibilities and
obligations.
</P>
<P>
China, that unswervingly pursues an independent foreign policy
of peace, will join other developing nations and all peace-loving
countries in making positive contributions to maintaining regional
and world peace, promoting common development, and opposing
hegemonism, power politics and all unjust and unreasonable
behaviors in the international community.

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind has expressed disappointment at the suspended talks on
easing the European Union's (EU) global ban on British beef
product exports.
</P>
<P>
EU veterinary officials reportedly failed to reach agreement on
lifting the ban on exports of British gelatine, tallow and other
beef by-products at today's meeting in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EU ban on British beef exports will remain in
force entirely until the EU veterinary committee resume talks on
the issue again Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind told reporters that he was disappointed that Britain's
EU partners had failed to lift the ban on some British beef
by-products.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was encouraged that a number of countries
had voiced their support for Britain. "We have not only support
from France and from the EU Commission but from a significant
number of other countries as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that the discussion and patient
negotiation is gradually bearing fruit and we will wait a few more
days to see if that'll be brought about," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the British government will take a tougher line,
Rifkind said, "as long as there is evidence that negotiation and
dialogue produce results, then that's something we should be
prepared to endorse."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg told
parliament today, "Good progress has been made today and I hope
the commission proposals can be adopted on Monday."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef product exports
on March 27 in a bid to calm the public fears over BSE or mad cow
disease.
