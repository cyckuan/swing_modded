<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Food Aid Continues in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Even though
international cease-fire monitors had left, international
humanitarian aid program continued in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) dispatched its
humanitarian convoy with food as planned after the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Kosovo Verification
Mission left earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing our best to ensure that emergency food aid
distribution to displaced people in Kosovo continue till the last
possible moment," said Mick Lorentzen, head of the WFP office in
Pristina, capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
WFP has been delivering food aid to internally displaced people
in Kosovo since June 25 last year. So far this month, the U.N.
agency has distributed 1,863 metric tons of food to 159,836
people, according to the WFP Pristina office.
</P>
<P>
The office estimated that the displaced people in Kosovo might
now number upwards of 235,000. According to a WFP Pristina survey
over 1,510 of the beneficiaries of the food aid program, almost
one out of every five beneficiaries are under the age of five.
</P>
<P>
"It has been snowing heavily here and all those children will
suffer even more," said Lorentzen.
</P>
<P>
It snowed for the past two days and the sky was still heavily
cloudy on Saturday with snows expected in the mountains in the
north and west of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, EU Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday met with Mideast peace envoy of the European Union
(EU) Miguel Moratinos on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and the EU official reviewed the latest developments in
the peace process, especially on the Palestinians-Israeli track,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos briefed Moussa on his latest visits to Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas and made an evaluation of the
situation on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy arrived here on Friday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which is keen on playing a key role in helping advance
the Mideast peace process, maintains close coordination with
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
and an active mediator in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since December when Israel shelved the Wye accord signed
last October in Washington, after carrying out the first of the
three-phased withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have announced to declare an independent state
on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule period enshrined in
the 1993 Oslo Accord expires regardless of the results of the
peace talks with Israel. The Palestinians are striving to rally
international support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, opposes the possible move, denouncing it as a
unilateral action. It has threatened to take tough measures
against the step, including annexation of the parts of the West
Bank under its control.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish UUP Leader Insists on IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble on Saturday reiterated that the IRA must disarm to
clear the obstacle to progress on the stalled peace pact.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the annual session of his pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) ruling council in Belfast, Trimble
said the arms "decommissioning" issue had to be sorted out to
ensure new political structures get off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
"All the work needed to be done to enable the institutions to
go live has been done," Trimble, the UUP leader, said.
</P>
<P>
"But on one issue there has been no progress -- the commitment
that all parties to the agreement gave to the 'total disarmament
of all paramilitary organizations'...It is time for the problem to
be sorted out."
</P>
<P>
Trimble refuses to sit alongside Sinn Fein in a new coalition
cabinet -- which Britain wants to form in less than two weeks --
unless the IRA hands over weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, however, accuses the Unionist
leader of using blocking tactics.
</P>
<P>
Adams argues that his party cannot "deliver" arms from the IRA,
and that anyway advance disarmament is not specified as a
condition of Sinn Fein taking part in a provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Ceasefires are generally holding but there have been violence
in the province between the Protestants and the Catholics.
The murder of leading human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson by
Protestants earlier this week, as well as sectarian rioting in the
flashpoint town of Portadown and clashes between Catholic crowds
and police, added to tension in the province.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Supports Less Oversight of Derivatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said that the success of derivatives traded outside
of exchanges suggested that U.S. futures markets could operate
with less Government oversight, the New York Times reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to over-the-counter markets, Greenspan said,"the fact
that the O.T.C. markets function quite effectively without the
benefits of the Commodity Exchange Act provides a strong argument
for development of a less burdensome regulatory regime for
exchange-traded financial derivatives."
</P>
<P>
The remarks came in a speech delivered Friday via satellite to
a Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders praised the speech and said it should
influence Congress later this year when it started rewriting the
laws on futures and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
Which oversees brokerage firms and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that profits from derivatives, investments with
a value tied to another asset or commodity, have increased the
earnings of large banks and are a factor in the financial sector's
overall growth this decade.
</P>
<P>
The derivatives market was estimated to have a notional value
of 70 trillion U.S. dollars last year, he said, "a figure that
doubtless is closer to 80 trillion dollars this year." Of that,
U.S. commercial banks hold about 25 percent of the contracts and
securities houses another 15 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Futures exchanges and brokerage firms have long sought to pare
back regulations, which they say hamper growth in their markets.
The exchanges contend that if over-the -counter, or privately
negotiated, derivatives function well without regulation, the
exchanges should operate under minimal regulation as well.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan to Support Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said here Saturday that his country and Jordan would
support an independent Palestinian state whenever it was
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press briefing after meeting with his
Jordanian counterpart Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib and senior Palestinian
officials on the Middle East peace process and a Palestinian plan
to declare an independent homeland on May 4 when the five-year
interim self-rule period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo accord expires.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa fell short of supporting the Palestinians to
declare the independent state on the specific date of May 4, but
said Egypt would follow up a Pan-Arab stand to support all
Palestinian rights, including setting up the independent state.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the timing for the announcement of a
Palestinian state was an internal affair of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) headed by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the three-way meeting in Amman, al-Khatib said Jordan
always supported the cause of the Palestinians, and was very much
concerned with the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were represented at the meeting by PNA
Secretary-General Mahmoud Abbas and other senior Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian, Egyptian and the Palestinian officials also decided
to hold further bilateral or three-way consultations on the
Palestinian state issue and to discuss ways of breaking the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Arafat is holding extensive consultations with Arab
and Western countries on whether to declare the Palestinian state
on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries Arafat contacted are trying to persuade
him to postpone the setting up of the Palestinian state to avoid
further complicating the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process was stalled at the end
of 1998 when Israel suspended its troop withdrawals from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and blamed the PNA for alleged failure to
collect illegal weapons and to stop terrorism against the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> UN Court Defends Release of Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has defended its decision to
unconditionally release a Rwandan genocide suspect accused of
involving killing 10 Belgian soldiers on U.N. mission and the then
Rwandan Prime Minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the ICTR Registry, reaching here Saturday, said
that the judges of Trial Chamber 1 of ICTR, which is based in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, ordered the immediate and
unconditional release of Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former major in the
Rwandan Armed Forces, on legal basis following withdrawal of
indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that the ICTR cannot defer to a national court
by releasing Ntuyahaga to any state courts as demanded by Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"According to the general principles of law, a person who is no
longer under indictment may not be deprived of his or her
freedom,"the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor, who is the master of prosecutions and decides
when and where it is appropriate to proceed, has the right, under
rule 51 of the rules of procedure and evidence, to file a motion
to withdraw the indictment at any stage in the proceedings," the
registry said.
</P>
<P>
"The chamber has therefore granted the prosecutor leave to
withdraw the indictment. The withdrawal of the indictment is, in
fact, tantamount to a decision to drop the case.!1
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, 47, surrendered himself to the tribunal on July 10,
1998 and was indicted on September 29 with one count, namely
crimes against humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the 10
Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort the Prime Minister Agathe
Uwilingiyimana before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release is a result of the bid by his prosecutor,
Othman Chande, who argued that the withdrawal will promote the
exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by a state as contained in
article 8 of the statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutor's motion followed a request by the
Belgian government which has tried to transfer the trial of
Ntuyahaga to the Britain.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in an addendum to her initial motion
for leave to withdraw the indictment, the prosecutor requested
that Ntuyahaga be released to the Tanzanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
In light of that development, Belgium, which had been
authorized by the chamber to appear before it as Amicus Curiae
(friend of the court) requested that Ntuyahaga be surrendered to
it to be tried before its national courts upon the withdrawal of
the indictment.
</P>
<P>
However, Belgium indicated that, should its request not be
granted, it would back the prosecutor's request for Ntuyahaga to
be released to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The chamber found that it was not within its jurisdiction, as
defined in the statute and in the rules, to order that a person
who has been released because he or she is no longer under
indictment, be surrendered to any state whatsoever," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The ICTR cannot "defer" to anyone," it said. "Article 8 of the
statute states clearly that the tribunal has primacy over all
national courts."
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were massacred in a genocide in the middle of 1994 in
Rwanda. The ICTR was created by the U.N. Security Council in
November of that year to try major suspects of the genocide.

in a suicide bombing in eastern province of Van, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the attacker detonated the bomb he wrapped up

the building of the Regional Traffic Directorate in Baskale
district of Van.
</P>
<P>
Van Governor Abdulkadir Sari said that two policemen and a
passer-by were slightly injured in the suicide bombing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Federal-State Anti-Gun Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered his government Saturday to develop a plan for closer
federal-state cooperation to increase prosecution of criminals who
use firearms and to take other steps aimed at reducing gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton claimed the country's
crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent since 1993, and the
rate of murders by firearms has fallen by 33 percent. But he said
that far too many people still are killed by guns. In 1997, 14,000
people were killed by guns.
</P>
<P>
"Guns have magnified the malevolence of crime," Clinton said,
adding that disarming criminals should be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
Clinton put Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney
General Janet Reno in charge of developing a strategy against gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
He singled out Project Exile, headed by the U.S. attorney in
Richmond in cooperation with state, local and other federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said hundreds of firearms have been seized and hundreds
of criminals who used firearms convicted. The key to the project,
he said, is using existing federal laws as the backbone of
the enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeated what his budget for the next fiscal year is
proposing to help cut firearm-related crime, including 5 million
U.S. dollars for dozens of new federal prosecutors and 23.8
million dollars for more than 120 new agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

<HEADLINE> PNA Could not Curb Anti-Israel Demonstrations: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) could not continue to curb anti-Israeli protests as Israel
is trying its best to kill the peace process, said a senior PNA
official in Ramallah, West Bank Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim told the Voice
of Palestine that the PNA has tried hard to prevent anti-Israeli
demonstrations from happening in the territories, but the Israeli
policy on the peace process has put the PNA into a very difficult
position to continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has suspended the implementation of the
Wye peace agreement signed with the PNA in Washington last
October and now there is no sign from the Israeli side to move it
ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israel is still conducting land confiscation and
house demolition in the territories, which have also caused more
trouble for the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In short, the current Israeli government is doing everything
possible to kill the peace process, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli sentiments are on the rise due to Israel's
anti-peace policy which has made it harder for the PNA to mobilize
police forces to maintain order in the territories, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew to Athens
Saturday, starting another round of diplomacy to seek
international support for the declaration of an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year interim period of
the Oslo Accords expires.
</P>
<P>
He will then travel to France to exchange views with French
leaders before leaving for Washington to meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated on many occasions that he will declare an
independent Palestinian state on May 4. But Israel opposes the
idea, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under its
control if Arafat does so.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Comply With Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Egypt, Jordan and
the Palestinians Saturday urged Israel to fully abide by peace
agreements it signed with the Palestinians to break the impasse
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a statement issued after a three-way
meeting in Amman among Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian
officials on the peace process and a Palestinian plan to declare
an independent statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-
Ilah al-Khatib, his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Secretary-General Mahmoud
Abbas and other senior Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed in the statement their utmost concern
over the stalled peace process, and blamed Israel for its alleged
failure to implement peace deals with the Palestinians, including
the latest Wye River peace accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Israel to stop unilateral actions to forge
ahead with settlement plans in the occupied territories in
violation of signed peace deals.
</P>
<P>
The statement echoed a Pan-Arab stance to support the
Palestinians to set up an independent state on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It described peace as a strategic choice by Arabs to resolve
the Middle East problem, particularly in solving what the three
sides termed as the core issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement fell short of favoring a Palestinian
plan to declare an independent state on the specific date of May
4 when the interim Oslo peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians expires.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has vowed on many occasions to
proceed with the plan with or without Israeli consent and he has
been holding extensive consultations with Arab and Western
countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries Arafat contacted are trying to persuade
him to postpone the plan to avoid further complicating the
situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was derailed at the end of 1998, when Israel
suspended its troops withdrawals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the PNA for its alleged failure to collect
illegal weapons and to crackdown on terrorist activities against
the Jewish state, a charge firmly denied by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Mourn Victims of Bombing, Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Saturday declared March 21 a day of mourning for the victims of
the bombing in Vladikavkaz, North Caucasus, and of the fire in the
Vologda region of Central Russia.
</P>
<P>
The bombing in a crowded market Friday killed more than 50
people and wounded over 100 others in what was believed to be a
terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out overnight Friday killed 21 patients in a
mental hospice. Authorities are investigating the cause of the
tragedy but faulty electric wiring was suspected.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, in the Mikhailovsky community in the Ustyuzhan
district of the Vologda region, also left 14 others hospitalized
with burns and injuries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed sorrow for the dead and condolences for their
family members, relatives and all who have suffered because of
these tragic events, the presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree signed by Yeltsin, Russia's national
flags will be lowered to half-mast across the country, and
cultural institutions and television companies are recommended to
cancel entertainment events and programs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government, along with North Ossetian and Vologda
regional authorities, has been ordered to take the necessary
measures to help the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
It was initially reported that over 60 people died in the
Vladikavkaz blast, but authorities on Saturday revised the toll to
more than 50.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin on Friday condemned the terrorist act and vowed to take
"ruthless" measures to bring those responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
"I apologize to the relatives and friends because I am
responsible for everything," Yeltsin said in televised remarks.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia Saturday
expressed regrets over the return home of 18,000 Iraqi pilgrims
by orders from the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We share regret with the Iraqi pilgrims who were ordered by
the Iraqi authorities to return back to Iraq, because Baghdad used
the pilgrimage for political purposes," Saudi Interior Minister
Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz told a press conference held in the
Islamic holy city of Mecca.
</P>

The "Saudi, Arab, Islamic and even the world public opinion
will deplore the Iraqi move" of calling back the Iraqi pilgrims
who were allowed to perform the Hajj pilgrimage for free in Saudi
Arabia, said the minister.
</P>

Saudi King Fahd Friday agreed to let 18,000 Iraqi pilgrims
gathering at the Saudi-Iraqi border carry out the holy rituals at
the expense of the Saudi government, because the Iraqis could not
afford their lodging, transport and basic needs.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Baghdad said that the Iraqi authorities had told
its pilgrims to return to the border with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Nayef denied reports that the Saudi government banned Iraqis
from entering the country, stressing that anyone arriving in the
Gulf kingdom by land, air or sea would be allowed to perform
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
So far, 6,933 Iraqi pilgrims are still staying in Mecca and
Medina. Some 340 Iraqi pilgrims were airlifted by Iraqi planes
into Saudi Arabia over the past three days.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of more than 20 million, may send up
to 22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under a quota system which limits the
number of Muslims to perform pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia from each
country.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Back Home After Brief Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home Saturday after wrapping up a lightening visit to
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mubarak held talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah on issues in the Arab world, including the
Iraqi issue and the Mideast peace process, and ways of promoting
bilateral relations, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat
el-Sherif told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Both Mubarak and Jaber stressed the necessity to coordinate the
efforts for boosting Arab solidarity, said el-Sherif, who
accompanied Mubarak on the visit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders called for activation of the resolution adopted
by the 111th session of the Arab League Foreign Ministers Council
in a bid to seek solutions to the Iraqi crisis, el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers called on Thursday for a halt to any
actions against Iraq and Iraqi compliance with the United Nations
Security Council resolutions passed after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Kuwaiti summit covered the Mideast peace process
and means of salvaging the peace march, el-Sherif said, adding
that Mubarak and Jaber reiterated support for the Palestinians and
their decision on statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have announced to declare an independent state
on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule period enshrined in
the 1993 Oslo Accord expires regardless of the results of the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians-Israeli negotiations have been stalled since
December when Israel shelved the Wye accord, signed last October
in Washington, after carrying out the first of the three-phased
withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Agreement on Lockerbie Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday welcomed
Libya's decision to extradite its two nationals suspected of
bombing a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie in 1988 for a trial in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The decision opens up the way the suspension and eventual
lifting of international sanctions on Libya, the Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This event is the result of a political compromise, hard and
painstaking work by representatives of many international and
regional organizations and countries interested in a speedy and
fair settlement of the Lockerbie case," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Special role in this process was played by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan, South African President Nelson Mandela and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia," Itar-Tass quoted the statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Russia also made contributions to the
search for a political and diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain an active dialogue with all concerned parties and
encourage their far-sighted and flexible approach. This dialogue
has been especially active lately in Tripoli and other capitals,
and in New York," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on the Lockerbie case has become convincing
proof that conflicts in the modern world can and should be settled
by political means and by using the U.N. potential to the utmost,"
the document said. "There is no constructive alternative to this."

<HEADLINE> Syrian Stance for Talks With Israel Gains Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from Jordan, Egypt
and the Palestinians Saturday expressed their support for Syria to
resume its peace talks with Israel from the point where they were
suspended.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a three-way meeting in Amman on the
Middle East peace process, the officials urged Israel to withdraw
its troops from the Golan Heights it captured from Syria and from
south Lebanon, a fundamental condition laid by Damascus for the
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-
Ilah al-Khatib, his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and Mahmoud
Abbas, deputy head of the Palestinian National Authority and other
senior Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu was reluctant to accept understandings reached between
Syria and the previous Labor government, and it wanted to resume
its talks with Syria on new grounds.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The officials also discussed the stalement in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process and called on Israel to observe
all peace agreements it signed with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan to Support Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa said here Saturday that his country and Jordan would
support an independent Palestinian state whenever it was
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press briefing after meeting with his
Jordanian counterpart Abdel-Ilah al-Khatib and senior Palestinian
officials on the Middle East peace process and a Palestinian plan
to declare an independent homeland on May 4 when the five-year
interim self-rule period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo accord expires.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa fell short of supporting the Palestinians to
declare the independent state on the specific date of May 4, but
said Egypt would follow up a Pan-Arab stand to support all
Palestinian rights, including setting up the independent state.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the timing for the announcement of a
Palestinian state was an internal affair of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) headed by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the three-way meeting in Amman, al-Khatib said Jordan
always supported the cause of the Palestinians, and was very much
concerned with the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were represented at the meeting by PNA deputy
head Mahmoud Abbas and other senior Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian, Egyptian and the Palestinian officials also decided
to hold further bilateral or three-way consultations on the
Palestinian state issue and to discuss ways of breaking the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Arafat is holding extensive consultations with Arab
and Western countries on whether to declare the Palestinian state
on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries Arafat contacted are trying to persuade
him to postpone the setting up of the Palestinian state to avoid
further complicating the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process was stalled at the end
of 1998 when Israel suspended its troop withdrawals from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and blamed the PNA for alleged failure to
collect illegal weapons and to stop terrorism against the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Comply With Peace Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials from Egypt, Jordan and
the Palestinians Saturday urged Israel to fully abide by peace
agreements it signed with the Palestinians to break the impasse
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a statement issued after a three-way
meeting in Amman among Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian
officials on the peace process and a Palestinian plan to declare
an independent statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-
Ilah al-Khatib, his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) deputy head Mahmoud Abbas and
other senior Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials expressed in the statement their utmost concern
over the stalled peace process, and blamed Israel for its alleged
failure to implement peace deals with the Palestinians, including
the latest Wye River peace accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Israel to stop unilateral actions to forge
ahead with settlement plans in the occupied territories in
violation of signed peace deals.
</P>
<P>
The statement echoed a Pan-Arab stance to support the
Palestinians to set up an independent state on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It described peace as a strategic choice by Arabs to resolve
the Middle East problem, particularly in solving what the three
sides termed as the core issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement fell short of favoring a Palestinian
plan to declare an independent state on the specific date of May
4 when the interim Oslo peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians expires.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has vowed on many occasions to
proceed with the plan with or without Israeli consent and he has
been holding extensive consultations with Arab and Western
countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries Arafat contacted are trying to persuade
him to postpone the plan to avoid further complicating the
situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was derailed at the end of 1998, when Israel
suspended its troops withdrawals from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the PNA for its alleged failure to collect
illegal weapons and to crackdown on terrorist activities against
the Jewish state, a charge firmly denied by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Again Support for Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Saturday
once again denied Angola's accusation of supplying arms to the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman and Information and Broadcasting
Minister, Newstead Zimba, told the press here that the Zambian
government has cleared some of the individuals accused by the
Angolan government of being involved in the supply of arms to the
UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said that investigations indicated that former Defense
Minister and Energy Minister Ben Mwila is not linked in anyway to
the supply of arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Equally no information has been found to link former Commerce
Minister Enick Kavindele to the allegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Kavindle is an acquaintance of UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi, their relationship has never been used in the provision
of logistics or rearming UNITA, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said that all the places mentioned by Angola are
extremely remote and has no infrastructure to support the supply
of logistical support to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Angola has repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying arms to
UNITA and pointed its accusing finger at some prominent figures
like Mwila and Kavindele.

LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Further disturbances broke out on

lawyer Rosemary Nelson.

<P>
Masked gangs hijacked vehicles and set a bus on fire in the
southwest town of Lurgan, County Armagh, where Nelson was killed
by a car bomb on Monday, BBC report said.

The vehicles were seized in the nationalist Kilwilkie estate,
less than half-a-kilometer from where Nelson was killed. The
dissident loyalist group The Red Hand Defenders has claimed
responsibility for the murder.
</P>
<P>
The disturbances follow two nights of violence in nearby

The RUC set up checkpoints around Kilwilkie and advised

<HEADLINE> 18,000 Iraqis Back Home Without Performing Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 18,000 Iraqi pilgrims
returned home Saturday from the Iraqi-Saudi border town of Arar
after Saudi Arabia denied the Iraqi demand for covering its
pilgrims expenditures with its frozen assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported that Muhsen Fahem
al-Farhood, an official in charge of pilgrimage affairs, accused
Saudi Arabia of practicing policy of "flagrant schemes" in their
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Farhood said that in his fourth round of talks with the
Saudi side, the Saudis refused the Iraqi proposal on the payment
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official accused the Saudi authorities of planting
agents among Iraqi pilgrims, saying Iraqi pilgrims refused Saudi
King Fahd's "charity hajj" and they wanted to pay by themselves to
perform the rituals of hajj.
</P>
<P>
Saudi soldiers on Friday surrounded al-Najah border complex
inside Saudi Arabia where Iraqi pilgrims stayed with tanks,
armors and gunmen around them, said the Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, standing in front of the main gate to the border
complex, pointed their guns toward Iraqi pilgrims and shot rubber
bullets into the air to threaten and provoke them.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the Saudi authorities wanted to escalate the
situation so that it appeared to the world that Iraqi pilgrims
are making riot, but Iraqi pilgrims failed this scheme," said
al-Farhood.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Meet to Prepare for EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
15-nation European Union (EU) started their general affairs
meeting here on Sunday to prepare a EU summit meeting at Berlin
next week.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, at a closed-door session on Sunday, focused on
current situation caused by the resignation of the bloc's
executive body and its implications for Agenda 2000, the EU's
reform package for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Although France and Germany had agreed that their first choice
for president of the European Commission is former Italian prime
minister Romano Prodi, EU officials in Brussels had stressed that
the nomination was not a done deal and a special summit would be
held later after the Berlin summit to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the European leaders who are responsible for the
nomination of a new commission, were faced with two choices.
Either they could nominate an interim team, probably including
most members of the present body, or they could choose a new
executive group that would take over the nine-month period
remainder of the present commission's term and then continue for a
full five-year appointment.
</P>
<P>
But the European Parliament, which had tried hard to pull down
the commission, has expressed its opposition to any solution that
would preempt its June elections and deprive the incoming
legislature the right to accept or reject the governments'
nomination for the commission president.
</P>
<P>
Now, the all-important issue is still the Agenda 2000 reform
package. The Germany as current EU presidency has put on table a
new package, so-called "negotiating box", for debate on three key
items: EU's own resources, farm spending and the structural funds.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will check whether the elements set out
by the presidency can be considered as constituting a basis of
finding an overall compromise among EU member states, or whether
there are some other questions covered in the "box" which need to
be addressed further.
</P>
<P>
In his role as current EU president, Schroeder is visiting
European capitals this week seeking consensus both on a commission
president and the complex issue of reforming the EU's finances to
permit the expansion of the bloc from 15 to up to 26 members.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, EU farm ministers through three weeks of
complex negotiations reached a deal on broad reform of the EU
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but failed to achieve radical
cuts in spendings.
</P>
<P>
The package was expected for approval at Berlin summit by the
EU head of states and finance ministers. But German Chancellor
Gerhard Shroeder and French President Jacques Chirac failed on
Friday to agree on cutting agricultural subsidies, probably
leaving the major problem to be settled at the Berlin Summit.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural support is the biggest element in the EU's annual
budget of 86 billion euros (94 billion U.S. dollars), and also the
union's longest-lasting and most visible sign of integration.
</P>
<P>
Current EU financial arrangements expire at the end of this
year. Germany, the EU's net contributor of 12.2 billion U.S.
dollars, demand a cut from the EU pay shares. However, EU's
southern member states, such as Spain, Portugal, Greece as well as
Ireland, want the financial supports to be kept at the current
levels.
</P>
<P>
EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler has said the agreement by
the 15 member states was a compromise, but its effects would be
increasingly felt in coming years.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Nuclear Theft Accusations  (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the time of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of
Sino-US diplomatic relations at the end of last year, they dished
up this so-called investigation report which vilified China for "
stealing" top US military technology over the past 20 years, in an
attempt to take advantage of the general public's fears in the
nuclear weapons, make fuss about "national security", and spread
the "China threat theory", the scholars pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to the scholars, some far-sighted people in the US
are indignant at these attempts at chicanery and noted that "the
accusations against China by these people was exaggerated to an
absurd extent" and this indicates "their hopes for confrontation".
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that though the Cold War ended nearly ten
years ago, a small number of Americans still stick to the Cold War
mentality and proceed from a psychology of hostility towards China
to try by hook or crook to slander China and sabotage Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from domestic partisan struggles, they have brought
complicated domestic political factors into Sino-US relations,
thus damaging the fundamental interests of the American people,
the scholars noted.
</P>
<P>
The scholars pointed out that China is a peace-loving country
and the Chinese Government declared that China would not be the
first to use nuclear weapons from the day when it first developed
its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
During President Clinton's visit to China last year, the two
sides announced that China and the US would not target their
strategic nuclear weapons at each other, the scholars said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, China
has always adopted a serious, conscientious and responsible
attitude and firmly opposes the spread of nuclear weapons in any
form to any country, the scholars noted.
</P>
<P>
China pursues the policy of not advocating, not encouraging,
nor engaging in the spread of nuclear weapons, and not helping
other countries to develop nuclear weapons, the scholars confirmed.
</P>
<P>
In line with this principle, China has joined the Treaty on Non-
proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and approved the indefinite
extension of the Treaty. China was among the first group of
countries to sign the Comprehensive Ban on Nuclear Tests and
joined the international nuclear export control organization --
the Zangger Committee.
</P>
<P>
China's stand on nuclear weapons and its efforts in the
prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons are known to everyone,
the scholars said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that to maintain and develop sound and stable Sino-
US relations is not only in the fundamental interests of the two
peoples but also conducive to peace, stability and development in
the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The scholars said that in recent years China and the US have
expanded cooperation and enhanced consultation and cooperation in
easing the Asian financial crisis and halting the arms race in
South Asia and other major issues concerning regional and global
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should treasure the hard-won situation, the
scholars urged.
</P>
<P>
The anti-China wave stirred up by some Americans does not
accord with the common aspiration and fundamental interests of the
two peoples and is bound to fail, the scholars said.

<HEADLINE> Four-time Champion Dalian Stunned in Opening Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The new season of the Chinese
professional soccer league kicked up on Sunday as newly-promoted
Liaoning Fushun made the headlines by upsetting four-time champion
Dalian Wanda 1-0.
</P>
<P>
The goal from Qu Shengqing in the 49th minute put an end to
Dalian's five-year unbeaten streak at home and also attested that
Wanda is no longer invincible both away and home.
</P>
<P>
Dalian seemed in a slump form throughout and gave the visitors
quite a few chances. But the Liaoning side, a dominant force in
the 1980s who suffered a relegation to the second division in 1995,
failed to further widen the gap.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, runners-up last season and champion in 1995,
was held to a goalless draw at home by Tianjin Taida. Zhang Jilong,
vice president of the Chinese Football Association, declared the
opening of the season before the game.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Chongqing Longxin drew with Wuhan 1-1, Songri
lost to Jilin Aodong 1-0 in Guiyang, Shenzhen Ping'an tied Beijing
Guo'an 0-0, Shandong Taishan beat hosts Qingdao Hainiu 2-1 for the
first time since 1995 and Shenyang Haishi fought to a goalless
draw with Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Wanda's head coach Xu Genbao left the field
amid the jeers of home crowd, who demanded him to quit immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought of quitting," the 54-year-old Xu said. "
But if my resignation could give Wanda a boost, I would resign."
</P>
<P>
Xu, a former national head coach, attributed the loss to their
poor defense, which he said had given the opponents too many
chances to score.
</P>
<P>
"But I think our players have displayed good team work," said
Xu, who had also coached the national Olympic side but failed to
qualify for the 1992 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I had expected that the fans would urge me to resign after the
match," he said. "But I have met such crises for several times, I
think I can weather through this one."
</P>
<P>
Xu said that if the club had two good foreign players, the
situation could have been better.
</P>
<P>
The club is still looking for foreign players, hoping they
could save Wanda from a possible decline, said Xu, who took over
as the coach midway last season.
</P>
<P>
"We began to look for new foreign players as early as this year
and have spent much more time on this than ever, but so far we
have not found ideal players.
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that there were loopholes in our work. But on the
other hand, that's because we are not as lucky as before," he said.

losing streak to three games after being defeated by league leader

the regular season in Shenyang on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets took command from the start, racing to a 39-19 lead
before finishing the first half 65-53 in their favor.
</P>
<P>
The Hunters never came closer than 10 points in the second half,
facing the tough offensive of the Rockets led by Chinese national
players Wang Zhizhi, Liu Yudong, Zhang Jingsong and Li Nan.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Flaming Bulls scored an away 108-97 victory over Jilin
Northeast Tigers and Beijing Ducks beat hosts Sichuan Pandas 109-

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Nuclear Theft Accusations (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Professor Zhang Tianyuan, Secretary-General of the
Conference, more than 200 representatives from around the world
attended it, during which Chinese experts and their foreign
colleagues, including Lee, conducted general-purpose academic
talks and never touched upon the secrets of the W88 Nuclear
Warhead.
</P>
<P>
Experts have pointed out that some Americans claimed that the
Chinese side has developed things similar to those developed in
the US and therefore the Chinese side must have stolen the
American technology.
</P>
<P>
Such an accusation is purely baseless, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Some Americans slandered the normal academic exchanges and
contact between China and the US and this revealed their ignorance
and arrogance, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Scholars with the American Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and Qinghua University's Institute of
International Questions agreed that it is by no means accidental
that some Americans wantonly spread the rumor that China "stole"
US nuclear weapon's technology.
</P>
<P>
They noted that whenever Sino-US relations improve and develop,
some Americans will attempt to make trouble. For instance, prior
to the mutual visits by heads of state of China and the US in 1997
and last year, some Americans wantonly fabricated the so-called
the question of "political donations from China" and spread the "
threat of China's nuclear missiles to the US". However, their
scheme ended in total failure.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes US Nuclear Theft Accusation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and scholars
today refuted the investigation report drawn up by a committee
headed by Cox, a member of the US House of Representatives, which
accuses China of stealing US advanced military technologies
through bilateral economic exchanges over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China's research institutions engaged
in the exchanges with US Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories,
have stolen the US technologies concerning the neutron bomb W88
nuclear warhead and simulated nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
The report and some US media, in an obvious calumny, said that
Sino-US economic and technological exchanges have harmed US
national security, and demanded the US government restrict high-
tech exports to China and Sino-US scientific cooperation. They
even proposed reevaluating the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
These accusations are totally groundless and irresponsible,
Chinese scientists said in interviews with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that China has already established the
research and development system of its own in the science and
technology concerning national defense. China independently
developed the atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb as early as in the
middle of the 1960s, and later completed its strategic weapon
systems. The history of China's scientific and technological
developments in national defense has demonstrated that China is
capable of developing any weapons needed in its national defense
with the creative ability of the Chinese scientists.

<TEXT>
<P>
The scientists pointed out that the economic and technological
exchanges and cooperation between China and the rest of the world
have witnessed remarkable development since China introduced its
reform and opening up policy two decades ago. China also conducted
normal academic exchanges in many areas with the US on the basis
of free will and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, many such exchanges have been made at the
request of the US side, and it has recognized its interests in
these exchanges. For instance, at the request of the US side,
Chinese related research institutions have conducted exchanges
with the above-mentioned US national laboratories since the early
1990s, and the two sides in 1997 jointly sponsored the "integrated
demonstration of materials protection, control and accountability"
and other activities, for the purpose of preventing nuclear
proliferation. The Chinese researchers did not, and were unlikely
to, discover any secrets belonging to the US side. The US
departments concerned are more clear about these facts than anyone
else, which is proved by the testimony of John Browne, head of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, to the US congress.
</P>
<P>
As for the case of Peter Lee releasing US simulated nuclear
explosion technology to China during his stay here, the Chinese
scientists said that Lee's academic activities in China were
purely "basic" and part of the content released in international
academic magazines, as was pointed out in an open letter published
by Wang Ganchang and six other noted Chinese scientists in
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Wen Ho Lee, who is accused of revealing the W88
technology to China by the US side, is no more than a fabrication,
" said professor Li Deyuan with the Institute of Applied Physics
and Computational Mathematics.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Li, Wen Ho Lee attended an international
symposium on hydromechanics in Beijing in 1986, which was simply
and totally a meeting about basic scientific matters. Lee
delivered an open lecture about calculating the methods of
hydromechanics in a research institute in Beijing, which was also
fundamentally basic science and nothing to do with "secrets." (

<HEADLINE> SAARC Speakers Call for Greater Flow of Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Parliament speakers from SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries on
Sunday called for greater flow of information and increased
people-to-people contact among members of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
They made the call at the end of a three-day conference of the
Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
On communications and exchange of information among SAARC
countries, the speakers agreed that appropriate practical and
feasible steps for developing a Forum for Parliamentarians of the
SAARC countries should be initiated which may... lead to... a
South Asian Parliament."
</P>
<P>
To this end, they recommended that an Exchange Program of the
SAARC countries for members of parliament and the parliament
secretariats covering relevant areas be launched, and a necessary
climate be built up to broaden and deepen the prospect of
people-to-people contact within the member nations.
</P>
<P>
They suggested setting up on-line systems to facilitate
communication among parliamentarians, promoting people-to-people
contact through various programs, and promoting better
telecommunication and postal links by reducing telecom and postal
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The speakers, in recommendations adopted at the conference,
also agreed to generate, disseminate and exchange information
materials in support of all SAARC initiatives in such areas as
trade, investment and social development, and encourage greater
flow of information in the SAARC region for the promotion of peace
and harmony in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
They recommended that SAARC countries work consistently to
project and promote a positive image of the economic group abroad,
and discourage negative projection of member countries by media in
SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
On "ethical standard of parliamentarians and conflicts of
interest," the speakers recommended the establishment of a
Parliament Committee of Ethics to deal with ethics-related issues,
the differentiation of ethics-related offenses from criminal ones
and the drafting and adopting of detailed codes of conduct for
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that expenses of elections be reduced and shared
by the political party of the candidate, a ceiling limit for
election expenses be established, political parties take
responsibility for preventing the criminalization of politics, and
a SAARC Parliamentary Association be formed for all
parliamentarians of member countries.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by the speakers of Bangladesh,
Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and India, the deputy speaker of Sri
Lanka, and the representative of the speaker of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>

<P>
PYONGYANG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Russia share "deep concern" over the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system under study by Japan and the
United States, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The KCNA said Sunday that Pyongyang and Moscow are also worried
about the three-way military alliance of Japan, South Korea and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and Russia believe the TMD and the triangular alliance
are "a main source of upsetting the balance of forces and
increasing risks of war in Northeast Asia". They acknowledge "the
need for joint action of the countries concerned to cope with them,
" the KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said DPRK-Russian ties are developing day by
day, adding that the two countries will make efforts to further
such ties.
</P>
<P>
The report came after a visit to Pyongyang by Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin who met with Foreign Minister
Paek Nam Sun during his trip from Monday to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Karasin delivered to Paek a letter from Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov who expressed a wish to visit Pyongyang in
May to formally sign a friendship, good-neighborliness and
cooperation treaty to replace the 1961 one that expired in 1996.

The resolution deals with the philosophy and political platform
of FUNCINPEN party, the structure of FUNCINPEC, the cooperation in
the royal government, the amendment of the party's by-laws and its
internal rules, and the evaluation of the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
On FUNCINPEC's external policies, the resolutions said the
party will cooperate with all nations around the world, especially
the neighboring countries, and those in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the economic field, it said FUNCINPEC will implement true
free market economy, eliminate economic anarchy and dishonest
investors and develop the economy by making full use of national
resources and at the same time preserving a sound environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, 627 members of the National
Council will be appointed as well as 36 members of the Steering
Committee.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing FUNCINPEC's achievements in the past years,
Ranariddh defined three major goals to be pursued by the party in
the coming years. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen national unity around the Monarch;
</P>
<P>
-- To promote cooperation and understanding among Cambodians
through peaceful and non-violent actions;
</P>
<P>
-- And to promote and protect freedom of the people.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation between the two ruling parties, Ranariddh said
his party will strive to strengthen the cooperation with the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) with sincerity and to fulfill its
role as an equal partner of the coalition government in order to
better serve the people with the spirit of national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
After stressing the importance of the party's leadership and
unity, Ranariddh urged members of the leadership to strive to
consolidate the party structure at all levels especially at the
grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
The congress was attended by some 4,000 delegates, including
Nhiek Bun Chhay, the exiled military commander who returned to
Phnom Penh on March 7 after fleeing Cambodia in July 1997 and
Prince Norodom Chakrapong, a half-brother of Ranariddh and a
former CPP member, who has rejoined FUNCINPEC after returning from
exile not long ago.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Speakers' Conference Ends in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The third conference of the
Association of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation) Speakers and Parliamentarians ended here Sunday after
adopting a number of recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"Parliaments represent democratic peoples and these peoples
must have a space to let their voices be heard in the region,"
Bangladeshi Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury told the closing
session.
</P>
<P>
Parliaments hold the responsibility of "voicing and directly
responding to the aspirations and needs of our citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parliaments, where controversy can be followed by consensus,
and actions are proposed, opposed and debated, "represent the
essential proof that our citizens are free to decide upon their
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition
in the Bangladeshi parliament, said: "The most important thrust
for SAARC is promoting socio-economic growth and reform."
"Development remains the most compelling security challenge facing
the region."
</P>
<P>
Khaleda described the role of parliament speakers as "crucial."
 "They have a duty to contribute towards greater accountability
and transparency by all political parties... oversee the role of
the government so that it does not abuse its majority powers."
</P>
<P>
The parliament speakers should "be impartial guardians in
maintaining the balances," she added.

<HEADLINE> Freed Rwanda Genocide Suspect Prefers in U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Bernard Ntuyahaga, a Rwanda
genocide suspect, has asked to stay in the United Nations custody
though he was released Thursday by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga, a major in the former Rwandan Armed Forces, made the
request in his written appeal to the Tribunal Registry Friday,
sources from Arusha in northern Tanzania where the ICTR is based,
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ICTR spokesman Kingsley Moghalu was quoted by the sources as
saying that Ntuyahaga is still in the United Nations Detention
Facility (UNDF) on the outskirts of Arusha, but is not being
treated as a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
"Ntuyahaga is free, he is feared being deported to Rwanda," the
 spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Natuyahaga, 47, surrendered himself to the Tribunal on July 10,
1998 and was indicted on September 29 with one count, namely
Crimes against Humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the 10
Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort the former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR Tribunal Thursday granted the prosecution to withdraw
its indictment against Ntuyahaga and set him free.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release is a result of the bid by his prosecutor,
Othman Chande who argued that the withdrawal will promote the
exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by a state as contained in
Article 8 of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutor's motion followed a request by the
Belgian government which has tried to transfer the trial of
Ntuyahaga to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Since Ntuyahaga's release, Belgium and Rwanda have all demanded
his transfer for trial in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Belgian government met Friday with
Tanzania's Attorney General Andrew Chenge, demanding Tanzanian
authorities open to the possibility of arresting Ntuyahaga and
extraditing him to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state-owned Rwandan radio reported Thursday that
Kigali has submitted an extradition request to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Justice Minister Jean de Dieu Mucyo was quoted by the
radio as saying that "If the ICTR has no evidence, it should hand
him over as we do have proof."

<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary: NATO Kosovo Threat "For Real" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Sunday that the threat of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia was "for real".
</P>
<P>
"We have to get across to (Yugoslav) President (Slobodan)
Milosevic that we are serious. This is for real," he said in a BBC
TV interview.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the situation was "very serious" and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was preparing for a military
strike after the peace talks failed in Paris.
</P>
<P>
But he said the West remained in contact with Belgrade and
stood ready to reconvene peace talks at any time if the Serbian
leadership showed willingness to work for peace.
</P>
<P>
"The objective throughout this is to try and achieve an outcome
in Kosovo in which there is stability... If it will take military
action to achieve that, then military action is the logical step,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary said he was prepared to visit Milosevic
in Belgrade if necessary but Milosevic risked becoming
increasingly isolated in the international community the longer he
rejected a Kosovo autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks in Paris failed last Friday. From then on,
Britain and NATO officials repeatedly threatened to air-strike the
Serbian military sites in Kosovo if Yugoslavia refuses to sign on
the peace treaty initiated by the West.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo peace plan blueprinted by the six-nation Contact
Group offered substantial autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and require Western troops to monitor peace implementation
in that region.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade refused to sign the treaty, saying it violates its
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Manila: No Blanket Immunity for U.S. Soldiers Under VFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- President Estrada has assured the
public that the Visiting Force Agreement (VFA) between the
Philippines and the United States would not give visiting U.S.
troops blanket immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly Radio-TV program at the weekend, Estrada said the
Philippines can invoke its extradition treaty with the United
States to bring erring American soldiers to justice under
Philippine laws.
</P>
<P>
"Our law is clear. Legally speaking, we are on an equal footing
with the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The VFA provides guidelines on the prosecution in Philippine
courts of any member of the U.S. armed forces who violates
Philippines laws, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, offenses like rape and murder fall under the
jurisdiction of Philippine courts as the U.S. would never consider
these acts as part of the soldiers' official duty.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine government can run after American
soldiers who commit crimes against any Filipino even if they
attempt to escape to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The president cited as a precedent the recent case of an
American soldier stationed in Okinawa, Japan, who fled to the U.S.
but was extradited to Japan to stand trial in rape charges.
</P>
<P>
A primer on the VFA says: "In cases where the Philippines will
waive its exercise of jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction is
actually transferred to U.S. authorities who shall ensure that
justice is served for every offense committed by any member of the
U.S. armed forces in the country."
</P>
<P>
Should the Senate approve the VFA, the accord would pave the
way for the resumption of joint military exercises between the
Philippines and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Joint military exercises between the two countries stemmed from
the Mutual Defense Treaty signed by the Philippines and the U.S.
in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Develops Device for Selecting Baby's Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has designed and
manufactured a sex selection device which helps doctors select the
exact sex of a baby a woman wants to have.
</P>
<P>
The device known as Electro Magnetic Separation was designed by
 Professor Uche Megafu, head of department of obstetrics and
gynecology in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, and
manufactured by the government-owned Equipment Manufacturing
Center in Enugu State, eastern Nigeria, The Guardian newspapers
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Megafu announced the successful utilization of the device in
selecting sexes of children by women at the 1999 National
Convention of the Association of General and Private Medical
Practitioners of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the concept of the electro magnetic
separation device was based on the fact that males bearing
spematozoa migrate to the negative pole while females bearing
sperm move to the positive pole in an electric field.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the device has been experimented since 1996
with good result and with no failure rate in all sex selection of
babies.
</P>
<P>
Megafu said from 17 pregnancies and 14 deliveries, all the 14
babies delivered were boys while there were three abortions.
</P>
<P>
For the sex selection for female children using the device, all
the six deliveries so far were girls, giving a 100 percent success
rate.
</P>
<P>
Although there are several modern methods of sex selection in
developed countries, he said, they are complex and could not be
used in Nigeria because of lack of of needed materials.
</P>
<P>
The new technique is devised to provide a simple approach to
sex selection and help Nigerian women whose marriages are
threatened because they could not have a male child, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Africa where inheritance is along male line because of the
need to preserve family names, Megafu explained, lack of a male
child in the family often brings frustration, family breakage and
infidelity.

At a press conference following the summit, the two leaders
issued a nine-point statement on bilateral partnership and
implementation of the joint action plan they announced last
October during Kim's visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the progress in defense
exchange between the two nations, including preparation for a
second security policy meeting in June this year.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Kim stressed that he explained to the
Japanese prime minister his "sunshine policy" toward Pyongyang and
the importance of improving relations between Pyongyang, Tokyo and
Washington to the policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Obuchi said Japan supports President Kim's policy to
engage Pyongyang in a bid to remove confrontation from the Korean
peninsula and seeks to improve its ties with the DPRK by solving
issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the two leaders said that the DPRK's development and
test-firing of long and intermediate-range missiles is intolerable
for maintaining stability and peace on the Korean peninsula and
Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
They said they will make a joint appeal to DPRK leaders to open
channels of dialogue for reconciliation and exchanges, instead of
escalated confrontation and tension.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who arrived here Friday afternoon for a three-day visit,
was the first Japanese prime minister to visit South Korea since
Tomiichi Murayama' visit in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President-elect Calls for Transparency in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian president-elect Olusegun
Obasanjo has called for transparency in the on-going privatization
of some public enterprises by the present military government.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure for the second leg of his world tour, he
said in capital Abuja Saturday that "privatization to me requires
much more than the sing-song of privatization," The Guardian
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect stressed "where it has worked, it was with
openness," adding privatization is not a religion but done for
some purpose which is efficient service, investment and bringing
funds into the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to do a good job, he noted, privatization should not
be rushed, the objective must also be established, it must be
transparent and "we must know a reasonable true value of what we
are privatizing."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to speculations that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may have been behind the alleged hasty privatization
process, Obasanjo said he has discussed with it and it is equally
concerned with privatization and wants the nation to take time to
value things rather than be in haste.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Senator Anietie Okon, national publicity
secretary of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) which won the
February 27 presidential election, asked the current military
government to halt the planned privatization of the sensitive
sectors of oil, energy and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
He said his party was worried about the undue haste with which
the military government was implementing a project of such
fundamental importance to the survival of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
He explained that privatization cannot be rushed and should not
be conducted in such a manner that would convey the impression
that the exercise is simple to allow some powerful Nigerians
"pocket our national inheritance."

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders Suggest Holding General Elections  Every Two and a Half Years in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in Bangladesh have
suggested that general elections be held every two and a half
years, instead of the present every five years, to help ensure
political stability in the country, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the political parties' present level of intolerance for
each other, general elections should be held every two and half
years," President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) Abdul Awal Mintoo was quoted as
saying here on Saturday at a discussion on "electoral law
reforms."
</P>
<P>
"All the major political parties should sit together and take a
decision in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that women members of parliament who are not
elected directly by the people should not be allowed to vote on
major issues like a no-confidence motion against a government.
</P>
<P>
Thirty seats in the Bangladesh parliament are reserved for
women which are elected by the 300 directly-elected law-makers.
</P>
<P>
The FBCCI president also opposed bureaucrats joining politics
immediately after retirement. "There should be legal bar for civil
servants to enter into politics in at least three years of their
retirement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mintoo said that he and his colleagues in the FBCCI were highly
critical about the present electoral laws that allowed tax-dodgers
to contest the general elections but barred the loan defaulters.
</P>
<P>
"The defaulters issue was solely aimed at preventing some good
people involved in business from contesting the elections," he
said, suggesting that tax-evaders should not be allowed to take
part in polls.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Mintoo, Abu Alam Chowdhury, a businessman, said
he could cite examples of people's representatives (members of
parliament) who possessed considerable wealth and property but "do
not pay any tax."
</P>
<P>
He said there should be a provision under which the authorities
could distinguish between the "willful defaulters and the
defaulters due to certain political and economic conditions."
</P>
<P>
Arguing for reducing the five-year term of a parliament to two
years, FBCCI member Keramat Ali said that "becoming an member of
parliament is a very good investment. If the term is reduced to
two years, the nation will see some good people contesting the
polls having no vested interest in mind."
</P>
<P>
Participants at the discussion, including those from the FBCCI,
the Bangladesh Employers' Association, the Bangladesh Handicrafts
Association, the Bangladesh Periodical Publishers' Association and
others, observed that tenures of the next three or four
parliaments should be two and a half years before reverting to the
normal five-year duration.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was jointly organized by the FBCCI and the Fair
Election Monitoring Alliance, a citizens group for monitoring and
observing polls, to elicit opinions of the members of business
community on the need for electoral law reform in Bangladesh,
where political parties often resort to hartals (strikes)
paralyzing economic activities and causing heavy losses.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Ceremony: World's Most Watched Fashion Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Oscar night has become the
world's most-watched fashion show as designers compete to dress
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
"Fashion is almost as big as the show itself," said Gil Cates,
longtime producer of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
A designer who makes a successful connection with Hollywood can
be on the spotlight of the fashion world. Giorgio Armani was the
first designer to understand that a celebrity clientele is good
for both star and designer.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he opened a West Coast store, complete with a
publicity department. The next year, he dressed Michelle Pfeiffer
for the Academy Awards. Today, the Armani suit becomes the uniform
of Hollywood's power brokers.
</P>
<P>
Thus, during past few weeks, designers from New York, France,
Italy and Germany have been staging special shows of their evening
wear collections in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
They blitzed the nominees with faxes, phone calls and special
gifts. Couture gowns were shipped to prospects, assistants
dispatched with matching shoes and purses, clients taken to lunchs
and dinners.
</P>
<P>
Fashion for stars is more expensive than common people could
dream of: a 80,000-dollar gown, a pair of 110,000-dollar diamond-
studded Jimmy Choo closed-toe sandals with 40-carat diamond ankle
straps, a 500,000-dollar bracelet, and a pair of 28,000-dollar
diamond-studded Ray Ban sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 45 million households worldwide will tune into the
71st annual Academy Awards. And stars, especially female stars
such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett are racing to Oscar
dressing -- because a wrong outfit could damage a career and
photos of it could remain floating on the Internet for years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Oscars are ripe with speculation not only on who
might win but also on what the stars might wear.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 96 in Indonesia's Sambas Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the bloody
ethnic fighting in Sambas regency of Indonesia's West Kalimantan
province rose to 96, reports reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Six more bodies were found Saturday, bringing the death toll to
96, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Sambas is being brought under control
gradually although tension remained there on Sunday, the sixth day
since the outbreak of clashes between the indigenous Malays and
migrants from the island of Madura, the reports quoted local
police as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, refugees fleeing days of ethnic clashes continued to
flow into makeshift shelters and military installations in the
area, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
At least 15,000 Madurese have fled Sambas by boat and truck for
the West Kalimantan provincial capital of Pondianak, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
"We will transfer the refugees to a military installation in
Pasir Panjang," Nasrun Nasution, head of the regency's information
office, said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 1,030 houses were burned down in Sambas
since clashes broke out last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the violence erupted after a group of men, believed
to be Madurese, attacked a truck loaded with Dayaks in a village
last Monday, leaving one dead.
</P>
<P>
The unrest was the worst in the province since early 1997 when
similar battles broke out between Dayaks and Madurese, leaving 300
dead.
</P>
<P>
Reports said thousands of troops and policemen have been sent
to the area to contain the violence.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Urged to Tighten Oil Spill Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after some 300,000 liters
of bunker fuel blackened the waters of Manila Bay on Friday, the
Philippine Senate began to take action on Sunday to look into the
implementation of the government's oil spill prevention policy by
the appropriate agencies.
</P>
<P>
Loren Legarda, chairperson of the Senate's environment and
natural resources committee, said the senate will inquire into the
country's apparent lack of capability to handle a massive
environmental crisis that may be brought about by an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Coast Guard said Friday's oil spill might be the
worst the country has ever had.
</P>
<P>
The spill came from the oil tanker MT Sea Brothers, which sank
Friday after hitting the South Harbor's breakwater floor. Besides
the oil that has actually spilled out, some 120,000 liters of fuel
remain inside the submerged tanker.
</P>
<P>
"This latest spill is definitely a big one. Any spill in excess
of 50,000 liters is considered a major disaster," Legarda said.
</P>
<P>
She said the latest spill threatens the entire sea harvest in
Metro Manila, Cavite, Bataan, Laguna and Batangas, among other
areas.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted in 1994 a national oil spill prevention
policy. The policy regards oil spill as a "national security
matter" in view of the fact that a large portion of the country's
sea harvest may be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said that neither the government nor the private sector
has the capability or a ready mechanism in place to react with
dispatch to contain the damage and set in motion the cleanup and
rehabilitation of affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The senator also urged the government to set up an inter-agency
body with the private sector to monitor the regular cleanup and
maintenance of fuel containers and other facilities to prevent
spills.

CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss

Saturday past longitude 9 degrees west to complete the

an around-the-world voyage without a stop.
</P>
<P>
Piccard, a 41-year-old psychiatrist, and Jones, a 51-year-old

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Unveils Software To Monitor Kid's Performance in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company, known as
Schoolsoft and based in California, unveiled an upgrade to its
software that lets parents monitor their child's performance in
school over the Internet, according to a report from the company
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The company said it has developed software that runs on 3Com
Corp.'s popular Palmpilot handheld computers. School children will
have a more difficult time skipping classes in the future if their
parents monitor data stored in the software.
</P>
<P>
School teachers can now enter into the PalmPilot student
attendance data, grades, homework assignments, which are all sent
to the school's central server pre-loaded with SchoolSoft software,
according to Jim Weldom, SchoolSoft founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Later, parents with either Internet access or just a telephone
can access the school's server for updates from the teacher, he
explained,adding parents could only access the system via the
telephone in the past.
</P>
<P>
Weldom said his company at present had an installed base of
about 330 schools around the United States, and that the software
was used for children in kindergarten all the way to secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
The server software costs an average of about 20,000 U.S.
dollars for a school and the PalmPilots average about 360 a year
per user, the company said.

JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu left Sunday morning for a three-day visit to Ukraine,
Russia and Georgia in an effort to boost bilateral ties and halt
alleged Russia's weapon technology transfer to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement Saturday night,
denying criticism from opposition parties that the trip is meant
to boost Netanyahu's standing with over 700,000 Russian-speaking
voters in Israel in the May elections.

<P>
There are important diplomatic matters on the agenda topped
by the issue of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons programs

<P>
Netanyahu will express Israel's concern to Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov over the alleged technology transfer to
Iran by Russian companies and research institutions.

Israel views Iran's ability to develop ballistic missiles and
non-conventional weapons as a long-term threat to its security.

He will also discuss Israel's trade relations with the three
former Soviet Union republics and its connection with Jewish
communities there, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Ukraine, the first stop of his trip,

<HEADLINE> SADC Peacekeeping Force Endorsed: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Southern African defense
ministers have agreed to a timetable to establish a peacekeeping
force for the region.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Swaziland this weekend, delegates to a regional
inter- state defense and security meeting gave their backing to
the formation of the force, Sunday Times newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
December of 2000 has been set for the allocation of forces and
January 1, 2001 is the date for the inauguration of southern
Africa's peacekeeping force, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The force will police a growing number of conflicts in the
region and elsewhere in Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, a confidential report endorsed by
delegates to the meeting gave the following as the main features
of the force. It will have the ability to:
</P>
<P>
-- deal rapidly with small-scale contingencies of a short-term
nature;
</P>
<P>
-- deal with peacekeeping and humanitarian aid-type
contingencies under a United Nation and Organization of African
Unity (OAU) mandate, and
</P>
<P>
-- expand to appropriate force levels within a realistic
warning period and also have the capacity to develop a
brigade-size force over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The report is the conclusion of a year-long extensive
feasibility study which included a special seminar on military
cooperation in Harare, Zimbabwe, and a Danish-sponsored visit to
the Baltic peacekeeping front-line of Bosnia in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The interim goal shall be to establish a brigade initially
suitable for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations under the
OAU and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Starting small, the force should also be deployed over time to
the envisioned brigade-size force," said the report.
</P>
<P>
A military working group of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will be appointed by mid-next month to begin
working out the proposed force structure, equipment, training,
logistics and financing for the peacekeeping brigade.
</P>
<P>
The working group has been given until December this year to
table its final report, which will be subjected to the approval of
all SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The report lists among the most important driving forces for a
peacekeeping force the political will to establish closer
cooperation between SADC countries and the requirement for Africa
to develop and contribute to peace and security within the
continent and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It also draws attention to the lack of funds and logistic
resources and the steady down-sizing of armed forces within SADC
member states.
</P>
<P>
If the force were deployed in U.N.-mandated missions, expenses
will be refunded by the United Nations as agreed bilaterally
between the U.N. and specific SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said there is a "distinct requirement for
SADC nations to give sufficient priority to the project
financially and to allocate adequate staff officers to ensure the
required progress and momentum."
</P>
<P>
The report recommends the appointment of a core planning and
steering committee which will form the nucleus of an SADC brigade
headquarters staffed by about 14 staff members.

<HEADLINE> Major Kenyan Bank's Board to Quit Over Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of the
National Bank of Kenya is set to resign on March 24 in a new
restructuring move, according to the bank's managing director
Reuben Marambii.
</P>
<P>
Marambii said here Saturday that the ten directors except
himself had taken responsibility for an enormous sum of bad
loans, claiming that he is a newcomer and not responsible for the
problems at the bank.
</P>
<P>
Marambii said the directors will remain in office until April
30, when a new board of directors will be elected at the bank's
annual general meeting, newspapers here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bank chairman David Masika announced Friday that ten outlets,
including three branches, three sub-branches and four agencies,
will be closed or sold in 1999. Four other branches will be
merged this year.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said about 110 million shillings (about 1.8
million U.S. dollars) are to be raised by selling excess assets,
in a bid to offset adverse effects of bad loans, adding that the
bank is seeking new partners to buy the Kenyan government's stake
when the bank is back to sound operations.
</P>
<P>
The bank will reduce employees by 200 while the ongoing
computerization project will result in further reduction of staff
by 200, Masika noted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government and National Society Security Fund are
the majority shareholders with 22.5 percent and 37.5 percent
stakes respectively. The other 40 percent is owned by ordinary
shareholders, following two successful government share sales.

LUSAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia advanced into the next
round of the September All-Africa Games qualifying series with a
second leg 3-1 victory over Malawi on Saturday at Nchanga stadium
in Chingola, northern Zambia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vehicles With Fake Licences Impounded in Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian capital Lusaka's Road
Traffic Commission (RTC) has impounded about 120 motor vehicles
with fake road licences over the past few weeks at a joint
operation with the police, Road Traffic Commissioner John Chipuwa
has said.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission has refuted earlier media reports that two
officers at the headquarters were being held by police in
connection with a scandal involving the sale and distribution of
1999 first quarter licences, the Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Chipuwa said none of his officers or agents had been linked
with the alleged racket.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint operation with police has netted about 120 motorists
who have been charged and are helping police with investigations
about the source of their fake licences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, police have had to grapple with a persistent
problem of illegal printing of government documents in the
sprawling townships of Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Last year in a swoop, police officers confiscated printing
machines used to manufacture vehicle and road traffic licences.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has a commercial vehicle population of 100,000,
excluding the government vehicles which do not require licensing.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Warns Against Use of Force on Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian Foreign Ministry
said on Saturday that there are no grounds for using force against
Yugoslavia and warned that any policy towards military attack will
be "counterproductive" to the peace process in Kosovo, Itar-Tass
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Military measures would only complicate the peace process and
entail further aggravation of the crisis with unpredictable
consequences, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Belarus supports the efforts of the six-nation Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia, saying it has played the key role in
establishing dialogue between the opposing parties over Kosovo,
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged that the peace process should go on and
hoped that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) will soon resume its missions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Belarus insists that settlement of the Kosovo conflict should
be based on unconditional ensuring of Yugoslavia's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and that no force should be used
against Belgrade, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokesman on Recent Tense Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China strongly appeals to the
relevant parties involved in the Kosovo issue to settle the issue
by continuing to hold negotiations in an appropriate and just
manner through exercising restraint and adopting a patient and
flexible attitude.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remark here today
while giving a talk on the recent tension in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the latest developments of the Kosovo issue have
aroused the attention and uneasiness of all the peace-loving
people all over the world in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Kosovo is the internal affair of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, he noted, and the Chinese government hold
that the issue should be resolved politically through dialogues on
the basis of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Yugoslavia and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests
of the ethnic groups in Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
Resorting to a military action against Yugoslavia without
authorization of the United Nations' Security Council seriously
violates the UN Charter and the established norms of the
international laws and therefore cannot be accepted by the
international community, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Invest in Coop Project with South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
decided to invest 500,000 U.S. dollars in a cooperation project
with South Africa, which is known as "Mosagrius", Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries Carlos do Rosario told the Domingo
weekly which is published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project, targeted at agriculture, agro-industry and
eco-tourism, was agreed in May, 1996 by the Mozambican government
and SACADA, a South African business organization engaging in
agricultural development in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1997, the Mosagrius Development Society was established
as the executing institution of the project, in which the
Mozambican government and SACADA each holds 50 percent of the
shares.
</P>
<P>
About ten South African farmers arrived in Mozambique in late
1997 to carry out the project along with their Mozambican
counterparts. So far, a total of 1,500 hectares of land have been
cultivated and planted with tomatoes, potatoes and various other
crops. The final goal of the project is to cultivate 200, 000
hectares of farmland.

MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-three people were injured,
three of them seriously, when a powerful bomb exploded in a
northern Philippine town Saturday night, according to a Philippine
News Agency report Sunday.

The report said that the bomb exploded less than 100 meters

queen would be crowned at about 24:00 (16:00 GMT) Saturday.

Rogelio Danule, police chief of Balungao, was quoted by the

Molotov bomb or pill box.

Danule said a plastic container found in the crime scene
bolstered the theory that the bomb could either be a home-made
Molotov cocktail or pill box and not a grenade.

JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to leave early
Sunday morning for a three-day visit to Russia, Ukraine and
Georgia. Some critics from the Foreign Ministry and opposition
political parties said the trip is designed only to boost his
standing with Russia-speaking voters in Israel.

<P>
-- The Palestinians are ready to take up arms against Israel to
defend their legitimate rights, first and foremost their right to
declare an independent state, at anytime, Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said Friday in Ramallah.
Netanyahu said Arafat is making a grave mistake if he think he can
gain anything by unilaterally declaring an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Security officials are discussing annexation of part of the
West Bank still under Israeli control or seizure of territories
already handed over to the Palestinians if Arafat carries out his
intention to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. But
officials in the foreign and justice ministries said this step
will be a mistake, for which Israel will pay a high diplomatic
price.

Uganda had no problems in its deals with South Africa, whether

Uganda has been involved in the conflict in the Democratic

<HEADLINE> Oscar Night Brings Huge Profit to Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Oscar ceremony Sunday
night will bring huge profit to the Academy of Motion Picture Art &AMP;
Sciences, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Under a new pact that runs through the year 2008, American
Broadcasting Company (ABC), the media giant of the U.S., is paying
the academy 37 million U.S. dollars for the right to broadcast the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The net profit of Oscar Night for the academy could be well
above 15 million dollars, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the academy got 26 million dollars for worldwide
broadcast rights to the ceremony. But it cost the academy 10.3
million to sponsor it, and it spent 4.5 million dollars annually
on the Margaret Herrick Library and film archives, 2 million
dollars yearly on student film awards.
</P>
<P>
With higher revenues from the new ABC contract, the yearly
savings of 7.5 million dollars could roughly double, the sources
predict.
</P>
<P>
By now, the academy has spent most of its accumulated savings
of 22 million dollars on its project of Margaret Herrick Library
and film archives.
</P>
<P>
The library and archives will contain roughly 26,000 tomes,
including nearly every book written in English on the motion
picture business, 70,000 scripts, 7 million still photos and 19,
000 movie posters.
</P>
<P>
Robert Rehme, president of the academy, hailed the Oscar
telecast as the jewel in the academy's "crown," and he intends to
keep it polished. Though many organizations hire companies to
sponsor their award ceremonies, Rehme said the academy insists on
sponsoring the ceremony on its own as a way of ensuring quality.
</P>
<P>
"This way, we can control our fortunes," Rehme said. "We
control everything down to the number of commercials on the show,
and we look at every commercial and pass on the content. We want
to protect the Oscar and the Academy Awards and our brand."

<P>
WELLINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley will go to Apia to attend the state memorial service
for former Samoan Prime Minister Tofilau Eti, which will be held
there Monday (New Zealand time).
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued Sunday by the Prime Minister's
Office, Mrs. Shipley praised the former Samoan leader as "a
distinguished prime minister and an esteemed regional leader in
South Pacific".
</P>
<P>
Tafilau Eti "worked tirelessly over decades to build the
special friendship between Samoa and New Zealand", she said.
</P>
<P>
Tofilau Eti died Last Friday after a long battle with cancer.
He had been Samoa's prime minister from 1982 to 1998 when he
resigned because of illness.

New Zealand and Samoa signed a treaty of friendship in 1962.
Tofilau Eti had been a strong supporter of the treaty, the only
such agreement New Zealand has with any country.

<HEADLINE> Karst Subsidence Blamed on Human Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Human activity can be blamed for
70 percent of karst stratum subsidence in China, according to the
Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS).
</P>
<P>
CAGS geologists note that cave-ins and the erosion of
subterranean soil contribute to the normal subsidence of karst
formations over periods lasting as long as 1,000 years. However,
they acknowledged that human activities such as urbanization and
infrastructure construction can accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of underground karst formations has been
attributed to subsidence of the disappearance of surface water, as
well as erosion resulting from water flowing through cracks in the
formations.
</P>
<P>
The excessive extraction and pumping of groundwater in many
parts of the country has caused the subsidence of underground
karst formations. Cases of subsidence have affected more than 30
medium- to large-sized cities, 40 mine sites, 25 railway lines and
over 100 reservoirs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The experts have called for the enactment of legislation to
prohibit activities that adversely affect local topography and
propose the introduction of disaster insurance policies to cover
karst subsidence.
</P>
<P>
Subsidence is also associated with floods and earthquakes which
are estimated to play a role in only 30 percent of related events.
</P>
<P>
China categorizes researches related to karst features as
hydrographic studies. Grouting is currently used to consolidate
cave-ins and prevent karst structures from collapsing.
</P>
<P>
China's karst formations, which cover an estimated 3.65 million
sq km, hold 200 billion cu m of water resources available for
annual use. The latter figure accounts for close to a quarter of
the nation's total subterranean water resources.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Bans Malaysian Pork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has imposed an import
ban on Malaysian pork in a bid to stop the spread of pig-born
Japanese encephalitis, a statement of the Ministry of Public
Health available Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
"The livestock department has banned all pork imports and live
pigs from Malaysia and set up an ad-hoc patrol unit along the
common border," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public health experts warned the public not to panic
as no cases of the disease had been detected in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Japanese encephalitis, which can cause inflammation of the
brain, is spread to humans from pigs by the Culex mosquito. The
disease has been reported to cause at least 53 deaths in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry warned people to avoid mosquitoes
and not to keep live pigs near houses.
</P>
<P>
Officials manning customs checkpoints on the Thai-Malaysian
border had stepped up vigilance to ensure Malaysian pig-virus
epidemic did not spread to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian viral outbreak has killed at least 53 people
since October, and troops have begun killing more than 300,000
pigs in a bid to contain it. Almost all of the 53 victims lived or
worked near pig farms.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Singapore has also suspended the import of live
pigs from Malaysia and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Business Leaders for Shorter Terms of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders in Bangladesh have
suggested that general elections be held every two and a half
years, instead of the present every five years, to help ensure
political stability in the country, press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Given the political parties' present level of intolerance for
each other, general elections should be held every two and half
years," President of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) Abdul Awal Mintoo was quoted as
saying here on Saturday at a discussion on "electoral law
reforms."
</P>
<P>
"All the major political parties should sit together and take a
decision in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that women members of parliament who are not
elected directly by the people should not be allowed to vote on
major issues like a no-confidence motion against a government.
</P>
<P>
Thirty seats in the Bangladesh parliament are reserved for
women which are elected by the 300 directly-elected law-makers.
</P>
<P>
The FBCCI president also opposed bureaucrats joining politics
immediately after retirement. "There should be legal bar for civil
servants to enter into politics in at least three years of their
retirement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mintoo said that he and his colleagues in the FBCCI were highly
critical about the present electoral laws that allowed tax-dodgers
to contest the general elections but barred the loan defaulters.
</P>
<P>
"The defaulters issue was solely aimed at preventing some good
people involved in business from contesting the elections," he
said, suggesting that tax-evaders should not be allowed to take
part in polls.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Mintoo, Abu Alam Chowdhury, a businessman, said
he could cite examples of people's representatives (members of
parliament) who possessed considerable wealth and property but "do
not pay any tax."
</P>
<P>
He said there should be a provision under which the authorities
could distinguish between the "willful defaulters and the
defaulters due to certain political and economic conditions."
</P>
<P>
Arguing for reducing the five-year term of a parliament to two
years, FBCCI member Keramat Ali said that "becoming an member of
parliament is a very good investment. If the term is reduced to
two years, the nation will see some good people contesting the
polls having no vested interest in mind."
</P>
<P>
Participants at the discussion, including those from the FBCCI,
the Bangladesh Employers' Association, the Bangladesh Handicrafts
Association, the Bangladesh Periodical Publishers' Association and
others, observed that tenures of the next three or four
parliaments should be two and a half years before reverting to the
normal five-year duration.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was jointly organized by the FBCCI and the Fair
Election Monitoring Alliance, a citizens group for monitoring and
observing polls, to elicit opinions of the members of business
community on the need for electoral law reform in Bangladesh,
where political parties often resort to hartals (strikes)
paralyzing economic activities and causing heavy losses.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in north China's
Hebei Province was recently detained for illegally killing a
leopard, an endangered animal species that is under the highest
degree of protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Local police sources say that Wang Haiwang, a resident of the
village of Baiwangzhuang on the outskirts of Wu'an City, killed a
female leopard on a nearby mountain with a homemade gun at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang shared the leopard meat with his neighbors and sold the
skin for 2,300 yuan, and, earlier this year, he sold the animal's
bones for 2,600 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The incident was later reported to local forest police, who
then arrested Wang and confiscated his gun.
</P>
<P>
The police also tracked the leopard skin and bones down.
</P>
<P>
Wang will be prosecuted for the illegal killing of an
endangered animal and for smuggling animal parts, the sources say.

leader Thaksin Shinawatra to closely monitor disbursement of the
53-billion-baht (1.45-billion-U.S. dollar) loan, the Bangkok Post
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin, the country's telecommunication tycoon, was quoted as
saying Saturday that the prime minister should keep an eye on the
disbursement of the fund to make sure the money goes to where it
is needed.
</P>
<P>
Efficient audit mechanism were also needed since the loan, part
of the so-called Miyazawa fund, is expected to be spent within
four months, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the money be used to fund investment projects
which would help create jobs and benefit the country in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the government to spare part of the fund to help
people who would be affected by the Bankruptcy Bill which the
Senate has approved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the public to keep a close watch on the way
the fund is spent, to ensure it is not misused.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has received several loan packages since the country
was hit by the economic crisis in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the disbursement of the packages is reported to be
slow due to the red tape and bureaucracy in the departments of the
government.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Predicts Economic Recovery in Mid-1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economy could achieve
a turn-around in mid-1999 with capital inflows to be generated by
the sale of three banks and the upgrading of the country's credit
rating, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would sell off the Radanasin Bank, Bangkok
Metropolitan Bank and Siam City Bank to foreign banks to bring
competition and credit extension to cash-strapped Thai businesses,
Supachai said in remarks made public on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also Commerce Minister, said the authorities were
considering relaxing some reserve requirements for the banks being
sold as well as to possibly delay reserve requirements for
non-performing loans (NPL) by two or three quarters as incentives
to buyers.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of the banks will be a turning point for the economy.
The credit-rating agencies are watching us closely and we have a
greater chance after the bank sales to achieve an investment-grade
rating which will help us to draw funds into the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's credit ratings have improved to the level that
reflects the country's success in strengthening its payments
position, according to previous reports.
</P>
<P>
The credit ratings were up from lower grades to the current BI
foreign currency country ceiling for bonds and notes, BI foreign
currency country ceiling for bank deposits, and BaaI for baht
denominated government securities.
</P>
<P>
Supachai also noted said that it was ripe time for Thailand to
return to the international capital market by issuing global
bonds.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has programs to assist small- and
medium-size enterprises as part of a plan to salvage the banks'
NPLs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his earlier proposal that the government issue
bonds to banks in buying their NPLs, Supachai said it was a
complementary option that should be further explored -- especially
with regard to the sale of the three banks.

XINING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Three hundred artists are working
on a 600-meter-long and 2.3-meter-deep Tangka silk scroll painting
in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Aims to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in Shanghai,
a leading industrial city of China, is ready to open more fields
to attract overseas investment
</P>
<P>
It is striving to create an sound investment climate for
foreign businessmen, the China Daily Business Weekly reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to draw more foreign investment to boost
technology-intensive or capital-intensive industries to make
internationally competitive products," the paper quoted Hu Wei,
executive deputy director of the Pudong New Area Administrative
Committee, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The area is shaping a market-oriented economic management
system in accordance with laws and regulations to keep pace with
its growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is purifying its environment by launching large-
scale afforestation projects, dredging the rivers and reining in
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Although Pudong has passed its initial development phase, it
still has eye-catching attractions for foreign business people
because of its healthy economic structure and international-
standard management and service, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
Despite living in the shadow of the Asian financial turmoil,
Pudong still attracted 2.39 billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct
investment last year, an increase of 50 percent on a year-on-year
basis.
</P>
<P>
To date, 88 multinational companies have set up 149 enterprises
in Pudong, and 21 foreign conglomerates have chosen Pudong as the
location of their regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment has become a strong force to promote
Pudong's economy. In 1998, the area's gross domestic product hit
70.8 billion yuan (8.53 billion U.S. dollars), increasing 16.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Colombians May Face Shortage of Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombia, a country
rich in water resources, may face a shortage of water supply by
the year 2016, a Colombian expert warned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vice director of the Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies Institute (IDEAM) Martha Garcia said that there is a great
waste of water in the country as people think that it is very
abundant. U.N. figures show that Colombian's water resources are
five times bigger than the world average.
</P>
<P>
The problem lies in an uneven distribution of water resources
among the population. Most of the Colombian population is settled
in the Rio Magdalena watershed, exerting high pressure on the
region's water supply, while in some other places rich water
resources are not available for human needs, she explained.
</P>
<P>
On the treatment of waste water, Garcia said, 96 percent of the
country's municipalities, including the big cities, have no sewage
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the Environment Ministry, only one of the 6,000
sources of untreated sewage that flow into the Bogota River, now
the second most contaminated river of the world, complies with the
environmental regulations.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Rebels Threaten to Continue Armed Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
on Saturday threatened to continue their "armed struggle" against
Yugoslav security forces if the international community and NATO
fail to conduct military interference in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, KLA representatives said
the Kosovo Albanian delegation had signed the U.S.-proposed peace
plan in Paris peace talks for the sake of Kosovo's peace and
future as urged by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The three representatives, who were part of the ethnic Albanian
delegation in Paris peace talks, said that it is time for NATO and
the United States to carry out their promise to conduct emergent
interference in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with a population of 2 million, is an Albanian-
dominated province in Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic where the
secessionist Albanians have been fighting Yugoslav security forces
since early last year. The year-long conflict has killed more than
2,000 people and displaced tens of thousands of others.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western countries have been
pressuring the two warring sides to sign a peace agreement in
Paris peace talks and threatening to bomb Yugoslavia's strategic
points if Serbia refuse to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Paris peace talks broke down Friday after the Serbian
delegation refused to accept the deployment of NATO troops in
Kosovo to oversee the implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan which includes a political part and a
military part, Kosovo will be granted high-level autonomy rather
than full independence. The stationing of NATO peacekeepers in
Kosovo is the centerpiece of the military part.
</P>
<P>
The KLA representatives warned that the KLA would "continue to
fight" if NATO still balks at military intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They also warned that if NATO fails to carry out its threat,
the KLA would not abide by the peace plan which provides for the
disarmament and reform of the group.
</P>
<P>
The three representatives -- Ram Buja with the headquarters of
the KLA General Staff and KLA spokesmen Jak Up Krasniqi and
Melahim Zeka -- arrived here Saturday with other members of the
Albanian delegation to the Paris talks.
</P>
<P>
The delegation held talks with Albanian President Rexhep
Meidani and Foreign Minister Paskal Milo at the airport.

<HEADLINE> More Taiwanese Textile Manufacturers Moving To Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Over the last 20 years, Taiwan
developed a massive textiles industry with more than 6,000
manufacturers and annual exports worth 15 billion U.S. dollars,
but, increased international competition, labor shortages, and
labor costs caused many of them to move their factories to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources here, Taiwanese have registered
more than 2,000 textile companies on the mainland and exports to
the mainland now account for nearly 30 percent of Taiwan's textile
exports.
</P>
<P>
The sources say that Taiwanese manufacturers have found an
ideal place here for a production base because of the large
supplies of cheap labor and the huge market. They've brought both
technology and equipment, and much needed market information and
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
It hasn't taken many of them very long to succeed on the
mainland and textiles produced by Taiwanese firms are now widely
used by major garment producers in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Shishi, a small city on the coast of Fujian Province, has now
become a bridge to Taiwan for the textile industry. It chose
textiles as its major industry as early as the 1980s and by the
mid-1990s, the city of 280,000 had nearly 5,000 textile
manufacturers, producing 70 million pieces of garments a year.
</P>
<P>
But, its lack of brand names and inferior designs prevented it
from developing further. So, in 1991, it began inviting Taiwanese
manufacturers to its annual textile exhibition to pave the way for
closer co-operation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The city now has some 200 textile enterprises funded by
Taiwanese businesses and it has become a major cloth producer and
market on the mainland.

<HEADLINE> Canada Readies for NATO Action in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Saturday that its
fighter aircraft in Aviano, Italy, have been prepared for NATO
action in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian CF-18s from our Air Task Group in Aviano are prepared
to join in NATO action in order to end the hostilities in Kosovo
and the suffering of its people," said National Defense Minister
Art Eggleton in a release.
</P>
<P>
Canada currently has about 130 Canadian Forces personnel and
six CF-18 fighter aircraft in Aviano. All CF-18s are deployed with
air-to-air missiles and precision guide munitions for a ground
attack role.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has maintained its preference for a negotiated,
peaceful settlement to this crisis, and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has been given every opportunity to co-operate.
He must now take full responsibility for the consequences of not
doing so," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Canadian embassy staff and dependents have
evacuated from their mission in Belgrade, which has temporarily
reduced operations. Only a few embassy volunteers will remain to
maintain a minimal level of operations, said the release.

<HEADLINE> Most Bulgarians Against Use of Force in Kosovo, Survey Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Most Bulgarians oppose the use of
force in solving the Kosovo crisis out of the fear that Bulgaria
may become involved, according to a survey carried out by the
Alpha Research agency and Darik Radio.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted during March 16-19 shows that 72 percent
of the respondents are against NATO military intervention in
Yugoslavia and 77 percent are against NATO equipment or personnel
crossing Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent view the conflict in Kosovo, which is only
300 kilometers to the west of Sofia, as the worst threat to
national security at the moment.
</P>
<P>
A mere 27 percent of the respondents expect a fast resolution
of the conflict, as against 66 percent who expect it to drag on
for years.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, 43 percent of people would approve of Bulgaria's
receiving refugees if a war broke out in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the respondents consider NATO guarantees a
reliable protection, while 59 percent say Bulgaria would be better
protected if it did not allow its territory to be used in a
possible attack on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of Bulgarians stand for the government's Balkan
policy, which calls for a peaceful solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cement Relationship with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China and Pakistan are making
joint efforts to further cement their long-standing and mutually
beneficial friendship as they have enjoyed steady growth in
bilateral trade and economic cooperation. .
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily Business Weekly, statistics
from the General Administration of customs showed the two-way
trade volume between China and Pakistan topped 1 billion dollars
in 1997, up 10.6 per cent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"China has actively participated in the economic development of
Pakistan and has provided technical know-how and financial
assistance in construction of various major projects, such as the
Heavy Mechanical complex and Karakoram Highway," noted a report
from the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Besides supplying different kinds of machinery and equipment,
Chinese companies have also undertaken construction of road, power,
pharmaceutical, electricity, transmission line and cement projects
on a turn-key basis.
</P>
<P>
In order to further consolidate and develop the bilateral
economic cooperation, the Chinese and Pakistan governments have
signed a series of agreements covering the promotion of trade and
investment, transfer of technology and avoidance of double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based trade expert said that there is great potential
for the further growth of Sino-Pakistan economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"With the development of China's economy and improvement in the
standard of equality and variety of its products, further increase
in the volume of Chinese exports to Pakistan is expected," the
embassy report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both China and Pakistan have been making efforts to
reduce the trade deficit on the Pakistan side. And fairs and
exhibitions are being planned to introduce more Pakistani products
into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
China mainly sells Pakistan chemical materials, plant equipment,
paper, medicines, metal products, light industrial products and
livestock commodities, while imports from Pakistan usually consist
principally of cotton, leather, wool, chromite and crude oil.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Monitors Evacuates Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- All the 1,381 international
observers in Kosovo withdrew safely on Saturday from the troubled
province of Serbia, said a report of the Macedonian national
television station reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
ordered the evacuation of its monitors Friday after Kosovo peace
talks in Paris collapsed. France and Britain announced they were
adjourning the peace talks and would not resume them until the
Serb-led Yugoslav delegation accepted a peace plan for Kosovo,
which the ethnic Albanians have already signed.
</P>
<P>
The monitors' departure paved the way for possible air strikes
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to force Belgrade
to sign the peace plan drafted by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
William Walker, chief of the 1,381-member Kosovo Verification
Mission (KVM) told reporters Friday that while most monitors would
return for the moment to their home countries, he and a
headquarters staff of about 150 people would set up a base in
Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The KVM was deployed in Kosovo under an October 1998 cease-
fire agreement between Belgrade and the West that authorized as
many as 2,000 unarmed monitors to verify compliance with the
accord.

<HEADLINE> Banzer Denies Bolivia in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Hugo Banzer
affirmed on Saturday that the country is not in crisis despite
recent pessimistic comments from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition in the Bolivian Congress and the Bolivian
Workers Central (COB) warned that Bolivia is in a deep social and
economic crisis and showed pessimism over the future of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia's economic development was twice the average level of
Latin America and its inflation was under growth rate, which were
the fruits of strict macro control disciplines for many years,
Banzer said.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian president said that those achievements would not
be destroyed by the discouraging words of some sectors of the
country and the insufficient attention to social demands. "The
different sectors must understand the need to prevent damage to
the economy.", he added.
</P>
<P>
Banzer meanwhile admitted that some problems are not easily
resolved, despite the economic growth of the country, referring to
the demands of the workers.
</P>
<P>
Only under possible measures set by the country should the COB
demands be realized, Banzer stressed. The COB announced new
demonstrations to protest the government lack of attention to
their demand higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian president announced the members of the ruling
coalition will meet Monday to analyze all these matters and
coordinate better their activities.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Forces Ecuador to Change Export Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis in Ecuador will
force it to reschedule its export goals, Foreign Trade Minister
Hector Plaza said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to change our plans due to the changes in the
economic situation," said Plaza, explaining that the exports were
hampered by the paralysis of economic activities this week, which
were caused by the strikes of the social sectors in the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister will meet with other members of the economic
cabinet next week to discuss the production and exports targets.
</P>
<P>
"We need more support from the production sector, because the
tax burden on that sector is very heavy," added Plaza, referring
to the imposing of some taxes, such as one percent taxes on the
assets of companies and the elimination of tariff exemptions on
some imported products.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exporting sector has seen the worst time in
the last two weeks, because many companies were impeded from
fulfilling deals of importing and exporting of products.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian Federation of Exporters said that the losses
attributed to the strikes in the last two weeks could amount to
150 million dollars, although an increase of production is
foreseen in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador had an trade deficit of 854 million dollars in 1998,
according to Central Bank statistics.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Service Sector Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- China will further liberalize its
service sector to bolster co-operation with other economies, the
China Daily Business Weekly today quoted a senior trade official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the opening up must be carried out gradually according
to China's own economic situation, Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of
foreign trade and economic co-operation, made the remarks at a
seminar hosted last week by the U.S. Coalition of Service
Industries (CSI), the Chinese Development and Research Center, and
Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
"China's service sector is still underdeveloped with an
unbalanced structure and poor legal foundation," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
"We should allow domestic enterprises enough time to readjust
and upgrade themselves in order to compete with foreign
counterparts on the same level in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun went on to say that in the long run, the attraction of
foreign funds by the service sector would be an irresistible trend.
</P>
<P>
It will be a gradual process to realize the convertibility of
the Renminbi under capital accounts as China still has to
strengthen its macroeconomic regulatory system, improve the
financial supervisory system, and readjust the banking system,
Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the opening of the insurance market should also
be carried out on a trial basis as this industry still has to
prepare itself for the future competition.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China has granted licenses to 14 foreign-
funded insurance companies for dealing in property insurance for
foreign-funded firms and life insurance for foreigners, and in re-
insurance of both.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China is drafting a series of management
provisions as supplements to the Insurance Law, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
Other service sectors including telecommunications, retailing
business, foreign trade, travel, transportation, accounting, and
legal services are all to be liberalized or further opened through
a gradual process, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
Robert Vastine, president of CSI, said this emphasis on gradual
process was somewhat conservative.
</P>
<P>
Sun said large-scale and abrupt opening could bring financial
turbulence to domestic financial and insurance enterprises that
still bear burdens inherited from the planned economy, and thus
cannot compete on a level playing field with foreign counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Prosecuter Angry about Tyson Rumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Marion County Prosecutor Scott
Newman plans to contact Maryland correctional authorities Monday
to discuss reports that Mike Tyson might be eligible for release
from a Maryland jail as early as this Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a local report, Tyson reached an agreement on
March 5 with Newman to serve additional 60 days in Maryland for
violating his parole in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
"I expect a 60-day jail sentence to be served following the
Maryland sentence," Newman said Friday. But he added if Tyson
behaves in custody and accomplishes education and work credits,
that time can be reduced to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
According to one of Tyson's attorneys, if released Friday,
Tyson would be placed on work release or home detention to serve
out the remainder of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Johnson, who put Tyson into the jail, told Tyson's
attorneys that he will rule on March 26 on a request to reduce
Tyson's one-year Maryland assault sentence to eight months.
</P>
<P>
If the Maryland judge reduces the sentence to eight months, the
jail time could be between three and 30 days.

<HEADLINE> China Launched Second Anti-dumping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Proceedings in China's second
anti-dumping case have been initiated by the Wuhan Iron and Steel
(Group) Co in central Hubei Province, China Daily "Business Weekly
" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Before 1997, the Wuhan company was China's only producer of
sillicon steel.
</P>
<P>
Even after the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group Co in Shanxi
Province also began production of the material in the latter half
of 1997, the market share of the Wuhan Iron and Steel has remained
above 95 percent, which qualifies it to apply to launch an an-
dumping investigation.
</P>
<P>
The applicant claimed that since 1996, cold rolled silicon
steel had been flooding into China at prices 2,000 yuan (241 US
dollars) per ton lower than its normal value, according to
Huangzhong &AMP; Partners, the attorneys for the applicant.
</P>
<P>
Calculations by the applicant's lawyers suggest that the
production cost of the Russian silicon steel, based on the cost of
the various links in the production process, was much higher than
the prices at which it was being sold in China, said He Jinghua, a
lawyer with Huangzhong &AMP; Partners. But he declined to reveal more
details.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the alleged dumping had done considerable
damage to the applicant's production and sales.

<HEADLINE> Business Gears up to Exploit Sino-African Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese business community is
showing a surge of enthusiasm for trade with and investment in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The several seminars on Sino-African trade and investment
recently held in Beijing drawn throngs of business people from
various parts of the country, according to the China Daily
Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
They were eager to learn more about trade and investment
opportunities in Africa, which has remained a largely
underdeveloped market for Chinese business.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 100 Chinese business delegations visited
South Africa, China's biggest trade partner on the continent,
according to Chinese trade officials.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the enthusiasm mainly to encouragement by
the Chinese Government and the need to explore new markets, trade
experts say.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish domestic demand, dwindling Asian markets and
competition on the European and North American markets have also
helped push Africa into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are a lot of risks in doing business in Africa,
the returns on trade and investment are two to three times the
average in other parts of the world," Fan Guijin, a division chief
with the African Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
China needs Africa's abundant natural resources, and China's
consumer goods, machinery and electronic products, and technology
answer the demand of many African countries with their low prices
and sound quality.
</P>
<P>
Although trade between China and Africa has developed rapidly
over the past few years, reaching 5.5 billion U.S. dollars last
year, it only accounts for two percent of Africa's total trade
volume, leaving much room for further development.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila's Growth Target Is Suspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- As the Philippine government
painted a fine picture of the economy's recovery, two world
organizations and one of the country's leading think tanks
forecast the 1999 GDP may fall short of the government's target.
</P>
<P>
The government has projected this year's gross domestic product
(GDP) to grow by 2.6 percent to 3.1 percent, regarding the
recovery of agriculture and industry as crucial factors to this
outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture projected that for the first
semester of 1999 alone, rice output will grow by 47.3 percent and
corn by 102.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth of farm sector will have multiple effects on sectors
of manufacturing and services, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this week, presidential spokesman Jerry
Barican said that the government remains optimistic that its
target growth of GDP for 1999 "is within reach."
</P>
<P>
However, in a recently released report, the World Bank said the
country is unlikely to meet its economic growth target this year.
</P>
<P>
"Without an early resumption of industrial growth, it will be
difficult to record even a modest recovery of 2 percent in 1999,"
the bank said in its 97-page report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is sticking to
a projection that the country's GDP will grow by up to 2.5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation for Economic Freedom, one of the country's
leading think tanks, has also predicted a 2.1 percent GDP growth
rate this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the domestic economy is expected to fall below
the government's target, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest statistics showed that a slump in
manufacturing, which accounts for a fifth of the GDP, has deepened
from last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines registered its strongest export growth
in close to a year in January 1999, its import in January declined
16 percent from the year-earlier month to 2.395 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports of unprocessed raw materials,
semi-processed raw materials and some capital goods could largely
indicate the performance of industry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The tumble of the import showed the activity in the broad
economy remains weak, they said.
</P>
<P>
The lingering Asia financial turmoil, a sluggish market and
even the recent Brazil's debt crisis were considered as
contributors to the fragile economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the side of agriculture, also accounting for a fifth of the
economy, analysts said it is still exposed to many external
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some economists are eyeing an agriculture recovery after last
year's debilitating drought caused by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
But the La Nina weather pattern, which brings torrential rains,
could cloud the government's forecast for strong gain in the
sector, the others said.
</P>
<P>
"If it rains too much, we'll have to say good-bye to the
harvests," said Johnny Noe Ravalo, director of the Bankers
Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Being aware of the risk that a recovery won't take hold and the
fact that natural conditions and external economic factors are not
up to its own expectations, the government set aside fund to
infrastructure construction and continued to lower the interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy aims to prod economic activities and
encourage companies to borrow, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla
urged the Central Bank to let money supply grow more rapidly to
drive down interest rates in an effort to provide an environment
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the IMF projection, Medalla said that if the
country get zero or negative growth rate in the first quarter, the
projection might come true.
</P>
<P>
He explained that if that happens, it will be difficult to
attain the government's whole-year target because it will require
a five-percent growth in the fourth quarter to offset the first
quarter contraction.
</P>
<P>
"But if we grow by 1 percent (in the first quarter), then we
are right," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Debt Servicing Ratio to GDP Highest in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador uses 84 percent of its
gross domestic product (GDP) to repay debt, the biggest proportion
in Latin America, said the Studies and Analysis Center (CEA) on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country, whose debt servicing ratio to GDP is 41 percentage
points above the average of the region, is followed by Bolivia
with 52 percent, Peru with 45 percent, Chile with 38 percent,
Venezuela with 36 percent, Colombia 35 percent, Argentina with 34
percent, Brazil with 29 percent and Uruguay with 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean's foreign debt has grown 617
percent in the last 13 years when it went from 1975's 69 billion
dollars to 1998's 495 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian foreign debt surpasses 16 billion dollars, which
means 3 percent of the Latin American debt, but its median
capability of repayment as a function of the GDP is the highest,
since it allocates 2.115 billion dollars a year for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
This figure represents 41 percent of the state's general budget
and almost half the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The CEA said that the Ecuadorian foreign debt situation may get
more complicated if the fact is taken into account that the
balance of trade had a 957 million dollar deficit last year, and
the level of direct foreign investment in Ecuador hardly amounted
to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CEA recommended to diversify and improve exports, increase
the economic growth, which presently is only one percent, and to
encourage saving.

<HEADLINE> Development Zones Maintain Excellence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Various development zones in
China still excel thanks to superior infrastructure and investment
climate, today's China Daily "Business Weekly" quoted Tan Hanhuai,
secretary-general of the China Association of Development Zones as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 32 state-level development zones attracted over ten billion
U.S. dollars last year in contractual overseas direct investment,
roughly equaling 1997.
</P>
<P>
Actually used overseas investment added up to 4.5 billion
dollars, down 14 percent from a year ago, Tan said, however, it
still accounted for one-tenth of the total investment inflow into
China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), development zones of different levels and
kinds were responsible for nearly 60 percent of overseas direct
investment last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, output by the zones increased by over 15 percent in
the period, the secretary general said. The growth rates of
exports and tax payments also outstripped the national average.
</P>
<P>
However, the processing trade, which constitutes a large
portion of industry in the zones was negatively affected by the
strengthened customs and foreign exchange administrations, Tan
added.

<HEADLINE> Blair Thanks Mandela Over Lockerbie Handover Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Saturday thanked South African President Nelson Mandela for his
efforts in persuading Libya to hand over the two suspects accused
of the 1988 Pan Am airliner bombing over Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Blair's office said Mandela had confirmed in
a telephone call with Blair on Saturday that Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi will hand over the two suspects on or before April 6.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister spoke to Nelson Mandela, who is now back in
South Africa, at about 1830 GMT, and President Mandela told him
that Gaddafi had agreed to hand over suspects on or before April
6," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair welcomed the news and told Mandela he was very grateful
for his work towards the agreement, she said.
</P>
<P>
Libya would hand over the two suspects to be tried in a
Scottish court sitting in Holland, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also told Blair that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
should start liaison with the Libyan government on the transfer
details, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mandela announced in Tripoli that Libya intended to
surrender the two men suspected of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The bomb of the Pan Am airliner in December 1988 over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie killed 270 people in the air and on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain accuse that they have convincing
evidence that the two Libyan suspects planted the bomb.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Lift Kenyan Textiles Exports Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana and Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho said here Saturday that
the Clinton administration has promised to negotiate for the
removal of the quotas on imports of Kenya's textile products.
</P>
<P>
Returning from Washington, the two ministers revealed that
although the textile industry is not mentioned in the draft
African Growth and Opportunities Bill, to be tabled in U.S.
Congress soon, they hoped the quotas would be scrapped when the
bill is passed.
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Kamotho said the Kenyan textile industry could
not perform well after the imposition of quotas on Kenya, adding
that the country's production is too small to jeopardize the
American market.
</P>
<P>
A consensus on the establishment of ties to foster trade and
economic growth between the United States and Africa has been
reached after a two- day conference between officials from the
U.S. and 46 African countries in Washington recently, according to
the ministers.
</P>
<P>
They said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had pledged to
sponsor a motion during the G7 meeting for debt relief to the most
indebted countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers claimed that the criteria being used
for debt relief should be revised.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries have sacrificed a great deal to repay their
loans and move from the Most Indebted class. The developed world
could be aiming to give relief to countries that have mismanaged
donor funds," Godana said.
