<HEADLINE> Atlanta Woman Picks Final Four  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Here's what Kristin Helgeson gets for four lucky
guesses: high-fives from women for one-upping the guys and marriage
proposals from men who love basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Atlanta graphics designer was the only person
out of 590,000 to predict each of the Final Four teams in a contest
by ESPN.com. She says she's not a huge sports fan and prefers
football and hockey to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When the Web site reported her feat -- and posted a link to her
e-mail address -- Helgeson received hundreds of messages. Some
wanted help picking stocks or lottery numbers. One said, ''You're a
goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a few where the subject says, 'Will you marry me?'
Some ask for a picture. ... A few women have written: 'Who says
women don't know anything about basketball? You show em! Way to go,
girl!''' Helgeson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if Helgeson will get any prize for
correctly picking the four teams since she did not accurately
predict the championship matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeson entered the contest because five guys in her office
were doing it. She rushed through her picks before leaving the
country for two weeks. She didn't watch any tournament games until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeson says, ''Mostly, people are just curious: 'It's killing
me. How did you do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   She picked Florida because she's an alumna. Wisconsin was where
her father went to school. She has a friend who went to North
Carolina. She picked Michigan State out of sympathy, after watching
them play Florida in the Citrus Bowl. The Spartans won 37-34.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we were bad sports against them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Man Ends Bid To Row Across Pacific  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A lone French oarsman abandoned
his attempt Monday to row across the Pacific Ocean after doctors
sent to give him medical supplies found traces of gangrene in both
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Le Guen, who set off Feb. 3 from New Zealand's capital,
Wellington, on his 5,580 mile voyage, aiming for Cape Horn, Chile,
was taken on board a container ship with just one-third of his trip
completed, his agent Martin Pinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Le Guen, 52, was found by doctors to be suffering septicemia, or
blood poisoning, and had the beginnings of gangrene in his feet. He
was delirious and too tired to speak, Pinder said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was concerned on Friday when he was unable to speak for any
length of time,'' Pinder said. ''Jo is a very determined person. He
had to decide when he would quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he set off, Le Guen acknowledged the mammoth task ahead
of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I can do the job,'' he said before climbing into his
technology-packed nine-yard black craft. ''I'll do my best to take
care of myself, but who knows -- the South Pacific is bigger than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   His boat, called ''keep it blue,'' boasted electric equipment
powered by batteries charged by solar panels and two windmills on
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   As well as high-tech navigation and communications equipment, Le
Guen carried three sets of 9-foot oars, dried food for the duration
of the journey, fresh water and two water purifiers capable of
extracting salt from sea water. Le Guen had estimated it would take
three-and-a-half months of rowing to reach his destination.
</P>
<P>
   No stranger to ocean crossings, the father of five has twice
rowed the Atlantic. On one trip he went solo and on the other he
was in a two-man team.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar remained lower against the yen
Monday morning despite dollar-buying intervention by Japan's
central bank. Tokyo stocks rose at the start of Japan's new fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.19 yen in late morning, down 0.09 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of
102.64 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 208.21
points, or 1.02 percent, to 20,545.53 at the end of the morning
session. On Friday, the average closed down 104.18 points, or 0.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher compared with its
New York level on Friday after Bank of Japan conducted yen-selling
to buy the greenback during early Tokyo market on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank action came on the heels of the dollar's slip
as low as 102.82 yen early in Tokyo trading, but the intervention
failed to push the dollar above its level late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming Monday's intervention, Zembei Mizoguchi, head of
international bureau with Japan's Finance Ministry, told reporters:
''Proper action was taken ... we're watching markets closely and
will take appropriate steps as needed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such dollar-supporting intervention by the
Bank of Japan since the beginning of this year, with the last one
conducted on March 15 in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the central bank's intervention was not immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have said the yen's rapid appreciation
against the dollar could hurt the nation's nascent economic
recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and thus
less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.42 yen, down
from 100.76 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started Monday nearly
unchanged from Friday's closing level, but prices later moved
higher as investors welcomed the Bank of Japan's intervention in
the currency market.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said expectations remain strong that public and pension
funds, as well as brokerage dealers, will join individual investors
and investment trusts for active purchasing of Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, news that Japan's Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was
hospitalized Sunday and remains in intensive care had a limited
stock market impact, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Mild improvements shown by the Bank of Japan's key ''tankan''
quarterly survey of business confidence were already largely
factored in, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The tankan showed that business confidence at major
manufacturing companies improved for the fifth consecutive quarter,
reflecting growing faith the country is pulling out of its lengthy
economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 8.91 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,714.85. The
TOPIX closed down 6.51 points, or 0.38 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7750 percent, unchanged from Friday's finish. Its price
remained unchanged at 101.07.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Dobbertin Orbiter turns bitter between couple who createdit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POMPEY, N.Y. (AP) -- Seven years ago, Rick and Karen Dobbertin
were virtually inseparable, cramped inside their homemade
amphibious craft as they attempted to circumnavigate the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Dobbertin Surface Orbiter, which looks like a rocketship on
wheels, once transported Rick and Karen Dobbertin to 28 countries
and through the Panama Canal during Project Earth Trek.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's landed them in court.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a messy divorce, they're fighting over the
19,000-pound vehicle, which sits in a barn here just south of
Syracuse. The Dobbertins both say they want to sell the Orbiter and
split the profits, as they agreed when they divorced in 1998. But
each says the other has been uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves charges of thwarted attempts by Rick and a
potential buyer to see the craft, deceit, improper storage fees and
business deals gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the fight took another turn, as Rick, armed with a
court order signed two weeks ago by State Supreme Court Justice
Charles Major, drove to Pompey to try to move the Orbiter from the
storage barn to a car dealer in Syracuse, a neutral site where the
Orbiter was to be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   But Loren Benedict, a friend of Karen's and former manager of
Earth Trek, on Thursday filed a storage lien at the Onondaga County
Clerk's Office. Benedict, who owns the barn, contends Rick and
Karen must pay $9,000 in storage fees before moving the Orbiter
out.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's deputy who escorted Rick to the barn Saturday
morning told him he could not pick up the Orbiter and would have to
sort it all out with officials on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we never had kids because I've spent the past 16
months and $5,000 in attorneys' fees just trying to get visitation
rights to a car,'' Rick said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've learned my lesson,'' Karen said. ''I'll never, ever,
ever, ever get married again.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the couple say it's been painful to watch them tear
each other apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a real crying shame it's come to this and
continues,'' Ron Yehle said. ''I told Rick two years ago, you
should have backed the Orbiter out of the garage and set fire to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orbiter - a stainless steel milk tanker that Rick spent more
than 14,000 hours converting into an amphibious home on wheels - is
32.5 feet long. The Dobbertins didn't circle the globe in it, but
the Orbiter did carry them over 27,300 land miles and 3,000 ocean
miles, including 38 states.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, the Orbiter sat in or next to the barn.
Rick, an industrial mechanic, contends that after he moved out of
the barn in 1998 Karen and Benedict made it extremely difficult for
him to gain access to the Orbiter so he could market or sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Karen, a decorating designer who lives at the barn, said Rick
has fabricated charges that she was uncooperative because he's
angry that she divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer she told Rick he needs a police escort to look at
the Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the police would like to sit around for four or
five hours while I check it over,'' Rick said in a letter to his
lawyer. ''It would also be rather difficult to explain to a
potential buyer why I needed a police escort to just show the
Orbiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen said she was concerned about his temper and whether he
might damage it. ''He's volatile and has a really short fuse,'' she
said. ''I have always been very fearful of this man. He's very
angry at me because I divorced him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Rick arranged to have the Orbiter stored at the car
dealer, which would use it in ad campaigns and provide free
storage. Karen vetoed the move. She said storing it outdoors was
too risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Orbiter, which could sell for more than $100,000, is the
only thing of value remaining from their marriage, and Karen wants
to protect that investment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rick said Benedict is trying to get back at him for
suing Benedict last year in a dispute over who should pay for taxes
and repairs that occurred when Rick also was living at the barn.
Benedict won that case in small-claims court.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit seeking a court order to compel Karen to turn
over the Orbiter, Rick said she and Benedict ''are simply utilizing
the demand for storage expenses to intimidate, frustrate and
dissuade'' Rick from his efforts to promote and sell the Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's known there were storage fees involved,'' said Benedict,
who acknowledged there's no written contract. ''You're not going to
store this in someone's closet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Critter Gitters,'' a weekly syndicated educational TV series
targeting kids, last year wanted to feature the Orbiter in at least
two episodes, said spokesman Eric Fuhrman. The program, which is
shown on 111 stations around the country, would have put in a plug
for the Orbiter in the credits.
</P>
<P>
   Karen said the show was only going to be in town for a few
hours, and she couldn't arrange her schedule to accommodate it.
Rick accused Karen of wasting huge exposure for the Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had had access to the Orbiter ... 'Critter Gitters' would
have seen it,'' Rick said. ''I'd break my neck to publicize it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I make myself available all the time,'' Karen said. ''Believe
me, I want nothing more than to see this thing go down the road in
somebody else's hands.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Republican Party may be stumbling
into losing the U.S. Senate election to Hillary Rodham Clinton,
according to a congressman who says he's willing to step in and
save the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm prepared to say is we're less likely to win relative
to myself or maybe even another candidate who can bring the party
together,'' Rep. Rick Lazio said on ABC-TV's ''This Week'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though stopping short of saying Giuliani couldn't win, Lazio
said ''we are in the process of potentially blowing the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County representative said he could still replace
Giuliani as the Republican candidate if state GOP leaders -- and
particularly Gov. George Pataki -- give him the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, GOP heads didn't seem to be budging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe the governor or I have changed in our support
of Rudy Giuliani,'' state Republican Committee Chairman William
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said the governor's support
for Giuliani remained steadfast and that Pataki ''looks forward to
beating Hillary Clinton in November.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is yet another sign of the deep concern that Republicans
across the state have about Rudy Giuliani's ability to be effective
in the Senate,'' said Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, one month before the state Republican Convention in
Buffalo, said Pataki has to rethink his support of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to say, 'Listen, we've got some serious problems
here. Hillary Rodham Clinton's numbers are moving up. More
importantly the mayor's numbers are collapsing,''' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has recently been sharply criticized for comments and
his release of court-sealed juvenile court records of Patrick
Dorismond in the black man's fatal shooting by New York City
police.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the close race between Giuliani and Clinton is
growing tighter after Giuliani's support of police in the Dorismond
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said Giuliani apparently doesn't seek, and won't get,
Conservative party backing. No Republican has won statewide office
without Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the political leadership and establishment in New York, I
think, ought to be saying is, 'Hey, let's look to find a candidate
that can bring the party together, that can attract soft Democrats
and independents, present a better, more positive, more inclusive
message for Republicans and beat Hillary Clinton,'' Lazio said. He
has put his Senate campaign on hold at Pataki's request to allow
Republicans to focus on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bombshell,'' said former Republican speechwriter Peggy
Noonan on CNN's ''Late Edition'' of Lazio's comments. ''I think
that's a huge announcement,'' said the author of ''The Case Against
Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there is no reason Giuliani shouldn't have to work for
the GOP nomination. But Noonan emphasized that the first lady has
no business running for the Senate seat in New York, where she has
been a resident for just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   A former ally of Giuliani whom the mayor had crossed party lines
to endorse, ex-Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Clinton remains a strong and
legitimate candidate on the strength of her ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's going to win because New Yorkers will want her,'' said
Cuomo, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised $19 million for the race to Clinton's $12
million. Lazio raised about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's camp Sunday refused comment.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 117, Warriors 113  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Sam Cassell scored 31 points and Ray
Allen had 27 as the Milwaukee Bucks shook off their worst loss of
the season to beat the Golden State Warriors 117-113 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks, coming off Saturday night's embarrassing 113-79 loss
at Portland, needed the win to stay close to Detroit and Orlando in
a tight race for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell was 15-of-16 from the free-throw line, including 3-of-4
in the final 33 seconds to help fend off the Warriors, who lost
their ninth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson and Tim Thomas each added 16 points for the Bucks
and Darvin Ham had 13. Ervin Johnson had 14 rebounds, grabbing
Mookie Blaylock's missed 3-point try in the closing seconds for his
final one.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes' 32 points led Golden State, which missed a chance
to complete its first season sweep of the Bucks since 1993-94.
Blaylock added 24 points and Jason Caffey had 19.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 63-54 at halftime, the Warriors put together an 8-2
burst capped by Blaylock's 3-pointer to pull to 77-72 late in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks answered with their own run, fueled by Thomas, who hit
a 3-pointer and drove in for a pair of dunks during a 13-4 burst
that put Milwaukee back in front 90-74.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State came back to score 10 straight points, including a
driving layup by Hughes on the first play of the fourth quarter
pulling the Warriors within 90-84.
</P>
<P>
   Ham converted a 3-point play and Johnson hit a short baseline
jumper to slow the Warriors' momentum, and after Golden State
closed to within five, Allen converted a 3-pointer with 7:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks still had to withstand a closing rush by the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock connected on a 3-pointer and Caffey put back a missed
free throw for another basket as Golden State closed to 104-103
with 3:30 remaining. Cassell answered with a jumper and Robinson
had a putback as part of an 8-3 burst putting Milwaukee up 112-106
with 1:42 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State scored the next four points, but Johnson made a
pair of free throws. After Hughes missed a running jumper, Johnson
was fouled and missed both free throws but Ham came down with a
huge rebound and dished off to Cassell, who was fouled and made
both free throws with 33 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock drained a 3-pointer to bring the Warriors back within
three and Cassell was fouled. He missed the first, his only misfire
all day from the free throw line, but made the second.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State went down court but Blaylock put up an air ball
from 3-point range and Johnson grabbed it, allowing the Bucks to
run the final few seconds off the clock.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cassell's 15 free throws was a Warriors' opponent season
high. ... Robinson registered a season-high seven assists. ...
Hughes has scored 30-plus points four times for the Warriors. ...
Milwaukee lost its earlier matchup this season with the Warriors
91-86.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 95, SuperSonics 82  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Steve Smith scored 21 points and Scottie
Pippen had 18 as the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away to defeat
the Seattle SuperSonics 95-82 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells added 16 points and hit two big fourth-quarter
3-pointers for the Blazers, who won all four games against the
Sonics this season to sweep them for the first time since 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton had 21 points and 11 assists, and Rashard Lewis
added 18 points for the Sonics, who fell 1{ games behind Sacramento
for the No. 7 spot in the Western Conference playoff race. With
nine games left, Seattle is facing a first-round series against the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Portland had to spread around the offense without leading scorer
Rasheed Wallace, who set an NBA record for technical fouls in a
season when he was ejected early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was issued two technicals in succession by referee Joey
Crawford with 10:37 left in the quarter, resulting in Wallace's
sixth ejection of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's 34 technicals break the mark of 32 held by Charles
Barkley and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   A layup by Payton cut Portland's lead to 67-63 early in the
fourth quarter, but Brian Grant hit a short jumper and Wells made a
3-pointer for a 72-63 lead. Two minutes later, Wells hit another 3
to make it 79-67 with 8:07 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle couldn't get closer than eight the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Detlef Schrempf added 16 points and eight rebounds for the
Blazers, and Damon Stoudamire had eight points, six rebounds and
six assists.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker scored 16 points for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led by two at halftime and used an 11-2 run to get
some breathing room. A fierce two-handed slam by Jermaine O'Neal on
a long lob pass from Smith gave Portland a 62-49 lead, but the
Blazers then went over 5 minutes without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Maxwell hit 3-pointers to begin and end a 12-3 spurt, and
in between the Sonics hit five straight free throws after starting
8-for-17. That helped Seattle cut the lead to 67-61 after three.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers started the game by missing 14 of their first 17
shots, and the Sonics got a few easy baskets off long rebounds. A
3-pointer by Lewis capped a 10-0 run and put Seattle ahead 16-10
before the Blazers came back to take a 19-18 lead entering the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers went up by seven on a drive by Stoudamire with 3:24
left in the period, but the Sonics rallied to get within 45-43 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis was at the arena for the
first time since going on the injured list March 24 with a sprained
right foot. He said he hopes to resume practicing next week, but
the team may rest him until the playoffs. ... Baker has hit double
figures in rebounds only twice in his last 29 games. ... Seattle
had 13 offensive rebounds, but none in the second half. ...
Portland's reserves, led by Wells and Schrempf, outscored Seattle's
43-29. In the four games between the teams, the Blazers had a
141-101 lead in that department.

<HEADLINE> Early Shooting Woes Cost Tennessee  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With its top perimeter threat sidelined by
an injury, Tennessee struggled early and never recovered against
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols missed 12 of their first 13 shots and 19-of-21 as
UConn won the NCAA championship with a 71-52 victory Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee sorely missed Kristen Clement's perimeter shooting.
She sprained her right ankle during a shootaround Sunday morning
and spent most of the night standing and rooting for her teammates
along Tennessee's bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ace is a starter, and to lose a starter on game day hurts,''
teammate Kara Lawson said of Clement. ''We kept our focus. We
thought we can win the game without her. I don't think we responded
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's semifinal victory over Rutgers, Clement scored eight
of the team's first 10 points -- including a pair of 3-pointers -- in
the first six minutes. It took the Lady Vols 12{ minutes to get
their eighth point against the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you play a team as aggressive and physical as UConn, you
have to have great guard play,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.
''We took some quick shots. We played in a panic and didn't have
our composure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a Philadelphia-area native and the team's emotional
leader, started every game for Tennessee this season before Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would think when you're playing for a national
championship, you would come out fired up,'' Clement said. ''They
outhustled us and we played young. Coach turned to me and asked
what could we do. I said, 'Coach, you can't teach heart.' We played
scared, with no emotion. Hopefully, they'll learn from this.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's starting guards combined for 14 points on 6-of-18
shooting, including Lawson who was 3-of-13 for six points. Senior
Kyra Elzy started in place of Clement and held Sue Bird to four
points.
</P>
<P>
   But Elzy, who scored eight points, could not provide the
offensive lift Tennessee needed early.
</P>
<P>
   ''We relied heavily on Ace,'' Summitt said. ''She's our best
perimeter defender and she greatly influences the attitude and
intensity of the team. Would it have changed the outcome? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-American tandem of Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall
also had a difficult time against a tenacious UConn defense.
Catchings, the AP player of the year, did not score her first
basket until 3:55 remained in the first half. By that time, the
Lady Vols trailed 25-12.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings finished with 16 points, including 11 in the second
half when the outcome had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got all the turnovers, made all the hustle plays and
converted,'' Catchings said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee committed 26 turnovers, a championship game record.
Kelly Schumacher had nine blocks, also a tournament record.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, who scored six points on 1-of-11 shooting, made her
first shot 6:51 into the second half. The Lady Vols trailed by 21
at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the time I drove the key, I got rejected,'' Randall
said. ''It was a huge factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee shot just 5-of-27 (19 percent) in the first half and
16-of-51 overall (31 percent). The Lady Vols trailed 32-19 at
halftime, UConn opened with the second half with an 8-0 run and led
by double digits the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were too deep,'' Summitt said. ''They rotated a lot of
bodies on Catchings and had a lot of fouls to use on her. Our
guards were not strong enough to handle the pressure the defense
applied.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Fan: 'It Was Extremely Ugly'  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- As the minutes ticked down Sunday night,
a sports bar crowd of Tennessee students chanted one last time:
''It's great ... to be ... a Tennessee Vol.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fading spirit couldn't carry to Philadelphia, where
Tennessee's Lady Vols fell short in their bid for a seventh NCAA
title with a 71-52 loss to rival Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was extremely ugly,'' Brooke Huffman, 19, said of the game
that UConn led from the start. ''It was hard to see the team play
like this when you know they could play so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rain came down outside Mike &AMP; Willy's Sports Cafe, Dwayne
Hall and a table of friends gave an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The officiating was terrible. It was eight against five, is
the way I see it,'' Hall said, counting the three officials and the
Huskies on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ain't playing Tennessee basketball. But we ain't getting
the calls, either.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is sad,'' said Laura Lauter, a UT soccer player.
''These girls played with their hearts every game. They train hard.
And then to come out and have a game like this, I think it is very
tough for them.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much for Tennessee fans to cheer about through much
of the game. Above a low din in the sports bar, the ESPN announcers
called the rout from more than 50 television sets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we are going to be able to pull this one out,''
Cara Biehn said with 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was especially hard because of Tennessee's rivalry with
UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate the whole (UConn) team because they are our nemesis,''
Huffman said. ''They are the team that we have to beat to prove we
are No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some fans' hearts, coach Pat Summitt's players still are.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love our Lady Vols,'' read a sign scribbled on a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think they had a great year,'' said Biehn.
</P>
<P>
   And there's always next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the starters are coming back,'' Huffman said. ''So it
should be good.''

<HEADLINE> Acting Japanese Prime Minister Named  </HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- A top ruling party figure took over as
Japan's acting premier Monday after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
suffered a stroke and was hospitalized in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, 62, was admitted at Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital
early Sunday after complaining of fatigue and remained under
intensive treatment Monday, Chief Cabinet secretary Mikio Aoki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, a close confidant of Obuchi, said he has assumed the role
of acting prime minister because it was not likely Obuchi would be
able to resume his duties soon.
</P>
<P>
   The government's handling of the crisis quickly came under fire.
It took nearly a day for an official announcement of Obuchi's
hospitalization, and still on Monday very little information was
available on how severe his condition was.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki told a news conference Monday that Obuchi had suffered a
stroke and that his condition had deteriorated since Sunday, but
said he did not know whether the prime minister was conscious or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Because Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party remains firmly in
control, the change was not expected to have any immediate impact
on policy issues -- particularly the government's efforts to
strengthen Japan's gradual recovery from its long economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were raised that Obushi's illness could effect Japan's
ability to host the G-8 summit of the world's leading
industrialized countries this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, 65, said Obuchi asked him to take over as acting premier
when he visited him in hospital Sunday afternoon. The step was
taken after Aoki and other top ruling party officials met through
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki has long worked as a quiet political insider, holding
several top posts within the Liberal Democratic Party. Previously
deputy finance minister, he was named chief Cabinet secretary last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to many, however, was the government's failure
to disclose the crisis sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why did they hide the crisis?'' said a headline in the Asahi,
one of Japan's major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki's initially announced Obuchi's hospitalization late Sunday,
in a statement that lasted only four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Aoki offered few further details. He said no
announcement was made earlier because officials did not know how
serious Obuchi's condition was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we acted with all due caution,'' he said. ''When I
saw him (Sunday afternoon) he was calm and able to speak. His
condition got worse after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters traveling with him during a fund-raising
trip on the West Coast, President Clinton said Sunday ''the
thoughts and prayers of the American people'' are with Obuchi, who
he said ''has been a good friend to me personally, he's been a good
friend of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi had been under intense pressure over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   He has had to deal with a major volcanic eruption in northern
Japan and turmoil in his ruling coalition. Last weekend, he
traveled to southern Japan to inspect preparations for the G-8
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has a chronic heart condition, but it was not known if
that was related to his current hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Although Obuchi's ruling coalition split up on Saturday, his
Liberal Democratic Party remains the strongest in Parliament, and
its hold on power is not in question.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998, and surprised many
analysts with his ability to get his policies through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year, he jump-started the economy with a program of
massive spending, consolidated his party's dominant position in
Parliament and championed legislation strengthening Japan's
regional security role and giving official status to the Rising Sun
flag.
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes have sagged recently, however, with polls finding
that support for his Cabinet is declining as Japan's economy
struggles to recover.

<HEADLINE> Advocates of universal health care rally for alternatives tomanaged care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A group of doctors is calling for
publically-financed health care, saying the current system is
motivated by profit, not the welfare of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 health care professionals and others took part in a
teach-in and rally Saturday that was part of a nationwide effort by
the groups Physicians Who Care and the National Coalition of Mental
Health Professionals and Consumers Inc. Demonstrators gathered at
42 locations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are saying that managed care has to stop, that human beings
are not a commodity and that health care can't be commodified,''
said Justine McCabe of New Milford.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, a clinical psychologist and her husband, Dr. John
Battista, proposed a bill last year calling for publicly financed
and administered universal health care in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one alternative to the HMOs, and that is
universal health care for all,'' said Naomi Shaiken, chairwoman of
Connecticut Call to Action. ''Old-style medicine, as imperfect as
it was, treated everyone. No one was left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who attended Rescue Health Care Day at the Connecticut
Mental Health Center also criticized a proposal to change Medicare
from a federally administered program to a voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Marmor, professor of public policy and management at
the Yale University School of Management, said medical care in the
last decade has undergone a striking, unexpected change.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton came into office, Marmor said, 37 million
Americans were without medical coverage. Now there are 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Change without choice is the way I would diagnose the 1990s,''
Marmor said. ''Many, although not all, of those changes were ones
that have adversely affected patients, doctors, nurses'' and others
involved in health care.
</P>
<P>
   John Ringwald, co-founder of the Connecticut Psychotherapists'
Guild, said managed care has resulted in a ''major shift of health
care dollars away from clinics, hospitals and health care service
providers into exorbitant executive salaries, advertising,
corporate profits and the bureaucracies that sustain them.''

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Treasurer Corruption, Conn Bjt, 480  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- George Gomes, a former assistant state
treasurer and key associate of former state Treasurer Paul J.
Silvester, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court today, The
Hartford Courant reported.
</P>
<P>
   Citing sources it did not identify, The Courant reported that
Gomes has been cooperating secretly with federal prosecutors
investigating corruption during Silvester's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Stephen C. Robinson, whose
office is handling the case, would not comment; nor would Gomes'
lawyer-- H. James Pickerstein, a former assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes could not be reached for comment. A message was left at
his Middlebury home by The Associated Press. He has said repeatedly
that he will not comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, Silvester, his brother, and brother-in-law pleaded
guilty to federal charges stemming from a multi-million-dollar
racketeering and kickback conspiracy from mid-1997 to January 1999.
Since that time, Gomes' name has come up twice.
</P>
<P>
   Silvester, his brother Mark, and brother-in-law Peter Hirschl
were scheduled originally to be sentenced on March 20, but they
were rescheduled for June 19 to allow investigators more time to
bring charges, potentially, against additional defendants. The
three have agreed to testify against others.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least last summer, federal investigators have been
investigating Gomes' hiring in early 1999 as a lobbyist with the
New London law firm of Glenn T. Carberry, a former Republican
congressional candidate with close political ties to Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes worked as assistant treasurer until Silvester lost the
1998 election and left office, with his appointees, on Jan. 6,
1999. Silvester tried to find jobs for a number of his displaced
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his term, Silvester gave a $27.5-million state pension
deal to Philadelphia-based Keystone Venture Capital Management Co.,
which Carberry had represented in talks with Silvester's office.
Keystone agreed to make payments totaling $275,000-- 1 percent of
the investment-- to Carberry's firm for lobbying services through
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carberry denies any relation between Silvester's approving the
Keystone deal and his firm's hiring Gomes. Gomes has left the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gomes' name also came up last fall by J. Vincent Chase, the man
Rowland picked to become state treasurer in mid-1997 and then
dumped a few days later in favor of Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that Gomes approached him with the idea of using the
treasurer's office as a 1998 campaign fund-raising machine for
Rowland and the state Republican Party. Chase thought his refusal
to go along with that idea contributed to his not becoming
treasurer. Rowland denied the charge.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Names First Radcliffe Dean  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A leading historian of the Civil War and
the American South will lead the institute created by last fall's
merger of Radcliffe College with Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Gilpin Faust, a history professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, will become the first dean of the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study at Harvard, Harvard President Neil Rudenstine
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The institute was created by the October merger, which ended the
onetime women's school as a separate college after 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars pursue advanced work in academics, professions and
creative arts at the institute, which maintains a strong commitment
to the study of women, gender and society.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply honored to have been chosen for what seems to be
the most exciting job in higher education,'' Faust said. ''The
institute will build upon Radcliffe's twin traditions of academic
excellence and commitment to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Faust will continue teaching at University of Pennsylvania
through the fall semester and will take over as dean on Jan. 1.
Mary Maples Dunn, former president of Smith College, has served as
acting dean since the merger.

Castro: Elian's Dad May Travel to U.S.

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Elian Gonzalez's father was
willing to travel alone to the United States Monday morning if U.S. officials
promise to turn over the boy to him and let them return to Cuba right away.
Failing that, visas would be sought for father Juan Miguel Gonzalez and an
entourage of 27 others to leave for the United States as early as Tuesday to try
to get Elian back, Castro said Sunday during a live appearance on national
television. Last week, Castro said Gonzalez was willing to travel to the United
States and wait out the results of an appeal for custody by their Miami
relatives in federal appellate court, if the U.S. government gave him custody of
Elian in the meantime.

<HEADLINE> UConn Team Ranks Among the Best  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tennessee's 1998 team is widely considered
the best ever. Pat Summitt, who coached the Lady Vols to a 39-0
record and the national championship that year, thinks Connecticut
compares favorably to her '98 team.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great team,'' Summitt said after UConn beat
Tennessee 71-52 in the NCAA championship game Sunday night.
''There's no question about it. They were awesome. It's similar in
terms of up-and-down tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that team relied more on full court pressure than this
team had to rely on it -- not that they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn smothered Tennessee with its aggressive and physical play
on defense and the Lady Vols struggled with their shooting. The
loss of Kristen Clement, Tennessee's main perimeter threat and top
defensive player didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't lose a player like that and not be hurt when you
have a situation where our bench is not nearly as deep as their
bench.''

   FINAL FOUR FITS PHILLY: The NCAA women's basketball tournament
committee gambled five years ago when it selected Philadelphia for
the Final Four. The gamble paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The event drew more reporters -- 669 -- than any previous women's
Final Four. The crowd of 20,060 at Friday's semifinal games was the
second-best for a national semifinal and was the largest crowd to
ever witness a college basketball, men's or women's in
Pennsylvania. Sunday night's championship between top-ranked
Connecticut and No. 2 Tennessee was expected to be the most-watched
women's game in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had not been in a really big city,'' said Linda Bruno, the
Atlantic 10 commissioner who chaired the tournament committee in
1995. ''This is the way I wanted it to happen. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The event has not only been great for Philadelphia, but for the
women's game overall. UConn coach Geno Auriemma believes more fans
will be attracted to the sport after watching the final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people would watch the game, maybe that have one set
of impressions, one bias toward the game and, say, 'Here is what I
think women's basketball is like,''' Auriemma said. ''and maybe by
tuning into the game, will see something that will spur a different
thought. Like, 'Wow, I didn't know what it's like.' Maybe people
will stop comparing it to the men's game and be able to see it on
its own, for its own value.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   UCONN-TENNESSEE III: Auriemma was reluctant to schedule
Tennessee twice during the regular season. Now the UConn coach is
glad he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought why do we need to do this. Why put ourselves in a
situation that limits the variety in our schedule?'' Auriemma said.
''The benefits far outweigh any negatives. We're going to do it
again next year. And where it goes beyond that, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Clement committed to Tennessee during her junior year
at Cardinal O'Hara High School in suburban Philadelphia and hasn't
looked back. ''I'm glad I followed my heart,'' said Clement, who
chose Tennessee over Connecticut. . . Veteran referee Dennis DeMayo
added to the Final Four's heavy Philly flavor. DeMayo, a resident
of nearby Bensalem, worked his first title game Sunday. . . The
most clever sign in the crowd was held by a UConn fan. It read:
''Somebody has to lose: Any Volunteers?''. . . Auriemma was very
animated along the sidelines during the first half Sunday. On two
occasions, associate head coach Chris Dailey had to pull Auriemma
away from the officials.

<HEADLINE> Drug seizures suggest use of the psychedelic ecstasy becomingepidemic  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawyer arriving from Paris is stopped at
Kennedy Airport for a routine customs inspection. Discovered in the
false bottom of his bag are 21,000 ecstasy pills that authorities
say were ordered by a Greenwich Village tavern owner.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli living in a middle-class part of Queens is overheard
on a wiretap arranging illicit deliveries of ecstasy to Manhattan
hotels. Investigators seize 300,000 pills worth $7.5 million and
make 32 arrests; they say he's part of an international ecstasy
ring.
</P>
<P>
   A young ultra-Orthodox Jew, about to be sentenced in Brooklyn,
laments accepting a free flight to Belgium in exchange for
returning with luggage laden with a designer drug -- again, ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I shamed my family and my community with what I did,'' the
young first-time offender, Joel Gluck, told the judge before being
put under house arrest for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities cite these recent cases and others as proof that New
York City has become the epicenter of a national boom in illegal
imports of ecstasy, the synthetic ''psychedelic amphetamine'' also
known as MDMA, or simply ''E.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizures of the innocent-looking tablets -- some are embossed
with smiley faces, shamrocks or Playboy bunny ears -- have
multiplied like rabbits. U.S. Customs reports it confiscated 3.5
million pills throughout the country in fiscal 1999, compared to
750,000 in 1998; the total has already reached 4 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City area alone, the totals were 1.3 million
pills in 1999, up from 48,400 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have discovered ecstasy stashed in airmailed packages,
and in imported cars and antique furniture. But mainly, it's
smuggled in luggage carried by couriers from Europe, where pills
are produced for less than a dollar for sale in a youthful and
expanding U.S. market for up to $40 a piece, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar profit potential has attracted an
eclectic collection of traffickers working in varied locales,
evidenced by the Feb. 24 arrest of notorious mob turncoat Salvatore
''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano for his alleged role in an ecstasy ring
in Phoenix, and the seizure of 30,000 pills carried by an air
traveler to Cincinnati three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Israeli and Russian organized crime groups -- and
even some members of Brooklyn's conservative Jewish communities --
are hooked on dealing ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck, 19, was one of several young Hasidic men recruited by an
Amsterdam-based ring which believed their traditional black hats,
dark suits and sidecurls would deflect suspicion. They were given
the trips to Europe and cash in exchange for smuggling back
millions of pills.
</P>
<P>
   In another Brooklyn case, federal authorities charged a Jewish
businessman and four others in January with conspiring to sell
180,000 ecstasy pills for about $1.5 million to an FBI informant,
then laundering illicit proceeds through a religious school.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have responded to the ecstasy explosion with a
flurry of enforcement measures and war-on-drugs rhetoric
reminiscent of the crack cocaine scare of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only with a concerted global law enforcement offensive can we
conquer this threat,'' the acting head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Donnie Marshall, declared last month after
authorities shut down an East Coast ring selling 100,000 pills a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly has used the agency's Web
site, www.customs.gov, to warn parents that ecstasy abuse -- once
confined to urban dance parties known as ''raves'' -- has become a
''full-fledged epidemic'' spreading into suburbia and other
sheltered communities.
</P>
<P>
   In a dispatch earlier this month, Kelly announced Customs was
forming an ecstasy task force and training 13 dogs to sniff out the
drug at major airports and border crossings. The commissioner and
others have also repeatedly cited medical evidence that ecstasy
causes severe dehydration, dizziness and headaches or, with
prolonged use, depression, memory loss and even permanent brain
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a notion that ecstasy makes you feel good, that
there's no downside,'' Kelly said in an interview. ''But there's
plenty of horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   A lucrative black-market for any illegal drug can breed
violence, Kelly said. He recalled one recent investigation in Los
Angeles where agents found a body in the trunk of a car left at the
airport by suspected ecstasy smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA classifies ecstasy as a ''Schedule 1'' narcotic, putting
it in the same category as LSD and heroin. As with those drugs,
federal defendants face stiff penalties. For instance, the
suppliers in the Hasidic courier case face up to 20 years in prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Those penalties, critics charge, are too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a drastic difference between ecstasy and crack cocaine
or heroin, but the (sentencing) guidelines don't appreciate that
difference,'' said Joseph Tacopina, a defense attorney representing
a Brooklyn real estate owner in another federal ecstasy conspiracy
case.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-ecstasy Web sites argue the drug bears no real resemblance
to hard-core narcotics. They note both the absence of widespread
gunplay, turf wars, overdoses and physical addiction associated
with the cocaine and heroin trade, and ecstasy's history of use by
some therapists to enhance psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy enthusiasts describe a euphoric four-hour high in which
inhibitions evaporate. One Web site recommends ''Nice things to do
on E,'' including having someone wash your hair, rolling naked in
leaves or coating your body with vapor rub.
</P>
<P>
   One student at Bard College, a small liberal arts school north
of New York City, says ecstasy is readily available through a
network of fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been the one drug where there's been the steadiest supply
this semester,'' the student, who asked that his name not be used,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said he takes a $25 ''hit'' of ecstasy before going to small
weekend dance parties. The drug, he added, is considered on par
with marijuana and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like it's not a big deal around here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Isakson Carving Own Identity  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Johnny Isakson ranks 433rd of 435 House
members in seniority, but his office is fit for a speaker. It was,
in fact, where one -- Newt Gingrich -- used to conduct his district
business not longer ago.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, a Republican from Marietta, Ga., inherited the
congressional seat and prime office vacated when Gingrich resigned
last year after the GOP's poor election showing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's old quarters in the Rayburn House Office Building are
large and have a clear view of the Capitol. It's where he conducted
his district business, while using the official speaker's office in
the Capitol for his other duties.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Isakson normally would expect to have modest
accommodations. He admits enjoying the spoils of following a
speaker but is quick to say he's no reincarnation of the flamboyant
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, I'm not Newt,'' Isakson said. ''My dad taught me a long
time ago that if you can't be a success being yourself, you'll
screw it up trying to be someone you aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Isakson jokes that Gingrich's resignation sent
Georgia's conservative 6th District from ''speaker of the House to
the outhouse.'' But he knows that relative anonymity has its
rewards, notably being able to concentrate on issues important to
constituents rather than focusing on national debates, as Gingrich
did.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Gingrich's duties as speaker made committee
appearances a rarity, Isakson regularly attends meetings of the
House Transportation panel on which he serves. It's not the most
prestigious assignment, yet few policy areas are more important
around metropolitan Atlanta, where traffic concerns abound.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gingrich was an in-your-face kind of politician, whereas
Isakson is one who wants to be in your heart,'' said Jay Morgan,
who worked for both. ''I frankly think the 6th District is much
more comfortable with that kind of style even though they suffer
the indignity of having lost a speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the staunchly partisan Gingrich and the
low-key Isakson was illustrated three years ago when Georgia Gov.
Zell Miller, a Democrat who defeated Isakson in the 1990
gubernatorial race, was looking to improve the relationship between
the state's Republican schools superintendent and the
Democratic-dominated Board of Education. He tapped Isakson to chair
the board.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent a 13-month congressman can have a ''niche,''
Isakson has found one in trying to merge schools with the Internet.
House Education Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., tapped him for the
Web-Based Education Commission, which examines education technology
and Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty computer-literate for a 55-year-old,'' Isakson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Isakson worked for a real estate firm,
eventually becoming the company's president and a millionaire. He
honed his political skills in the Georgia House of Representatives,
where he served 14 years, half of those as the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his failed run for governor, Isakson lost a 1996
bid for the Republican Senate nomination to businessman Guy
Millner, who then was defeated by Democrat Max Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson easily won last year's special House election,
outdistancing fellow Republican Christina Jeffrey, 65 percent to 25
percent, and faces no serious re-election challengers this fall.
</P>
<P>
   By replacing one speaker, Isakson has built a rapport with
another. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Gingrich's successor in the
leadership post, has taken Isakson under his wing, even inviting
him on a trade mission to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Johnny Isakson and I both have the distinction of replacing
Newt Gingrich,'' Hastert said, ''but we have both learned that we
can't really replace Newt. The best we can do is use our own
talents and abilities in our jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Fantasy Furniture at D.C. Museum  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Cederquist makes furniture. He has done a
chair that looks as if it can't be sat on because there's an
upright saw blade on the seat, and drawers that won't open normally
because the handles are just painted on.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an illusion,'' Cederquist explained recently. The
''blade'' is carved out of wood, and is lying flat -- not upright.
The drawers open easily if you know how.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much furniture as art. The National Museum of
American Art, its main building closed for refurbishing, opened a
show of the work Friday at its Renwick Gallery across from the
White House. Renwick shows usually are devoted to crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics observe that all art is a kind of illusion and that
Cederquist is not just making jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who mistake Cederquist's humor for frivolity will miss
his pointed message: Image is content,'' Kenneth R. Trapp,
curator-in-charge at the Renwick, wrote in the show's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Cederquist, 53, is a native of Southern California and teaches
art at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, south of Los
Angeles. His background has a lot to do with the way he works.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a child of the '60s,'' Trapp explained, ''steeped in the
urban lore of Southern California replete with Beach Boy tunes, hot
rods, Disneyland and living free in some kind of paradise... (He)
came of age in the tumultuous time of Cold War politics,
television, rock 'n' roll, human rights struggles, Vietnam,
dropout, drop-acid hippies and the love generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it all gets pretty complicated, but the unlikely
themes fit together -- in a way.
</P>
<P>
   Cederquist has a long interest in surfboarding. He's also
fascinated by the famous Japanese print of the artist Hokusai
called ''The Great Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost all the kids who come to my classes say it's because
they want to paint waves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he admires the cartoon character Popeye.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thrilled to discover that The Great Wave is quoted on
the cover sheet of (the music for) Popeye's theme song ('I'm Popeye
the Sailor Man') uniting two of Cederquist's inspirations in a
single vivid image,'' Arthur C. Danto, a retired philosophy
professor at Columbia University, wrote in an analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In one piece, Cederquist has carved out a wooden image of
Hokusai's wave, which emerges from a chest of drawers -- not
something one usually encounters when looking for a pair of socks.
He titled the chest ''Tubular.'' Surfers know the word: It
describes a wave's curling crest. Cederquist painted the expression
on the side of the chest in Japanese characters and included the
same Japanese inscription that Hokusai put on his print.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Cederquist is more interested in communicating ideas
through his furniture than in celebrating the beauty of woods or
fine woodworking techniques,'' noted Jeremy Adamson, senior curator
at the Renwick.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 1790 Census: 'Perfect Enumeration'  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In late 1790, an inquisitive government agent
knocked on the door of Boston silversmith and patriot Paul Revere
and dutifully noted his name and the number of people living under
his roof.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred and ten years later, the ledgerbook recording that
raw data about Revere and his Boston neighbors is on view at the
National Archives, pen-and-ink evidence of the first U.S. census
and the 20 national head counts that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Archives pulled the 1790 ledger from its miles of shelves
just as the 21st census got under way with the dispatching of
questionnaires to about 120 million households.
</P>
<P>
   As the American Revolution began in 1775, Revere galloped out
from Boston to Lexington, Mass., rousing the countryside and
warning that the British were marching. His midnight mission would
be immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's ''Paul Revere's
Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that is obvious from the 1790 census. Revere's name
appears as head of a household that included three boys under age
16 and three white females. All except Revere are listed as
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than that we know nothing else about them, not even
their names,'' said Connie Potter, an Archives official. ''But it
is clear, from the questions that were asked, that there were no
slaves in Paul Revere's household.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first census, just 650 people did the counting in the 13
states, the districts of Maine, Vermont and Kentucky and the
Southwest Territory, which later became the state of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for the count was lodged with the U.S. marshal in
each state and district. Those doing the actual counting were hired
as assistant marshals.
</P>
<P>
   In populous towns and cities the pay was $1 for every 300 people
counted; in the countryside it was $1 for every 150, but that was
increased in sparsely settled areas to $1 for every 50.
</P>
<P>
   Each census worker took an oath to make ''a just and perfect
enumeration and description of persons within the division assigned
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The count was essential. It not only established the total
population but also served as the basis of apportioning state
delegations to the new House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people realized the important nature of what was being
set in motion,'' said David Hendricks, a Census Bureau historian,
standing near the case with the sheet of ruled paper listing the
names of Paul Revere and other Bostonians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important because they were building a democratic
government for the first time and the government needed to
distribute political power to the people based on their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the secrecy rules prevailing today, the 1790 census rules
required that two copies of the final tallies be publicly
displayed. Records show that copies went on view in such places as
''in front of the Court House,'' the Orange Tree Inn, a local
gristmill, or, in one case, ''Mr. Henry Eckhart's Tavern.''
</P>
<P>
   The third tally sheet was sent to President Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As in every census, some people were missed, either because they
were hard to find or because they wished to remain uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think there was a general acceptance in 1790 that while
not everyone got counted, it was good enough for what they had to
do,'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the formula established by the Constitution, slaves
were counted as three-fifths of a whole person for the purposes of
apportionment. Free blacks were counted as whole people. So were
indentured servants.
</P>
<P>
   There were just six questions asked in 1790, of which two were
basic: the name of the head of each family and the number of people
in each household.
</P>
<P>
   The census takers recorded the number of free, white males 16
years or older to determine how many men might be potentially
available for military service. They also counted the number of
free, white males younger than 16; the number of free, white
females; all other free people by sex and race and the number of
slaves in the household.
</P>
<P>
   When all the adding of names and numbers was over, the result
did not meet everyone's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and other unhappy government officials had hoped the
count would show a population of significantly more than 4 million.
It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When the census was over, the population of the United States at
the end of 1790 was certified at exactly 3,929,214.
</P>
<P>
   That included Paul Revere.

<HEADLINE> Global Diamond Business Changing  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) -- The diamond trade has always had its
dark side, with smugglers and gunrunners too often lurking behind
the sparkle and glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Now revelations that gem sales are feeding some of Africa's
nastiest civil wars have forced change at the heart of the global
diamond business.
</P>
<P>
   Antwerp's diamond trade stands accused of allowing rebels from
Angola and Sierra Leone to sell billions of dollars of gems on the
international market to pay for arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Extremely lax controls and regulations governing the Antwerp
market facilitate and perhaps even encourage illegal activity,''
said a stinging report presented to the United Nations this month
by Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   The report on how Angolan warlord Jonas Savimbi defies U.N.
sanctions to fund his guerrillas reads like a post-Cold War
thriller, with a cast of shadowy South African arms dealers,
Ukrainian mercenaries, eastern Mediterranean gem traffickers and
African leaders bribed with packets of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, many of the strands in this web lead to
Antwerp, where 85 percent of the world's rough diamonds are traded.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond district hugging Antwerp's railroad tracks
registered a turnover of almost $18 billion in the first nine
months of last year. Trading is cosmopolitan. Hassidic Jews in
black coats and hats mingle with sharp-suited dealers from Bombay
to Beirut. Little jewelry stores on the neighborhood's fringes are
run by newcomers from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There are Kosher delis, Lebanese cafes and Bollywood movie
posters.
</P>
<P>
   At Antwerp's High Diamond Council, the U.N. report was met with
consternation and claims the city is being made a scapegoat for an
illicit trade that's impossible to control.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Van Bockstael heads the Angolan task force set up by the
Diamond Council after the U.N. banned trade in Savimbi's diamonds
in 1998. He insists Antwerp has stricter controls than rival
centers, such as Bombay or Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Every batch of diamonds coming into the city is double-checked.
Certificates of origin are scrutinized. Close cooperation with the
Angolan government seeks to verify all diamonds from there are
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   However, Van Bockstael acknowledged diamonds are a smuggler's
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are small, they are high value and they are very hard to
detect,'' he said, pointing at pin-covered maps tracing suspected
clandestine routes out of Angola through Africa, the Middle East
and former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Although some diamonds can be recognized as coming from
particular mines, Van Bockstael said the high quality gems panned
from the rivers of Angola's remote northeast are indistinguishable
from those of neighboring Congo and are similar to Canadian gems.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of production is simply not identifiable,'' Van
Bockstael insisted. ''We are trying to develop a technology (but)
it's going to take at least another five years before we have a
reliable instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Savimbi can easily circumvent controls by forging
certificates or shipping stones through nations where he has
friends or officials are easily bribed. Once cut and polished, Van
Bockstael said, the diamonds are impossible to track.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond marketing colossus De Beers responded to the outrage by
banning all sales from Angola. Van Bockstael said that's giving the
same treatment to victims and their tormentors. He's trying to get
agreement from other diamond centers for a joint pledge to buy
Angola's diamonds only from official channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flourishing diamond industry can be utilized by the legal
Angolan government to rebuild their war-torn cities and
infrastructure,'' the statement says. Van Bockstael pointed to
Botswana and Namibia, where legitimate diamond sales underpin local
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Although 40 years of unbroken warfare have left Angola's
citizens desperately poor, the country's official diamond sales
last year reached $600 billion, making it the fourth-largest
producer behind Botswana, Russia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many more diamonds are smuggled out of Angola.
The human rights group Global Witness estimated Savimbi earned
$3.72 billion from diamond sales from 1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With such riches at stake, campaigners recognize the
difficulties in imposing controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The illicit diamond trade is never going to be stopped,'' said
Alex Vines from Human Rights Watch in London. ''But the costs (of
smuggling) can be raised. ... There needs to be more tightening
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Bockstael said international concern is changing attitudes
in an industry that paid scant regard to ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears of scaring away an industry that provides 7
percent of the country's exports, the Belgian government is
introducing tighter controls. Antwerp's Diamond Council is
petitioning dealers ''not to accept the blood money'' that comes
from trading rebel gems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the end of the diamond business as we knew it and the
start of a new, more ethical business,'' Van Bockstael said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Miami Kin Says Dad Is Unfit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and their
allies are questioning whether the boy's father is fit as a parent
as time runs out in their battle to retain custody of the
6-year-old refugee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the father's attorney insisted Sunday that
the boy belongs with his father, but lawyers for the relatives
suggested there is evidence he is unfit to care for the small
child.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he hoped for a peaceful resolution, as
members of Congress on both sides of the issue took to the Sunday
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between government lawyers and representatives of the
Miami relatives were resuming today, against a Justice
Department-set Tuesday deadline for a signed agreement by the
family to turn Elian over for return to Cuba if it loses a custody
battle in court.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro said Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, was willing to travel alone to the United
States today if officials promised to turn over the boy to him and
let them return to Cuba right away.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, issued a statement
Sunday in Miami inviting Juan Gonzalez, his wife and their baby son
to ''spend time with us as a family, to begin a process of
interaction with Elian under circumstances that are best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father,'' said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ''Suffice it to say, the issue is not whether we will
transfer Elian to his father, but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., joined the relatives' lawyers in
suggesting Elian might not be safe with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do take kids away from fathers and keep them away from
them where there's child abuse or problems. We don't know what the
situation is,'' Burton said on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' explaining
that he was beaten as a child. ''All the facts should come out in a
family court. That's the only way to know for sure that this boy's
going to be safe going back to Cuba with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case here, said attorney Gregory Craig, who
represents Elian's father. ''There is no doubt this father loves
his boy very, very much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' lawyers suggested otherwise. Attorney Manny Diaz
said their legal team has submitted evidence to the federal court
and the Clinton administration, although he declined to detail it.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the lawyers on our team met with the attorney general
at the beginning of this process and raised those types of
concern,'' Diaz said on ABC's ''This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig said the family is just now raising the issue after
months of acknowledging that Gonzalez was a loving man. ''It's
outrageous,'' he said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The family's arguments come as the Justice Department insists
the relatives agree to surrender Elian if they lose their pending
court case.
</P>
<P>
   It has given the relatives until Tuesday to sign such a promise
and has threatened to revoke the boy's permission to be in this
country if they do not agree. That deadline has already been
extended twice.
</P>
<P>
   Family members want to preserve their option to keep up the
legal fight even if they lose their case in federal court. They
also want a family court, which considers a child's best interests,
to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have said they will surrender the boy if INS
agents show up at their door and demand him. Federal officials hope
to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta stressed that the
administration believes Elian should be with his father, who wants
him back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''A child belongs with his natural parent unless that parent's
unfit,'' Podesta said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''We have no
indication that Elian's father is an unfit parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, attorney Linda Osberg-Braun continued to push that
theory. She said the father told Elian on the telephone that his
mother was alive and waiting for him in Cuba when, in fact, his
mother died last November in the effort to reach the United States.
Elian was left clinging to an inner tube following a shipwreck
until being rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun speculated that Elian's father was under the
influence of the Cuban government when he misled his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's cruel, and we understand that that's because of the
forces in Cuba coaching him and coercing him to say these horrible
things to his son,'' she said on CBS. ''That needs to be discussed.
It needs to be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Supportive members of Congress backed the attorneys' theories.
Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the father should not be allowed
unrestricted visitation with his son unless a court grants him the
right.
</P>
<P>
   Others forcefully disagreed. Conservative Rep. Steve Largent,
R-Okla., said Elian should be returned to Cuba right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''If my little boy ... was lost, what position does a court have
to come in and start evaluating whether I'm a fit father or not?''
he said on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton said he was optimistic a resolution
could be found.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people on both sides of this issue who are
more concerned with what is in the best interest of the child than
the larger political issues involving Castro and Cuba,'' he told
reporters Sunday while flying on Air Force One to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ''That ... gives me hope we can find a principled resolution
that is not just a train wreck for the child, a train wreck for the
rule of law or a train wreck for all concerned. We'll see. I'm
hopeful.''

<HEADLINE> Something to scream about: Jay Hawkins' 57 kids  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- His biographer says Screamin' Jay Hawkins spent
his life looking for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Screamin' Jay had more success than most.
</P>
<P>
   The voice behind the seminal '50s rock howler ''I Put A Spell on
You'' claimed to have fathered 57 children before dying Feb. 12 at
age 70. That's just an estimate; Hawkins acknowledged there could
be a few more wandering about.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very active in the ladies' department,'' said his
biographer, Maral Nigolian, as understated as Hawkins was
oversexed. ''He was a handsome, vibrant musician, a very
charismatic persona.''
</P>
<P>
   That charisma has prompted a Web site aimed at tracking down his
prodigious progeny -- an effort that has drawn nearly 70 responses
from around the United States since it went online March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins lost touch with his children -- those he knew about --
after moving to Paris in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   How impressive is Hawkins' total? Rolling Stone Mick Jagger,
rock icon of the last four decades, acknowledged siring just seven
children.
</P>
<P>
   At www.jayskids.com, the message is succinct: ''If you believe
you may have had a child by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, or if you
believe you are a child of Screamin' Jay Hawkins, please click
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That sound you hear is hundreds upon hundreds of mouse clicks.
On its busiest day, the site racked up 12,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nigolian, at least eight of the respondents seem
legitimate heirs, based on information that Hawkins provided during
a series of conversations. The others will require additional
investigation; ultimately, DNA testing will determine who is and
who isn't an actual Screamin' son or daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, during a singing career that spanned nearly 50 years,
was married six times and enjoyed uncounted liaisons. His widow,
who lived with Hawkins in France, was apparently unaware of his
previous wives and knew little about his endless heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins died of multiple organ failure following emergency
surgery for an aneurysm. He was buried in Pere Lachaise, the same
French cemetery where Doors frontman Jim Morrison was buried.
</P>
<P>
   The estate is saying nothing about any children until they are
actually proven to be offspring of the Wilt Chamberlain of rock 'n'
roll. But in excerpts from some of the e-mails received through the
Web site, it's clear that Screamin' Jay got around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he had relatives in (Washington) D.C., and believe that
around the time of my conception he was here,'' offered one
possible child.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote another, ''My mamma was a waitress in a Detroit diner when
she met Hawkins.''
</P>
<P>
   A third, writing from Cleveland, picked up some paternal clues
from his mother's musical taste.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that my mother was a HUGE fan of Mr. Hawkins ... She
had met him on many occasions and kept a picture of herself and Jay
framed on the wall,'' he wrote. ''I just want to trace my blood
lines and find out where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' desire to track down his kids had a simple motivation:
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was something he regretted -- there was never enough time
to spend with his kids,'' Nigolian said. ''But he never regretted
having them. He was very proud of his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins was always a larger-than-life figure, bursting on the
music scene with his unforgettable 1956 single ''I Put a Spell on
You.'' Afraid that his original version was too timid, Hawkins
started drinking until he achieved the right level of inebriation,
then redid his vocals in a howl.
</P>
<P>
   The result was pure inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spell'' was covered by Creedence Clearwater Revival, among
others. Hawkins enjoyed later success in both music and film,
opening for the Rolling Stones in 1980 and appearing in the Jim
Jarmusch film ''Mystery Train.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' stage act was over-the-top, too. He would appear from
inside a flaming coffin, a bone through his nose and a
cigarette-smoking skull on a stick in his hand. Hawkins called the
skull ''Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the Hawkins' estate has become a bone of
contention. His attorney, Gary M. Spritz of Beverly Hills, did not
return messages, so its unclear how much money is involved.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Hawkins' fifth ex-wife is in charge of the
estate, which was news to the widow Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bit of a legal drama between the widow and the
ex-wife,'' acknowledged Danny Dolan, a spokesman for the estate.
''We'll find out when the will is filed for probate in mid-May.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Nigolian should have a good idea about the search for
survivors. But she makes it clear that her search is about closure,
not cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to make this a gold hunt,'' she says.
''That's not what this is all about. We simply want to get to the
heart of the true submissions.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Inspires Cautious Optimism  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOLOMNA, Russia (AP) -- Spring is slow arriving this year, but a
vague hope glimmers on the slushy streets of this ancient town that
President Vladimir Putin's election may finally mean better times
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is wary. Nobody is sure what Putin will do, and
Russians have been disappointed by broken promises so many times
before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, weary and cynical as they are about their country's
poverty and corruption, Russians are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a young fellow. We hope he will do something,'' says Vera
Artamanova, 54, who sells underwear in the town market to augment
her tiny pension. ''Life is so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Labina from the next stall chimes in, saying she liked
Putin's vow -- made after winning the March 26 election -- not to
make promises so he wouldn't create false hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin hasn't been specific about plans beyond calling for a
strong state and a crackdown on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I liked about his speech was he didn't promise anything,
unlike Yeltsin,'' she says. ''A low bow to him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, steeling themselves for disappointment, say they
don't expect much. For some, it's enough the 47-year-old Putin is
not Boris Yeltsin, his unpopular and increasingly frail
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only achievement of this election is that a young person
is in power,'' says the 33-year-old Labina.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism runs deep in Russia, where most people expect nothing
from their government but corruption and empty talk. And so while
she approves of Putin, Alevtina Dymova, 60, warns that Russians
must help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin is young, educated, energetic,'' says Dymova, the
director of Kolomna's historical museum. ''I'm impressed that he
can speak without notes, that he doesn't lose his place, that he
can speak to people normally.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she adds, ''There are no miracles. The president must
create normal conditions for work. Then we must work, ourselves. No
one else can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   As in so many places in Russia, much work waits to be done in
Kolomna, a city of 153,000 people. More than 800 years old, Kolomna
is endowed with monasteries and churches that could attract
tourists from nearby Moscow, but the place is falling apart from
decades of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The town's factories employ just a third of the workers they did
10 years ago, and most people grow food in home gardens just to eat
day to day.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief spell of euphoria following the fall of Communism
in 1991, the public mood shifted to disappointment with the flawed
capitalism that flourished under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The government has failed to restructure inefficient Soviet-era
enterprises, while the development of new businesses is often
stymied by corruption and excessive bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why they're rarely optimistic, many Russians often
quote former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin: ''We wanted to do
better, but it turned out like always.''
</P>
<P>
   Much cynicism remains, especially about how Putin came to power.
</P>
<P>
   A former KGB agent and Kremlin bureaucrat, Putin was propelled
from obscurity by Yeltsin and his inner circle. Named prime
minister in August, Putin became acting president Dec. 31 when
Yeltsin resigned. That gave Putin the advantages of incumbency in
an early election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeltsin put him in; it will be the same as with Yeltsin,''
says Yelena Kuprika, 24, leaning on her gate in Andreyevskoye, a
tiny village just outside Kolomna.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows what he is,'' says Yury Andreyev, 38, walking his
dog along the village's single muddy lane. ''Even if he gets rid of
Yeltsin's entourage it will take a year or two at least.''
</P>
<P>
   While they wait to see what Putin will do, people rely on their
own efforts for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''What should we expect? We'll work, and so we'll live. We've
got our garden,'' says Valentin Pavlovich, a retired army sergeant
in the nearby village of Semibratskoye who would give only his
first and middle names.
</P>
<P>
   He says he voted for Putin ''because I have to vote for
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's decisive,'' he says. ''What he'll do, we don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Another Year of Woman in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVENTURA, Fla. (AP) -- When she looks out over a horizon dotted
with high-rise condominiums filled with retirees, state Rep. Elaine
Bloom sees the voters who could propel her to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, who got her start in politics 35 years ago lobbying
Congress to pass Medicare, is one of an exceptionally large class
of women from both parties competing in the year's hottest House
and Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   She woos senior citizens, who make up one-third of the south
Florida congressional district, with a pitch to extend Medicare
coverage to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no sense to have a system that provides for hospital
care and not the medications that keep people well,'' she said,
winning nods of approval from a gray-haired audience at a
synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom, a Democrat, raised more money last year than 20-year
Republican Rep. Clay Shaw and is given a better-than-average chance
of unseating him.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for a
Senate seat in New York, both parties have recruited women to try
to improve their chances of winning certain races.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news is there are women running in some of the most
competitive districts in the country and they've made very strong
showings early in the campaign cycle,'' said Stephanie Cohen Glass,
a spokeswoman for Emily's List, which raises money for Democratic
women candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While 1992 was dubbed the ''Year of the Woman'' after four women
won Senate seats and 24 were elected to the House, 2000 is quietly
shaping up as the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Women are seeking four of the 11 Senate seats and six of the 18
House seats considered most competitive, playing an important role
in an election where control of each chamber is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marquee contenders is former Democratic Rep. Jane
Harman of California, who is trying to regain the House seat she
gave up in 1998 for an unsuccessful run for governor. With
President Clinton's help, Harman raised $400,000 last month at a
fund-raiser in Washington's fashionable Georgetown neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also tout women they hope will capture
Democratic-held seats in Pennsylvania, with state Sen. Melissa
Hart, and West Virginia, with state Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, the
daughter of former Gov. Arch Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties made concerted efforts to recruit women with
credentials and name recognition that make them strong contenders
in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, for instance, Columbus City Council member Maryellen
O'Shaughnessy, a Democrat, is running for the House seat being
vacated by retiring GOP Rep. John Kasich.
</P>
<P>
   O'Shaughnessy has plenty of backing. Her father and two uncles
were state lawmakers and her brother is a village mayor. Besides
serving on the city council, she is a director of her family owned
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bloom in Florida has a long resume as a state
representative and as a leader of several local civic groups. Her
efforts date back to 1965 when, as state legislative chairman of
the National Council of Jewish Women, she lobbied Congress to enact
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, acknowledges that Bloom has a real chance
to unseat Shaw. Bloom raised $742,634 last year to $522,702 for
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say women may prove especially attractive this year
because voters give them an edge on the issues that are expected to
dominate the fall campaign: gun control, Medicare and other health
care areas, Social Security and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues in this domestic agenda are the issues women have
championed for the past 100 years,'' said Mary Hawkesworth,
director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers
University. ''It may well be that many voters see the women as
having greater expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Ohio, O'Shaughnessy talks about her experience
with Medicare. Her 85-year-old mother died last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw my health care provider not delivering the services,''
she said. ''If it's happening to me, it's happening to many other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom talks about using projected budget surpluses to shore up
Social Security and Medicare and expanding the latter program to
cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That argument sits well with activists like Ginger Grossman, one
of the ''condo commandos'' who will make sure the seniors in those
high-rises get to the polls in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''It costs me to stay alive really $600 a month in prescription
drugs. Outrageous,'' Grossman fumed. ''Prescription drugs is a very
important issue. How do you stay alive?''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising Prober Defends Reno  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM C. MANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prosecutor who once led the Democratic
fund-raising investigation says he wanted Attorney General Janet
Reno to bring in an independent counsel partly to avoid the
appearance of favoritism, not necessarily because charges needed to
be filed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Charles LaBella, such an investigation might well
have failed to produce criminal charges. LaBella lost his
Washington assignment after recommending an outside investigation
of President Clinton and other top White House figures, which Reno
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The standard was information, sufficient information from
credible sources. ... I believe we had substantial information from
credible sources to warrant a full-scale investigation of many of
these allegations,'' LaBella said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Once an experienced prosecutor reviewed the allegations, he
said, ''I think most of these, if not all of them, would have
washed out.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBella was brought here from California in September 1997 to
head a Justice Department team looking into alleged fund-raising
abuses, largely by the Democrats, during the 1996 president
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The following July, he sent Reno a memo saying his investigators
had uncovered information that merited follow-up by an independent
counsel without links to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to seek a special prosecutor. LaBella was
transferred back to San Diego that month as acting U.S. attorney,
then resigned a year ago after being passed over for a permanent
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said one item that needed independent perusal was
allegations that Vice President Al Gore lied in 1997. Reno
determined he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how you get to that by virtue of not conducting
an investigation,'' LaBella said. ''It was looked at ... and we did
everything we could. I remember that because I was up there right
up until that point.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, by his reckoning his task force had collected
insufficient evidence to determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a jump ball. It's too close a call for us to make. We
should have somebody independent make this call,'' LaBella said.
''If it's going to be a nonprosecution, ... have somebody else make
the call so the American people are satisfied that it's been looked
at by an objective person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, said Sunday that Reno
had done nothing wrong, and noted that the task force LaBella led
was still in business.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Justice Department, I believe, followed the law in
handling this case and did so appropriately,'' Podesta said on CBS'
''Face the Nation.'' ''They're continuing to investigate the
matter, and I think they'll take appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBella agreed that politics played no part in decisions by Reno
or others at Justice who disagreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never politics. It was bureaucratic agendas, I think.
Protecting turf internally at the Department of Justice,'' LaBella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody was protecting anybody. I really don't
believe that the attorney general, in any way, shape or form, was
protecting anybody, or anybody else at the Justice Department was
politically protecting anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times last month quoted the memo as saying
Justice officials used ''gamesmanship'' and legal ''contortions''
to avoid an independent inquiry into Clinton-Gore fund-raising
matters.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella also accused his colleagues of ''intellectually
dishonest double standards'' by giving special treatment to Vice
President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Harold Ickes, a
former White House aide, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella contended Sunday that the Times story took his words
somewhat out of context. But he also said: ''I had field
prosecutors who came in who resigned from the task force in
frustration because they felt that there was legal gamesmanship
being played.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Uganda Sect Member Speaks Out  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- A former member of a Christian doomsday
sect says the cult's unfulfilled doomsday prophecy spurred
opposition and possibly the murder of sect dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation came Sunday as dignitaries joined residents of
Kanungu and nearby villages in southwestern Uganda to deplore the
deaths of 924 members of a reclusive Christian doomsday sect who
authorities say were killed by their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, no sect member, past or present, had confirmed the
common belief here: The failure of the world to end Dec. 31 led
members to demand belongings they had surrendered to join the
Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God -- a
challenge that led to retaliation by sect leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A March 17 blaze inside the chapel of the sect's secretive
compound in Kanungu burned 530 sect members alive. Authorities
initially termed the deaths a mass suicide, but the discovery of
the bodies of six slain men in a compound latrine soon shifted that
assessment to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, mass graves at three other compounds linked to the
cult have yielded 388 more bodies, many stabbed and strangled. The
pungent scent of rotting bodies emanating Sunday from a latrine in
the main Kanungu compound suggested the toll could still rise.
</P>
<P>
   At least one cult compound, in the remote foothills of western
Uganda's Mountains of the Moon, has yet to be searched.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ahimbisibwe, whose mother and sister died in the fire two
weeks ago, said sect members began pressing Credonia Mwerinde, a
movement founder who was known as ''The Programmer,'' about the
fate of their property during worship services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who sold their property would inquire one-by-one.
Whoever would inquire would disappear,'' said Ahimbisibwe, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ahimbisibwe also said he saw a man carrying a hammer and nails
early March 17. It is partly this testimony, authorities say, that
has persuaded them that windows and doors were blocked to prevent
sect members from leaving the chapel before the flames erupted -- or
fleeing afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Sect members were ''always preparing'' to go to another world,
Ahimbisibwe said. But when they entered the chapel that morning for
prayers dressed in the sect's uniform of green-and-white robes,
they had no idea of what was about to happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of townspeople gathered on a hilltop soccer
field Sunday to mourn the neighbors they barely knew.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan Vice President Speciosa Kazibwe called the architects of
the deadliest cult tragedy in modern history ''diabolic, malevolent
criminals masquerading as holy and religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the memorial service, Kazibwe acknowledged the failure of
the country's police and intelligence agencies to expose sect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through deception and conspiracy, these criminals outwitted
the security network (and) exploited the ignorance and illiteracy
of thousands,'' she said, adding that the government planned to
convene an interagency group to study the country's cults.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Grace Kaiso, the head of the Uganda Joint Christian
Council, criticized the country's churches for failing to expose
the sect.
</P>
<P>
   ''How come that despite our elaborate parish network as
churches, we failed to detect the fate that befell so many of our
brothers, sisters and children?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the crowd as speakers vilified her estranged husband
as a murderer was Therese Kibwetere. Authorities are pursuing
Joseph Kibwetere, the sect's self-described ''bishop,'' but his son
Juvenal Mugambwa has said he was killed in the Kanungu fire.
</P>
<P>
   Therese Kibwetere said her priest in her village of Kabumba
persuaded her to attend Sunday's ceremony. Asked if she felt she
owed the victims and their relatives an apology, she replied:
''What should I have done?'' and noted that 25 of the dead were
from her village.

<HEADLINE> Re-Enactment of Civil War Battle  </HEADLINE>
By GARRY MITCHELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Something had always been missing during the
15 years of re-enactments of the Battle of Blakeley: There were no
blacks on the mock battlefield, despite a historical record of some
6,000 black Union soldiers in the Civil War fight.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of 10 black Boy Scouts has volunteered to
participate in the April 8-9 re-enactment, giving a new look to the
warring field of Blues and Grays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel strongly that the boys and community should know the
blacks did take part in the battle over here -- a major part in the
battle,'' said Eliscia Edwards, who is making uniforms for some of
the Scouts. ''It's been hidden from us, and when it came to light,
we wanted to take part in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout Troop 221 of Mobile had worked in the 1996
re-enactment off the battlefield, parking cars and helping out at
Historic Blakeley State Park, which is on the eastern shore of the
Mobile Delta river wilderness. That stirred their interest in
getting onto the battlefield. The role of black soldiers cinched
it.
</P>
<P>
   Scoutmaster Beauford Perkins, 61, said the Scouts studied the
history of the Hawkins Division of 6,000 black soldiers who were
among the 45,000 Union forces at Blakeley. There were only about
2,500 Confederate soldiers, so the fighting was brief.
</P>
<P>
   It was also somewhat futile. It was fought on April 9, 1865 --
the same day that Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee signed the
surrender at Appomattox, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Each year about 300 re-enactors, dressed in Civil War regalia,
relive the event, many attempting to look mean and full of venom.
Until now, all were white.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally there hasn't been any black re-enactors in this
area,'' said John Rather, 45, a businessman from nearby Daphne who
rides as a calvaryman in the Blakeley event and takes part in
re-enactments all over the country. ''I don't think it's a racial
thing. There are a lot of black re-enactors up North, just aren't
any down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer engineer Steve Thomas of Fairhope, who began taking
part in re-enactments four years ago, said the lack of black
re-enactors in the area may be partly because of the fraternization
that goes on among the Civil War buffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people get into it because of ancestry,'' he said.
''It tends to be a fraternal organization. People get their friends
interested and pal around.''
</P>
<P>
   When would-be participants don't see a lot of their friends out
there, it's hard to join in, he said. And that may keep blacks
away.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile businessman Eddie Irby is not one of them. He nurtures an
interest in black military events because his late uncle served in
the all-black Buffalo Soldiers, a U.S. Army force mainly in the
American West.
</P>
<P>
   Irby said the cost of buying the gear is an obstacle for
re-enactments, but he said it's important for blacks to get
involved to demonstrate to younger blacks the role of their
ancestors in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, they only get ''one side of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Irby said he had contacted about a half-dozen men about getting
some uniforms and equipment to get started as re-enactors, without
much success.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeley Park's interim director, Jo Ann Flirt, said there
hadn't been an aggressive effort to bring black re-enactors into
the state park event in the past because it mainly was staged by
the re-enactors themselves, not the park, which she said had always
publicized the role of the black soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Flirt said she began trying to stir black
participation in Blakeley after the dedication of the Spirit of
Freedom Memorial to black soldiers in Washington, D.C. ''We put out
some publicity, saying we were looking for folks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She got little response.
</P>
<P>
   The Blakeley participants mainly come from a corporation that
goes from place to place, staging Civil War events and other
''living history'' events.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins hopes members of his Boy Scout troop will be permanent
figures at Blakeley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm enjoying it myself,'' he said. ''I had never really tried
to re-enact.''

<HEADLINE> Plane Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- An American Airlines passenger plane made an
emergency landing Sunday night after a loud bang occurred on board.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the Fort Worth-based airline, said
she assumed that some of the 57 passengers reported seeing sparks
from the McDonnell-Douglas Super 80's right engine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 57 passengers also reported seeing sparks from the
right engine, said Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the Fort
Worth-based airline.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 772 left Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at 8:25
p.m. en route to LaGuardia Airport in New York. After the captain
heard the bang and saw a warning light go on, he shut down the
right engine and made an emergency landing in Shreveport, La., at
9:20 p.m., Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown what caused the loud noise. All the passengers and
the six crew members got off the plane without injuries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another plane went to Shreveport to pick up the passengers and
take them to LaGuardia, Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was taken out of service and will be inspected Monday.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Babies Rescue Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- In the waning days of the
Vietnam War, enormous cargo planes lumbered into the sky over
Saigon carrying tiny, precious loads.
</P>
<P>
   Along the walls inside the planes, seat belts held hundreds of
frightened toddlers and older children. Down the center, secured
with long straps, were rows of cardboard boxes, each holding two or
three babies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 Vietnamese orphans were evacuated from Saigon,
now renamed Ho Chi Minh City, during those final days in April 1975
in a U.S. campaign dubbed ''Operation Babylift.''
</P>
<P>
   It included a deadly crash that stunned even those already
numbed by the war's horrors.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some of those airlifted to new homes and adoptive
families a quarter-century ago came back to Vietnam for the first
time on a memorial tour led by one of the evacuation's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 38 arrived at Ho Chi Minh City airport, including 15
orphans as well as their adoptive families. After the long flight,
they looked happy but exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a dream being back in many respects'' said Sister
Mary Nelle Gage, a former administrator with a volunteer agency
that processed adoption papers for many of the children. ''When we
were living here and working here, every day seemed so desperate.
We always wondered what the children would be like when they grew
up, what they would think of their time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage, who now lives in Colorado, hopes the two-week trip will
help the orphans, now in their mid-20s and early 30s, come to terms
with their past. Many ended up being adopted by American families.
</P>
<P>
   The orphans often didn't have official birth records because
some were children of American GIs and Vietnamese women, considered
a shameful union by Vietnamese society, she said. Many grew up
wondering about their past and the reasons for their abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know this is their flesh-and-blood beginning. They want
to see where they are from and experience being in that
environment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the visitors are survivors of the ill-fated cargo jet
crash on April 4, 1975, that killed 144 adults and children,
including 76 babies.
</P>
<P>
   On that morning, a giant C-5A cargo jet -- making one of the
first evacuation flights -- cruised down the runway of Saigon's Tan
Son Nhut Airport loaded with more than 300 children and their
caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after takeoff, an explosion blew out the doors.
The pilots were able to turn the plane back toward the airport and
crash-landed a few miles from the runway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most tragic images to emerge from the chaos of the
war was the sight of tiny white body bags being unloaded from
rescue helicopters as frantic personnel sought to help the 170-plus
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The returnees are planning a special memorial service Tuesday at
the crash site. Some of the Vietnamese childcare workers who cared
for the orphans at the time are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Gage has led two other groups of orphans and their adoptive
parents back to Vietnam in 1996 and 1997. But this year -- the 25th
anniversary of the end of the war -- has a particular resonance, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will focus on providing the returnees and their parents
with a sense of connection with the past, with visits planned to
local orphanages and birthplaces of the orphans.
</P>
<P>
   For the first-time returnees, cultural lessons on Vietnam are
part of the itinerary, with tours of Ho Chi Minh City and a trip to
the Mekong Delta and its floating markets.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the south, the tour will wind its way up to Danang
and Hue before concluding in Hanoi at the end of next week with a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson.

<HEADLINE> AOL Breaks Into Fortune 500 List  </HEADLINE>
By PETER SVENSSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dot-com companies may be minting millionaires at
a historic pace, but they have yet to make many inroads in the
venerable Fortune 500.
</P>
<P>
   Just one purely Internet company -- America Online Inc. -- broke
into the ranks of the Old Economy stalwarts this year, and only at
No. 337, in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most largest
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology companies benefiting from the Internet boom
climbed in the magazine's rankings, but there was little evidence
of the high-flying Internet startups. That's because the list is
based on 1999 revenue, not the companies' stock values.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc., one of the world's largest carriers of
Internet traffic, hit No. 25, up from No. 80, in the list released
Sunday and appearing the magazine's April 17 issue. Dell Computer
Co., the largest seller of computers in the country, went to 56
from 78.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., the company with the highest market value, rose
to 84 from 109, and Cisco Systems Inc., which makes equipment for
the Internet, advanced to 146 from 192.
</P>
<P>
   AOL wasn't the only history-maker. Amgen Inc. became the first
biotechnology company, landing at 463. And Hewlett-Packard Co., No.
13, was the highest-ranking Fortune 500 company with a female chief
executive, Carleton Fiorina.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. remained No. 1 for the 12th consecutive
year, with revenues of $189 billion, but Ford Motor Co. dropped
from second to fourth place, displaced by fast-growing retailer
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., previously in third.
</P>
<P>
   GM's lead over Wal-Mart, which had $166 billion in revenue, may
look sizable, but Wal-Mart has had annual growth in the double
digits for more than a decade, while GM's revenue dropped in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In third place was oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp., following the
merger of Exxon Corp., previously No. 4, and Mobil Corp., ranked
No. 6 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co. remained fifth in revenue, but led in
profits, stuffing its coffers with $10.7 billion. The grandfather
of computer companies, International Business Machines Corp.
remained in sixth place, followed by Citigroup Inc., also unchanged
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. climbed from 10th to eighth, pushing down Philip
Morris Cos. Inc. to ninth. Boeing Co. fell from ninth to 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which went public last
year, is the highest-ranked newcomer, at No. 54.
</P>
<P>
   Total profits for the 500 corporations grew 28.7 percent, thanks
to a roaring economy and a recovery from the Asian financial
crisis, which pulled earnings down by 1.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues grew by 10.2 percent, also an improvement on 1998
growth of 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tones Down Message in Nev.  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A subdued President Clinton took to the
fund-raising trail again Sunday, abandoning white-hot criticism of
his wife's Republican Senate opponent and casting attacks on the
GOP in general economic terms.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to a fund-raiser in Washington Saturday, where
Clinton lambasted New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a tool of the
''right-wing venom machine,'' Clinton told about 30 people at a Las
Vegas brunch that this fall's election boils down to what each
party plans to do with the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said voters must choose between the short-term
gratification of an outsized Republican tax cut or the long-term
satisfaction of knowing the money will keep safety-net programs
like Medicare and Social Security in the black for another
generation of retiring Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment for making tomorrows. This is not a moment
for indulging ourselves in all this good stuff that's going on
today,'' Clinton said. ''Are we going to pick leaders that we know
understand the future and can take us there, or are we going to
pick people who say things we like to hear and may make things
easier for a month or two?''
</P>
<P>
   The president was the headliner at two events in Las Vegas that
were expected to bring in $525,000 for the Democratic National
Committee. He then headed to San Jose, Calif., site of a $1 million
fund-raiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let this election be about little things. And don't let
this election be about divisive things,'' Clinton said at the San
Jose event. ''We've got the chance of a lifetime to build the
future of our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC General Chairman Ed Rendell urged donors to keep the money
flowing, saying the Republican National Committee has historically
raked in more soft money donations -- even in 1996 and 1998, when
Democrats won.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to outspend us,'' Rendell said. ''We need
enough money to get our message across. We don't have to match 'em
dollar for dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his remarks Sunday in a voice that bordered on
a whisper at times. He restated his allegiance to Vice President Al
Gore and said his reasons are ''quite apart from my personal
loyalty to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he understands the future and has the knowledge
and experience and the strength to take us there,'' Clinton said.
''And that swamps every one of the specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton mentioned Gore by name, he did not do the same for
the likely Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George Bush. He limited
his comments to the GOP-backed proposal to devote a share of the
federal surplus to a tax-relief package of up to $240 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''For it to become law would mean we could not get the country
out of debt,'' Clinton said. ''All of you would be better off, but
only for a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''President Clinton and Al Gore consider giving working families
tax relief a risky scheme. Republicans consider it good policy,''
said Chris Paulitz, spokesman for the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paulitz said most Republicans are amused that Clinton says the
country lacks the money to give families relief but can find
millions of dollars ''for gallivanting around the world and getting
nothing accomplished.'' Paulitz said he was referring specifically
to Clinton's recent trip to India, Pakistan and Geneva where he
sought to lessen tensions between India and Pakistan and broker
peace between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's brunch was at the home of real estate developer Brian
Greenspun, also publisher of the Las Vegas Sun newspaper and
Clinton's classmate from Georgetown University. Greenspun thanked
Clinton for promising to veto a bill, passed by Congress nearly two
weeks ago, that would allow tons of radioactive nuclear waste to be
shipped to the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight from Washington, Clinton recalled that Greenspun
was on Georgetown's golf team. Then he went into a discourse about
Robert Trent Jones Sr., the golf course designer whose latest
creation opened this weekend in Las Vegas. Later, he golfed there
with Jones and his son.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's limousine broke down en route to the golf course.
Smoke began billowing out of the car's rear, so the president's
motorcade pulled to a stop on the freeway and Clinton climbed into
a limousine.

Ex-Uganda Sect Member Speaks Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- A former member of a Christian doomsday sect says the
cult's unfulfilled doomsday prophecy spurred opposition and possibly the murder
of sect dissidents. The allegation came Sunday as dignitaries joined residents
of Kanungu and nearby villages in southwestern Uganda to deplore the deaths of
924 members of a reclusive Christian doomsday sect who authorities say were
killed by their leaders. Until Sunday, no sect member, past or present, had
confirmed the common belief here: The failure of the world to end Dec. 31 led
members to demand belongings they had surrendered to join the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God -- a challenge that led to
retaliation by sect leaders.

Microsoft Case Goes Back to Judge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With settlement talks in collapse, the Microsoft antitrust
case is returning to the judge who found the software giant was a monopoly that
stifled innovation and hurt consumers. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who previously issued ''findings of fact,'' could rule any day on
Microsoft's guilt, setting off a legal marathon that could last through years of
appeals. If, as expected, Jackson lays out violations of law against the
company, he then would begin designing a remedy that could range from breaking
up Microsoft to restricting its conduct in the marketplace.

Castro: Elian's Dad May Travel to U.S.

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Elian Gonzalez's father was
willing to travel alone to the United States Monday morning if U.S. officials
promise to turn over the boy to him and let them return to Cuba right away.
Failing that, visas would be sought for father Juan Miguel Gonzalez and an
entourage of 27 others to leave for the United States as early as Tuesday to try
to get Elian back, Castro said Sunday during a live appearance on national
television. Last week, Castro said Gonzalez was willing to travel to the United
States and wait out the results of an appeal for custody by their Miami
relatives in federal appellate court, if the U.S. government gave him custody of
Elian in the meantime.

hospitalized in intensive care. Obuchi, 62, was admitted at Tokyo's Juntendo
University Hospital early Sunday after complaining of fatigue and remained under
intensive treatment Monday, Chief Cabinet secretary Mikio Aoki said. Aoki, a
close confidant of Obuchi, said he has assumed the role of acting prime minister
because it was not likely Obuchi would be able to resume his duties soon.

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A lone French oarsman abandoned his attempt
Monday to row across the Pacific Ocean after doctors sent to give him medical
supplies found traces of gangrene in both his feet. Jo Le Guen, who set off Feb.
3 from New Zealand's capital, Wellington, on his 5,580 mile voyage, aiming for
Cape Horn, Chile, was taken on board a container ship with just one-third of his
trip completed, his agent Martin Pinder said. Le Guen, 52, was found by doctors
to be suffering septicemia, or blood poisoning, and had the beginnings of
gangrene in his feet. He was delirious and too tired to speak, Pinder said.

<HEADLINE> Anna Deavere Smith puts the White House at center stage  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anna Deavere Smith doesn't need big costume
changes or lots of props to transform herself into someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing simple black slacks and a crisp white shirt, she just
slips on a tie, picks up a coffee cup or grabs a martini glass and
she changes from Abraham Lincoln to George Stephanopoulos, stopping
in between at Anita Hill and Gloria Steinem.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a playwright-performer known for her one-woman shows
about riots in Los Angeles and Brooklyn's Crown Heights, is back
with a thoughtful, provocative play that seeks to shed light on
today's America through a quintessentially American institution --
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In ''House Arrest,'' just opened at the Public Theater, Smith
revives a technique she used to powerful effect in the past. In
just under three hours, alone on stage, she portrays close to 50
real-life characters, re-enacting what they told her in interviews
or -- for those plucked from history -- reciting words they wrote or
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hopes to understand the forces that have shaped America by
looking at the men who have led us, from Thomas Jefferson to
William Jefferson Clinton. Sifting through the history of that most
mythologized, most scrutinized American institution, she delves
into issues of privacy, the press, power and race.
</P>
<P>
   After her triumph with ''Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'' -- about
that city's deadly riots -- Smith went to Washington's Arena Stage
for a new project in the mid-1990s, long before Monica Lewinsky and
Ken Starr forever changed our ideas about the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Its inhabitant, she decided, would make the perfect subject for
the next piece in her series, ''On the Road: A Search for American
Character.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to know, originally, to what extent the president
keeps us together, and to what extent he does not,'' she recalled
in an interview in a bare, spacious Public Theater rehearsal room.
''I think we're living in a time now, more than ever, where it's
difficult to conceive of the one person who can have the one
explanation for how we are, and I wanted to know why that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find the answer with ''House Arrest,'' she sings at
one moment in the drunken Scottish brogue of a 19th century
Jefferson critic and orates the next in the aristocratic Virginian
tones of the third president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Her characters, all real people, also include high-powered
Washington pundits, a rural South Carolina churchgoer and FDR's
longtime cook. She invokes them vividly and verbatim, including
every giggle, pause, and um and uh.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of ''House Arrest'' were performed in Washington
and Los Angeles with a cast of actors. But in New York it's a
one-woman show -- updated with current events. It runs through April
16 but may be extended and later taken on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 49, spent more than five years developing ''House
Arrest.'' She traveled with Clinton and Bob Dole on the 1996
campaign, interviewed three presidents and some 300 journalists,
scholars, politicians and government aides. With a team of
researchers, she pored through material on Jefferson, Lincoln and
Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   While the play's first half is historical, Act II focuses
entirely on the Clinton presidency -- sex and politics as only
modern Washington can combine them. Smith pursues the theme
suggested by her title, examining the paradox of a man who has
immense power but must live with the pressure of being watched
almost constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a celebrity culture and the president is the celebrity
in chief,'' Stephanopoulos says in the play, portrayed by Smith
with martini glass in hand. ''The deal is you can do whatever you
want. The price is, everybody's going to know everything you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny has a morbid side. Former U.S. News &AMP; World Report
photographer Brian Palmer -- Smith, in a red baseball cap pulled on
backwards -- tells how White House photographers constantly focus on
the president at public events, just in case disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wanna have the president in your view, in your viewfinder,
pretty much all the time,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Smith does in a gripping segment that combines
past and present, as she recreates Lincoln's last moments while
training a row of cameras on the doomed president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can't write a play about privacy in the White
House without Lewinsky and her blue Gap dress.
</P>
<P>
   Smith captures the fervid pursuit of sexual wrongdoing behind
the calm, legalistic face of Starr's investigation by playing one
of his deputies questioning Clinton for a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me define 'phone sex' for the purposes of my question,''
the lawyer says, recalling the complicated language Washington
created for a simple act.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright sees the Lewinsky investigation as the
culmination of a cynicism that began with the Vietnam War and
Watergate and has grown deeper since.
</P>
<P>
   In today's public life, she said, ''There isn't so much a
pursuit of truth as there is a pursuit of lies. The question is,
how will we ever move out of that? ... Spiritually, it breeds a
dreadful, dreadful cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith hopes theater can help reinvolve Americans in the nation's
future, and bridge divides like the ones around race.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mission of my adult life,'' she explains, ''is how to
cause communication across boundaries of difference, and how to use
art as part of that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''House Arrest,'' Smith traces the nation's racial divides to
its earliest days, musing over Jefferson's internal contradictions
and complicated legacy. The eloquent, intellectual author of the
Declaration of Independence owned slaves, believed black people
were inferior and did little to oppose the spread of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, he comes to symbolize the moral ambiguity on which
America was founded, and which haunts us today.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, Smith quotes documentary filmmaker Ken Burns as
saying, ''ensured that we would inherit the poison of the
indecision on race.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This idea that Jefferson was living in moral ambiguity every
single day of his life, and that there was a shadow side to
everything he did, is a part of human nature,'' Smith said. ''And
the question is, how do we work with the shadow, how do we keep it
in check?''
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, she answers herself, opening one mind at a time,
optimistic that America's deepest wounds can be healed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Slavery was a big mistake, so that seems to me to indicate
that there can also be a big lesson,'' she says. ''I don't know
that I will live to see the great symphony, the sort of Beethoven's
Ninth of America, but I believe that will happen in the next
century, and plan on living whatever time I have left to push that
along.''

<HEADLINE> Stateside Buddhists Await Visit  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. (AP) -- The placid face of a towering Buddha and
the sonorous sound of chants lend this mountainside monastery an
air of tranquility. But lately the Buddhists here are abuzz. They
are convinced His Holiness will come.
</P>
<P>
   His Holiness is a strapping 14-year-old Tibetan boy revered as
the 17th incarnation of the Karmapa, the third most important
leader in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   After making a daring escape from Tibet into India, the young
monk is now expected to visit North America, a journey likely to
boost the profile of Buddhism in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been expecting this for 12 years,'' said Chojor Radha,
an interpreter at the monastery. ''I never really lost hope. I knew
it would come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa has remained in India since his escape from Chinese
rule in January. The Indian government has been urged to grant
refuge to the Karmapa by the Dalai Lama, who is viewed as the
spiritual leader of all Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not ruled on the request. But the Karmapa
could possibly travel on documents issued by Tibet's government in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Although no travel plans have been announced, the Karmapa's
followers here are certain he will come. After all, the 16th
Karmapa -- the boy's previous incarnation -- spent a lot of time
stateside. And some Buddhists see a sign in the Karmapa's
millennium prayer for peace, which gave tidings ''especially,
throughout the land of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche, a resident lama at the Woodstock
monastery, about 85 miles north of New York City, says a visit by
the Karmapa is ''definite.'' It could be within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery is the main seat in North America -- where about
250,000 practice Buddhism -- for the Karma Kagyu sect of Tibetan
Buddhism. About two dozen Tibetans and Westerners live here
year-round. Many more people come to pray and learn from resident
lamas, who teach around the continent.
</P>
<P>
   A low-slung central temple houses a spacious shrine watched over
by an 11-foot, gold-leaf Buddha. Shoeless monks pad through airy
spaces decorated with vivid silk tapestries and infused with the
sweet smell of incense.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa chose this site near the village of Woodstock
in the 1970s. He died in 1981, leaving the 17th Karmapa to witness
the fruits of his vision. A suite for the Karmapa with a cushioned
throne and a bed stands ready. Or almost ready, considering that he
is a growing boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Holiness' bed we have to replace,'' said Tom Schmidt, a
monastery administrator. ''It's too small.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation over a visit is stoked by the Karmapa's star power.
The son of Tibetan nomads was recognized in 1992 as an incarnation
of a line of lamas dating to the 12th century. His picture has
appeared in newspapers around the world since his improbable escape
from under the watchful eyes of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Followers say he embarked on an eight-day trek to India after
sneaking out a monastery window. The Karmapa reportedly walked,
rode a horse and flew in a helicopter in a journey over snowy
mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the escape came 40 years after a similar flight
from Tibet by the Dalai Lama has added to the Karmapa's mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpochesaid he expects thousands of people to be
drawn to the Karmapa when he comes stateside.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scholars of Buddhism agree that the Karmapa is
likely to visit and to attract attention. Charles Prebish,
professor of religious studies at Penn State, said the growth in
Buddhism's popularity over the past decade in this country gives
the Karmapa a built-in audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an event, to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche says the United States continues to be a
fertile ground for Buddhism. He sees amid the materialism of
America a thirst for learning that can be slaked through the
teachings of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The analysis and reasoning aspects of Buddhism attracts a lot
of Westerners,'' said monastery administrator Schmidt, who became
attracted to Buddhism in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The visit would have special meaning for the Bardor Tulku
Rinpoche, who was dispatched to America by the 16th Karmapa in
1978. The lama -- who didn't even speak English at the time -- was
given the mission of cultivating the monastery and spreading the
teachings of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche can now show his accomplishments to the
reincarnation of the lama who sent him here: ''The only difference
is his body. His heart is the same.''

<HEADLINE> Ecstasy Flow Said Becoming Epidemic  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawyer arriving from Paris is stopped at John
F. Kennedy International Airport for a routine customs inspection.
Discovered in the false bottom of his bag are 21,000 ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli is overheard on a wiretap arranging illicit
deliveries of ecstasy to Manhattan hotels. Investigators seize
300,000 pills worth $7.5 million and make 32 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   A young ultra-Orthodox Jew, about to be sentenced in Brooklyn,
laments accepting a free flight to Belgium in exchange for
returning with luggage laden with a designer drug -- again, ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities cite these recent cases and others as proof that New
York City has become the epicenter of a national boom in illegal
imports of ecstasy, the synthetic ''psychedelic amphetamine'' also
known as MDMA, or simply ''E.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizures of the innocent-looking tablets -- some are embossed
with smiley faces, shamrocks or Playboy bunny ears -- have
multiplied like rabbits. U.S. Customs reports it confiscated 3.5
million pills throughout the country in fiscal 1999, compared to
750,000 in 1998; the total has already reached 4 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City area alone, the totals were 1.3 million
pills in 1999, up from 48,400 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Agents have discovered ecstasy stashed in airmailed packages,
and in imported cars and antique furniture. But mainly, it's
smuggled in luggage carried by couriers from Europe, where pills
are produced for less than a dollar for sale in a youthful and
expanding U.S. market for up to $40 a piece, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Using undercover officers and cooperating suspects, authorities
have learned that the New York imports serve a vast Northeast
market. Federal officials, who asked not to be identified, said New
York appeared to be the largest American gateway for ecstasy based
on number of pills seized.
</P>
<P>
   Other major entry points include Miami and Orlando. Memphis -- a
hub for international air deliveries -- is the main supplier for
California.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion dollar profit potential has attracted an
eclectic collection of traffickers working in varied locales, as
evidenced by the Feb. 24 arrest of notorious mob turncoat Salvatore
''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano for his alleged role in an ecstasy ring
in Phoenix, and the seizure of 30,000 pills carried by an air
traveler to Cincinnati three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Israeli and Russian organized crime groups -- and
even some members of Brooklyn's conservative Jewish communities --
are hooked on dealing ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Gluck, 19, was one of several young Hasidic men recruited
by an Amsterdam-based ring which believed their traditional black
hats, dark suits and sidecurls would deflect suspicion. They were
given the trips to Europe and cash in exchange for smuggling back
millions of pills.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have responded to the ecstasy explosion with a
flurry of enforcement measures and war-on-drugs rhetoric
reminiscent of the crack cocaine scare of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only with a concerted global law enforcement offensive can we
conquer this threat,'' the acting head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Donnie Marshall, declared last month after
authorities shut down an East Coast ring selling 100,000 pills a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly has used the agency's Web
site, www.customs.gov, to warn parents that ecstasy abuse -- once
confined to urban dance parties known as ''raves'' -- has become a
''full-fledged epidemic'' spreading into suburbia and other
sheltered communities.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner and others also have repeatedly cited medical
evidence that ecstasy causes severe dehydration, dizziness and
headaches or, with prolonged use, depression, memory loss and even
permanent brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a notion that ecstasy makes you feel good, that
there's no downside,'' Kelly said in an interview. ''But there's
plenty of horror stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The DEA classifies ecstasy in the same category as LSD and
heroin. As with those drugs, federal defendants face stiff
penalties. For instance, the suppliers in the Hasidic courier case
face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentencing guidelines, critics charge, are too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a drastic difference between ecstasy and crack cocaine
or heroin, but the guidelines don't appreciate that difference,''
said Joseph Tacopina, a defense attorney representing a real estate
owner in another federal ecstasy conspiracy case.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-ecstasy Web sites argue the drug bears no real resemblance
to hard-core narcotics. They note both the absence of widespread
gunplay, turf wars, overdoses and physical addiction associated
with the cocaine and heroin trade, and ecstasy's history of use by
some therapists to enhance psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   One student at Bard College, a small liberal arts school north
of New York City, says ecstasy is readily available through a
network of fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been the one drug where there's been the steadiest supply
this semester,'' the student, who asked that his name not be used,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said he takes a $25 ''hit'' of ecstasy before going to small
weekend dance parties. The drug, he added, is considered on par
with marijuana and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like it's not a big deal around here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Worker Perk: Pet Insurance  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rene Castro's cat, Mitsu, developed a uterine
infection last year and needed a hysterectomy that cost $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, his 6-pound Maltese dog, Princess, dislocated a
disc when she fell off the sofa. The bill for treatment including a
CAT scan was $750.
</P>
<P>
   So Castro was thrilled when his employer, Lenox Hill Hospital,
added pet health insurance to its list of optional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody went crazy,'' said Castro, who supervises the
sterilization of instruments in the hospital's operating room. ''I
think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Hill is among a small but growing number of companies
offering some form of health insurance for their workers' pets.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hirsch of Pet Assure Inc. in Dover, N.J., which manages
the Lenox Hill pet insurance program, said the program is one of
several employee benefits being added as a defense against a tight
labor market and booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employers are looking for ways to attract and keep their
favored employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine exactly how many employers offer pet
health insurance. Kristin Accipiter, spokeswoman for the Society
for Human Resource Management, said a survey of her organization's
130,000 members found 1 percent of companies offered the benefit
last year, the first time the question was included in the annual
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lewis, vice president for marketing and communications
at Veterinary Pet Insurance Inc. in Anaheim, Calif., said her
company has sold individual policies since 1982 but group plans for
employers only started taking off in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a real big interest from a corporate standpoint,''
Lewis said. ''With unemployment low, benefits become a real key
part of retaining and obtaining new employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, she said, ''The role of the pet has truly evolved.
Pets are seen more as a family member.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said VPI has between 75 and 100 corporate members
nationwide, including St. Louis-based Ralston Purina Co. and Mirage
Resorts Inc., which is being bought by rival MGM Grand Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, a spokesman for Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts,
said the company started offering pet insurance about six months
ago, and so far just under 100 of Mirage's 32,000 employees have
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   VPI offers a typical indemnity plan, with average premiums of
$200 a year and a $40 deductible. VPI covers only dogs and cats,
and pre-existing conditions generally are not covered.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Pet Assure, is not a traditional insurance program
but ''kind of an HMO for pets,'' said Hirsh, the company's director
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Members pay a small fee -- at Lenox Hill it's a $4 monthly
payroll deduction -- and get a 25 percent discount at network
providers. All animals are covered regardless of age, infirmity or
species.
</P>
<P>
   Erin O'Connor, vice president for human resources at Lenox Hill,
said the hospital signed on after polling its employees about what
new benefits they would like. Life insurance for spouses was the
top choice, followed by car and home insurance. Pet health
insurance was No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   So far 50 employees out of about 2,800 at Lenox Hill have signed
up for the pet insurance program, which went into effect Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Florida Gets a Kick Out of Program  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Football at Florida is a religion. Billy
Donovan is doing his best to make sure it's not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators play Michigan State tonight for the national
basketball championship. If Florida wins, it will become just the
sixth school with national titles in both major men's sports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hype over football, the Florida basketball team
would have just as many national championships as the football team
if it beats the Spartans: one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, yeah, it's definitely a basketball school now,'' coach
Donovan said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came here knowing this is not a basketball school, nor is it
ever going to be a basketball school. All I'm concerned about is
doing the best job I can.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a lot of ground to cover and did it much quicker than
anyone thought possible. At 34, the fast talker from Long Island is
on the verge of becoming the third youngest coach to win a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   He has done it with a running, 3-point-shooting style of play --
they call it Billy Ball -- that rivals Steve Spurrier's Fun 'N' Gun
as the most exciting offense on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier says he fully supports the basketball team. He'll be at
home tonight, watching the game on TV just like thousands of other
Gators fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stark contrast from years past, when the buzz around
Gainesville would have been spring football practice and next
weekend's annual football scrimmage, the Orange and Blue game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Football has always had a big interest in the South,''
Spurrier said. ''As far as basketball goes, when you're hanging NIT
banners in your gym, that says you don't have much of a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I had no doubt Billy could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, athletic director Jeremy Foley hired Donovan
away from Marshall. As much as a turnaround, Foley needed a name,
personality and style fans could rally behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at some of the scores of when Billy was in
Marshall,'' Foley said. ''He lost to Kentucky 120-98. It was a
loss, but at least there's some entertainment value there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the team began to win, more fans turned out. Many students,
known as the Rowdy Reptiles, spend hours outside the arena before
big games, lining up for prime seats that were empty in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   Florida averaged 9,783 fans this season, about 3,500 more than
when Donovan arrived.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, longtime Florida fan Patrick Geraghty had
trouble getting tickets for the marquee games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, that's unbelievable,'' said Geraghty, who drives four
hours from Fort Myers to watch the Gators. ''Next year, I'm
planning on buying season tickets, even if I only go to one or two
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Gators fans wonder how long the success will last. They
also wonder if Donovan will tire of working in Spurrier's shadow,
and leave for a school with more basketball tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Foley gave Donovan a healthy contract extension last year and is
making every effort to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he leaves, it won't be because of petty jealousies,'' Foley
said. ''Steve Spurrier and Billy Donovan get along and work very
well together. We have a very fine football program. We have a very
fine basketball program. I don't see any reason why everyone can't
coexist together.''

<HEADLINE> Spartans Happy To Run With Florida  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State knows how to win at just
about any game: fast, slow, bruising defense, run-and-gun offense.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Florida wants to try in tonight's national championship
game, the Spartans are saying, ''Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be remembered as champions,'' forward A.J. Granger
said Sunday. ''No one remembers who came in second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans got caught up in an ugly defensive struggle in
their 53-41 win Saturday night over Wisconsin. Tonight, they'll
play an up-tempo game against the high-energy Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Either style is fine with the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying it's not going to be tough and physical against
Florida, but we pretty much can get more up-and-down and try to
play our style of basketball,'' point guard Mateen Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the same style Florida favors.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators look more like greyhounds on paper. They averaged
84.1 points during the season and 79.4 points in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans are big, fast and athletic, too. They averaged
73.7 points during the season. That's easy to overlook after
watching them play a slow-down team like Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans beat Mississippi State 96-63; Illinois -- a team
very much like Florida -- 91-66; and Michigan 114-63.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our players are confident that no matter who we play,
we've played somebody like them,'' coach Tom Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is Izzo's doing. He's the one who scheduled
nonconference games against Texas, North Carolina, Kansas, Arizona
and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Spartans believe they should be able to handle
Florida's vaunted press. Other good teams have pressed them -- and
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans beat UConn 85-66. Syracuse, another good pressing
team, led the Spartans by 14 points early in the second half of a
regional semifinal game, but lost by 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we match up with Florida very well,'' said forward
Andre Hutson, who handles the low post for Michigan State. ''They
don't have anyone really tall or bigger than we are.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are big physically and very athletic, just like we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State averaged 12 more rebounds a game than opponents
during the season. Florida's margin, by comparison, was 5.4
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rebounding will be a big key, especially because of their
style,'' the 6-foot-8, 240-pound Hutson said. ''We're going to send
four guys to the boards, just like we always do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this game might be decided the way so many Michigan
State games are decided -- by the play of Cleaves. Forward Morris
Peterson has scored the big points in this tournament, but Cleaves
is still the leader.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that Cleaves, a three-time All-American, stayed in
school to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell him it's like Deion Sanders,'' Izzo said. ''It's prime
time, and he's a prime-time player. A lot is going to be on his
shoulders.''

<HEADLINE> Junior Time Starts in Cincy  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting today, the National League is the Junior Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As in Ken Griffey Jr., who -- weather permitting -- makes his
debut for the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son's skipping school on opening day. It's a tradition,''
Griffey said. ''Cincinnati expects that a lot of kids are not going
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa will have the first
faceoff in the Home Run Central.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, Kerry Ligtenberg, Moises Alou and Jason
Kendall will be back.
</P>
<P>
   And John Rocker, John Smoltz, Curt Schilling, Kerry Wood, Matt
Williams, Darryl Strawberry and umpire Richie Garcia will be among
the missing.
</P>
<P>
   The first full day of baseball in the new century -- did those
games in Japan last week really count? -- is filled with a year's
worth of plot lines.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey renewed baseball's buzz in Cincinnati when he forced
Seattle to trade him to his hometown team on Feb. 10. With their
annual parade, the Reds -- who started play in 1869, 31 years before
the AL began -- get the most worked up about opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to see Junior get announced,'' Reds first baseman
Hal Morris said Sunday, a day before the Reds open the North
American portion of the baseball season against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''In '91, there was tremendous excitement because we'd just won
the World Series,'' Morris said. ''I think this matches if not
surpasses that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs split a two-game series
in Tokyo last week -- the first season opener outside North America
-- the other 28 clubs were still at spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the NL schedule has the Cubs at St. Louis, San Diego
at the Mets, Colorado at Atlanta, Los Angeles at Montreal, San
Francisco at Florida, and Houston at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In the AL, the New York Yankees are at Anaheim as they start the
quest to become the first team to win three straight World Series
since the 1972-74 Oakland Athletics. They'll be missing Darryl
Strawberry, again suspended for cocaine use, this time for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's pressure because we're the Yankees,'' second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch said. ''It's a double-barreled thing,
because we're the Yankees and we're the defending champions, so
everybody is gunning for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, the Chicago White Sox are at Texas, Cleveland
is at Baltimore, Kansas City at Toronto, Tampa Bay at Minnesota,
and Detroit at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Two openers are scheduled for Tuesday, with Philadelphia at
Arizona, and Boston at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will see new crews of mixed AL and NL umps. The new union,
which replaced Richie Phillips' Major League Umpires Association,
agreed to the merger as part of baseball's elimination of separate
league offices.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, perhaps the most recognizable umpire, won't be on the
field and Frank Pulli won't be, either. They are among 22 umps
still trying to regain their jobs, the result of Phillips' failed
mass resignation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also will be missing, serving a two-week suspension -- an
arbitrator cut it from four weeks -- for disparaging gays,
foreigners, minorities and New Yorkers in a magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, his Atlanta teammate, is out for the season with a torn
elbow ligament, but Ligtenberg, the Braves' closer in 1998, has
returned from ligament-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood, the NL Rookie of the Year for the Cubs in 1998, is
still rehabbing from the same injury, and Schilling, Philadelphia's
ace, is working his way back from shoulder surgery. Williams, a big
reason Arizona won the NL West in only its second season, broke a
bone in his foot last week and will miss at least the first month
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, back from cancer treatment, has reclaimed his
first-base spot in Atlanta, and Alou is back with Houston following
a knee injury that caused him to miss all of 1999. Kendall returned
to the Pirates after a gruesome ankle injury last July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Managers making debuts with new teams today are Mike Hargrove
(Baltimore), Charlie Manuel (Cleveland), Davey Lopes (Milwaukee),
Mike Scioscia (Anaheim), Buddy Bell (Colorado) and Phil Garner
(Detroit). Don Baylor made his with the Cubs in Tokyo last week.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's focus, at least for the start, will be on the NL
Central, dubbed the Home Run Central. Can Griffey, McGwire and Sosa
combine to top 180 homers?
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus on McGwire and Sosa comes from the media as much as
the fans,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ''I don't think
there's anything wrong with that part of the game getting a lot of
attention, as long as the teams are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, owner George Steinbrenner will keep pressure on
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure's always there; it's part of what we do,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ''Relaxation won't happen, but
confidence is there when you do it two years in a row.''

<HEADLINE> Florida, MSU Ready To Battle  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State is ready to run. Florida
never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   They meet at warp speed tonight in the NCAA championship game,
with the Spartans hoping to rejoin the modern basketball world
after a turn-back-the-clock victory over Wisconsin in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, the Gators will be open to the idea of opening up
things.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're playing Wisconsin, it's tough,'' said Michigan
State's Mateen Cleaves, still wincing at the memory of a 53-41
victory, the lowest-scoring Final Four game since the shot clock
was added in 1986. ''Hopefully, we can get up and down and play our
style of basketball against Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators (29-7) start running as soon as the ball is tossed in
the air and don't let up until the horn sounds. There seems to be
no method to their style of play, just five guys running around
like dogs chasing their tails. Of course, it all makes perfect
sense to the man who orchestrates the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every team in the country practices their half-court
offense,'' coach Billy Donovan said. ''We try to be as disruptive
as possible and take teams out of what they practice on a regular
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Spartans (31-7) are most effective in a half-court
game, where they can crash the boards and be physical. But Michigan
State can get up and down the court, having scored more than 80
points nine times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like to run, too,'' coach Tom Izzo said. ''I think we have
an understanding for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Spartans comprehend the kind of unrelenting pressure
they'll face from Florida?
</P>
<P>
   The 10-deep Gators wore down three higher-seeded teams --
Illinois, top-ranked Duke and Oklahoma State -- in the East Regional
before doing the same against North Carolina in the semifinals,
rallying from a six-point deficit in the second half for a 71-59
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see them holding their shorts or walking back to the
huddle,'' guard Teddy Dupay said, relaying the telltale signs of a
fatigued team. ''We run back to the huddle like, 'Come on guys,
we've got 'em. They're tired.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State was the only No. 1 seed to reach the Final Four
and has lived up to the role of favorite, winning every game in the
tournament by at least 11 points. But the five starters average
between 27 and 35 minutes a game, with only two reserves playing
more than 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt that Florida is the deepest, most talented
team we've played,'' Izzo said. ''It seems like everybody they
bring in is a clone of the guy he replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, seeded fifth, got a scare from Butler in the first
round, winning in overtime on Mike Miller's last-second shot. Since
then, the Gators have looked unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand how fragile this whole thing is now,'' Donovan
said. ''But I also realize that if you go through every team that's
won a national championship, there's been that game. ... Everybody
has close games.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State starts three seniors who have been focused on
nothing less than a championship after losing to Duke in the
semifinals a year ago. Florida, on the other hand, has seven
sophomores and freshmen in its rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our youthfulness has won us a lot of basketball games this
year,'' said Kenyan Weaks, Florida's lone senior. ''I don't know if
that's going to be a big problem in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Spartans turned to an age-old method of getting
ready to face a pressing team, working the ball up court against
six or seven defensive players. But their effectiveness against
Florida will likely be determined by Cleaves, the senior point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never have a chance to relax,'' he said. ''You can't relax
or take plays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State is trying to become the first Big Ten team to win
the national championship since Michigan in 1989. The Spartans'
only national championship came in 1979, when Magic Johnson led
them to the title as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year we got here and that was cool, but we went home
empty-handed,'' Cleaves said. ''It's great to get here but you'll
always be remembered as a national champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida is looking for its first national championship while
keeping alive the Southeastern Conference's even-year streak;
Arkansas won in 1994 and Kentucky won in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, one of six men to play and coach in a Final Four, is
looking to join even more select company.
</P>
<P>
   Only Bob Knight and Dean Smith have played in a Final Four and
coached a national champion. At 34, Donovan would be the
third-youngest coach to win it all behind Indiana's Branch
McCracken in 1940 and Wisconsin's Harold Foster in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody keeps saying the same thing ... enjoy it,'' Donovan
said. ''Right now, I don't want to enjoy it. I want to exhaust
every possible avenue I have as a coach to put these guys in the
best possible position to win.''

<HEADLINE> Mickelson Wins BellSouth Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULUTH, Ga. (AP) -- Phil Mickelson beat a Nicklaus on a Georgia
golf course in April. Too bad his victory in the BellSouth Classic
didn't come with a green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will happen this week, when Mickelson will try to
take the momentum -- not to mention a short game that is getting
better every week -- to Augusta National for another chance at his
first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last few years, I've put myself in contention and almost
won the Masters with the short game that has been less than I
expect,'' he said Sunday after beating Gary -- not Jack -- Nicklaus
on the first playoff hole when the final round was washed out by
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that this year around the green, I'm as good as I have
possibly ever been,'' he said. ''I expect to do well next week
because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need much a short game Sunday, a soggy day on the TPC
at Sugarloaf in which only two shots were required for Mickelson to
bag his 15th victory -- a 9-iron into 18 feet on the par-3 16th and
a birdie putt that really didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   He earned $504,000, each shot worth $252,000. It also made the
drive east on Interstate 20 a little sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Augusta provides a great opportunity for me to win my
first major,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's true in at least one sense -- it's the next major.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus never really had a chance as soon as his 8-iron came
off a little heavy, a high price for such a small miss. The ball
caught the bunker, stopped 4 inches away from a 10-inch lip that
left Nicklaus virtually no shot.
</P>
<P>
   It took him two shots out of the sand to reach the green, and
Mickelson pulled his birdie putt from the cup before Nicklaus
picked up his ball mark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nicklaus earned $302,400, which should be enough to keep
his card for next year. And he proved something to himself, even if
he didn't get a full round to state his case as a solid player who
just happens to be the 31-year-old son of Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I proved to myself that I can win out here,'' Nicklaus said.
''I was one shot away from winning the tournament, one hole against
one of the best players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Perry and Harrison Frazar tied for third, two strokes out
of the lead. They were among 19 players within five shots of the
leaders who never got a chance to make up ground on the final day.
</P>
<P>
   The tour contemplated a Monday finish, but the forecast was just
as bad for the next two days. It was the first time a ''final
round'' featured only one hole since Woods beat Tom Lehman in a
playoff at La Costa to win the 1997 Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson and Nicklaus each finished at 11-under 205, and headed
to the 16th for a playoff that lasted only about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After going 18 months without a victory, Mickelson is slowly
returning to the form that made him a threat to win just about
every time he played. It was the fifth time he has won at least
twice in one season, and he joined Tiger Woods as the only players
with multiple victories on the PGA Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as Mickelson is, it was the second time this year
that he toppled a gallery favorite. In San Diego, he wasted a
seven-stroke lead and recovered to win the Buick Invitational by
four shots over Woods, ending the longest tour winning streak in 55
years at six tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like there were a lot of people who were tired of the
streak and were very glad that I ended it,'' Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
   At Sugarloaf, despite four teen-agers who painted P-H-I-L on
their chests, the gallery was pulling for a familiar face with a
familiar name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gary is a very good player and he's been in a difficult
situation his entire life, trying to play golf for a living in the
shadow of the greatest player of all time,'' Mickelson said. ''I
think he's handled that situation very well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been very nice for him to have been able to
break through and get his first tournament win. I didn't want it to
be at my expense. So I don't feel bad about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mickelson is loaded with confidence going to Augusta,
Nicklaus feels the same way, even though he has to wait until the
MCI Classic for another chance at being more than just the Golden
Cub.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big milestone for me,'' he said. ''It gives my
confidence a boost. It just lets me know that good things are
coming down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that road doesn't lead to Augusta this year.

<HEADLINE> Even Pete's Grandma Had Game  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Tough love meant one thing in the Peterson
household and something else on the basketball court. That's where
the women teaching the brash young man to play the game came up
with their motto: Defeat him or die trying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always felt like if I beat one of them -- at anything -- that
I'd really accomplished something,'' Michigan State's Morris
Peterson recalled on the eve of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be opening the window fastest, stepping in the front
door first, anything. Win and you could brag the rest of the day.
That's where I learned to be so competitive. Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of college basketball has been paying for those lessons
ever since. They began when Morris and Valarie Peterson's youngest
child and only son was a 6-year-old who liked talking trash almost
as much as playing. They ended a half-dozen years after that, when
the women turned Morris over to boys his own age and size.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents coached basketball at nearby middle schools in
Flint, Mich., so even after they divorced in 1983, Morris never
lacked instruction -- or competition. Both of his sisters, Tonda and
Trina, older by five and two years, respectively, were already
budding stars who would play in college.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, in turn, made sure none of them ever lacked motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd make a shot -- one shot! -- and he'd go on like he was
Muhammad Ali,'' Valarie recalled. ''He'd get up in your eyes and
scream, 'I'm bad! I'm the greatest!' And he wouldn't shut up.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so,'' she added, ''we banded together.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, called Pete by those closest to him, could play. It
was just his bad luck to be born into a family where everyone
could. Even his grandmother, the late Clara Mae Spencer, had game.
What separated her from the other Peterson women is she didn't make
a point of letting Morris know it.
</P>
<P>
   Valarie had no such qualms. When Morris laughed at stories about
how good a player she had been, his sisters arranged a 3-point
shooting contest. Morris made one and missed; Valarie sank five
straight, turned and walked off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should have seen poor Morris,'' Tonda Broom said. ''His
eyes were as big as doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonda went next. In a game to 25 baskets, Morris jumped out to a
23-11 lead. Everything was running smooth until he opened his
mouth. His countenance turns mournful at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''She pushed me, knocked me down and blocked every one of my
shots after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tonda was the enforcer, Trina the finesse player. Playing
against both, Peterson learned to bang inside against the
Wisconsins of the world, and hold his own in jump-shooting duels
with run-and-gun outfits like Syracuse. The downside is he was
nearing his 12th birthday before he had a ''W'' over anybody in the
family -- except Clara Mae.
</P>
<P>
   ''And she could have beat him, because she was an athlete,
too,'' Valarie said. ''But she was a softy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond forged between the old woman and her first grandson was
finally loosened March 25, when Spencer died at 72, a month after a
stroke. Peterson attended her funeral Thursday, but three days
later, he still regretted not making a last visit.

<P>
   ''She wouldn't mind, because she knew this was his time of
year,'' said Christine Bender Williams, her sister. ''I can say
that, because I feel like I'm representing her. I know if she
could, she'd tell us to go on and do whatever is going to help Pete
take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times after he did that in Saturday's semifinal,
Peterson pointed his index finger toward the sky. On the side of
his sneakers, too, he scribbled, ''R.I.P. Clara Mae Spencer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the games and the practices have provided welcome
distractions. To pass the time between, Peterson relied on teammate
Mateen Cleaves, who grew up playing alongside and against him since
they were 7-year-old prodigies on the Flint playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they put off the NBA draft to return for their senior
seasons. Then they survived a rough stretch last fall when Cleaves,
sidelined with a broken foot, pushed Peterson to assume a greater
leadership role with the Spartans. Now, Cleaves provides Peterson
with the quiet reassurance that Spencer once did.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she was with him out there,'' Cleaves said after
Peterson scored 20 points to beat Wisconsin. ''She carried some of
those shots for him.''

<HEADLINE> Some employers now offer health insurance for Fido and Fluffy  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rene Castro's cat, Mitsu, developed a uterine
infection last year and needed a hysterectomy that cost $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, his 6-pound Maltese dog, Princess, dislocated a
disc when she fell off the sofa. The bill for treatment including a
CAT scan was $750.
</P>
<P>
   So Castro was thrilled when his employer, Lenox Hill Hospital,
added pet health insurance to its list of optional benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody went crazy,'' said Castro, who supervises the
sterilization of instruments in the hospital's operating room. ''I
think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Hill is among a small but growing number of companies
offering some form of pet health insurance to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hirsch, of Pet Assure Inc. in Dover, N.J., which manages
the Lenox Hill pet insurance program, said the program is one of
several employee benefits being added in the current booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employers are looking for ways to attract and keep their
favored employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine exactly how many employers offer pet
health insurance. Kristin Accipiter, spokeswoman for the Society
for Human Resource Management, said a 1999 survey of her
organization's 130,000 members found that 1 percent of companies
offered the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the first time the question was included in the
annual survey, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lewis, vice president for marketing and communications
at Veterinary Pet Insurance Inc., in Anaheim, Calif., said her
company has sold individual policies since 1982 but group plans for
employers only started taking off in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a real big interest from a corporate standpoint,''
Lewis said. ''With unemployment low, benefits become a real key
part of retaining and obtaining new employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, she said, ''The role of the pet has truly evolved.
Pets are seen more as a family member.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said VPI has between 75 and 100 corporate members
nationwide, including Ralston Purina and Mirage Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, a spokesman for Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts,
said the company started offering pet insurance about six months
ago, and so far just under 100 of Mirage's 32,000 employees have
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wonderful convenience for employees who are looking for
this kind of insurance for their furry loved ones,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   VPI offers a typical indemnity plan, with average premiums of
$200 a year and a $40 deductible. VPI covers only dogs and cats,
and pre-existing conditions generally are not covered.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Pet Assure is not a traditional insurance program
but ''kind of an HMO for pets,'' said Hirsh, the company's director
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Members pay a small fee -- at Lenox Hill it's a $4 monthly
payroll deduction -- and get a 25 percent discount at network
providers. All animals are covered regardless of age, infirmity or
species.
</P>
<P>
   Erin O'Connor, vice president for human resources at Lenox Hill,
said the program costs the hospital nothing except administrative
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Hill signed on after polling its employees about what new
benefits they would like. Life insurance for spouses was the top
choice, followed by car and home insurance. Pet health insurance
was No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''It did surprise me,'' O'Connor said. ''I didn't really think
that many people knew it was something that was available.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ''If you've ever had a pet get very ill, it can
be very expensive. And there are many people who want to see
everything done to save their pet, but cost often impedes them in
their ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far 50 employees out of about 2,800 have signed up for the
pet insurance program, which went into effect Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect that we'll get additional enrollments as it becomes
an established program,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 percent discount may not sound like much, but Castro
noted, ''It's better than what we had before, which was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He regularly pays at least $300 for a physical for Princess, a
bright-eyed 8-year-old who was dressed in a sweater for a jaunt
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife worries so much about her; anything abnormal, she runs
to the vet,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that not everyone would spend $1,700 on a
hysterectomy for a cat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't let her suffer,'' Castro said. ''She would have
died.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Yagudin Establishing Pattern  </HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- Midway between Winter Olympics, Michelle
Kwan and Alexei Yagudin are establishing a nice pattern.
</P>
<P>
   For Kwan it is every other year a world title. For Yagudin every
year a world title.
</P>
<P>
   That seems good for both leading up to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan has won in 1996, 1998 and now 2000. Yagudin's series is
1998, 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Following a hectic beginning that had crashes and slashes in the
pairs at the World Figure Skating Championships, the women's free
skate Saturday was simply about the skating.
</P>
<P>
   In a difficult transitional year, Kwan won what she says is the
most satisfying of her three titles. She admitted having trouble
adjusting to college and not skating as much as she would have
liked in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   She buckled down over the winter and focused on adding tougher
jumps. Kwan's short and long programs were the most technically
difficult of her career -- and she needed nothing less to vault from
third place in the short program to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never felt like that! I never felt as fast,'' Kwan said
coming off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan admitted that besides experiencing trouble balancing
skating with college, she had difficulty renewing her motivation.
Still just 19, she's already skated in seven worlds.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, if all goes right, it will be up to eight heading into
the Olympics in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, triple-triples -- perhaps two sets of them -- will
be needed in the women's program. Kwan put one in this year and
there is already talk of another by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Slutskaya, whom Kwan beat for this year's title, has
already been there. Although she didn't do them in the women's free
skate as promised, she did two of them at the Grand Prix final to
beat Kwan.
</P>
<P>
   And after coming in a disappointing second in Nice, Slutskaya
still seeks her first world championship. Look what happened when
she missed making the Russian team last year. She merely lost some
weight, added triple-triples, regained her European title and her
second-place ranking in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin has known nothing but top rankings since the 1998
Olympics, winning every world title.
</P>
<P>
   The key is staying one step ahead of a strong field.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when others were flirting with the quad, he was the
most consistent skater and won his second world championship in
Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Now others are hitting the quad more regularly, so what does
Yagudin do to challenge that? He puts together a program with two
quads.
</P>
<P>
   There were 20 quads in all by nine men. American Tim Goebel did
four, as did Yagudin, but placed 11th because his other jumps were
hampered by a sore muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time U.S. champion Michael Weiss used a quad to come in
third behind Yagudin and Elvis Stojko of Canada, also a three-time
world champ.
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin continually ups the ante when challenged. This year, he
lost his European title to Yevgeny Plushchenko. But at worlds,
Yagudin was wearing the gold medal and Plushchenko didn't have any
medal, due to a critical breakdown in the free skate, when he
failed on three quads.
</P>
<P>
   The championships were marked by the domination of the Russians,
although they failed to sweep all four titles, something they did
last year -- the first country to take all four disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The ice dance crown escaped them, although they can claim a part
of it with Moscow-born Marina Anissina teaming with Gwendal
Peizerat representing France. They earned the only 6.0s of the
competition for their free dance before a boisterous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The pairs, marked by all kinds of dramatics, went to Russia's
Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. They took over when teammates
Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze withdrew because she had
failed a drug test for a stimulant in a medication for bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   French pairs skater Stephane Bernadis overcame the shock of a
razor attack at his hotel by an unknown assailant to team with
Sarah Abitbol and win the bronze medal.

<P>
   One week left and there's still plenty to decide in the NHL
playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal earned a point the hard way Sunday night, losing 6-5 in
overtime at Detroit. The Canadiens rallied from a three-goal hole
and two third-period deficits, only to fall behind the Red Wings
again with only 2:59 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadiens tied it with 1:02 remaining in the third
before Martin Lapointe ended it with 14.4 seconds to go in the
extra session.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play well when we're down. Somehow we have to change
that,'' Montreal forward Brian Savage said. ''But we come out of
Detroit with a point. We're not going to complain about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulation tie was enough to pull Montreal into a
ninth-place tie with Buffalo, just one point behind Carolina, the
current holder of the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main thing is it's still in our hands,'' Montreal's Shane
Corson said. ''We still have a heartbeat. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes jumped back into the key slot with a 1-0 victory
over Philadelphia. Bates Batagglia scored on a breakaway just 1:18
into the game and Arturs Irbe stopped all 31 Flyers shots.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's loss, coupled with New Jersey's 4-1 victory over
Tampa Bay, pushed the Flyers four points behind the Devils in the
Atlantic Division. New Jersey, with 101 points, went over the
100-point mark for the fourth straight season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils also lead the Washington Capitals by two points for
the top seed in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was St. Louis 4, Ottawa 1; Colorado 3, Dallas
2 in overtime; Atlanta 5, the New York Islanders 4; and Vancouver
3, Chicago 2.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Stevenson scored one of Montreal's three third-period
goals and assisted on another by Martin Rucinsky. Patrice Brisebois
and Savage also scored for the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still alive,'' Canadiens coach Alain Vigneault said.
''It's going to be a tough fight down to the end. It's going to be
a fun week of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Shanahan scored his 40th goal, Sergei Fedorov had a goal
and an assist and Steve Duchesne also scored for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't much clearer in the Western Conference. The Red
Wings' victory kept Detroit three points behind St. Louis for the
conference's top spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their backs were against the wall and they needed some
points,'' Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said of the Canadiens. ''They
charged in and things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado extended its Northwest Division lead over Edmonton to
six points. Vancouver inched within one point of San Jose for the
eighth and final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
Avalanche 3, Stars 2
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein stole the puck from goalie Ed Belfour behind the
net and scored a short-handed goal with 47 seconds left in
overtime, lifting Colorado over visiting Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy had 22 saves for his 443rd regular-season victory,
four shy of NHL career leader Terry Sawchuk.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque and Adam Deadmarsh also scored for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull and Sylvain Cote had Dallas goals. Hull scored his
609th career goal, one fewer than his father, Bobby.
</P>
<P>
Hurricanes 1, Flyers 0
</P>
<P>
   Arturs Irbe stopped 31 shots to lead Carolina past Philadelphia
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe set a franchise record with his 32nd victory and recorded
his fifth shutout this season, one shy of his career high.
</P>
<P>
Devils 4, Lightning 1
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias had two goals and Martin Brodeur stopped 26 shots
as New Jersey won at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who tied Terry Sawchuk for the most wins over a
five-year span with 195, lost his shutout when Fredrik Modin scored
with 3:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Malakhov and Scott Stevens also scored for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
Blues 4, Senators 1
</P>
<P>
   Backup goalie Jamie McLennan stopped 26 shots, and Scott Young
scored twice, leading St. Louis over Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has won 55 straight when it scores three or more goals
in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, who last won a division title in 1987, are 7-1-2 in
their last 10 games. The Senators, who have also clinched a playoff
spot, have lost six of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Turgeon and Todd Reirden also scored for St. Louis, which
beat Ottawa at home for the first time since 1993. Blues defenseman
Al MacInnis played in his 1,200th career game.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa center Radek Bonk scored his 22nd goal.
</P>
<P>
Canucks 3, Blackhawks 2
</P>
<P>
   Denis Pederson had two goals and an assist as Vancouver won at
Chicago. Ed Jovanovski also scored for the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks goaltender Felix Potvin stopped 17 shots. He lost a bid
for his second shutout this season with 5:54 left when Bryan McCabe
beat him with a 30-foot shot. Steve Sullivan made it 3-2 with 1:10
left.
</P>
<P>
Thrashers 5, Islanders 4
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette scored on a third-period breakaway as Atlanta
snapped a 17-game home-winless streak, beating the New York
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ferraro had a goal and two assists for the expansion
Thrashers, who were 0-15-2 at Philips Arena since Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, the NHL's worst team, had lost five straight and was
1-16-1 since winning at Colorado on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who got two goals from Mike Watt, lost to the
Thrashers for the third time in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta goalie Damian Rhodes, playing his 10th straight game,
stopped 17 shots.

<HEADLINE> Kite Wins Senior Title in Playoff  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tom Watson turned 50 last Sept. 4, and
by the end of 1999 Lanny Wadkins and Tom Kite also came of PGA
Senior age.
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of new blood into a tour where Arnold Palmer, Jack
Nicklaus and Lee Trevino no longer ruled was eagerly anticipated --
not only by fans, but by the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kite showed why on Sunday, beating Watson in a monumental,
six-hole playoff to get his first senior win in the Tradition, the
tour's first major.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time that we hit our prime did not really coincide,'' Kite
said. ''Lanny was the best early on. He had his really good years
in the '70s. Tom came in in the late 70s and started winning and
won throughout the '80s, and I really didn't hit stride until the
'80s and early '90s. So even though we're contemporaries, we
haven't had that many opportunities to go head-to-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite ended the 24-hole endurance test with a 1-foot birdie putt
after Watson nearly birdied with a chip from behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson also finished regulation at 8-under-par 280, but
missed his chance to win when he two-putted from 5 feet on the 18th
green. Then he bogeyed the second playoff hole, leaving Kite and
Watson to duel it out.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff was the longest since the 1997 Pittsburgh Senior
Classic and fourth-longest in tour history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see that the Senior tour is in trouble, but certainly
if that show out there today doesn't help, then it can't be
helped,'' Kite said. ''I mean, that was just an incredible
exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson shot a 4-under 68 to make the playoff, Nelson fired a 69
and Kite, struggling with his putting, had a 72. He had two chances
to win earlier when putts headed for the heart of the cup stopped
short -- on No. 18, and on the fifth playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   The victory closed a gap for Kite, who won the 1992 U.S. Open
and 18 other titles on the regular tour. He was the only one of the
celebrated rookie trio who hadn't won.
</P>
<P>
   He also had seen only modest financial success, with one top-10
finish. But the $240,000 first prize sent Kite's earnings to
$311,426, enough to jump from 49th to sixth on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Watson won the second of two events he entered last season, and
Wadkins won in Naples, Fla., on Feb. 13, beating Watson and two
others in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was downcast after the Tradition, sponsored by
Countrywide, but not because of the loss to his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty happy about the way I played,'' the five-time
British Open champion said, looking ahead to the Masters, which he
won in 1977 and 1981. ''I am not happy about the way I putted when
I had to make something. My long game is pretty good, but my
putting is going to have to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher was fourth at 282, and Joe Inman followed at 283.
</P>
<P>
   Gary McCord and Andy North were four shots off the pace, and
John Jacobs was alone at 286.
</P>
<P>
   The group of six at 287 included Nicklaus, who closed with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff was conducted on the par-5 18th hole and the par-3
17th, a 194-yard puzzler that is the toughest hole on the Cochise
Course. The stroke average there was 3.38, and Kite's final birdie
was only the sixth it yielded in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson got his bogey there.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth extra hole, Watson made an extraordinary chip out
of a sandy natural area to within 7 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Kite then rolled his 30-foot first putt within six inches of the
cup only to see it stop. He thought Watson had won, but Watson
two-putted as well.
</P>
<P>
   On the last hole, Watson bounced his tee shot over the green,
while Kite dropped a 6-iron next to the cup. It stopped a foot
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''That lets me know what I have to do,'' Watson joked with the
crowd. Then he nearly did it, lofting a high, 30-foot chip that
bounced once and hit the flagstick, rolling 2 feet to the side as
the gallery erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it had caught the pin just right, it could have gone in. I
scared him a little bit,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson putted out for par, and Kite sank his birdie putt.

<HEADLINE> Woman Falls Out of Stands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A woman fell out of the stands and landed in
a runway about eight feet below during halftime of the women's NCAA
championship game between Tennessee and UConn on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified, fell over a railing and into
the hallway leading to the UConn locker room at the First Union
Center. She was fitted with a neck brace and taken away on a
stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was treated at the arena, then taken to two different
hospitals, nursing supervisors said. An arena official said she did
not want her name released, and her condition was not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   No railing gave way. The security official said the woman was
trying to walk through a section of the stands when she fell.

<HEADLINE> Internet romance grows into federal kidnapping case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the summer of 1997. Gangandeep Bakshi was
a Queens teen-ager whose strict Sikh family was apparently unaware
she was falling in love over the Internet with a man outside her
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, at age 18, Bakshi ran off to Houston to live
with the man. What happened next has become the focus of an unusual
federal kidnapping case.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI arrested Bakshi's parents, Agyapal and Kamla Singh, and
her two older sisters last week at their Richmond Hill home after
they were indicted in Texas. The 55-year-old father was ordered
jailed until a scheduled arraignment as a threat to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges the four family members brutally abducted
Bakshi last August from her Hindu lover's Houston apartment -- at
one point ''beating her into submission'' -- because they objected
to the romance. The victim also claims her father drugged her and
threatened to ''cut her to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bakshi quickly fled her family again, married the
man and moved out of Houston, Bakshi has told investigators that
her father has been using connections in Indian enclaves in Texas
and elsewhere to locate and harass her. The FBI says fear has
driven the couple into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys vigorously deny the allegations, insisting
Singh is a respected member of the Queens Sikh community. They
accuse prosecutors of turning a simple family dispute into a
full-blown federal case, and they portrayed Bakshi's husband as
someone who took advantage of a naive teen-ager in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it hadn't been for the marvel of computers, none of us
might be here right now,'' one attorney, Rafael Abramovitz, said
during a hearing in Brooklyn federal court last week attended by
several of Singh's Sikh supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Dugger argued that Singh
was a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a case about some internet Lothario who seduced a
girl,'' Dugger said. ''This is about a man who's been indicted in
Texas for a violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, another defense attorney, William Watanabe,
declined to offer more information about Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers do not name Bakshi's husband. Authorities would
only describe him as a Hindu man in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements Bakshi made to the FBI, the trouble
began when she used an airline ticket provided by her
then-boyfriend to join him in Houston. The pair had secretly seen
each other for the first time in New York City before that.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, after learning Bakshi was gone, Singh, his wife and
two daughters, ages 24 and 29, set out from Queens in rented van to
find her. At about 5:30 a.m. on Aug. 26, the victim was awoken by a
knock at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege Singh lured his daughter outside and dragged
her into the van. A neighbor leaving for work told the FBI he heard
screaming, then saw a turbaned man ''ball his fist, cock back and
punch this girl in the stomach,'' FBI agent Eric Johnson testified.
</P>
<P>
   Bakshi told the FBI that while en route back to New York, her
parents punched and slapped her for an hour. She also claimed her
father forced her to drink a substance that made her pass out.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the victim alleged, her father put a knife to her
chest, ''telling her that he would cut her to pieces if she
returned to Houston,'' court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakshi escaped only hours after the family returned to Queens.
After she called 911 from a pay phone, the police arranged for her
to spend the night in a shelter. She was on a plane back to Houston
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The victim claims that over the next several months the couple
moved from city to city -- and even state to state -- to escape her
father's threats. In one instance, Singh allegedly tried to turn in
the husband, an illegal immigrant, to immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter finally responded by reporting her alleged
abduction to the FBI. Agents launched an investigation leading to
the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate Cheryl Pollak, in denying bail for Singh, said she
was convinced that Bakshi is ''in serious danger from her father.''

<HEADLINE> Refining Prostate Testing Will Help  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Doctors may be able to reduce false alarms
when screening for prostate cancer and find early-stage tumors
better simply by fine-tuning the standard screening test.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of men with prostate cancer have elevated
levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen -- PSA. Testing
blood for PSA has been a standard screening method for older men
since about 1990.
</P>
<P>
   However, other conditions, such as non-cancerous prostate
enlargement, can also make PSA levels shoot up, so doctors must
perform biopsies to make sure cancer is truly the cause. For every
biopsy that detects prostate cancer, two or three others are false
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic and psychological cost of this is huge,'' said
Dr. Peter H. Gann of Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   One way to try to reduce this problem is to make the PSA more
precise. In the bloodstream, PSA can be either free-floating or
attached to other proteins. Doctors have noticed that men with
cancer often have lower levels of free PSA than do those whose
elevated PSA has other causes.
</P>
<P>
   Free PSA tests have been available for several years, but
doctors are still unsure how to interpret the results. To help
guide this, researchers conducted the first look-ahead study of the
potential of free PSA testing to pinpoint cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors used blood samples stored in 1982 -- nearly a decade
before PSA testing became available. The samples came from 15,000
men who participated in the Physicians Health Study at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. The landmark study established the
benefits of taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   During 12 years of follow up, 430 men in the study were
diagnosed with prostate cancer. By doing PSA tests on the stored
samples, the researchers could predict the test's power to detect
men's prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Gann and colleagues compared the cancer victims' PSA readings
with those of 1,642 men the same age who stayed free of prostate
cancer. He presented the analysis Sunday at a meeting in San
Francisco of the American Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   If the total PSA level is over 10 nanograms per milliliter of
blood, there is about a 50-50 chance the man has cancer. However,
the risk of the cancer is much less certain if the PSA is between 4
and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Gann said that looking for the percentage of free PSA should
help doctors avoid negative biopsies in men whose PSA levels are in
this gray area. He calculated how much cancer would be found if
doctors limited biopsies to those whose free PSA fell below a
specific cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting biopsies to men whose free PSA is below 20 percent of
the total, the number of unnecessary biopsies falls by 42 percent,
although there is a slight increase in the number of missed
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gann said that by factoring free PSA into the equation,
it might be worthwhile to do biopsies on men whose total PSA levels
are above 3, rather than the current standard of 4. He said this
would actually detect 10 percent more cancer and trigger 13 percent
fewer needless biopsies than simply doing biopsies on everyone with
a total PSA over 4.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, tumors in men whose PSAs are between 3 and 4 are
likely to be small and still curable using surgery or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Morton Jr. of Baylor College of Medicine said the
study helps establish a cutoff for free PSA levels that ''lets us
distinguish between clinically important and clinically
non-important cancers.''

<HEADLINE> Gel May Protect Hair From Chemo  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hair loss from chemotherapy, a distressing
side effect of cancer treatment, could be a thing of the past if a
gel under development shows promise in adults.
</P>
<P>
   The clear ointment has been tested only on lab rats, but
developers said its effects are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We noticed a marked protection of the hair,'' said Stephen T.
Davis. ''It was just stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a scientist at Glaxo Wellcome, said the company hopes to
test the ointment on people, though he could not predict when that
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer cells grow faster than normal tissue. Chemotherapy works
by killing cells that are rapidly dividing. An unintended side
effect is damage to the hair follicles, which also divide more
quickly than other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The Glaxo drug works by temporarily stopping the follicles from
dividing, shielding them from the effects of chemotherapy. The
effect wears off within a day and does not seem to make any
difference in long-term hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William N. Hait, director of the Cancer Institute of New
Jersey, called the research well done. ''This is part of an effort
of cancer researchers around the world to make treatment a lot more
tolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis described the research Sunday at a meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, code-named GW8510, inhibits an enzyme called
cyclin-dependent kinase 2, one of the basic stimulants of cell
division.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that if further testing holds up, patients would rub
the gel into their hair before getting their cancer treatment and
then wash it out a few hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is not absorbed into the blood stream. As far as can
be told from rat experiments, it is safe and carries no side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiments, scientists gave rats a chemotherapy drug
called etoposide. Without treatment, 90 percent of the rats had
hair loss. GW8510 prevented this totally in half of the rats. In
the rest, its effectiveness ranged from 25 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gel also appears to protect hair from some other common
cancer drugs, such as Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide.
</P>
<P>
   Hait said that a treatment for hair loss is much needed. Some
patients avoid getting screened for cancer because they fear this
and other side effects of chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defector Supports Elian  </HEADLINE>
By WILSON RING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Walter Polovchak, once the object of an
international custody dispute, has met with Elian Gonzalez for the
first time and says he understands how the 6-year-old feels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he knows the difference between freedom and not having
freedom,'' Polovchak said at the end of a 45-minute meeting Sunday.
''You don't have to get hit by a car to know it's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, Polovchak defied his parents and chose to stay
in the United States while they returned to the Ukraine, then a
part of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   As a 12-year-old defector, Polovchak listed Jell-O and bananas
as top reasons for wanting to stay in the United States. But what
he really was expressing was a love of freedom, he says. He
marveled at walking in a grocery store and plucking things from the
aisles; he was used to long lines and small rations.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak's refusal to return to the Ukraine with his parents
set off a 5{-year custody battle that didn't end until he turned 18
and was granted U.S. citizenship. He's now an office manager in
Chicago, is married and has a 6-year-old son of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He has been following Elian's case since the boy was found
clinging to an inner tube off Florida's coast on Thanksgiving Day.
The boy's mother and 10 others died when their boat sank two days
earlier during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak said he volunteered to come to Miami and his way was
paid by a California doctor with no connection to the Cuban exile
community.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, visibly frustrated over the
attention focused on the boy, said Elian was in good spirits when
he and family members went to church Sunday morning. But when the
family returned later from an afternoon county fair, Elian seemed
tired.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a little bit stressed out,'' said Elian's cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak said the best solution for Elian might be for his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to come with his wife and young son
to live with him in the United States, rather than fighting to take
him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood the pressures of being a child caught in a
tug of war between competing ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looked at as a traitor to my country,'' he said. ''My
father was under a lot of pressure to return. Elian's father is
under tremendous pressure, too.''

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian's Dad May Come Monday  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In an apparent bid to show flexibility in the
campaign to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, President Fidel Castro
said the boy's father has offered to travel alone today to the
United States to pick up his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   However, a group trip with the boy's relatives and classmates
appeared more likely than a solo trip by his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the boy's stepmother, his baby half-brother, a dozen
classmates and some adults planned to apply for American visas
today at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the American mission
here. The group would be ready to leave for the United States as
soon as Tuesday, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he would go get his son alone if U.S. authorities
promised they would turn Elian over to him immediately and allow
them to fly back to Cuba right away, Castro said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am willing to leave tomorrow, absolutely alone and transport
myself to where the child is,'' Castro read from a letter signed by
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the government of the United States can decide if it
prefers this variant,'' continued the letter, which Castro read on
a state television station broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez for months refused requests by Elian's Miami relatives
to go to the United States to claim the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the lawyers for the boy's relatives in Miami
said they might try to argue that his father is an unfit parent.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said there is no evidence of unfitness, and
the father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, said the ''outrageous''
allegations were a sign the Miami relatives were getting desperate.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if American authorities would give the Cubans the
28 visas they have proposed. The group would not leave until
Gonzalez had assurances that American authorities would give him
custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for him and other members of the delegation to stay
in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while awaiting the
results of a federal court appeal by Elian's Miami relatives, who
have temporary custody of him and are seeking to block his return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In another dramatic move, Castro announced that the chief of the
Cuban Interests Section in Washington was willing to revoke the
diplomatic immunity on his residence, where Cuba has proposed
Gonzalez stay with Elian and the rest of his family during the
federal appeal -- which could take as long as a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that if those who oppose returning Elian to Cuba are
worried about turning the child over to ''what is considered Cuban
territory, then our Interests Section is willing to renounce
diplomatic immunity of the residence of the chief of this section
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November. His
mother was among 11 people who died after they boat sank during the
attempted crossing from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives are fighting to keep the boy in the
United States, saying they can give him a better life off the
communist island. Gonzalez has demanded his rights as the child's
sole surviving parent and wants Elian returned to him.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest deadline, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service has given the Miami relatives until 9 a.m. Tuesday to sign
a paper promising to turn over the boy to immigration authorities
if they lose their federal court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives thus far have refused to sign the document,
and in recent days said they would not turn Elian over to his
father if he came to the United States. Earlier, they had said they
would give the boy to Gonzalez if he made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Before his Sunday night address, Castro played the affectionate
grandfather to the 12 first-graders proposed to go on the trip,
assuring them that their planned trip to Washington to retrieve
their little friend was a very important mission.
</P>
<P>
   Patting some of the kids on the head, Castro assured them that
they formed a powerful ''commando.''

<HEADLINE> Hero of the Holocost to be honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALEM, Conn. (AP) -- As a diplomat in France during World War II
, Hiram Bingham IV defied his supervisors' policies and aided
thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland has honored the Salem native by declaring
today Hiram Bingham day in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham sheltered Jews in his diplomatic residence in Marseilles
and helped them obtain visas to escape Nazi-occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He put humanity before his career,'' his son Robert Bingham
said. ''My father had a sense that Hitler had to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   For years after his death in 1988 at the age of 85, the Bingham
remained largely unrecognized.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never boasted about his deeds,'' said his son. ''He was a
humble, kind person.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bingham worked to change that. He has launched an effort
for the U.S. Postal Service to issue a stamp honoring his father.
</P>
<P>
   Led by U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-2nd District, and U.S. Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., more than 60 congressmen and senators
have supported the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Today also marks the opening of an exhibit at U.N. headquarters
in New York honoring Bingham and 10 other diplomats credited with
saving a total of more than 200,000 lives during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is called -- Visas for Life: The Righteous Diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases, this will be the first time that the survivors
will have the opportunity to meet the families of their diplomatic
rescuers,'' said Eric Saul, director of the exhibit, which will
remain at U.N. headquarters until April 28.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 members of Bingham's family, including several of
his sons and daughters, were planning to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward with a great deal of zeal to meeting the
survivors,'' Robert Bingham said. ''It's heartwarming knowing my
father played a hand in keeping them alive.''

Castro: Elian's Dad May Come To U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In an apparent bid to show flexibility in the campaign to
return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, President Fidel Castro said the boy's father has
offered to travel alone Monday to the United States to pick up his 6-year-old
son. However, a group trip with the boy's relatives and classmates appeared more
likely than a solo trip by his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Gonzalez, the boy's
stepmother, his baby half-brother, a dozen classmates and some adults planned to
apply for American visas Monday at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the
American mission here.

Refining Prostate Testing Will Help
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Doctors may be able to reduce false alarms when
screening for prostate cancer and find early-stage tumors better simply by
fine-tuning the standard screening test. About three-quarters of men with
prostate cancer have elevated levels of a protein called prostate-specific
antigen -- PSA. Testing blood for PSA has been a standard screening method for
older men since about 1990. However, other conditions, such as non-cancerous
prostate enlargement, can also make PSA levels shoot up, so doctors must perform
biopsies to make sure cancer is truly the cause. For every biopsy that detects
prostate cancer, two or three others are false alarms.

Ex-Uganda Sect Member Speaks Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- A former member of a Christian doomsday sect says the
cult's unfulfilled doomsday prophecy spurred opposition and possibly the murder
of sect dissidents. The allegation came Sunday as dignitaries joined residents
of Kanungu and nearby villages in southwestern Uganda to deplore the deaths of
924 members of a reclusive Christian doomsday sect who authorities say were
killed by their leaders. Until Sunday, no sect member, past or present, had
confirmed the common belief here: The failure of the world to end Dec. 31 led
members to demand belongings they had surrendered to join the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God -- a challenge that led to
retaliation by sect leaders.

Microsoft Case Goes Back to Judge

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With settlement talks in collapse, the Microsoft antitrust
case is returning to the judge who found the software giant was a monopoly that
stifled innovation and hurt consumers. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who previously issued ''findings of fact,'' could rule any day on
Microsoft's guilt, setting off a legal marathon that could last through years of
appeals. If, as expected, Jackson lays out violations of law against the
company, he then would begin designing a remedy that could range from breaking
up Microsoft to restricting its conduct in the marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Aboriginals May Hold Protests  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Aboriginal activists threatened today
to hold violent protests at the Sydney 2000 Olympics after
Australia's government said they exaggerated the effects of a
decades-long policy of taking aboriginal children from their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Protests at the Olympics are ''going to be very violent,''
Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in an interview rebroadcast in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are telling all the British people, please, don't come
over. If you want to see burning cars and burning buildings, then
come over,'' Perkins said. ''Enjoy yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins -- one of the main representatives of his community --
later toned down his comments, but when asked about protests, he
told Australia's Channel Nine television: ''It's 'burn, baby, burn'
from now on. Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron
suggested that reports of an estimated 100,000 Aboriginal children
taken by authorities between 1910 and the 1970s -- known as the
''stolen generation'' -- were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''A generation is all people born around that period. It didn't
affect all Aboriginal people, and that's the point that I'm making
in my'' report on the subject, he told Channel Nine. Portions of
the report appeared in the press Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, children were taken from their families in the
belief that Aborigines were doomed and saving the children was the
only humane alternative. Light-skinned Aboriginal children were
given to white families for adoption, while dark-skinned children
were put in orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   The government says 10 percent of Aborigines were affected by
the policy. It did not say how many people that amounted to.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the Saturday accounts of Herron's report, New South
Wales' 118 Aboriginal land councils voted to march in protest on
Sept. 16, the first day of Olympic competition here.
</P>
<P>
   ''All bets are off,'' Lyall Munro, Olympic protest campaign
delegate to the Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council, told local
media. ''Aboriginal people will rise up in this country and show
the world how racist Australia is.''
</P>
<P>
   The report and Herron's defense of it have plunged the
relationship between Prime Minister John Howard's government and
Aborigines to an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   In parliament, Howard admitted that the separation of Aboriginal
children from their mothers had been a serious blemish on the
nation's history, but again ruled out a formal apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that large numbers of children were taken in
circumstances in which they should not have been taken,'' Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that Herron's submission had been accurate.
</P>
<P>
   News of the report first surfaced when the Daily Telegraph in
Sydney quoted the document as saying, ''There was never a
generation of stolen children.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowitja O'Donoghue, chairwoman of an Aboriginal advisory
committee set up by Sydney Olympics organizers, said Aborigines
should protest at Australia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it matters not whether it was a generation, (or)
whether it was 10 percent, but the policy was wrong,'' she said.
O'Donoghue was taken from her parents when she was 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Olympics organizers refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Kim Beazley said he understood anger at the
government's report, but he said the Olympics should be left alone
by protesters. ''The Olympics ought to be off limits. It ought to
be an occasion of joy for all Australians and a chance to show off
what good hosts we can be,'' Beazley told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Rattles Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake struck near a lake
resort today in central Taiwan, seismologists said. No damage or
injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.3-magnitude quake hit 10 miles west of Sun Moon Lake, the
island's largest natural lake, the Central Weather Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort area suffered severe damage when a 7.6-magnitude
tremor jolted Taiwan on Sept. 21. Lakefront hotels collapsed and
several landmark structures were ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Since the big quake, which killed 2,400 people, more than 12,000
aftershocks and tremors have rattled Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, scores of earthquakes hit Taiwan each year.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Shea Ralph Steals Show  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It's hard to imagine what Shea Ralph would
do without basketball. She plays it like a skydiver making a daring
jump, or a relay runner making that final, exhausting push for the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   She played for the national championship Sunday night as if the
whole world were trying to take it away from her. And no one takes
anything away from Ralph without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a drive that I have, something that's been taught to me
the hard way,'' said Ralph, who led Connecticut to its second
national championship with a 71-52 victory over archrival
Tennessee. ''Enjoy the moment, and every day, and every minute that
you have in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This victory was so easy because one player on the court
wouldn't stop diving, swatting, snarling and shouting. With all
this, Ralph somehow found time to get nearly every loose ball, make
every deadeye pass, toss in every layup that her tenacity earned.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph scored 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting and had seven
assists, six steals and a block for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever wanted anything like I wanted this
tonight,'' said Ralph, the MVP of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Most valuable? That was as easy to see as Ralph's pained
expression -- always contorted with a mixture of consternation and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out with a vengeance,'' Ralph said. ''We came out like
we wanted something, and we got it. And I think we deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   After sparking UConn's 21-6 run to start the game, Ralph ensured
there would be no letup in the second half. She started off with a
layup and a double-clutch, driving jumper to make it 36-19, then
picked off a pass and quickly set up Svetlana Abrosimova for a
layup to give the Huskies a 40-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shea Ralph is the hustle player of the year on that team,''
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. ''She gives them so much energy.
She's a great leader by example.''
</P>
<P>
   She got free for another layup to make it 48-27, then ran a
little give-and-go on the fast break with a bounce pass to
Abrosimova for a layup that gave UConn a 50-27 lead with 13:31
left.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a performance for a player who missed the entire
1997-98 season with her second ACL injury to her right knee in as
many seasons. She blew out her ACL in the Huskies' first game of
the NCAA tournament on March 15, 1997, then did it again on Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were moments of doubt, but I always knew that I would
play again,'' Ralph said. ''I never knew how good I would be. I
never knew what kind of impact I would have on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph was asked what got her through those dismal months of
rehab, when it seemed her knee would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always been the national championship,'' Ralph said.
''It's always been winning the last game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   When she forced a jump ball, she pumped her fist wildly. When
she attacked the basket for an acrobatic jumper, she screamed,
flexed her biceps and grabbed any teammate who would dare share her
viselike embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're in the position that we were this year, you can't
let that slip through your fingers,'' Ralph said. ''You never know
when you're going to have it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The basketball certainly doesn't slip through Ralph's fingers.
When UConn blitzed Tennessee with a 21-6 run to start the game,
Ralph was in the middle of every scrum. A fan watching basketball
for the first time might have assumed that the goal of No. 33 was
to rub her elbows on every inch of the court -- then get up and
scream like a professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was it effective. Ralph came up with four steals and forced
at least three jump balls in the first half alone. She turned
Tennessee's offensive gameplan into a mosh pit -- with herself in
the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph had three fouls at halftime, but never committed another
one. She was 3-for-4 for seven points, had four steals, a block and
three assists as UConn led 32-19 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Ralph was one of the first to dive into the ultimate
mosh pit when it was over. She tackled Sue Bird, UConn's little
point guard, as the Huskies celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I've seen us play this well all year,'' Ralph
said. ''We got the ultimate prize.''
</P>
<P>
   The knee injuries and medical redshirt season have kept her
around Storrs so long that the running joke in women's basketball
is, ''Shea Ralph is still at Connecticut?''
</P>
<P>
   You bet she is. And she's only a junior. She'll be back for more
floorburn next year, and probably can't wait.

<HEADLINE> Poets Creating Works on Computer  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- It's poetry that cannot occur on paper --
the blending of the most modern technology and an age-old literary
form. It's e-poetry, and there is no turning back now.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic poets around the world are creating works that evolve
and ''perform'' on the computer screen, said Loss Pequeno Glazier,
director of the University at Buffalo's Electronic Poetry Center,
which displays the work of dozens of e-poets.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Web site, he said, logs 8 million visitors a year
from 90 countries. In honor of ''National Poetry Month,'' it will
include a collection of new digital works for and about April.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic poetry has movement or programming qualities that
allow for forms of experimentation that wouldn't even occur to
print poetry writers, Glazier said. Poems may move, talk, change
and interact with the reader.
</P>
<P>
   In Roberto Gilli's ''War,'' for example, changing text is
superimposed over black and white images that flash onto the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kac's ''Uirapuru'' extends the myth of a magical
Amazonian bird and sings to the reader. The work incorporates the
writer's personal mythology into the realm of the rainforest and
transforms the bird into a tele-robotic flying fish that the reader
can manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic poetry was the logical extension of ''concrete
poetry'' that became popular over the last several decades, where
poets would arrange letters and words in certain shapes, lending a
visual dimension to the work, Glazier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once people were working with computers, they said how could
we do something on the computer with poetry that can't be done on
paper,'' he said. ''It was at that moment that electronic poetry
was born.''
</P>
<P>
   The new style features kinetic poetry, poetry that moves, and
programmable poetry, in which a computer program actually helps
create the poem.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Web, you can have the poems move or have some sort of
timing to them or changeability,'' Glazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only shapes, but colors, fonts and motion are important
elements of electronic poetry. That means e-poets must be computer
savvy as well as visionary, though there are programs to help
fledgling artists along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Although the poems cannot be bound in a book and put on a
library shelf for the benefit of future generations, they can be
electronically archived and displayed on Web sites like the
Electronic Poetry Center, which was formed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As technology changes and threatens to render the current
programs obsolete, Glazier said the center will do its best to
translate poems into more up-to-date formats so they will be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a challenge,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Isakson Carving Own Identity  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Johnny Isakson ranks 433rd of 435 House
members in seniority, but his office is fit for a speaker. It was,
in fact, where one -- Newt Gingrich -- used to conduct his district
business not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, a Republican from Marietta, Ga., inherited the
congressional seat and prime office vacated when Gingrich resigned
last year after the GOP's poor election showing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's old quarters in the Rayburn House Office Building are
large and have a clear view of the Capitol. It's where he conducted
his district business, while using the official speaker's office in
the Capitol for his other duties.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Isakson normally would expect to have modest
accommodations. He admits enjoying the spoils of following a
speaker but is quick to say he's no reincarnation of the flamboyant
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, I'm not Newt,'' Isakson said. ''My dad taught me a long
time ago that if you can't be a success being yourself, you'll
screw it up trying to be someone you aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Isakson jokes that Gingrich's resignation sent
Georgia's conservative 6th District from ''speaker of the House to
the outhouse.'' But he knows that relative anonymity has its
rewards, notably being able to concentrate on issues important to
constituents rather than focusing on national debates, as Gingrich
did.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Gingrich's duties as speaker made committee
appearances a rarity, Isakson regularly attends meetings of the
House Transportation panel on which he serves. It's not the most
prestigious assignment, yet few policy areas are more important
around metropolitan Atlanta, where traffic concerns abound.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gingrich was an in-your-face kind of politician, whereas
Isakson is one who wants to be in your heart,'' said Jay Morgan,
who worked for both. ''I frankly think the 6th District is much
more comfortable with that kind of style even though they suffer
the indignity of having lost a speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the staunchly partisan Gingrich and the
low-key Isakson was illustrated three years ago when Georgia Gov.
Zell Miller, a Democrat who defeated Isakson in the 1990
gubernatorial race, was looking to improve the relationship between
the state's Republican schools superintendent and the
Democratic-dominated Board of Education. He tapped Isakson to chair
the board.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent a 13-month congressman can have a ''niche,''
Isakson has found one in trying to merge schools with the Internet.
House Education Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., tapped him for the
Web-Based Education Commission, which examines education technology
and Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pretty computer-literate for a 55-year-old,'' Isakson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Isakson worked for a real estate firm,
eventually becoming the company's president and a millionaire. He
honed his political skills in the Georgia House of Representatives,
where he served 14 years, half of those as the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his failed run for governor, Isakson lost a 1996
bid for the Republican Senate nomination to businessman Guy
Millner, who then was defeated by Democrat Max Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson easily won last year's special House election,
outdistancing fellow Republican Christina Jeffrey, 65 percent to 25
percent, and faces no serious re-election challengers this fall.
</P>
<P>
   By replacing one speaker, Isakson has built a rapport with
another. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Gingrich's successor in the
leadership post, has taken Isakson under his wing, even inviting
him on a trade mission to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Johnny Isakson and I both have the distinction of replacing
Newt Gingrich,'' Hastert said, ''but we have both learned that we
can't really replace Newt. The best we can do is use our own
talents and abilities in our jobs.''

<HEADLINE> Advocates rally for alternatives to managed care  </HEADLINE>
nghfcnhr
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- A group of doctors is calling for
publicly financed health care, saying the current system is
motivated by profit, not the welfare of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 health care professionals and others took part in a
teach-in and rally Saturday that was part of a nationwide effort by
the groups Physicians Who Care and the National Coalition of Mental
Health Professionals and Consumers Inc. Demonstrators gathered at
42 locations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are saying that managed care has to stop, that human beings
are not a commodity and that health care can't be commodified,''
said Justine McCabe of New Milford.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, a clinical psychologist and her husband, Dr. John
Battista, proposed a bill last year calling for publicly financed
and administered universal health care in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one alternative to the HMOs, and that is
universal health care for all,'' said Naomi Shaiken, chairwoman of
Connecticut Call to Action. ''Old-style medicine, as imperfect as
it was, treated everyone. No one was left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who attended Rescue Health Care Day at the Connecticut
Mental Health Center also criticized a proposal to change Medicare
from a federally administered program to a voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Marmor, professor of public policy and management at
the Yale University School of Management, said medical care in the
last decade has undergone a striking, unexpected change.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton came into office, Marmor said, 37 million
Americans were without medical coverage. Now there are 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Change without choice is the way I would diagnose the 1990s,''
Marmor said. ''Many, although not all, of those changes were ones
that have adversely affected patients, doctors, nurses'' and others
involved in health care.
</P>
<P>
   John Ringwald, co-founder of the Connecticut Psychotherapists'
Guild, said managed care has resulted in a ''major shift of health
care dollars away from clinics, hospitals and health care service
providers into exorbitant executive salaries, advertising,
corporate profits and the bureaucracies that sustain them.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Opens Mixed; Dow Up 16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices opened mixed on Monday. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average is up 16 points in early trading.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a 3-to-2 lead
over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 88 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is fractionally higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is failing to get the second quarter off to a strong
start.
</P>
<P>
   Much of hesitation stems from the breakdown in settlement talks
between Microsoft and the government over the weekend. Microsoft
shares are expected to open with a loss of about $10 apiece, based
on pre-market trading.
</P>
<P>
   The market will have much to consider during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Several economic reports will be released over the next several

<HEADLINE> Justices To Clarify Arbitration Role  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify
federal courts' role in enforcing business contracts that say all
disputes are to be resolved by arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will hear the appeal of an Alabama
financial company that wants to force a woman whose mobile home it
financed to go through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court said she can sue instead because the
contract's arbitration language did not specify who would have to
pay for the arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Larketta Randolph bought a mobile home in 1994 from a company in
Opelika, Ala., and financed it through Green Tree Financial
Corp.-Alabama. Her lawsuit said the financial company did not
properly disclose that it required her to buy insurance to protect
it in case Green Tree had to repossess the home.
</P>
<P>
   Her class-action lawsuit against Green Tree, filed in 1996, said
the company violated the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit
Act by requiring arbitration of all claims.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the purchase
contract required the dispute to be submitted to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the lawsuit
last June, ruling it could hear Randolph's appeal because the judge
issued a final dismissal of all her claims.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the contract's arbitration clause was not
enforceable because it did not specify who would pay the costs.
Randolph might be forced to pay substantial costs even if the
arbitrator ruled in her favor, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Green Tree's lawyers said a
federal law that encourages arbitration of business disputes barred
the 11th Circuit court from hearing Randolph's appeal until after
the arbitration was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not allow immediate appeals when an arbitration
question is combined with other issues, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Green Tree's lawyers also argued that the arbitration agreement
was valid even though it did not say who would pay the costs. The
appeals court should not have assumed ''the worst possible
outcome'' but should have required Randolph to prove she would have
to pay substantial fees, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph's lawyers said the appeals court properly decided the
judge's ruling was a final order that could be appealed
immediately. They also said that court correctly said the
arbitration clause created an ''unacceptable risk'' she would have
to pay large fees.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama vs. Randolph,
99-1235.

<HEADLINE> FBI Agents Lose Court Fight  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
by a group of FBI agents to the bureau's limits on their
participation in the military reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away the agents' argument
that they should be allowed to pursue their lawsuit in court.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 40 years, the FBI has barred agents from serving in
the military ''ready reserves,'' the reserve personnel who
participate in regular training and must be prepared for active
duty on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, agents could serve in the military ''standby reserve,''
volunteers who can be called to active duty only if insufficient
ready reservists are available. Agents who served in the standby
reserves were not allowed to volunteer for optional training
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress enacted the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act, which bars private and government
employers from discriminating against workers who serve in the
military reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI revised its policy in 1996 to let agents who join the
standby reserves to undergo optional training with permission from
their supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six FBI agents who serve in the standby reserves sued,
saying the bureau's policy violated the 1994 law. A federal judge
in New York City dismissed the lawsuit, saying the agents should
have first filed an administrative complaint with the FBI's
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals went further, ruling last
September that the law barred the agents from going into court at
all. Because of national security concerns, Congress barred
employees of federal intelligence agencies, including the FBI, from
suing over alleged violations of the law, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the agents' lawyers said the law
lets agents challenge the FBI's overall policy even if they cannot
go to court over decisions in individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers opposed the appeal, saying Congress wanted to
insulate intelligence agencies' personnel policies from outside
review. Agents still can go to court to argue that the FBI's policy
violates the Constitution, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Dew vs. U.S., 99-1089.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Who Represented Libya Loses  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former top State Department legal adviser
today lost a Supreme Court challenge of the public sanction he
received for briefly representing Libya in a lawsuit over the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 after he left his government job.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, left intact the District of Columbia
Bar's disciplinary action against Abraham Sofaer, the only lawyer
ever cited for violating ''revolving door'' rules by working in
private practice on the same matter he handled for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Sofaer denied any wrongdoing. A former federal judge and leading
figure in legal and foreign policy circles while the State
Department's top lawyer from 1985 until 1990, he once seemed a
likely Supreme Court appointee.
</P>
<P>
   Sofaer received an ''informal admonition'' -- a sanction for an
ethical violation -- in connection with criminal and civil disputes
stemming from the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyan intelligence agents were named in U.S. indictments in
1991, and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi refused to release them to
U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1993, Libya hired Sofaer and his law firm to
negotiate possible settlements filed by relatives of some of the
270 victims. He was to negotiate the surrender of the two accused
Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Sofaer and the law firm dropped out of the case, amid highly
publicized criticism by victims' families, only 15 days after
signing a $3 million retainer agreement with the Libyan government.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, with final say in
lawyer-discipline matters from the nation's capital, imposed the
sanction. It said Sofaer had personally and substantially taken
part in the U.S. government's investigation of the bombing and in
related diplomatic and legal activities while with the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said Sofaer ''may have received'' information
during his government service ''that might be useful'' in
representing Libya as a private lawyer. Whether he actually
received such information was immaterial, that court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Sofaer's Supreme Court appeal said, ''The use of a broad
appearance-based standard to impose discipline is fundamentally
inconsistent with established principles of due process. A
disciplinary rule condemning improper appearance is, by definition,
a rule dependent on the eye of the beholder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the District of Columbia urged the justices to
reject the appeal, saying. ''This is a matter of purely local
concern. ... It involves no issues of national or general
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Sofaer vs. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
99-1143.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks 227; Dow Up 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged at the start of
trading today, with Microsoft weighing down the Nasdaq composite
index. But rising financial shares kept the Dow Jones industrials
in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 227.54, or by almost 5
percent, at 4,345.29.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 12 5/16 to 93 15/16 as the company appeared
poised for harsh penalties in its antitrust case. Microsoft's
negotiations with the government broke down on Saturday, and U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule any day
on Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 33.82 at 10,955.74.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.71 to 1,488.87.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wasn't the only software company suffering today.
Legato Systems, a maker of storage software, lost nearly half of
its value, tumbling 22 1/64 to 22 39/64. The company told the
Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday that it would delay
the filing of its annual 10-K form, raising concerns that the
company would restate some financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Microsoft is a component of the Dow, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks.
American Express rose 4\ to 153 3/16, and J.P. Morgan rose 3 11/16
to 135 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 116.15 million shares
in the early going, well behind Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.34 to 535.75.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.0 percent to a new
3-year high, despite the hospitalization of the prime minister and
the appointment of an acting premier. In afternoon trading,
Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40
was down 2.0 percent. Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.0 percent. A
computer problem at the London Stock Exchange made it impossible to
calculate the main market index for more than four hours in early
trading.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Over Baby Formula Killed  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An evenly divided Supreme Court today killed a
lawsuit that had accused three companies of illegally conspiring to
raise the price of baby formula.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-4 decision was a defeat for a couple who had filed the
lawsuit and had argued that it should have been handled in a
Louisiana state court, not a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The justices had been expected to use the case to clarify when
some lawsuits filed in state courts can be transferred to federal
courts. But the 4-4 vote, announced without any opinion, simply
upheld a lower court's ruling that allowed the baby formula case to
be transferred to a federal court, where it was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The high court deadlock came about because Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor excused herself from the case. Although she did not
explain her disqualification, her most recently filed financial
disclosure form indicates that she owns between $15,000 and $50,000
worth of stock in one of the three sued companies, Bristol-Myers
Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   The court, as is its custom after such votes, did not disclose
which justices voted on what side of the issue. Such 4-4 votes are
considered of little precedential value because of the possibility
that the court will someday return to the issue with all nine
justices participating.
</P>
<P>
   Robin and Renee Free sued in a Louisiana court in 1993, accusing
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Abbott Laboratories and Mead Johnson &AMP; Co. of
conspiring to raise the price of baby formula -- an alleged
violation of Louisiana antitrust law. Their lawsuit was a class
action seeking up to $20,000 in damages for each person.
</P>
<P>
   The companies sought to move the case to federal court, but the
Frees argued that the amount of their claim did not meet the
$50,000 minimum required at the time for federal court
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum has since been raised by Congress to $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the case
belonged in federal court. Both sides later reached a $4.3 million
settlement, but a federal judge threw it out on grounds the
settlement had not been proven fair for all class members.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then dismissed the case, saying Louisiana antitrust
law did not allow price-fixing lawsuits by people who only
indirectly bought a product from a manufacturer. The 5th Circuit
court upheld the dismissal last year.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Free v. Abbott Laboratories, 99-391.

<HEADLINE> Legal Service Groups' Rights Debated  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Congress can bar groups funded by the Legal Services Corp.
from filing lawsuits that seek to change welfare laws.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will hear the Clinton administration's
argument that it can lawfully pay for people to go into court and
seek benefits under the current welfare law but bar funding for
legal challenges to the law.
</P>
<P>
   The justices took no action on a separate lawsuit by legal-aid
clients who challenged other restrictions imposed by Congress on
the LSC.
</P>
<P>
   The LSC, created in 1974 to provide basic legal services to the
poor, distributes millions of dollars in federal money to local
legal-aid groups, most of which also receive other public and
private funds.
</P>
<P>
   LSC funds cannot be used for defending criminal defendants or
cases related to abortion, school desegregation or military
desertion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, amid efforts to abolish LSC altogether, Congress
imposed new restrictions. It barred use of LSC funds for
class-action lawsuits, lobbying legislators, providing aid to
certain immigrants, seeking lawyers' fees or representing prison
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The law also barred LSC-funded groups from using other funds for
those purposes, although they can set up affiliates to use
nonfederal money for those activities.
</P>
<P>
   Legal-aid lawyers and clients challenged the new law in 1997,
saying it violated speech and associational rights protected by the
Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in New York City upheld the law and the rules on
affiliate groups, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court said the government could not bar use of
LSC funds to seek changes in welfare laws while allowing
representation of people's individual welfare cases. That
distinction amounted to discrimination on basis of viewpoint, the
appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said Congress
lawfully can provide benefits to people seeking benefits under the
current welfare program, while not aiding those who want to
challenge the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the legal-aid clients said the government was
seeking to advance a ''favored political viewpoint'' while not
funding a disfavored viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The cases granted review today are Legal Services Corp. vs.
Velazquez, 99-603, and U.S. vs. Velazquez, 99-960.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets Sex Offender Law Stand  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to a Tennessee law -- similar to those in all 50 states -- aimed at
helping government officials and the public keep track of anyone
ever convicted of a sex crime.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that says the
law does not invade anyone's privacy or violate any other
constitutionally protected rights.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have some type of sexual offender law modeled
after a federal ''Megan's Law,'' named for a New Jersey girl who
was raped and killed by a released convict in her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee law, which imposes registration and monitoring
requirements that potentially can last for an ex-convict's
lifetime, took effect in 1995 but applies retroactively to people
previously convicted of sex crimes ranging from statutory rape and
solicitation to incest and aggravated rape.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Cutshall, who in 1990 had been imprisoned after pleading
guilty to aggravated sexual battery of a 5-year-old relative in
Greene County, sued when he learned that he would have to register
with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation when freed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He contended, among other things, that the law should not be
applied retroactively, punished him twice for the same crime and
violated his privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
against Cutshall and upheld the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus of the act is not on circumscribing the conduct of
the offender, but on the protection of the public,'' an appeals
court panel said in its 2-1 ruling last October.
</P>
<P>
   Cutshall's Supreme Court appeal said the law was meant to punish
already-punished sex offenders and therefore violates the
Constitution's double-jeopardy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal also attacked the law's provision for public release
of registration information. ''The public may very well use the
information to locate offenders and their families so they can
attack them, harass them, or otherwise seek to drive them from the
community as has happened on several occasions,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal added: ''The Tennessee act and similar other acts
raise foundational issues of federal law regarding the manner in
which the regulation of undesirable conduct may be balanced against
the punishment of past offenses and about the types of personal
interests and rights that government may infringe without providing
even minimal due-process protections.''
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors urged the justices to reject the appeal. They
said the Tennessee Legislature's motives were not punitive, but
only ''to comply with federal law, to assist law enforcement in
solving crimes and to help the public protect itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court previously had rejected challenges of
similar laws in New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, the justices refused to revive a Pennsylvania
law that required some sex offenders to be designated ''sexually
violent predators'' subject to lifetime registration and public
notice of their address. That law, struck down by the state's
supreme court, allowed the state to assume people convicted of
certain crimes are violent predators unless they prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The case acted on today is Cutshall vs. Sundquist, 99-1123.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Confederate Flag March Resumes  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOOSE CREEK, S.C. (AP) -- A group of some 70 people set out today
on the second leg of a 120-mile trek to get the Confederate flag
removed from atop the South Carolina Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Women in wide-brimmed straw hats joined longshoremen and
politicians walking three to four abreast, though the numbers were
down sharply from about 600 people who began the march on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to arrive at the Statehouse in Columbia on Thursday,
the same day a rally in support of the Confederate flag is
scheduled at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flag no longer has any part to play in our society,'' said
Sherrill Pickard, who describes herself as ''a Southerner, and
proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an embarrassment to people that are white and a slap in
the face to people who are black,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers encountered about a dozen Confederate flag
supporters at a rural intersection northwest of Goose Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Pat Conroy joined the marchers as they left Charleston
on Sunday and plans to rejoin the group when they walk into
Columbia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist, known for stories of South Carolina such as ''The
Prince of Tides'' and ''The Lords of Discipline,'' said state
lawmakers don't like being told what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''South Carolina white boys love to dig their heels in. There's
no question,'' he said. ''Some of them will but they are going to
hurt their state in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy warned that failure to resolve the flag controversy could
cost the state the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., which lights up
theaters and recital halls around Charleston each spring.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers chanted ''Bring it down'' and held blue-and-white South
Carolina state flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of South Carolina -- white and African-American --
want the flag to come down,'' said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley
Jr., who had the idea for the march. ''The purpose is to say the
people of South Carolina are in step, and we want the Legislature
to get in step with the people of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was accompanied by two state law enforcement agents and
marched in a bulletproof vest, saying he received a death threat
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate flag supporters also demonstrated along the route on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Webb, a 23-year-old College of Charleston student, waved a
Confederate flag Sunday and said marchers yelled threats at him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who were yelling at me were right in this crowd --
saying, you know, 'I hope you brought your bulletproof vest,' ''
Webb said. ''These people are a bunch of hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandye Williams of James Island had ancestors who fought for the
South, but said the flag should be moved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole issue is an embarrassment to the state of South
Carolina and how the rest of the country looks at us -- like we're a
bunch of racist rednecks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has called for a tourism boycott of the state, saying the
Confederate flag above the Statehouse in Columbia is a racist
emblem. Flag defenders say it is a symbol of Southern heritage and
honors Confederate war dead.
</P>
<P>
   Only state lawmakers can move the flag from the dome, and
several plans are under consideration. Organizers of the ''Get in
Step'' walk say it should be moved from the dome to a place of
honor.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks 161; Dow Up 132  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged today, with Microsoft
weighing down the Nasdaq composite index. But rising financial
shares and a continuing shift to blue-chip stocks kept the Dow
Jones industrials in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 171.81, or by 3.8 percent, at 4,401.02.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 13 13/16 to 92 7/16 as the company appeared
poised for harsh penalties in its antitrust case. Microsoft's
negotiations with the government broke down on Saturday, and U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was expected to rule at 5
p.m. today on Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of nearly 70 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks.
The Dow was up 132.48 at 11,054.40.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.18 to 1,502.76.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wasn't the only software company suffering today.
Legato Systems, a maker of storage software, lost more than half of
its value, tumbling 22 53/64 to 21 51/64. The company told the
Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday it would delay the
filing of its annual 10-K form, raising concerns that the company
would restate some financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Legato's plunge underscored investors' nervousness over the
long-term prospects of the technology shares that drove the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains last year. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said the market appears to be in a ''new economy correction,'' in
which investors are driving down stocks that may have run too far
in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers
today. American Express rose 5 1/16 to 154, and J.P. Morgan rose 4~
to 136|.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Home Depot advanced 3[ to 67|.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 290.32 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.34 to 531.75.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose
2.0 percent to a new three-year high, despite the hospitalization
of the prime minister and the appointment of an acting premier. In
afternoon trading, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.2 percent. A
computer problem at the London Stock Exchange made it impossible to
calculate the main market index for more than four hours in early
trading.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts Set To Regulate Guns  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McELHENNY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Armed with a court ruling, the state today began
enforcing the nation's first consumer protection regulation of
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge victory,'' said John Rosenthal of Stop Handgun
Violence, a leading proponent of gun-control measures in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would effectively ban ''Saturday night specials,''
and require handguns sold in the state to include childproof locks,
tamper-proof serial numbers and safety warnings. Enforcement of the
rules begins immediately, the attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The new gun safety regulations would not only affect
Massachusetts gun dealers, but also any gun manufacturers who want
to do business in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association this morning referred calls to
the Massachusetts-based Gun Owners Action League, which did not
immediately return a call this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Scott Harshbarger wrote the rules in
1997. In an unprecedented legal maneuver, Harshbarger relied on the
attorney general's powers to regulate faulty consumer products when
he crafted the regulations that essentially banned the sale of
handguns that failed to satisfy certain safety and performance
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Superior Court Judge Diane Kottmyer said
Harshbarger had overstepped his authority. But the Supreme Judicial
Court, the state's highest court, ruled last June that Harshbarger
had acted within his authority when he ''sought to take
preventative action as to defective handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   The court returned the case to Superior Court for further
proceedings, and in December it, too, ruled in favor of the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle ended March 20, when the gun industry failed to
meet a deadline for further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly had been waiting to ensure the gun industry had given up
its legal battle before embarking on the full-scale enforcement
effort.
</P>
<P>
   When the high court ruled last year, Steve Ruel, a spokesman for
the Gun Owners Action League, said the high court ''made a wrong
decision because of the vagueness that is in the regulations. ... I
don't think they really understand what they've made a decision
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The state also passed a tough gun-control law in 1998 that
banned some large-capacity weapons, included penalties for gun
manufacturers who don't equip guns with proper safety locks and
owners who don't properly store their guns.
</P>
<P>
   In his December ruling, Superior Court Judge John Cratsley said
the regulations were valid except where they conflict with the 1998
law.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed at midday.
</P>

or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value, around midday, while its yield
rose to 5.84 percent from 5.83 percent late Friday. Prices and
yields move in opposite directions.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise; Grains Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean prices jumped in early dealings today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by new forecasts for mostly dry
weather in the Midwest this week. Grains were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, which ended last week at their highest price in nearly
a year, extended the rally today on prospects that the soybean belt
will remain mostly dry. Traders said the lack of substantial
precipitation in most growing areas over the weekend helped nudge
the price higher.
</P>
<P>
   Corn opened higher on less-than-expected rain over the weekend,
then fell back.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures retreated after initially pushing higher on
concerns about a freeze this week in the winter wheat belt, which
accounts for most U.S. wheat production.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 2\ cents to $2.61 a bushel; May corn
was unchanged at $2.36 a bushel; July oats rose 1} cents to $1.22 a
bushel; May soybeans rose 2\ cents to $5.47} a bushel.

<P>
   Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.

   June live cattle rose .07 cent to 68.87 cents a pound; May

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Push Gun-Show Issue  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- President Clinton will visit Colorado on April 12
-- just days before the Columbine school massacre anniversary -- to
support a proposed ballot initiative to require background checks
for all gun sales at gun shows, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Staff John Podesta said Sunday on ''Face the Nation''
that Clinton will make the visit, but he didn't specify a date at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said the Clinton administration is frustrated that
Congress has not closed the ''gun show loophole'' and accused
Republican leaders of foot-dragging. Under current law, federally
licensed gun dealers who sell firearms at gun shows must conduct
background checks on prospective buyers, while unlicensed dealers
are not required to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to continue to press the case with the public that
they ought to do it. And in the meantime, I think the president is
going to try to use his efforts and his bully pulpit to go out and
deal with state initiatives that are dealing with this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An official of SAFE Colorado, a gun-control group that invited
the president, said Clinton will speak at a public rally April 12.
That's eight days before the anniversary of the shooting rampage by
two students at Columbine High School last year.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the time
and place have not been set.
</P>
<P>
   SAFE Colorado was created after the Columbine massacre, in which
two seniors at the school in Littleton, outside Denver, fatally
shot 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
used guns bought by other people at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is proposing ballot initiative in which
Colorado voters would be asked to approve a requirement that all
gun-show gun sales be subject to background checks, including those
by unlicensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The group needs 62,000 voter signatures to get the issue on the
November ballot and will begin gathering signatures soon, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Columbine shootings, the U.S. Senate passed a
bill that would have required background checks for gun show
purchases, but the measure failed in the House -- an outcome Clinton
at the time called ''unacceptable.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks 247; Dow Up 119  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged today, with Microsoft
weighing down the Nasdaq composite index. But rising financial
shares and a continuing shift to blue-chip stocks kept the Dow
Jones industrials in positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 247.12, or by 5.4 percent, at 4,325.71.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 15 3/16 to 91 1/16 as the company appeared poised
for harsh penalties in its antitrust case. Microsoft's negotiations
with the government broke down on Saturday, and U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson was expected to rule at 5 p.m. today on
Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of more than 70 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks.
The Dow was up 119.75 at 11,041.67.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.98 to 1,495.60.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wasn't the only software company suffering today.
Legato Systems, a maker of storage software, lost more than half
its value, tumbling 23 15/16 to 20 11/16. The company told the
Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday it would delay the
filing of its annual 10-K form, raising concerns that the company
would restate some financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Legato's plunge underscored investors' nervousness over the
long-term prospects of the technology shares that drove the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains last year. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said the market appears to be in a ''new economy correction,'' in
which investors are driving down stocks that may have run too far
in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers
today. American Express rose 6 to 154 15/16, and J.P. Morgan rose 5
5/16 to 137 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Home Depot advanced 3 to 67{.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 432.20 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 7-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.69 to
528.40.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Afghan Woman Decries Taliban  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Frayba Wakili of Afghanistan spent her second
day in the United States at an international feminist conference
pleading for help for women in her homeland who remain under the
control of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Afghan women was a focal point at Feminist Expo
2000, a three-day conference to review the feminist movement's
achievements and set new goals.
</P>
<P>
   Swatches of blue mesh, pinned to the clothes of many
conference-goers, represented the mesh that covers the eyes of
Afghan women, who are required to wear burqas that cover them from
head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   The country's women are no longer allowed to work, go to school
past the age of 8 or walk outside without an escort, under the
harsh brand of Islamic law espoused by the Taliban. Those who break
the rules are sometimes beaten in the streets by Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Wakili spent the last six years in a refugee camp in Pakistan as
her country was first torn apart by civil war and then taken over
by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taliban abused and used our religion to oppress women,''
Wakili said. If she returned to Afghanistan, ''I cannot hold a job
or go to school, and so would be forced to beg for food like
thousands of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, wife of ''Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, urged those
at the expo to pressure the U.S. government and the United Nations
''to put some teeth into their condemnation of the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't, make them say why not -- I want to know who
benefits from these terrible men being in power,'' she said.
''Essentially, the women of Afghanistan have been left with nothing
but their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile issue at the expo was the abortion pill
mifepristone. The pill, which has been available in France since
1988 when it was known as RU-486, has been waiting for Food and
Drug Administration approval for about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which organized the
conference, vowed to campaign for the drug's approval, declaring it
not only an effective method of abortion but also a potential
treatment for illnesses including meningioma tumors and fibroid
tumors, which can lead to hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If men were having something that major, they'd be looking for
a cure really fast,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist
Majority Foundation. ''We cut out female organs and think nothing
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference covered a wide range of other topics including
sweatshop labor, eating disorders, violence against women and the
future of the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem, the founder of Ms. Magazine and a longtime
feminist leader, said the conference showed that feminism's time is
not yet finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them impede the movement by declaring it over, which
they do every Wednesday at tea time and have done since 1969,'' she
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. mergers and acquisitions totaled a record
2,459 during the first three months of the year as many companies
expanded overseas and technology companies continued to link up.
</P>
<P>
   The largest deal announced during the quarter was America Online
Inc.'s industry-shaking $166 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc.
In all, the announced value of mergers and acquisitions between
January and March topped $493 billion, missing the previous
quarterly high set in the second quarter of 1998 by less than $1
billion, according to Mergerstat, a Los Angeles-based company that
tracks mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AOL-Time Warner deal, other notable takeovers
during the first part of the year included VeriSign Inc.'s $17.8
billion acquisition of Network Solutions Inc.; Ernst &AMP; Young's
$11.2 billion sale of its consulting business to France's Cap
Gemini SA; and The Tribune Co.'s $5.6 billion purchase of Times
Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs was the top adviser
to companies involved in mergers or acquisitions during the
quarter, followed by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell provided legal counsel in
the largest number of transactions, followed by Skadden, Arps,

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Rose in Feb.  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending grew for the fifth
straight month in February with commercial projects and
single-family homes posting big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said Monday's report suggests that higher interest
rates by the Federal Reserve have yet to significantly slow
construction activity, which has been one of the main forces behind
the economy's robust growth.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on construction projects around the country jumped by a
bigger-than-expected 1.5 percent in February to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $758.7 billion, a record level, the
Commerce Department said. Many analysts were predicting spending
would actually decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''That strength is little comfort to the Fed, which had hoped
that higher interest rates would curb construction spending and
help usher in a period of more moderate growth,'' said First Union
economist Mark Vitner.
</P>
<P>
   Construction spending in February was running about 7 percent
higher than for the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the speeding economy and keep inflation under
control. Given the outlook for strong continuing growth, many
economists predict the central bank will raise rates again May 16.
</P>
<P>
   In January, construction spending rose 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists believe that better-than-normal weather helped boost
construction spending in both January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on all nonresidential, or commercial building, rose 4.8
percent to a rate of $197 billion in February. Industrial
complexes, office buildings and hotels and motels were among the
categories posting gains.
</P>
<P>
   For all residential projects, spending was up 0.6 percent to a
rate of $340.7 billion. Single-family homes led the way with a 1.3
percent increase that pushed spending to a rate of $230.7 billion.
Spending on apartment buildings, however, fell by 2.7 percent to a
rate of $28.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch economist Andrew Groat believes higher interest
rates will dampen residential activity in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on big government projects fell 0.1 percent to a rate
of $179.2 billion in February. Public housing, hospitals and
highways reported decreases in spending, while schools and military
facilities showed increases.

<HEADLINE> Convicted murderer wants new trial, says DA concealed evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) --A medical examiner tailored his trial
testimony and helped a district attorney scheme to have a man
convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, says the man's defense
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Rivas has been in prison since 1993 serving a 25-year to
life sentence, but allegations of prosecutorial wrongdoing may get
Rivas a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Onondaga County Judge John Brunetti has scheduled a hearing this
week to hear the issues raised by Rivas' attorney. District
Attorney William Fitzpatrick's office has denied the accusations in
its written response to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick is accused of concealing evidence and documents that
would have undermined the prosecution's theory that Rivas stalked
Valerie Hill and killed her because she had rejected his attempt to
rekindle a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's body was found in her Syracuse home on March 30, 1987.
Hill, a 28-year-old pediatrics nurse, had been strangled with the
belt of her bathrobe and sexually molested.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas, Hill's former boyfriend, was questioned at length the day
the body was found but no charges were brought. That is, until
Fitzpatrick became district attorney in 1992 and decided to reopen
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas was convicted in March 1993 of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court Appellate Division upheld the conviction
in 1995. But Rivas' attorneys started further legal maneuvering's
last year after claiming they had newly discovered evidence that
warranted overturning the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argues that former Medical Examiner Erik Mitchell
concluded that Hill had been dead less than 48 hours before her
body was found. Rivas, however, had an alibi for most of that time
period, and authorities opted not to charge him initially.
</P>
<P>
   The time of Hill's death and Mitchell's findings on that issue
were key factors in the 1993 trial.
</P>
<P>
   When Fitzpatrick resurrected the case and took it to trial,
Mitchell expanded the time frame for the killing by a day, a time
for which Rivas did not have an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rivas was the victim of a concerted effort to convict that was
severed from concerns over actual guilt very early on in this
investigation and was orchestrated by the district attorney
himself,'' the defense charged.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell quit his job after being charged with criminal
misconduct in the way he ran the medical examiner's office. Rivas'
attorneys said that information raises questions about Mitchell's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are suggesting that Mitchell gave false and misleading
testimony in an attempt to ingratiate himself to a district
attorney who he knew might one day be making a prosecutorial
decision regarding his gross misconduct,'' the defense claims.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the defense claims it has learned that about
potentially helpful evidence authorities had at the time but did
not provide only after requesting documents under the state's
Freedom of Information Law.
</P>
<P>
   Among that information was that police had other suspects in
Hill's slaying and that a jail inmate had told police a mentally
disabled man had confessed to the Hill slaying a year after the
crime.

<HEADLINE> Two Gang Members Convicted in N.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Two men were convicted Monday of
abducting and killing two young women and wounding a third woman as
part of a gang initiation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they intend to seek the death penalty against
Eric Queen, 21, and Francisco ''Paco'' Tirado, 18, who were the
first of nine people to stand trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Queen and Tirado were each charged with killing Tracy Lambert,
19, and Susan Moore, 25, and wounding Debra Cheeseborough, 42, who
was shot seven times but survived.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Queen, Tirado and other members of the Crips
gang randomly picked the women as part of an initiation ritual in
1998. Prosecutors said the ''rampage of murder and mayhem'' was
carried out with bullets that had been painted blue, the Crips'
signature color.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado's lawyer said his client was not present during the
abduction or shooting of Cheeseborough. Queen's lawyers argued that
while he confessed, he should be spared because he cooperated with
investigators and had been smoking marijuana and drinking beer the
night of the crimes.

<HEADLINE> Stateside Buddhists await visit by spiritual leader  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. (AP) -- The placid face of a towering Buddha and
the sonorous sound of chants lend this mountainside monastery an
air of tranquility. But lately the Buddhists here are abuzz. They
are convinced His Holiness will come.
</P>
<P>
   His Holiness is a strapping 14-year-old Tibetan boy revered as
the 17th incarnation of the Karmapa, the third most important
leader in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   After making a daring escape from Tibet into India, the young
monk is now expected to visit North America, a journey likely to
boost the profile of Buddhism in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been expecting this for 12 years,'' said Chojor Radha,
an interpreter at the monastery. ''I never really lost hope. I knew
it would come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Karmapa has remained in India since his escape from Chinese
rule in January. The Indian government has been urged to grant
refuge to the Karmapa by the Dalai Lama, who is viewed as the
spiritual leader of all Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not ruled on the request. But the Karmapa
could possibly travel on documents issued by Tibet's government in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   Although no travel plans have been announced, the Karmapa's
followers here are certain he will come. After all, the 16th
Karmapa -- the boy's previous incarnation -- spent a lot of time
stateside. And some Buddhists see a sign in the Karmapa's
millennium prayer for peace, which gave tidings ''especially,
throughout the land of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche, a resident lama at the Woodstock
monastery, about 85 miles north of New York City, says a visit by
the Karmapa is ''definite.'' It could be within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The monastery is the main seat in North America -- where about
250,000 practice Buddhism -- for the Karma Kagyu sect of Tibetan
Buddhism. About two dozen Tibetans and Westerners live here
year-round. Many more people come to pray and learn from resident
lamas, who teach around the continent.
</P>
<P>
   A low-slung central temple houses a spacious shrine watched over
by an 11-foot, gold-leaf Buddha. Shoeless monks pad through airy
spaces decorated with vivid silk tapestries and infused with the
sweet smell of incense.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th Karmapa chose this site near the village of Woodstock
in the 1970s. He died in 1981, leaving the 17th Karmapa to witness
the fruits of his vision. A suite for the Karmapa with a cushioned
throne and a bed stands ready. Or almost ready, considering that he
is a growing boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Holiness' bed we have to replace,'' said Tom Schmidt, a
monastery administrator. ''It's too small.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation over a visit is stoked by the Karmapa's star power.
The son of Tibetan nomads was recognized in 1992 as an incarnation
of a line of lamas dating to the 12th century. His picture has
appeared in newspapers around the world since his improbable escape
from under the watchful eyes of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Followers say he embarked on an eight-day trek to India after
sneaking out a monastery window. The Karmapa reportedly walked,
rode a horse and flew in a helicopter in a journey over snowy
mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the escape came 40 years after a similar flight
from Tibet by the Dalai Lama has added to the Karmapa's mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpochesaid he expects thousands of people to be
drawn to the Karmapa when he comes stateside.
</P>
<P>
   A number of scholars of Buddhism agree that the Karmapa is
likely to visit and to attract attention. Charles Prebish,
professor of religious studies at Penn State, said the growth in
Buddhism's popularity over the past decade in this country gives
the Karmapa a built-in audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an event, to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche says the United States continues to be a
fertile ground for Buddhism. He sees amid the materialism of
America a thirst for learning that can be slaked through the
teachings of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The analysis and reasoning aspects of Buddhism attracts a lot
of Westerners,'' said monastery administrator Schmidt, who became
attracted to Buddhism in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The visit would have special meaning for the Bardor Tulku
Rinpoche, who was dispatched to America by the 16th Karmapa in
1978. The lama -- who didn't even speak English at the time -- was
given the mission of cultivating the monastery and spreading the
teachings of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Bardor Tulku Rinpoche can now show his accomplishments to the
reincarnation of the lama who sent him here: ''The only difference
is his body. His heart is the same.''

<HEADLINE> Small Advances Made vs. Epilepsy  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They call it ''the feeling,'' a warning some
people with epilepsy have that a seizure is imminent -- one that
they're powerless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   They can be midconversation when numbness begins stealing over
body and mind. Sometimes the seizure is a 30-second ''blank-out,''
just sitting glassy-eyed, unable to speak or move.
</P>
<P>
   Other times it's a feeling of falling, and then ... nothing. The
victim wakes in the emergency room with a horrendous headache and
no memory of convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're helpless,'' says Jeanne Carpenter of the Epilepsy
Foundation, a Washington lawyer who controls her epilepsy by taking
medication three times a day. ''You'd give anything if it would
just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say they're finally learning enough about this
mysterious brain disorder that Carpenter's wish may, in several
more years, be within reach: Laboratory research is pointing toward
new targets for safer, better seizure-controlling therapy, even
ways to prevent some cases of epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, doctors predict patients one day might even wear
microchip-like sensors to detect the earliest stirrings of a
seizure and immediately infuse medication onto the misfiring brain
cells to quell it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an almost palpable excitement,'' Dr. Timothy Pedley of
New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center told a conference
convened at the National Institutes of Health last week to spur the
hunt for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to happen all at once,'' he cautions. ''But we
are at a point in understanding brain mechanisms ... that patients
and their families are understandably saying, 'Let's talk about a
cure. Stop pussyfooting around.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2.3 million Americans have epilepsy, essentially periodic
electrical storms inside the brain. When the brain's electrical
circuits misfire fast enough, a seizure results. It can range from
a short glassy-eyed stare to jerking movements or the classic
convulsions and loss of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are born with epilepsy. But up to half of the people
who suffer a brain injury -- a severe blow to the head, an infection
like meningitis, a stroke -- develop epilepsy several years later.
It's impossible to predict which ones will.
</P>
<P>
   Although two dozen drugs control seizures very well for many
patients, about 600,000 Americans aren't helped by today's
medications.
</P>
<P>
   And while surgery can cure some types of epilepsy, such as
''temporal lobe epilepsy,'' far too few of the tens of thousands of
ideal candidates ever get the operation, said Dr. Marc Dichter of
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Brain surgery sounds scary, explained Dr. Martha Morrell of
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines are made by the incredibly rare, radical operations in
which a child with severe, unrelenting seizures has half a brain
removed. That's not the surgery most epilepsy patients need,
Morrell stressed. Most candidates have misfiring neurons in just
one small spot that sophisticated brain scans can pinpoint,
allowing ''very conservative and very safe'' surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The future of epilepsy care is poised to come from recent,
exciting molecular discoveries about just which brain chemicals,
cells and genes react in different ways to cause seizures.
Scientists issued a call last week to hurry up and turn those
discoveries into treatments doctors can test.
</P>
<P>
   For example, scientists now know that loss of a protein called
cystatin B causes increasingly bad seizures in ''progressive
myoclonus epilepsy.'' A logical next step is to give back patients
that missing protein, maybe as a drug. ''What are we waiting for?''
asked Dr. Jeffrey Noebels of Houston's Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are pinpointing the neurochemicals that spark
abnormal electrical signals and formation of some abnormal brain
circuits and finding a slew of novel drug targets.
</P>
<P>
   Another huge quest is to create neuroprotective drugs to keep
people from developing epilepsy after a brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still other scientists are trying to create those microchip-like
sensors to detect seizures early, and tiny implantable pumps that
could infuse anti-seizure medicine just on the misfiring cells
instead of medicating the whole brain.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors and drug pumps are more than a decade away, but
scientists say clinical trials of some other novel treatments could
start in as little as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can help in the quest: Scientists are hunting families
with a history of epilepsy to hunt related genes.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a patient who isn't seizure-free, Morrell advises
seeking care at an epilepsy specialty center. General physicians
won't understand as well as specialists the differences between the
24 medications or who is a good surgery candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Epilepsy Foundation can provide information on gene studies
and epilepsy care at http://www.efa.org.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: It's tough on campaign trail, especially for women  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COXSACKIE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that
life on the Senate campaign trail is harder than expected,
especially for women.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, running against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, also attacked both extremes in the nation's gun-control
debate, saying she has been hunting and doesn't hate guns. That is
a message seemingly designed to appeal to more conservative voters
in upstate New York, a key battleground in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a great time, but I'm also seeing how hard it is''
to be a candidate, the first lady told an audience of about 100
people at a community forum in the village of Coxsackie just south
of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost embarrassed to think back -- all the times that I
would say to my husband, 'Well, you could have said this
differently, or you could have done that.' Now, I would like to
take all those words back because it's very tough for both men and
women,'' the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said ''there are extra burdens that women
(candidates) face around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The best advice I've ever seen for women in politics came from
one of my favorite predecessors, Eleanor Roosevelt ... She said,
'You must grow skin as tough as a rhinoceros.'
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you look carefully at my skin ...'' Clinton began before
she was drowned out by laughter.
</P>
<P>
   There were serious moments at the forum, such as when one former
Democrat and handgun owner told her he had defected to the
Republicans because of what he perceived as ''no-gun policies''
being promoted by Clinton's fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she did not believe in outlawing all guns,
but did want to see them licensed, have required background checks
for owners and action to make sure children could not get at guns.
</P>
<P>
   And while attacking the National Rifle Association for being
stuck on a ''theological view'' about gun control, Clinton also
warned against ''people on the other extreme who want to take
everybody's guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone hunting,'' she said. ''I don't have anything against
guns if guns are used by responsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was fielding questions on the campaign trail,
Giuliani took time out from his mayoral duties to take in opening
day at Shea Stadium where the Mets hosted the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum in Coxsackie, the first lady proposed a doubling of
the nation's $90 million investment in microcredit -- small loans
aimed at helping very small businesses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Blocks U.S. in Abortion Case  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will have no voice
when the Supreme Court later this month considers a Nebraska case
that could determine the fate of 30 states' bans on a surgical
procedure opponents call ''partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a brief order Monday, rejected Solicitor General
Seth Waxman's request that a government lawyer be allowed to
participate when the Nebraska case is argued April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman, the government's top-ranking courtroom lawyer, filed a
friend-of-the-court brief last week that supports a Nebraska
doctor's challenge of his state's restrictive law. The brief says
the state law violates some women's constitutional right to end
their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton twice has vetoed a federal ban enacted by
Congress, which served as a model for the similar state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal was an unusual setback. Such requests by the
Justice Department are granted far more often than they are
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's brief said the law challenged by Bellevue,
Neb., doctor Leroy Carhart is written so broadly it could be
enforced against more than one abortion procedure and is too vague
to let doctors know just what abortion techniques are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the law is limited to a single procedure, the brief
said, it unduly burdens a woman's right to abortion because ''it
fails to provide an exception to preserve the pregnant woman's
health.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgical procedure at issue involves partially extracting a
fetus, legs first, through the birth canal, cutting the skull and
draining its contents. Partial-birth abortion is not a medical
term. Doctors call the method dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nebraska law and legal dispute focuses on the D&AMP;X
procedure, far more may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say
the court's decision could broadly safeguard or dramatically erode
abortion rights, depending on what state legislatures can consider
when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not issued a major abortion ruling since
1992 when it reaffirmed the core holding of its 1973 decision in a
case called Roe vs. Wade. That landmark ruling said women have a
constitutional right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court struck down the Nebraska law along with
those in Iowa and Arkansas. But nearly identical laws in Illinois
and Wisconsin were upheld by another federal appeals court.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Drug Given to S. Africa's Poor  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. is offering to
give away an expensive AIDS drug to poor South Africans, a move
that follows a series of protests and raises hopes other
pharmaceutical companies will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Diflucan, treats cryptococcal meningitis, a lethal
brain infection that occurs in nearly one out of 10 HIV-patients.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, the daily dose of Diflucan costs about $15, far
more than the country's many poor can afford. Those with the
infection must take medication for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV and AIDS Treatment Action Campaign, an advocacy group,
had lobbied the New York-based Pfizer for a year to reduce the
drug's price, said volunteer coordinator Midi Achmat. Last month, a
group of protesters broke into Pfizer's New York headquarters to
demand a meeting with Chairman William Steere, though ultimately
met with a lower-level executive.
</P>
<P>
   Thabi Nyide, associate director of corporate affairs in Pfizer's
Johannesburg office, said Monday that the lobbying was ''probably
part of a stream of events that led to this and not the only
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With or without the demonstration, I'm sure we would have done
something,'' she said. ''This is a response to an unmet medical
need in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyide said she did not know how much the offer would cost the
company. Details were still being discussed, and it was not yet
certain how the process of supplying the drug would work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's offer sparked hopes among activists that other
pharmaceutical companies would follow suit and offer HIV and
AIDS-related drugs at a discount or free. One in 10 South Africans
-- 4 million -- are believed to have HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Treatment Action Campaign also is lobbying other
pharmaceutical firms to reduce prices of other HIV and AIDS-related
drugs. The campaign has new hope now that Pfizer has decided to
provide Diflucan free, Achmat said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is asking Glaxo Wellcome PLC, the maker of AZT, to
make that drug available free to reduce the risk of
mother-to-infant transmission. But the British firm had no plans to
offer AZT free, said Ben Plumley, head of Glaxo's external
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Donations only make sense in short-term interventions and the
problem with HIV is that it is a chronic disease,'' he said, adding
that Glaxo typically offers AZT on a steep discount to patients in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, the discount is 75 percent, meaning Glaxo
charges $2 instead of $8 for a daily dose, he said. The firm is
negotiating with the South African government to buy AZT.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo already gives away AZT to the relief organization UNICEF,
which makes the pills available to people in developing countries,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks 237; Dow Up 196  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged today, with Microsoft
weighing down the Nasdaq composite index. But rising financial
shares and a continuing shift to blue-chip stocks helped the Dow
Jones industrials soar.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 237.13, or by 5.2 percent, at 4,335.70.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 14[ to 92[ as the company appeared poised for
harsh penalties in its antitrust case. Microsoft's negotiations
with the government broke down on Saturday, and U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson was expected to rule at 5 p.m. today on
Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of more than 70 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks.
The Dow was up 196.70 at 11,118.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.60 to 1,501.18, and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.19 to 526.90.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech decliners included Legato Systems, a maker of
storage software, which lost more than half its value, tumbling 24
9/16 to 20 1/16. The company told the Securities and Exchange
Commission late Friday it would delay the filing of its annual 10-K
form, raising concerns that the company would restate some
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Legato's plunge underscored investors' nervousness over the
long-term prospects of the technology shares that drove the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains last year. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said the market appears to be in a ''new economy correction,'' in
which investors are driving down stocks that may have run too far
in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers
today. American Express rose 7 11/16 to 156|, and J.P. Morgan rose
7 3/16 to 138 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Home Depot advanced 3] to 67~.
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't completely shunning technology stocks. Shares
of companies that make Linux software rose on the prospect that any
court-ordered breakup of Microsoft could stimulate demand for
Linux-based operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat rose 1} to 44[ and VA Linux rose 3 5/16 to 63 11/16 on
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft occupying center stage on Wall Street and in
Washington, investors paid little attention to the latest report
from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group
reported that growth in the manufacturing economy continued in
March, but at slower rate than February.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers also warned about the rising cost of
energy and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered
decliners by a 10-to-9 margin. Volume came to 643.69 million
shares, well behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 5-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose
2.0 percent to a new three-year high, despite the hospitalization
of the prime minister and the appointment of an acting premier.
Britain's FT-SE 100 closed down 1.2 percent. A computer problem at
the London Stock Exchange made it impossible to calculate the main
market index for more than four hours in early trading.

<HEADLINE> Tobbaco Attorney Defends Industry  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A tobacco industry lawyer told jurors Monday that
the issues in the $14.4 million damage claim by three sick smokers
can be boiled down to one basic question: Should they get paid for
smoking?
</P>
<P>
   ''You can slice it and dice it however you want to. That's where
you get to,'' said Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. attorney Gordon
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury that ruled last July that the industry conspired
to produce a dangerous product is to begin a new round of
deliberations later this week on whether the industry is at fault
in the cases of the three smokers with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If any money is awarded, the jury would then hear still more
testimony and be asked to set punitive damages for an estimated
500,000 sick Florida smokers also covered by the lawsuit. The
industry, which already owes states about $250 billion, fears a
$300 billion punitive award.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the last of the industry lawyers to present closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, attorneys for Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett
Group Inc. asked to be cleared of any damage claim because the
three plaintiffs weren't regular users of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the smokers sometimes bummed Lorillard cigarettes but
were never regular Lorillard smokers, and the third never recalled
smoking any Lorillard product, said company attorney Ken Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   They also never reported smoking any brands made by Liggett, the
smallest of the nation's five biggest cigarette makers, said
company attorney Kelly Luther.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could still find all five cigarette makers in the case
liable under umbrella fraud counts based on conspiracy, concealment
or misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., and two industry groups, the Council for Tobacco
Research and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> British Sex Shops Going Mainstream  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- One of Britain's best-known chains of sex shops,
Ann Summers Ltd., is sprucing up its raunchy image by buying out a
mainstream women's underwear business, ahead of plans to expand in
the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The chain announced Monday that it paid an unspecified sum for
Knickerbox, a retail concern that has fallen on hard times since
its heyday in the 1980s and is now in financial receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Summers, part of the privately held Gold Group International
Ltd., bills itself primarily as a lingerie store, though it also
sells what it calls ''novelties'' ranging from furry pink handcuffs
to plastic PVC underwear.
</P>
<P>
   It will take over 33 Knickerbox stores selling bras and women's
underwear in Britain, plus a smaller number of shops in Denmark,
Iceland and Ireland. The company's goal is to restore the troubled
chain to profitability and to expand Knickerbox into promising new
markets in the Middle East, Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Summers also plans to open its first U.S. shop -- its biggest
anywhere -- in Los Angeles in June, and is also negotiating with a
potential franchise partner to operate a store in New York, said
spokeswoman Rebecca Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Britain, the company hopes to convert some larger
Knickerbox shops into overtly sex-oriented Ann Summers stores. That
strategy could test public morality in a nation still renowned,
perhaps unfairly, for its traditional prudishness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knickerbox is very pretty and girly. Where Knickerbox ends,
Ann Summers starts,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Knickerbox has a reputation for moderately priced undergarments
and the convenient locations of its outlets in train stations and
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Summers got its start in the 1960s, operating a few shops
behind blacked-out windows. Today, patrons of its 27 British stores
are more likely to encounter wooden parquet floors, in-store coffee
bars, halogen track lighting and even ''wide aisles for prams,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We target women,'' she said. ''Our society has become more
confident about sexual issues. Women are becoming confident
verbally, so they're becoming more confident in their spending
also.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Summers posted sales of $68.4 million last year. The company
doesn't disclose profit figures.
</P>
<P>
   Cox attributes this success to chief executive Jacqueline Gold's
efforts to make Ann Summers more appealing to women.
</P>
<P>
   Central to that strategy has been Ann Summers' product
''parties,'' a sort of Tupperware party for sexually curious women
put on by some 7,500 organizers around the country. The events are
strictly off-limits to men.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and her management team ''probably feel that they can cut
costs and bring in economies of scale and turn Knickerbox around,''
said Diana Whitehead, a fashion editor at Drapers Record, a weekly
trade magazine for Britain's fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   As it charts its plans for expansion outside Europe, Ann Summers
acknowledges it needs to show sensitivity to different cultural
attitudes toward sex. In some Middle Eastern countries, for
example, it plans to emphasize lingerie and swimwear at its stores,
but no sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   Knickerbox could face an additional problem in the United
States, due to semantics.
</P>
<P>
   Far from suggesting trendy underwear, the word ''knickers''
conveys the image of an exceedingly frumpy type of feminine garment
for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And male American golfers might be horrified to learn that the
1930s-style legwear they know as ''knickers'' has a far different
meaning in the land that invented their favorite game.

<HEADLINE> Accused Iranian Jews Get Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's judiciary has assigned lawyers to
defend 13 Iranian Jews expected to go on trial this month on
espionage charges, Iranian radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused Jews refused to introduce lawyers and therefore
lawyers have been appointed for them,'' the state radio quoted
judiciary spokesman Hossein Mirmohammad Sadeqi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Iran's only Jewish legislator said the families of
the 13 suspects and Iran's Jewish Society had hired lawyers to
defend them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know exactly what happened. We would like them to
enjoy access to (any) lawyers,'' the legislator, Manouchehr
Eliassi, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the lawyers appointed by
the families were rejected. Judicial officials were not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is to begin April 13 in Shiraz, 550 miles south of the
capital Tehran. The suspects were arrested in Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were arrested more than a year ago. They are
accused of having spied for the United States and Israel. Both
countries deny the charges. If convicted, the suspects could face
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has been under international pressure to free the Jews or
ensure they receive a fair trial. The government says their faith
has no bearing on the case and that some Muslims have also been
arrested on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   There were once 100,000 Jews in Iran. There were 80,000 Jews in
the country just before the 1979 Islamic revolution, but the Jewish
community has since dwindled to about 25,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community remains the Middle East's largest
outside Israel. Iranian Jews are allowed to practice aspects of
their religion, but are forbidden to teach Hebrew.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair Mom Has Case Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- An appeals court has overturned the
conviction of a woman with muscular dystrophy who rode her
wheelchair in a street.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th Ohio District Court of Appeals in Toledo said Kelly
Dillery did not receive a speedy trial on the charge of being a
pedestrian in the street, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   A Municipal Court judge in Sandusky had found Dillery guilty and
fined her $100. But the appeals court ruled Friday that she had the
right to go to trial 30 days after she was served with a summons on
Dec. 4, 1998. Her trial began Jan. 21, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal means she can't be tried again in the case. She
still faces the same charge in another case, but prosecutors were
unsure if they would try her, since she has moved to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Dillery, 31, has repeatedly insisted that she be allowed to ride
in streets when she can't get her wheelchair onto sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, she was acquitted of a child-endangering charge that
arose after she allegedly rode her wheelchair in a street with her
4-year-old daughter strapped to her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Dillery is suing Sandusky, alleging the city violated her civil
rights.

<HEADLINE> Britain Toughens Asylum Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The government's introduction Monday of tough new
measures to deter asylum seekers came under immediate criticism
from a leading British charity, which said it would refuse to
accept the vouchers given to the refugees instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new initiative, asylum seekers no longer will be given
cash grants. Instead, they will get vouchers, which can then be
exchanged at participating stores for food and other necessities.
However, any change will go to the store instead of back to the
refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam, a major charity that runs a network of shops selling used
clothes and other goods, condemned the measure as
''penny-pinching'' and said it would not accept the vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee Council chief executive Nick Hardwick said the new
system would ''stigmatize and demean asylum-seekers and make one of
society's most vulnerable groups even more exposed to potential
hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new measures include imposing fines of $3,180 on truckers
who smuggle in illegal immigrants, and the forced dispersal of
asylum-seekers around the country to take pressure off London and
southeast England, where many refugees are now concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people are genuinely fleeing from countries like Iraq, then
they won't mind at all going to a perfectly civilized city like
Glasgow,'' Home Secretary Jack Straw said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are the latest attempt by Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor Party government to curb the soaring number of
asylum-seekers. The government says most are simply seeking a
better way of life, sometimes attracted by reports of generous
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Home Office says the number of asylum-seekers shot to
a record 71,160 last year, mostly coming from the former Yugoslavia
and Sri Lanka. The influx represented a 50 percent increase from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new measures, asylum-seekers will get $16 cash a week,
and vouchers worth between $30 and $42 depending on the recipient's
age.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservative Party complained that the Labor
government wasn't going far enough to try to curb the number of
refugees entering Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Tory spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe said, if in power, the
Conservatives would make greater use of detention as a deterrent to
unjustified asylum claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will send out one very simple message,'' she told the
British Broadcasting Corp. ''If you come to Britain with an
unfounded claim, one, you will be detained; two, you will be dealt
with quickly; and three, you will be removed.''

<HEADLINE> Educators Fall Short on World Goal  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failing to meet a decade-old goal of assuring
every child on earth an education by this year, world educators,
human rights groups and politicians are giving themselves 15 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   With 125 million children still out of school, the challenge is
huge and the cost up to $8 billion a year. But the Global Campaign
for Education, launched in five far-flung cities Monday, has new
tools and new supporters: the Internet and teachers unions around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   With announcements in Washington, New Delhi, India, Durban,
South Africa, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Brussels, Belgium, teachers
groups and non-government organizations operating in 180 countries
started a campaign to pressure governments and global financial
institutions into achieving universal education.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 governments have committed to the 2015 goal after
it became clear they couldn't meet the 10-year goal first set at an
international education conference in 1990. The next U.N.-sponsored
global forum is set for Dakar, Senegal, April 26-28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to sit by while one in three people in the
developing world is growing up illiterate,'' said Bob Chase,
president of the National Education Association, at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The rival American Federation of Teachers also has joined the
campaign, along with teachers' and other child advocacy groups
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a basic human right that must be met. No child anywhere
on earth should be denied an education,'' said Sandra Feldman, AFT
president, in a statement released at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The effort includes e-mail and postcard campaigns calling for
increased aid, debt relief, more private investment in education
and more help for African countries specifically. Organizers cite
successes in Uganda, where enrollment went from 50 percent to 90
percent in two years, and Malawi, where a campaign doubled
enrollment of girls in primary education.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, President Clinton's National Economic Council
director, endorsed the campaign, citing the administration's
efforts to gain debt relief for poorer countries which are unable
to educate all their children and moves to halt child labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opportunity for universal education is there,'' said
Sperling. ''This is as important as any cause that any of us can
work on.'' He added that dollars spent on education abroad go
farther both economically and morally than other foreign
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam International, a non-government development agency, and
the Global March Against Child Labor are among groups leading a
week-long global effort to get governments to commit more resources
to education.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe citizens around the world can come together and
make a difference,'' said Raymond C. Offenheiser, Oxfam president.
</P>
<P>
   Pharis Harvey, an organizer of the global campaign against child
labor, said for the United States to be a leader in the effort it
must do more to meet the needs of its own child laborers,
especially the hundreds of thousands of migrant farm worker
children.
</P>
<P>
   He said 45 percent of migrant children drop out of school
without the skills to compete for the lowest paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the richest nation on earth cannot adequately include these
children, we cannot call on other nations with fewer resources or
less commitment to solve their inadequacies,'' Harvey said.

<HEADLINE> Most Wanted UN War Crimes Suspects  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   RADOVAN KARADZIC: Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic
has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity and violating the customs of
war during the Bosnian conflict.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, he was also charged with genocide for masterminding the
slaughter of more than 6,000 Muslims in the U.N.-protected
Srebrenica enclave in northeastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992-95 war, Karadzic served as the first Bosnian
Serb president. He was replaced by his deputy, Biljana Plavsic, in
1996 and was last seen in public that September.
</P>
<P>
   He fled his stronghold village of Pale, east of Sarajevo, and is
believed to be hiding somewhere in Bosnia, in the French-controlled
southeastern zone.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia have been reluctant to go after
him, because he is reportedly heavily protected by armed personal
security guards. Belgrade sources close to Karadzic say he has lost
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Karadzic was a psychiatrist in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   If arrested, he could implicate Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, who is widely blamed for instigating the Croatian and
Bosnian wars.
</P>
<P>
   RATKO MLADIC: Former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko
Mladic has also been indicted by the U.N. tribunal for crimes
against humanity, violating the customs of war and genocide during
the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he led Yugoslav troops in Knin, Croatia and one year
later, assumed command of the forces of the Yugoslav army's 2nd
military district, which effectively became the Bosnian Serb army.
</P>
<P>
   Mladic led the Bosnian Serb military for the duration of the
war, under Karadzic, with whom he shares an indictment for genocide
linked to the massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   He was ousted from his post in December 1996, and remains at
large. Mladic has frequently been seen in Serbia, most recently
last Tuesday, when he showed up -- flanked by eight bodyguards -- at
a soccer match between Yugoslavia and China.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Mladic lives in Belgrade's Dedinje
district, where Milosevic also has his home.

<HEADLINE> People Back Campaign Finance Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of Americans in a survey say they
support campaign finance reform, including public financing of
elections, according to a group that backs the overhaul of laws on
campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Public polls on the topic consistently have shown support for
overhauling campaign finance laws, but they also place campaign
finance reform near the bottom as a priority issue.
</P>
<P>
   Only a third of the people in the survey conducted by Democratic
pollster Mark Mellman for Public Campaign ranked the influence of
special-interest money as a top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of those in the poll said George W. Bush's raising
of more than $70 million was more a symptom of what is wrong with
fund raising than a sign of broad-based support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 800 likely voters conducted March 20-23 had an error
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nyhart, executive director of the nonpartisan Public
Campaign, noted that four states -- Arizona, Massachusetts, Maine
and Vermont -- have adopted full public financing of campaigns for
candidates who agree to not take private donations and to limit
spending.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of the candidates' proposals for campaign finance
reform, Nyhart said Bush's ''dances around the edges'' while the
plan of likely Democratic nominee Al Gore ''is very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gore is an appropriate messenger for widespread
campaign finance reform -- Gore said he was an ''imperfect
messenger'' because of allegations about his past fund raising --
Nyhart said that any candidate who gets to be the likely nominee of
a major party ''has had to raise money from special interests to
get there.''

<HEADLINE> SLA Meets Uncertain Fate in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA GATE, Israel-Lebanon Border (AP) -- Israel's top ally in
Lebanon on Monday invoked the fall of the ancient hilltop fortress
of Masada -- the bloodiest last stand in Jewish history -- to
describe what may be in store for his men after Israel's scheduled
withdrawal in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Antoine Lahad's rhetoric, however, was at odds with
predictions by Israeli officials -- and of some of the 80,000
Lebanese in his charge -- of an uneventful transition, with some
militiamen going into exile with their families, and others coming
to peaceful terms with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to withdraw his
troops from south Lebanon by July, making good on an election
promise to end an increasingly unpopular occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Barak would prefer to pull out as part of a peace agreement with
Syria, the main power in Lebanon, but the two sides seem
intractably at odds over territorial issues. Without an agreement,
Lahad's South Lebanese Army faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad told reporters Monday that his 2,600 fighters would only
relinquish control of south Lebanon if given assurances by the
Lebanese government that they will not be punished for cooperating
with Israel. He also demanded that his men be absorbed into the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Lebanese government has offered lenient
treatment to lower-ranking South Lebanon Army members considering
defection. However, Lahad and other senior officers have been
sentenced to death in absentia, and it was not clear if they would
get the same deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad said Beirut's failure to meet his conditions would mean
''the government does not want to come south.''
</P>
<P>
   Without assurances from the Lebanese authorities, ''just like
you at Masada, we will fight for our land,'' he told reporters at
an Israeli army base on the border.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to a hilltop fortress in the Judean desert
where Jewish rebels and their families resisted Roman soldiers for
years. When they saw the Romans were about to breach their
defenses, 960 people killed themselves rather than surrender in
A.D. 73.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of Lahad's militiamen are already quietly moving
to avoid a cataclysm. Some speak of accommodating themselves to
Lebanese rule; others say they will seek refuge in Israel from a
vengeance promised by the Hezbollah, the Islamic militia that is
Israel's main enemy in the south.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would prefer to live in my land,'' said Issa Karim, an SLA
mechanic who was crossing into Lebanon at the ''Good Fence,'' the
transit point for the many Lebanese who shop and work in Israel.
''But if the Hezbollah comes to try and take me and my children, I
would come to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis, feeling an allegiance to a militia that has
helped their troops police the buffer zone Israel has occupied for
18 years, have lobbied their government hard to absorb the SLA men
and their families -- about 10,000 people altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are their last hope,'' said Miriam Hod, a hotelier in the
border town of Metulla who has been working on behalf of about 100
Lebanese families.
</P>
<P>
   The top Israeli army commander in Lebanon said his troops were
ready to offer refuge in Israel to any or all of the SLA men and
their families -- the first official Israeli acknowledgment of such
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is obligated to them,'' Brig. Gen. Benny Ganz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganz said he was ''optimistic'' that the post-pullout period
would be relatively free of bloodshed. He cited the SLA withdrawal
from Jezzine, a town on the northern tip of the buffer zone, last
year as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the SLA troops who remained in Jezzine -- and who had
supposedly faced death sentences for treachery -- instead spent a
few months in prison and were released to their old jobs and
families.
</P>
<P>
   Ganz grimaced each time Lahad, who is recovering from an
undisclosed illness, warned that his men were prepared to ''die on
their land.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of those under Lahad's control are sure it will come to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like Israel to stay,'' said Yusuf Salih, a 73-year-old
Lebanese returning from a day's work in the peach and cherry
orchards along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also looked forward to reuniting with two sons in Beirut.
Even the prospect of imprisonment did not daunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will see them when I get out of jail,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Causing Disease in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Bodies of people killed in the
Chechen war are decomposing in a river and causing scores of
villagers to come down with typhoid fever, local officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report of 74 cases of the potentially fatal disease in the
village of Lermontov-Yurt came during a lull in the war that has
gripped the republic for seven months. It adds a new dimension to
the plight of Chechnya's people, most of whom have lost homes and
family members in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The war has left hundreds of unburied bodies, many lying in the
republic's forests and mountains or at the bottom of its waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 bodies of rebels still lie in a minefield outside the
Chechen capital Grozny, where they died while trying to flee the
capital in early February, said the Kremlin's spokesman on
Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a water-supply system, or even a well in some
villages, most Chechens use river water for drinking. And a lack of
firewood often means the water is not boiled.
</P>
<P>
   In Lermontov-Yurt, 19 of the 74 people diagnosed with typhoid
fever have been hospitalized, said local officials, who blamed the
outbreak on water from a nearby river contaminated by dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Galina Lazikova, a senior official at the epidemic control
department of Russia's Health Ministry, warned Monday that similar
outbreaks could be expected throughout the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is no guaranteed water supply, anything can be
expected,'' Lazikova said on the Echo of Moscow radio station.
''People are drinking nobody-knows-what kind of water, contaminated
with nobody-knows-what.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can expect outbreaks of any intestinal disease ... even
cholera,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No large battles were reported in Chechnya over the past day,
Yastrzhembsky told a news conference Monday. But Chechen rebels
continue to descend from the mountains and stage surprise attacks
in the Russian-controlled lowlands, said Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have driven the main rebel forces out of the
northern flatlands into the mountains that make up Chechnya's
southern third, but seem unable to progress much further.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops continued combing the Vedeno district
deep in the southern mountains, in a search for at least 11
comrades missing after a rebel ambush last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 43 Russian servicemen died as a result of the ambush --
the latest in a series of attacks that inflicted heavy losses on
the Russians and showed their vulnerability to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The economic toll the war is taking on Russia's strained budget
has never been disclosed. But First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov said Moscow spent $210 million on the offensive in the
first quarter of this year, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in September, following
weeks of air strikes, after Chechnya-based rebels invaded the
neighboring republic of Dagestan. The rebels are also blamed for
apartment bombings in Russia in September that killed some 300
people.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Campaign Trail Is Tough  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COXSACKIE, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that
life on the Senate campaign trail is harder than expected,
especially for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost embarrassed to think back -- all the times that I
would say to my husband, 'Well, you could have said this
differently, or you could have done that,''' the first lady told
about 100 people at a community forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I would like to take all those words back because it's
very tough for both men and women,'' said Clinton, who is running
against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ''there are extra burdens that women (candidates)
face around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The best advice I've ever seen for women in politics came from
one of my favorite predecessors, Eleanor Roosevelt ... She said
'You must grow skin as tough as a rhinoceros.'
</P>
<P>
   ''So if you look carefully at my skin ...'' Clinton began before
she was drowned out by laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also repeated her support for gun licensing, a position
shared by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attacked the National Rifle Association for being stuck
on a ''theological view'' about gun control, but she also warned
against ''people on the other extreme who want to take everybody's
guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone hunting,'' she said. ''I don't have anything against
guns if guns are used by responsible people.''

<HEADLINE> Burglars Kill German Family in China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Burglars killed a German auto executive and his
family in their home in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The DaimlerChrysler executive, who had lived in China since
1997, his wife, son and daughter were stabbed Saturday night, a
German Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Pfrang was the deputy general manager of Yaxing-Benz, a
joint venture in Jiangsu province, where Nanjing is the capital.
Mercedes-Benz is a unit of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler would not release the names of Pfrang's wife and
children, aged 11 and 14. The foreign ministry spokesman would only
say that the family was from the southern state of
Baden-Wuerttemburg.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was unusual for China, where crimes against
foreigners are rare and the rate of reported crime is relatively
low. The German Foreign Ministry said there was no record of such a
crime ever being committed in China before.
</P>
<P>
   The burglars -- four young farmers -- killed Pfrang, 50, and his
family after he confronted them, said a German diplomat in China.
Police called in by security guards arrested the burglars in the
residential compound where the family house was located.
</P>
<P>
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the burglars had confessed,
and the agency stressed that police believed the break-in had no
political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attack was random, and did not specially target
foreigners,'' Xinhua said. The German Foreign Ministy concurred.
</P>
<P>
   The burglars had first ransacked an unoccupied house before
breaking into the Pfrang home, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman said the company was shocked by
the killings and praised the quick Chinese police work in arresting
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Yaxing-Benz has 38 German employees in Yangzhou, a city near
Nanjing where it makes buses, the spokeswoman said by telephone
from Stuttgart, Germany. About 60 Germans total live in the region,
the German Foreign Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Has Proven Critics Wrong  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The results of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
policies have been mixed, but he got much farther than his early
detractors predicted he would.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, 62, who was in a coma on Tuesday after suffering a
stroke, was met with widespread derision when he took office in
July 1998. Pundits predicted he lacked the charisma to get the job
done and would be out in months.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, his term in office had made an
impressive mark. His government is on the verge of breathing life
into the economy with a massive spending program, and his political
skills have squeezed a string of controversial measures through
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The results of Obuchi's policies have been varied. While the
economy has improved, the bill for his spending program will burden
government budgets for years to come. The mixed success has been
reflected in waning support for his government in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But most seem to agree that Obuchi -- who was on life support in
a Tokyo hospital -- has shown he was up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   At the pinnacle of his popularity, last summer, analysts had
only praise for his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the economy, foreign policy, and getting legislation
approved, I think Obuchi deserves pretty high marks,'' said Takashi
Inoguchi, a professor of politics at Japan's prestigious Tokyo
University.
</P>
<P>
   While other top politicians had grabbed headlines, Obuchi has
toiled behind the scenes and by the book, working his way up the
Liberal Democratic Party ranks.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University, Obuchi won
election to Japan's powerful lower house of Parliament in 1963 at
the age of 26 -- inheriting, in common Japanese fashion, the seat
held previously by his father. He's been elected to the seat ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi first served as a Cabinet official in 1979, when he was
selected to jointly head the Management and Coordination Agency and
Okinawa Development Agency.

<P>
   In 1993, he became the Liberal Democrats' secretary-general, one
of the three key party posts, under Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. A
year later, Obuchi took control of the biggest of several rival
factions in the LDP, succeeding former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
</P>
<P>
   He became foreign minister in 1997 -- a post considered a
stepping stone to becoming prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has never described himself as a big shot, at least in
public. He once reportedly compared himself to a ''noodle shop
between two skyscrapers,'' referring to two of his proteges, former
prime ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and the late Takeo Fukuda.
</P>
<P>
   That humble image is often cited as a key to his success.
Instead of the hard-driving style that is often frowned upon in
Japan, Obuchi favors low-key consensus-building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his economic policies, he also has used his
skills to push a number of tough packages through Parliament,
including passage of controversial U.S.-Japan defense guidelines
that boost Tokyo's regional security role.

<HEADLINE> Plan: Satellites Aid Alzheimer's  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The death of an Alzheimer's patient who
strayed from home and tumbled down a hillside has prompted an
ambitious project to use satellites to find victims of the disease
if they become lost.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, developed by a Spanish Alzheimer's association and due
to be introduced late this year, is to have patients wear a tracer
that give police real-time coordinates of their position if they
wander too far.
</P>
<P>
   Getting lost is an often lethal danger for victims of
Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative brain disorder that robs people
of their memories, judgment and other mental skills.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tracer -- using global positioning system
technology, or GPS -- would emit a signal that bounces off a
satellite to a monitoring center if the patient goes beyond a
certain radius from the home. Staff would call relatives and
determine if the patient is in fact missing. If so, police can set
out in search.
</P>
<P>
   The idea originated three years ago when an Alzheimer's patient
wandered from his home in Barcelona and was found dead months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in November of last year, another Alzheimer's patient
vanished from his home in the southwestern city of Almeria during a
cold spell and was found dead days later curled up under a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes dramatic things like these for people to become aware
of the issue,'' said Paloma Ramos, president of the Spanish
Association for Relatives of Alzheimer Victims.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the U.S. Alzheimer's Association said a
device like the one being built in Spain would be an important
development.
</P>
<P>
   One study conducted in the United States indicated that when an
Alzheimer's patient gets lost, after 24 hours pass there is a 46
percent chance they will die, said Gerald Flaherty, special
projects coordinator of association's Massachusetts chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wandering is the most life-threatening behavior associated
with Alzheimer's,'' Flaherty said from Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The project is initially to be run as a pilot experiment
starting in Barcelona in October.
</P>
<P>
   The device is being developed by a Spanish firm called
Technosearch. Its president, Jose Luis Pellicer, said the
challenges involved are daunting -- mainly, building a battery that
is tiny but strong enough to send a signal to a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first-generation tracer will probably be about the size of
a pack of cigarettes,'' Pellicer said. ''By the third or fourth
generation, we hope to get it down to the size of a bracelet.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, that will take about two years and the final
product will probably cost about $500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Signatron Technology Corporation of
Concord, Mass. is also working on a bracelet-style GPS tracer, said
systems engineer Jim Zagami.

<P>
   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Producer Aaron Spelling is donating every
episode of Lucille Ball's last weekly TV series to the Lucy-Desi
Museum in the late comedian's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling was executive producer of ''Life With Lucy,'' which
aired in 1986, and his company, Spelling Entertainment, owns the

</P>
<P>
   His relationship with the actress dates to 1955, when he
appeared in an ''I Love Lucy'' episode.
</P>

   ''With Mr. Spelling's donation, the Lucy-Desi Museum can now
offer visitors screenings of rarely seen 'Lucy' shows,'' museum
Director Ric Wyman said. ''This donation is quite a gem for the

   Microsoft Ruling To Come Late Today
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft
antitrust trial prepared to release his verdict today after the
close of trading on Wall Street. The ruling follows the collapse of
negotiations between Microsoft and the government. A recording for
the federal courthouse said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson would disclose his ''findings of law'' today after
financial markets closed. Stock in Microsoft Corp. lost 13 percent
of its value today after the news was disclosed. The judge was
expected to rule against Microsoft, based on harsh assessments he
outlined last November in his ''findings of fact.'' In that
document, Jackson found that Microsoft repeatedly engaged in
anti-competitive behavior by taking advantage of its monopoly
power. The charges were made in a lawsuit filed against the company
by the government and 19 states.

   Nasdaq Sinks 245; Dow Up 229
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged today, with Microsoft
weighing down the Nasdaq composite index. But rising financial
shares and a continuing shift to blue-chip stocks helped the Dow
Jones industrials soar. Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Nasdaq
composite index was down 245.80 at 4,327.03. Microsoft fell 14 9/16
to 91 11/16 as the company appeared poised for harsh penalties in
its antitrust case. Microsoft's negotiations with the government
broke down on Saturday, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson was expected to rule at 5 p.m. EDT today on Microsoft's
guilt. Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its
steep plunge was the equivalent of more than 70 Dow points, Wall
Street's best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial
stocks. The Dow was up 229.81 at 11,151.73.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending on construction projects around the

commercial building. The Commerce Department reported today that
construction spending climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of $758.7 billion, an all-time high monthly level. February's
performance was stronger than many analysts were predicting. In

20 industries surveyed by the National Association of Purchasing
Management, 17 reported higher prices. The index of the

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel Inc. is putting its troubled Learning

offerings. The world's largest toymaker said today that it has
retained investment firm Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. to sell
the money-losing Learning Company, which has been a burden to
Mattel since it was acquired last May for $3.6 billion. Problems
with the Learning Company led to Jill E. Barad's resignation in
February as Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer. She
announced her departure after Mattel reported a steep
fourth-quarter and year-end loss, mostly due to troubles with the
software business.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Musical Greats Inducted  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi paid tribute to its storied
music history by inducting Elvis Presley, B.B. King and Robert
Johnson into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen others were also honored during the Hall of Fame Gala
on Saturday -- and not all were the household names like Elvis and
B.B.
</P>
<P>
   ''Music is such a large part of my life, and I learned that in
Mississippi,'' said inductee Nanette Workman, a singer and actress
in Canada and Europe. ''I'm extremely proud to be recognized in my
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some notables not inducted were John Lee Hooker from Clarksdale,
Conway Twitty from Friars Point, Muddy Waters from Rolling Fork and
Howlin' Wolf from West Point.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we were going to leave off persons that we realized
had a big impact on music in Mississippi,'' said Ellistine Holly,
head of the selection committee. ''But we will have another gala
next year, and the year after that, too.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Sinks 301; Dow Up 230  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index
today, falling steeply in advance of a judge's ruling in its
antitrust case. But rising financial shares and a continuing shift
to blue-chip stocks helped the Dow Jones industrials soar.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 301.76, or by 6.5 percent, at
4,271.07. The index was on track for its worst performance in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 15\ to 91 as the company appeared poised for
harsh penalties, including a possible order to break itself up.
Microsoft's negotiations with the government broke down on
Saturday, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was
expected to rule at 5 p.m. today on Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of more than 75 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks.
The Dow was up 230.82 at 11,152.74.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.66 to 1,501.24, and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.89 to 525.20.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech decliners included Legato Systems, a maker of
storage software, which lost more than half its value, tumbling 24
13/16 to 19 13/16. The company told the Securities and Exchange
Commission late Friday it would delay the filing of its annual 10-K
form, raising concerns that the company would restate some
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Legato's plunge underscored investors' nervousness over the
long-term prospects of the technology shares that drove the Nasdaq
to unprecedented gains last year. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said the market appears to be in a ''new economy correction,'' in
which investors are driving down stocks that may have run too far
in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers
today. American Express rose 8[ to 157 1/16, and J.P. Morgan rose
6\ to 138.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Home Depot advanced 3[ to 67|.
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't completely shunning technology stocks. Shares
of companies that make Linux software rose on the prospect that any
court-ordered breakup of Microsoft could stimulate demand for
Linux-based operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat rose 1 7/16 to 43 13/16 and VA Linux rose 3 5/16 to 63
11/16 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft occupying center stage on Wall Street and in
Washington, investors paid little attention to the latest report
from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group
reported that growth in the manufacturing economy continued in
March, but at slower rate than February.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers also warned about the rising cost of
energy and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues narrowly
outnumbered decliners. Volume came to 776.26 million shares, well
behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 3-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose
2.0 percent to a new three-year high, despite the hospitalization
of the prime minister and the appointment of an acting premier.
Britain's FT-SE 100 closed down 1.2 percent. A computer problem at
the London Stock Exchange made it impossible to calculate the main
market index for more than four hours in early trading.

<HEADLINE> Opening Arguments in Marine Case  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain charged in the
heatstroke death of a reservist refused to slow the pace of a night
training hike, then left before a head count was completed, a
prosecutor said Monday in opening statements at the officer's
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Marines on the hike testified they were marched so fast that
many became overheated and ill and straggled out of the sight of
Capt. Victor Arana, 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were going down all over the place,'' said Lance Cpl.
James Vasser. ''I saw Marines in the road vomiting, with cramps in
their legs. Myself, I was vomiting the majority of the hike.''
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Maj. Chris Hamilton, told the judge that Arana was
overheard on the hike saying, ''I don't care who dies,'' and that
Arana told his staff as he left after the hike, ''Mama ain't
waiting up all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana, from DuPage County, Ill., is charged with failure to obey
an order and dereliction of duty in the death last July 7 of Lance
Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn. If
convicted, Arana could be sentenced to more than 3{ years in prison
and be dismissed from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   A wrestler and lacrosse player, Leto had just completed his
second year at Western New England College when he came to Camp
Lejeune for infantry training. Arana led Leto and 179 other
Marines, all carrying weapons and packs, on an eight-mile night
march in 80-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Leto's body was found two hours after the hike ended near a back
road at Camp Geiger, a training facility that is part of Camp
Lejeune. Prosecutors contend Arana didn't follow established
procedures for training hikes, normally conducted at a slightly
slower pace and with more rest stops than hikes for seasoned
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence will show while Captain Arana was concerned about
getting home, his staff was worried about getting a good head
count,'' Hamilton said. ''Evidence will show he left the field just
as he conducted the hike -- in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Mark Stevens said in his opening statement that
Arana's superiors didn't give him specific guidance for conducting
the hike, Arana's first command assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence will show that he did slow down at the request of
his staff,'' Stevens said. ''This was the first and only time any
request was made of Captain Arana to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the hike ended, the group spent the night in the field, and
Arana stayed with them for at least an hour and left when told by a
sergeant the head count was complete, Stevens said. Arana returned
when notified there was a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arana gave his staff instructions on dealing with stragglers,
said Stevens, but ''his guidance was completely disregarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said a defense witness will testify that Leto ''was
holding a perfectly normal conversation'' with a sergeant and
showed no evidence of the heatstroke blamed for his death.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser testified that Leto's comrades knew he was missing after
the first head count, conducted after the hike ended.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexican Volcano Erupts, Then Calms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The huge Popocatepetl volcano spewed ash and
gas a mile high above its crater in a brief eruption, monitors said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-886-foot high volcano calmed after two bursts Sunday
evening, according to the National Center for the Prevention of
Disasters. No ash plume was visible on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in February expanded the recommended no-enter zone
around the volcano to 4 miles from 3 miles because of increased
activity, including the formation of a new lava dome within the
crater.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano, about 40 miles southeast of Mexico City, has been
spewing vapor, ash and rock intermittently since December 1994
after lying largely dormant since 1927. It had been relatively
quiet over the past year, but produced minor eruptions in October
and November.

<HEADLINE> Florida Canker Quarantine Expanded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Stepping up their battle against citrus
canker, Florida agriculture officials expanded the quarantine zones
Monday and ordered that all field hands statewide disinfect
themselves and their equipment before entering or leaving citrus
groves.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus canker poses a major threat to Florida's $8.5 billion
citrus industry. The plant disease causes fruit to fall prematurely
and ultimately can kill the tree.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than 200,000 residential trees and more than
300,000 commercial trees have been destroyed in a $174 million
eradication effort.
</P>
<P>
   The 773-square-mile Miami-Dade and Broward County quarantine
area was expanded to nearly 1,000 square miles, north to the Palm
Beach County line and south to Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Collier County's quarantine area expanded westward from 43
square miles to 77 square miles. Hendry County has a new quarantine
area of 16 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to stay ahead of the spread of canker, and expanding
these quarantine areas will help us do that,'' said Agriculture
Commissioner Bob Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the quarantine areas may not move citrus trees,
fruit, leaves or stems from their property. They also may not
exchange citrus fruit with anyone or plant new citrus trees. They
are required to dispose of any citrus fruit or debris in doubled
plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   The new decontamination measure requires that all workers wash
themselves and clean their equipment before entering and leaving
property containing citrus plants, even if the grove is not
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Workers can decontaminate themselves with antibacterial soap and
clean their equipment with an ammonia solution.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Condemns Austrian Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a resolution Monday
condemning the ''anti-democratic, racist and xenophobic views''
expressed by Joerg Haider and other leaders of the right-wing
Freedom Party that joined an Austrian government coalition last
February.
</P>
<P>
   The non-binding resolution, passed by voice, expressed
''profound regret and dismay'' that the Freedom Party would play a
major role in the new government and urged the White House and the
administration to make clear to Austria U.S. concern about the
inclusion of a party associated with xenophobic, racist policies.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that Haider in the past has praised Adolf Hitler's
employment policy, called Waffen SS veterans ''decent people'' and
decried, in expressions used by Nazi leaders, the
''over-foreignization'' of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., ''echoes the
sentiment of many in the international community who are deeply
disturbed by events taking place in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   The government coalition sworn in Feb. 4 is split equally
between the Freedom Party and the conservative People's Party.
Haider does not have a national government position and has said he
is stepping down as leader of his party May 1, but is thought to
wield influence through party members holding ministerial
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has withdrawn its ambassador and members of the European
Union have downgraded relations as a result of the Freedom Party's
ascendance to power.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds No-Compensation Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that makes it far more difficult for landowners to get compensated
when government regulation prevents them from developing their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, turned away a Florida dispute
over the availability of compensation when property owners show
regulation deprived them of all economically viable use of their
land.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court said such a showing is not enough, and
ruled that landowners also must prove they had ''reasonable''
expectations of developing the property.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling is now binding law in all lawsuits against the
United States in which a claim for at least $10,000 is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Good Jr. owns a 40-acre tract of undeveloped land on Lower
Sugarloaf Key in Monroe County, Fla. The tract, known as Sugarloaf
Shores, is mostly comprised of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Good and his mother bought the land in 1973, and his efforts to
develop it began in 1980. In 1981, he sought U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers permission to fill or excavate 13 acres for a development
of 54 houses and 48-slip marina. Permission was granted in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Good pursued the necessary state and county
approvals, and had received them by mid-1984. But a state agency
then complained about the proposed development, and in 1986 the
Florida Land and Water Adjudication Commission ordered Monroe
County to review the project under a more stringent standard.
</P>
<P>
   Good sued, and in 1989 again had county permission for the
development.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, the Lower Keys marsh rabbit was placed on the
federal government's endangered-species list. And in 1991, the
silver rice rat was added to the list. The federal Fish and
Wildlife Service said Good's planned development would jeopardize
both species.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on that finding, the Corps of Engineers rejected Good's
permit application. He sued in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Federal Claims ruled for the government, and the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rejected Good's argument that a 1992 Supreme
Court decision means landowners always are entitled to compensation
when government regulation denies all productive use of their land.
</P>
<P>
   That decision did not eliminate ''the requirement that the
landowner have reasonable, investment-backed expectations of
developing his land,'' the appeals court said. ''In view of the
regulatory climate that existed when (Good) acquired the subject
property, (he) could not have had a reasonable expectation that he
would obtain approval to fill 10 acres of wetlands in order to
develop the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''reasonable expectations'' requirement has been part of
property condemnation laws for many years, but some courts have
ruled it does not apply in cases like Good's.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Good's lawyers noted that the
Endangered Species Act had not yet been made a law when he bought
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Under the appeals court rationale, they said, ''a property owner
will be held to lack such expectations even if nothing barred his
proposed development on the day he purchased the land if the
development is contrary to some future law or as yet unpromulgated
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Good vs. U.S., 99-881.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils Environmental Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALIQUIPPA, Pa. (AP) -- George W. Bush challenged Al Gore on
Monday on environmental issues, one of the vice president's
perceived strengths, and said his presidential rival had some
explaining to do on positions he took in his book, ''Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on former steel mill property that has been cleaned and
is about to re-open as a $120 million wallboard plant, the presumed
Republican presidential nominee proposed a plan for contaminated
sites that would be modeled after programs already in use in 35
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contrasted that with the federal Superfund cleanup program,
which is behind schedule and over budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our state is a state, like Pennsylvania, that didn't wait for
Al Gore to wave his magic wand to clean up our environment,'' the
Texas governor told reporters after speaking at the US Gypsum plant
in suburban Pittsburgh. ''We cleaned it up ourself, and our state's
the better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Gore would have to explain his book, which, among
other things, includes criticism of the internal combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Gore was an extremist on the environment,
Bush said, ''I think the vice president is probably going to have
to explain what he meant by some of the things in his book, to
share with us the philosophy behind some of the standards in the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush acknowledged he has not read ''Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Bush's plan, the Gore camp cited the vice
president's own proposals to expand open spaces, fight urban sprawl
and ban new oil drilling as proof of his environmental credentials.
</P>
<P>
   It also said Bush's plan to deal with contaminated
''brownfields'' mimicked or expanded federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difference between Al Gore and George Bush on the
environment is like night and day,'' said spokesman Doug Hattaway.
''Al Gore has a long history of fighting for the environment while
George Bush presides over the most polluted state in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental problems in Texas include Houston air pollution
that recently surpassed that of Los Angeles. Since Bush signed
legislation in 1995, some 451 brownfield sites in Texas have been
cleaned, adding $200 million to local property tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Coming a week after Bush unveiled reading and teacher
improvement plans, the governor's environmental speech continues an
effort to coax support from Democrats and independents by
portraying Bush as a government reformer at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said developers often ignore polluted industrial sites
because they don't want to deal with government cleanup rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of hassling with sites that might be the subject of
Superfund liability lawsuits, developers simply move on to pristine
sites farther out in the country on the suburban fringe,'' he told
a group of plant construction workers wearing hard hats.
''Brownfields get passed over, while greenfields get paved over,
furthering what's now known as urban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his proposal, Bush would:
</P>
<P>
   --Direct the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for
brownfield cleanups that are more flexible than existing Superfund
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Superfund was created under 1980 legislation aimed at cleaning
the most contaminated sites in the country. However, the General
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said that as of
last June 30, only 595 of 1,231 Superfund sites had been cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants the EPA to take the intended use of a site into
account, enforcing strict standards if an old factory is slated to
become a school, but being more lenient if it will be demolished,
capped or turned into a new factory.
</P>
<P>
   --Give developers who clean up brownfields under state
redevelopment plans protection from federal legal action if the
sites are cleaned according to the new U.S. standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Focus more on developing technologies and methods to clean
brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   --Streamline bureaucracy and block-grant money under the $35
million Brownfield Cleanup Revolving Loan Fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Extend permanently a brownfield cleanup tax credit that is
scheduled to expire Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   --Direct active federal facilities to comply with all
environmental protection laws and hold them accountable when they
do not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush headed from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, Pa., where he was
attending two fund-raisers. On Tuesday, he was visiting
Philadelphia to speak about education policy and meet with Latino
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, Bush planned to campaign in California.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for China Trade  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- With the support of high-technology
executives and moderate Democrats, President Clinton today pushed
Congress to approve normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   With this city's Tech Museum of Innovation serving as his
backdrop, Clinton touted the benefits of trade with China to
members of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council. Both the DLC
and the high-tech community are strong supporters of granting
permanent normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is asking Congress to give China the same
permanent low-tariff access to U.S. markets it routinely gives
nearly all other trading partners. China's status now must be
renewed annually. The change would facilitate China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the economic consequences of letting China into the
WTO are ''100 to nothing'' in the United States' favor. It puts U.S
companies in a position to expose the Chinese people to an open,
democratic way of life, Clinton said, while China would have no
greater influence in the United States than it has now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the answer is to allow them in, and let liberty spread
from within,'' Clinton said. ''They know it may unleash forces that
the leaders themselves may not control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House Democrats and organized labor oppose the trade
agreement. But the DLC and Clinton have used their support of free
trade as evidence that they are different from the old liberal
Democratic politicians of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-trade faction of the party is finding allies among the
growing high-technology industry. High-tech companies have begun a
major lobbying campaign in support of China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive officers of 200 high-tech companies, including
Microsoft, IBM and Sun Microsystems, signed a letter urging
Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations with China.
''We consider it the most critical vote you will make in support of
our high-technology industries,'' the executives wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration today released that letter, as well
as a separate letter in support of China trade signed by 40
governors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to get the high-technology community more involved in
the effort around this vote,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert
said. ''A lot of members on the Hill listen to the high-tech
community. They're the ones creating jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies and the people who run them have become a
major source of campaign giving. Upon arriving here from Las Vegas
Sunday evening, Clinton went straight to a fund-raiser for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The event, expected to
raise $1.1 million, was held at the home of Jim Jorgensen, chief
executive officer of AllAdvantage.com, a 1-year-old Internet
company, and sponsored by other high-tech industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Around 150 people, who paid at least $5,000 each to attend the
event, joined Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea; House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt; California Gov. Gray Davis; and several
area congressional candidates for chicken skewers, grilled salmon
and chocolate cupcakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let this election be about little things. And don't let
this election be about divisive things,'' Clinton said. ''We've got
the chance of a lifetime to build the future of our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton raised $525,000 for the Democratic
National Committee at two fund-raisers in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk to the party faithful, Clinton said voters must
choose between the short-term gratification of an outsized
Republican tax cut or the long-term satisfaction of knowing the
money will keep safety-net programs like Medicare and Social
Security in the black for another generation of retiring Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a moment for making tomorrows. This is not a moment
for indulging ourselves in all this good stuff that's going on
today,'' Clinton said. ''Are we going to pick leaders that we know
understand the future and can take us there, or are we going to
pick people who say things we like to hear and may make things
easier for a month or two?''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed; Wheat Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures tumbled Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, while other grains and soybeans finished mixed.
</P>
<P>
   An early-session rally carrying over from Friday, driven by
concerns about a crop-harming freeze this week in the winter wheat
belt, failed to hold in the wheat futures market. Prices sank
nearly 2 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to have second thoughts about the chances of
crop damage from cold weather in wheat-growing regions over the
next two nights. The decline also was fueled by the slump in corn.
</P>
<P>
   Corn prices also got early support from dry weather concerns
before retreating. Fears that foot-and-mouth disease in South Korea
could spread added to the selling mood.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans rose slightly despite pressure from wheat and corn.
After ending last week at their highest price in nearly a year,
soybeans extended the rally on prospects that the soybean belt will
remain mostly dry. The lack of substantial precipitation in most
growing areas over the weekend helped nudge the price higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 4{ cents to $2.57} a bushel; May
corn fell 1} cent to $2.34\ a bushel; July oats rose 2 cents to
$1.21 a bushel; May soybeans rose 1 cent to $5.46{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures were higher.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle rose .18 cent to 69.15 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .02 cent to 83.90 cents a pound; June lean hogs
rose .12 cent to 73.27 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .05
cent to 97.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Leads Bush in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore had a double-digit lead over George
W. Bush in a New York poll out Monday, while Bush had the advantage
over Gore in a survey taken in traditionally Republican Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The two were tied in a new poll that came out in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The New York poll from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion showed the vice president ahead of the Texas governor, 49
percent to 38 percent. Gore has led Bush in several New York polls
out this winter, though the two were close in Marist polls last
December and earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are in a statistical dead heat among male
voters, with 46 percent supporting Gore and 42 percent for Bush,
but Gore leads Bush among women, 53 percent to 35 percent. The
telephone poll of 561 registered voters was conducted March 27-28
and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were tied at 46 percent apiece in a Wisconsin poll
taken by St. Norbert College from March 1-23 of 574 likely voters
with an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Bush led
Gore by 54 percent to 36 percent in an Indiana poll of 651
registered voters taken March 26-29 by the University of Indiana
Center for Survey Research with an error margin of plus or minus

<HEADLINE> Livestock Disease Strikes S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A provincial government in South Korea
indefinitely closed all livestock markets Monday amid increasing
fears that the deadly foot-and-mouth disease could become a
national epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Kyonggi province, which surrounds but does not include the
capital Seoul, said it will close all 32 livestock markets to
prevent further spread of the fatal ailment. Other provinces and
cities are expected to follow suit, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease began showing up around
March 20 at two farms in Paju in Kyonggi province, north of Seoul,
several more farms farther south are believed to have been
infected, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem requires an all-out government effort to be
controlled. It threatens to become a national epidemic,''
Agriculture Minister Kim Sung-hoon told a Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The government confirmed Sunday that the disease in Paju was
foot-and-mouth. It was the first confirmed outbreak of the disease
in Asia since it wiped out nearly all of Taiwan's pigs three years
ago. Seoul has not confirmed whether the illness in other areas was
the same disease.
</P>
<P>
   Foot-and-mouth disease is highly communicable and can kill
carrier animals and ruin entire beef and milk-cow herds. It cannot
be passed on to people.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has also reported suspected outbreaks of the disease in 19
cows on two farms since Saturday, and officials are testing
thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Japan and South Korea to suspend imports of beef
and pork from each other. Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Singapore also banned imports from both countries. China prepared
to join them.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea, which suffers from chronic food shortages, the
government has not confirmed any cases. But South Korean
intelligence officials said the ailment may have cropped up there.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Hongsong, a major cattle growing area 60 miles
south of Seoul, became the second region to be hit by the suspected
disease. So far, hundreds of cattle and pigs have been slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Yongi and Hwasong, two more villages along the
western coast about 50 miles away from Hongsong, reported that
their cattle and pigs had blisters in their mouths, typical
symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities sealed off the areas and began inoculating hundreds
of thousands of animals. Officials slaughtered infected livestock,
burned barns and banned imports of Chinese hay suspected of having
transmitted the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers set up roadblocks and let vehicles and travelers pass
only after being thoroughly fumigated or sanitized. But officials
fear the highly contagious disease might already have spread.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of the disease is threatening South Korea's farm
industry. South Korea last year exported 89,000 tons of pork to
Japan. It exports little beef.

<HEADLINE> African, European Nations Meet  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Sharp rebukes and frank pleas punctuated the
first day of the Africa-Europe summit Monday, overshadowing the
warm words of cooperation and hope that marked the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting is a major effort to overcome the bitterness
of Europe's colonial past and launch new efforts to bring the
heavily indebted African nations into the global economic and
political mainstream. But a vehemently anti-Western statement by
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi raised tensions that more moderate
leaders had hoped to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door session attended by heads of governments and
top ministers, Gadhafi said Europe ''had been submerged by American
imperialism,'' according to a diplomat who heard Gadhafi's speech.
The diplomat quoted Gadhafi as saying in the unflinching 20-minute
address that ''unless Europe is freed from NATO, it cannot be
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit host President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt had tried to keep
the session from deteriorating into a forum for airing old grudges.
Arab diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity Monday said
Mubarak had asked Gadhafi not to raise controversial topics.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi's message conflicted with the conciliatory tone set by
Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal, whose country holds
the presidency of the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to change our conception and preconceptions of each
other,'' said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
   Debt remained the overriding issue.
</P>
<P>
   Africa as a whole has $350 billion in external debt, with some
countries paying more every year to service their loans than they
do on health and education.
</P>
<P>
   President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania said African nations know
where they have to go, what's unclear is how.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not necessary to hammer to African governments the value
of competitive economic regimes with and between countries,'' he
said. Africa, Mkapa said, ''wants to be part of the action, not an
object of perpetual international pity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though African hopes for immediate substantial relief from
the EU were dashed, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder offered
$350 million in debt relief to almost 30 African nations as ''a
special sign of solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that the other creditor nations will follow our
example,'' the chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the 53-member
Organization of African Unity, said the need for a ''faster, deeper
and broader process of debt relief cannot be overemphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not wait for a major catastrophe to occur,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, which recently offered $1 billion in debt
relief to the world's poorest nations, had little more to give at
the summit beyond a promise to write a report that will be studied
at a future ministerial meeting. Most work on African debt will be
handled by other international institutions, such as the Paris Club
of creditor nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Africa today is suffering from both deprivation and the burden
of this ever-widening gap between the rich north and the poor
south,'' said President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, current
chairman of the OAU. ''Africa hopes that it will find listening
ears and understanding from Europe during this summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans were most interested in talking about ending
Africa's many conflicts, and promoting democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transition to democracy is not quite achieved in the whole
of the continent,'' said Romano Prodi, president of the EU
Commission, the organization's executive arm.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe angrily complained that
Britain was still treating his country like a colony.
</P>
<P>
   ''Britain has no right, no right at all, to try and suggest to
the rest of the world that we are a failure,'' he said in response
to British criticism of political violence at a weekend peace march
in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The march, organized by the country's biggest opposition
alliance, was marred by black war veterans attacking demonstrators
who were protesting the takeover of more than 700 white-owned
farms.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down iggest Fall; Dow Up 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology shares plunged Monday, with a
tumbling Microsoft dragging down the Nasdaq composite index to its
biggest point drop ever. But rising shares in financial businesses
pushed the Dow industrials sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index plummeted 348.58 points, or by 7.7
percent, to close at 4,224.25, according to preliminary figures.
That was far beyond the previous record daily drop of 229.46
points, set Jan. 4, and also was the fifth-biggest daily percentage
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused index had plunged 390.20 points last
week, even with a rally Friday. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq now has fallen more than 16
percent. But even with the decline, the Nasdaq is 3.8 percent above
where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average shot up 300.01 points, or 2.7
percent, to close at 11,221.93, according to preliminary
calculations. Last week, the Dow fell 190.80. Even with Monday's
increase, it was off about 4.3 percent from its Jan. 14 record of
11,722.98 and 2.4 percent below where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell $15.56\ to $90.68} a share in late trading as the
company appeared poised for harsh penalties in the government's
antitrust case. Negotiations broke down Saturday, and U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was expected to issue a verdict after
markets closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said the market appeared to be in a ''new economy correction,'' in
which investors were driving down stocks that may have run too far
in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend but
doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Microsoft is a component of the Dow, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained, because of the strength of financial
stocks. American Express and J.P. Morgan both were up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues narrowly
outnumbered decliners. Volume came to 776.26 million shares in late
trading, well behind Friday's pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by
a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.0 percent to a
three-year high, despite the hospitalization of the prime minister
and the appointment of an acting premier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troubled by Haitian Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Haiti's fledgling democracy at a turning
point, the State Department said Monday it is deeply troubled by
the killing of prominent Haitian radio journalist Jean Leopold
Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urge the government of Haiti to ensure a thorough and
prompt investigation,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, a strong advocate of a free press in Haiti,
reportedly was shot dead by two gunmen as he arrived for work
Monday at Radio Haiti Inter. The assailants also killed a station
worker.
</P>
<P>
   The attack underscored the sense of insecurity in Haiti as
officials try to organize elections and install a new parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been a number of reported threats against
opposition candidates,'' Rubin said, and a number of other
disturbing events have not been explained fully.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our standpoint, we believe that credible elections can be
held in April and May, in time to convene the new parliament by the
second Monday of June, consistent with Haitian constitutional
law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Significant further delays, he said, would undermine the
credibility of the electoral process and risk the momentum toward
an early election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to constitute promptly a legitimate parliament will
risk isolating Haiti from the community of democracies and
jeopardize future cooperation and assistance,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be a ''great tragedy'' if Haitians were to
squander the opportunity to establish democracy after a U.S.-led
intervention in 1994 that ousted a military regime.

<HEADLINE> SBC Refiling Application to FCC  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications is asking federal
regulators to start a new review of the company's bid to offer
long-distance service in Texas, seeking to bolster its
much-criticized application with additional information.
</P>
<P>
   Edging close to the deadline by which the Federal Communications
Commission was to have decided on the original application, SBC
requested that the agency look at a fresh set of facts. That would
buy the company 90 more days to make its case that it should be
allowed to provide long-distance to its local customers in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   It would become only the second Bell company allowed to do so,
behind Bell Atlantic which began offering long-distance to its New
York local customers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said Monday he hopes any new
submission by SBC would address both his concerns and that of the
Justice Department -- which submitted a largely negative evaluation
of SBC's bid. A 1996 law mandated that before a Bell company can
offer long-distance within its service area, it first must show in
detail that it has opened its local monopoly to give rivals a
chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission's primary objective in evaluating long-distance
applications is to ensure that the local markets are open to
competition,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   He asked that SBC address a number of issues, including the
company's handling of requests from rival businesses seeking to
lease lines so they could offer high-speed Internet and local phone
services. Kennard also asked that the company detail its processing
of orders to switch local phone customers over to competing
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had pinpointed these areas -- which are
part of the test to show the local phone market is open to
competition -- as problematic. Last month, in another filing, the
department reiterated its concerns and said SBC's performance for
providing pieces of its local network to competitors ''in some
cases worsened'' since the initial evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   SBC said it would seek to address the concerns raised by the FCC
staff and Justice Department in a new filing, which it would make
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FCC has the final say, it must give substantial
weight to the assessment provided by the Justice Department. The
commission must also take into account the evaluation of the Public
Utility Commission in Texas, which had lent its unanimous support
to SBC's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But local phone competitors, including MCI WorldCom which has a
presence in some Texas markets, had argued that SBC was not
processing their orders to switch over customers to their service
accurately or quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While SBC's action shows that it recognizes its shortcoming,
''starting a new 90-day review period without first fixing these
problems does not represent progress,'' said Michael H. Salsbury,
MCI WorldCom general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said that once the three-month clock is restarted, all
parties would have a chance to resubmit their comments.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Compete Hard in California  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush is taking pains to show
he won't let history repeat itself in California, eight years after
his father ceded the state early to Bill Clinton in a move that
helped the Democrats win back the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With symbolism and actions, the presumptive GOP presidential
nominee is seeking to reassure jittery Republicans that he intends
to fight for the state and win -- just as his father did in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Even though he's far behind Democrat Al Gore among
Hispanics in the state, he's going out of his way to seek their
votes. He's popular among Hispanics back home in Texas, and during
the California primary campaign he challenged other candidates to
debate him on issues important to Hispanics, but ''solamente en
espanol'' -- only in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has the upper hand among voters statewide, with the
latest Field Poll showing him 10 points ahead. He also has a
powerful ally in Gov. Gray Davis. And the Clinton administration
has rained down federal money in recent months -- a tactic Bush is
powerless to counter.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president topped Bush 35 percent to 28 percent in the
state's open primary last month, in line with a wave of Democratic
popularity that swept all but two Republicans from California's
statewide offices a year and a half ago. So some political
scientists predict Bush will channel resources into more winnable,
less expensive states.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's people insist he's not budging in a state that holds
one-fifth of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the beginning of the campaign, Governor Bush has always
prioritized California, and it has always figured centrally in his
national political strategy,'' said Margita Thompson, a California
campaign spokeswoman. ''That was true for the primary, and it's
more than true for the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   It better be, suggests GOP consultant Sal Russo, who worked on
presidential campaigns with Ronald Reagan. However the November
vote turns out in California, he says, a candidate who writes off
the state early jeopardizes the party here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, others note, giving up on such a big state would
allow Gore to concentrate his efforts elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hard decisions will be made later in the summer about where to
focus time and money to try to win a majority of the 270 electoral
votes, Russo said. ''Until then, California is going to be in the
hunt. If it isn't, we ought to throw in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will campaign in California this week, beating the vice
president to the state following last month's wave of primaries.
But he won't stay long this time. After about a day and a half in
this state of 34 million people, he returns to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can count on some affection for his boss rubbing off on
him, particularly in Hollywood. In their first appearance together
in months, Clinton and Gore will appear at a Beverly Hills
fund-raiser April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also sending surrogates here regularly. His father
headlined a fund-raiser near Palm Springs recently, though it was
not publicized. By contrast, the Democratic National Committee is
using high-profile surrogates as it orchestrates Bush-bashing news
conferences throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers can find a little comfort in neutral analysts'
comments on California -- but only a little.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be competitive, it depends where the McCain voters go
in California and where the big bloc of independent voters go,''
said Mark Baldassare, survey director at the Public Policy
Institute of California. ''I've yet to see evidence that there's a
lock for the Democrats in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign points out that its only state campaign office
remaining open after the big primaries was in California. The
campaign doesn't mention that officials had quietly attempted to
close the office, then reversed course, fearing such a move would
raise concern.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Davis helped run the elder Bush's California campaign in
1988, when the then-vice president captured the state and the White
House. The winning formula is simple, he said: Bring in the
candidate early and often.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was here so much we could hardly keep up,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion is divided among Republican candidates, consultants and
activists around California as to how vigorously Bush will campaign
here.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Issa, who is seeking a congressional seat that straddles
San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties, said the coattail effect
is critical for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has an obligation to be here a great deal of the time,''
said Issa, who predicted Bush will spend one-ninth of his time and
money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to wait in the Burbank airport for him,'' said
Craig Missakian, a GOP candidate for the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, the Republican consultant, said the debate over what Bush
will do is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only one decision to make now: We need to keep
California competitive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Drugs-Colonel's Wife,Bjt,510  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. Army colonel was implicated for the first
time Monday in a scandal in which his wife admitted smuggling
heroin while he was commanding the military's anti-drug operation
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a Brooklyn federal judge, prosecutors revealed
that James Hiett is now facing criminal charges that he failed to
turn in his wife, Laurie, for laundering drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett has agreed to plead guilty to ignoring a felony, the
letter added. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 3 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in
January, saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of
drugs to New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to
collect the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act
falling under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mrs. Hiett told reporters she purposely kept her
husband in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New
York,'' she said. ''I just told him, 'Don't ask me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors refused to detail the case against the colonel. His
attorney, Abraham Clott, did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Harvey Perritt said that Hiett remains on active
duty at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Vt., where he was transferred after
allegations arose against his wife. He said military officials
would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in
Panama had cleared Hiett, saying he had ''no prior knowledge'' of
his wife's crimes. Brooklyn prosecutors, meanwhle, had insisted
their investigation was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett -- an admitted cocaine addict -- surrendered to
authorities last August after they intercepted two 1.2-kilo
packages of heroin that she allegedly mailed to Queens and
Manhattan from a post office at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The parcels had her return address. But she claimed she sent
them for Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for U.S. military
commanders in Colombia, and that they contained books, candy,
coffee and Colombian artifacts. She pleaded innocent, and was freed
on bond.
</P>
<P>
   One of her codefendants, Hernan Arcila, 54, pleaded guilty on
Jan. 5 to drug conspiracy, admitting that he accepted shipments
from Colombia at his Queens address. Ayala, who was also named in a
13-count indictment, remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea, Laurie Hiett told a federal magistrate she
shipped six packages from Bogota to New York City, believing they
contained cocaine. Tests on the two seized shipments revealed they
were heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant also described flying to New York City two times
to pick up cash. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Dunst also said Laurie
Hiett once took another trip to Miami carrying a half kilo of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still free on bond, Mrs. Hiett faces up to nine years in prison
at sentencing April 28. Her husband is to enter his plea on April
17.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court allows lawsuit from man hit by patrol car  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A state appeals court has pierced the wall
of immunity that protects police officers from being sued by people
who are injured as a result of high-speed chases.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled Monday that Martin Torres of Perth Amboy has the
right to sue the city police department and the officer who struck
him while chasing a van that had violated the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been spectacular -- and sometimes
fatal -- crashes arising from high-speed police chases, and in most
of them the courts have ruled that injury lawsuits cannot be filed.
</P>
<P>
   State laws protect police from a flurry of such lawsuits,
sticking to the legal doctrine that to expose police to such
liability would intimidate them from doing their jobs aggressively.
This legal safety net is broken only when it can be shown that a
police officer acted recklessly or with extreme negligence to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   But appeals court Judge William D'Annunzio, writing for a
unanimous three-judge panel, said Monday this so-called ''hot
pursuit'' legal standard applies only when there is a real police
chase going on, and they define this as a situation in which a
criminal suspect knows the police are after him and he decides to
evade capture.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the court said the immunity from lawsuits does
not apply to speeding-ticket cases because the person who is being
pursued does not know it and is making no effort to evade capture.
</P>
<P>
   The Perth Amboy patrolman spotted a van exceeding the speed
limit by more than 20 mph, so he said he made a U-turn, activated
his lights and increased the speed of the patrol car to catch up
with the van and pull it over.
</P>
<P>
   Torres crossed the street at an intersection and was struck by
the patrol car. He suffered two broken bones in his spine and
multiple fractures to his leg. Torres claimed the light was green
for him to cross and that the officer had activated neither his car
lights, nor his siren. The officer claimed Torres was crossing at a
red light, and that the patrol car's lights and siren were on.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge dismissed Torres' lawsuit on the grounds the
police officer and the city were protected by immunity.
</P>
<P>
   These disputes about whether the lights and siren were on were
not relevant to the appeals court because they concerned themselves
with the dismissal of the case. Issues of what actually occurred
will be up to a jury to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of Judge D'Annunzio's ruling was that this was not a
''pursuit'' under legal definitions because the alleged speeder
driving the van was not trying to evade the police and in fact
probably did not know he was being chased.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crucial element of this definition is the officer's
reasonable belief that the pursued vehicle is aware of a police
attempt to stop the vehicle and the pursued driver is resisting
apprehension by increasing vehicle speed, ignoring the officer or
otherwise attempting to elude the officer,'' D'Annunzio wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''A pursuit creates an enhanced risk of mishap and injury,'' the
judge wrote. ''In contrast, a police officer's attempt to close the
gap on a speeding vehicle that is not attempting to flee does not
involve the risk (factors) of a pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Annunzio said immunity from liability in real police chases is
essential ''to promote police participation in the high-risk action
without the inhibiting concern of a civil reprisal. Such a
rationale is less important in the context of lower-risk events
such as (the officer's) attempt to close the gap and stop a
nonfleeing speeder.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the city, Frederick Rubenstein, would not
comment, referring calls to city police officials, who were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Fall Is Biggest; Dow Up 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index
today, falling sharply in advance of a judge's ruling in its
antitrust case and intensifying investors' stampede away from
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But rising financial shares and a renewed clamoring for
blue-chip issues helped the Dow Jones industrials soar 300 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 348.65, or 7.6 percent, at
4,224.18. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history,
surpassing a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 16\ to 90 as the company appeared poised for
harsh penalties. Microsoft's negotiations with the government broke
down on Saturday, and U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
was expected to rule at 5 p.m. today on Microsoft's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of more than 80 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained on the strength of financial stocks and
retailers. The Dow was up 300.01 at 11,221.93.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 7.39 to 1,505.97.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,575 up, 1,517 down and 384
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.02 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.20
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 21.76 to
517.33.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has been trading places with Cisco Systems as
the world's largest company by market capitalization, affected the
Nasdaq more dramatically than it did the Dow because the Nasdaq is
a weighted index, giving more significance to larger companies. The
Dow gives equal weight to each of its 30 components.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Microsoft's woes exacerbated growing nervousness
over the entire technology sector, analysts said. Since closing at
a record high 5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft kick-started the selling, but the weakness is pretty
intense across the board,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of
listed trading at SG Cowen in New York, citing biotechnology and
networking stocks in particular. ''A lot of these stocks went
straight up for months, and now they're going straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech decliners included Legato Systems, a maker of
storage software, which lost more than half its value. The company
told the Securities and Exchange Commission late Friday it would
delay the filing of its annual 10-K form, raising concerns that the
company would restate some financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology, a maker of computer-aided design
software, plunged after announcing that its earnings for the
current quarter will dramatically miss estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In an already nervous market, those disappointments brought
stiff punishment to the entire sector, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
described the Nasdaq's ongoing decline as a ''new economy
correction,'' in which investors are driving down stocks that may
have run too far in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers
today. American Express and J.P. Morgan rose sharply. Home Depot
and DuPont also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flip side to the Nasdaq's problems is that there's some
pretty strong buying in quality names,'' Sheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors weren't completely shunning technology stocks. Shares
of companies that make Linux software rose on the prospect that any
court-ordered breakup of Microsoft could stimulate demand for
Linux-based operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft occupying center stage on Wall Street and in
Washington, investors paid little attention to the latest report
from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group
reported that growth in the manufacturing economy continued in
March, but at slower rate than February.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers also warned about the rising cost of
energy and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indicators were mostly lower, although none
matched the drama of the Nasdaq and the Dow.

<HEADLINE> Ridge Mute on a Bush VP Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALIQUIPPA, Pa. (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman stood
mute last week as George W. Bush W. Bush answered a question about
whether she could be his running mate. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge couldn't stop talking when Bush was asked about him.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush, the Texas governor and presumed Republican
presidential nominee looking on in amusement, Ridge insisted he
would not discuss the subject if and when a call came.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential
candidate for Bush because his state has 23 electoral votes, he is
Catholic and a Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's got to make that determination himself,'' Ridge
said when asked if he met Bush's professed qualifications of having
a running mate who likes him and agrees with his politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would just say right now that I'm sure over the next couple
of months, people are going to say, 'Did the governor call you?'
And I'm just not going to tell you if he calls and when he calls,
and I think it's very important. I just say this with great
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, it is the governor's call, pure and simple, and
the last thing in that very important process he needs is other
elected officials running around saying, 'Hey, I got a call, I got
a call, I'm on the list.' Secondly, it's not fair to the
individuals, it won't be fair to the person that the governor
ultimately selects, so I'm just going to lay it all out: I'm never
going to tell you,'' Ridge added.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Fla. Adult Zoning  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused on Monday to let
Jacksonville, Fla., enforce an ordinance that required sexually
oriented businesses to obtain special exceptions before operating
in almost any part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Denying without comment an appeal filed by city officials, the
justices left intact a ruling that called the zoning ordinance an
unlawful ''prior restraint'' on those businesses' freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been pending before the justices since last August.
They apparently postponed consideration of it while studying a
nude-dancing dispute from Erie, Pa. In that case, the justices
upheld a public-nuisance law last week that requires dancers to
wear pasties and G-string.
</P>
<P>
   A group of businesses known as ''lingerie shops'' challenged the
Jacksonville zoning restriction. Rather than sell women's apparel,
these establishments specialized in nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge upheld the challenged ordinance as applied
to those businesses, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed that ruling last May.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a special exception was needed for locating an
adult-entertainment business everywhere but two locations in
Jacksonville, the appeals court called the special exception the
equivalent of a license.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning ordinances would allow such establishments at more
than 90 locations, as long as a special exception was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a form of prior restraint, licensing schemes commonly
contain two defects: discretion and the opportunity for delay,''
the appeals court said. ''Jacksonville's zoning exceptions contain
both defects.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit court said city zoning officials had virtually
unbridled discretion in deciding whether to grant special
exceptions, and they could delay indefinitely any action on
applications for exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has given communities broad leeway since 1976
to determine where such businesses are allowed with a ruling that
restrictions must be judged under a deferential ''time, place and
manner'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jacksonville case, the appeals court acknowledged that
''combating the harmful secondary effects of adult businesses such
as increased crime and neighborhood blight is a substantial
government interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said drafting an ordinance that addresses
those harmful effects and protects the businesses' free-expression
rights is not difficult, but that Jacksonville had failed to do so.
It said the city must allow the lingerie shops to locate in any of
the more than 90 locations without first getting a special
exception, as long as all other zoning code requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the city said the
zoning ordinances did not ''seek to suppress ... First Amendment
rights but rather ... preserve the quality of life for the citizens
of the city of Jacksonville.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Jacksonville vs. Lady J. Lingerie, 99-356.

<HEADLINE> Maine Outlaws Use of 'Squaw'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- All Maine communities and natural
landmarks containing the word ''squaw'' -- a term considered
offensive to women and Indians -- will be renamed under a bill
signed Monday by Gov. Angus King.
</P>
<P>
   A special commission will recommend new names, which are
expected to take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just an issue of being politically correct,'' said
Tony Sprague, a spokesman for the governor. ''This is a term that
is offensive to them and it shouldn't be used in public places.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ''squaw'' roughly translates to ''whore.''
</P>
<P>
   The law affects about two dozen mountains, waterways and other
features, such as Squaw Pond and Big and Little Squaw townships.
Private entities aren't affected.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Penobscot, Pasamaquoddy, Micmac and Maliseet
tribes were present as the bill was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took a lot of work from people in the native communities to
open up and talk about something that's as heartfelt as this,''
said Rep. Donald Soctomah, the Passamaquoddy Tribe's representative
and sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota and Montana have adopted similar laws, and in
Colorado, even the endangered squawfish was renamed the Colorado
pikeminnow.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Donna Loring, the Penobscot Nation's representative, said
the bill's approval showed that tribal-state relations are
improving.
</P>
<P>
   The law will affect map-making nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a huge deal for us,'' said Charles Conley, marketing
manager for Freeport map company DeLorme Inc. ''Part of being a
mapmaker is knowing you'll always be making revisions.''

<HEADLINE> Emergency Appeal by White House  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an emergency appeal, the Clinton
administration asked a federal appeals court Monday to set aside a
judge's finding that President Clinton committed a crime when he
released letters from presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a
Reagan-appointed judge, is ''a clear error of law that is properly
corrected at this time'' by a writ from the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in the nation's capital, the Justice Department said in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth ''imposed significant restrictions on the president and
his closest advisers'' by saying that the Privacy Act applied to
the Executive Office of the President, and ''the need for immediate
appellate review is particularly plain,'' the Justice Department
stated.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision last week, Lamberth noted that he had ruled in
1997 that the White House needed to follow the Privacy Act, just
nine months before Clinton and his White House lawyers released the
letters Willey wrote to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In its court papers, the Justice Department said Lamberth
committed a ''significant error'' by treating his 1997 decision as
''a binding ruling'' that was ''non-appealable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A single district court's statement on an issue of law does
not make the executive branch's reasonable understanding of the law
unreasonable, much less criminal,'' said the Justice Department
filing signed by department lawyers Mark Stern and Michael Rab.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Lamberth had written that ''the White House and
president were aware that they were subject to the Privacy Act, and
yet chose to violate its provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth's ruling came in a lawsuit by Reagan and Bush
administration appointees over the Clinton White House's gathering
of hundreds of FBI background files on Republican officials. The
judge gave the conservative group Judicial Watch, which is
representing the former officials, wide latitude in exploring
whether the White House routinely gathered and released damaging
information about opponents.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Russian Official Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Former Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov,
arrested more than a year ago on charges of embezzlement and
illegal possession of weapons, has been released from prison, the
news agency ITAR-Tass reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalyov's case has not come to trial, but he was released
because the Prosecutor General's office has finished its
investigation and Kovalyov could not interfere with it, the news
agency said, citing law-enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalyov was ousted by then-President Boris Yeltsin in July
1997, shortly after national television news programs aired a
videotape that appeared to show him cavorting with naked women in a
Russian bathhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports said the bathhouse was frequented by one of
Russia's most notorious mafia gangs, and implied that the justice
minister was linked to the mob. Some reports also suggested
possible links to a banker jailed on suspicion of embezzling
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   When arrested in February 1999, he was charged with illegally
possessing weapons and ammunition, and embezzling $50,000 from a
legal foundation he leads.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Economy Grows in March  </HEADLINE>
By PETER SVENSSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With prices for energy and industrial raw
materials rising in March at their fastest rate in five years,
manufacturing executives are worrying that the added expenses may
dampen business, a private report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the higher prices, the industrial economy continued to
grow in March, at a slightly lower rate than in February, according
to the widely watched report by National Association of Purchasing
Management.
</P>
<P>
   But financial markets ignored the latest evidence of growing
inflationary pressures and economic strength in a turbulent day on
Wall Street. The Nasdaq composite index plunged to its biggest
daily point drop ever, undercut by tumbling Microsoft stock, while
the Dow industrials soared.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert J. Ore, head of the purchasing agents' survey committee,
said that ''prices are currently increasing at an alarming rate,''
with 17 of 20 industries reporting higher prices for supplies,
especially for fuel and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of respondents expressed concern that escalating
energy-related costs may slow the economy,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report stoked expectations that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates for a sixth time since June to cool off the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The economic news, including a government report of a sharp rise
in construction spending in February, had little impact on the
stock market. Technology shares continued a steep selloff, with
Microsoft shares plunging on the collapse of negotiations to settle
an antitrust case with the government. A federal judge ruled after
markets closed that Microsoft Corp. violated federal antitrust laws
and tried to monopolize the Web browser market.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite plummeted 349.15, or by 7.6 percent, to
4,223.68. It was the biggest one-day point drop and the
fifth-biggest daily percentage decline ever. Microsoft stock lost
about $80 billion of its market value. But the Dow industrials shot
up 300.01, or 2.7 percent, to 11,221.93.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the five past Fed rate increases have yet
to rein in the galloping economy, construction spending rose 1.5
percent in February, the Commerce Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a big jump in commercial construction, spending reached a
seasonally adjusted all-time high monthly level, at an annual rate
of $758.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' index of the manufacturing economy was
at 55.8 percent in March, down from 56.9 February, but well above
the reading of 50 that indicates growth. The index measuring prices
paid for raw materials was at its highest level since February
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Neill, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal and Harris
Bank in Toronto, said the figures indicated a ''limited, very
limited moderation'' in the economy's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key here, the component that would be most focused on, is
the prices part of it,'' he said, forecasting that the Fed would
increase rates by a full percentage point this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't provide any relief from the acid indigestion that
they're feeling, this is not a Rolaids treatment for them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a contrary view, Paul Christopher, an economist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the price index was not as
important as it once was, and that the rising prices would not
necessarily be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Producers are able to use energy a lot more efficiently than
they were the last time we had a big run-up in oil prices,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, increased productivity and new financial instruments that
allow companies to stabilize their oil costs help absorb the higher
prices, Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this report will be ammunition on the side of those on
the Fed's policy board who would advocate a continued cautious
approach,'' he said, predicting another increase of a quarter
percentage point when the Fed meets May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The report surveyed the purchasing executives at more than 350
industrial companies and is closely followed because it is one of
the first readings of the economy's strength for the just-concluded
month.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ENFIELD, Conn (AP) -- Some inmates at Willard-Cybulski
Correctional Institution assumed the worst when they were awakened
early Monday morning, and checked their lockers for cigarettes and
other contraband.
</P>
<P>
   The government was coming -- but only to count the inmates. U.S.
Census workers in Connecticut fanned out to prisons, extending the
national head count to people who aren't getting their mail at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the census of prisoners began Saturday and will
continue through May 6. In Connecticut, the census on Monday was
visiting 20 prisons housing 17,000 inmates, said field operations
supervisor Herman N. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to regional census offices to determine how they will
conduct the prisoner count. In Michigan, the agency is training
prison employees to conduct the head count, said Andy Hupp, a
census technician. The count will take place on different days at
various prisons, Hupp said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10-state region handled by the Denver office, the count
began last week, said Don Lunsford, a regional technician.
</P>
<P>
   Data collection is starting this week in Pennsylvania, Maryland
and surrounding areas, said Nunzio Cerniglia, assistant regional
census manager. Census workers have not objected to going in
prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're indoors in this case,'' Cerniglia said. ''You have a
controlled environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states rely on prison administrative records rather than an
actual count of inmates, said Bart Eaton, area manager in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut's approach of training prison staff to
distribute the census forms is common, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got woken up at 7:30 this morning. Everybody thought we
were getting shut down,'' said a Connecticut inmate named Dwight.
Prison officials allowed inmates to be identified by first names
only.
</P>
<P>
   Most prisoners filled out a short form seeking basic information
such as name, age, race and date of birth. Like the general
population, one in six prisoners were given a long form seeking
additional information such as whether the person is a veteran and
if they worked last week.
</P>
<P>
   A thick door slid open slowly, leading to a brightly lit
cafeteria where dozens of inmates wearing beige uniforms walked in
slowly to fill out the forms. Five prisoners volunteered to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just hope it helps toward my 15-day re-entry,'' one man joked,
meaning he hoped his sentence would be reduced for his cooperation
with the count.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of inmates refused to fill out the form Monday,
Department of Correction spokeswoman Heather Zimba said. Federal
law provides a $100 penalty for refusing to cooperate with the
census, but violations are seldom prosecuted. It was not clear
whether the Connecticut inmates would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials brought forms in 37 languages, from Arabic to
Yiddish. Spanish was a common request.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty self-explanatory,'' Major Bruce Cuskovich told the
prisoners. ''Anybody have any questions so far?''
</P>
<P>
   A counselor, interpreter and other staff were present to answer
a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne, a 36-year-old inmate from New Haven, said it was
important for inmates to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to know where some of that money goes,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Other inmates questioned the need for a formal census of people
already counted several times daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know where we're at,'' said Jamaal, a 23-year-old
prisoner from Hartford. ''Everything we filled out in that form
they already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The census affects government funding for different programs and
the number of seats states receive in the U.S. House of
Representatives. It also can influence decisions such as where to
locate a veteran's hospital or additional prison housing, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much more than counting heads,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners objected to questions about income and race.
Dwight had a problem with a question asking whether he stays at his
residence most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not staying here,'' Dwight said. ''I've been in and out of
here a couple of times, but I don't intend to make a habit of it.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Eradicating Abandoned Cars  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They endanger children, fill with trash and
rats, provide a haven for vice and crime and are the most visible
symbol of urban decay and despair -- and the city is cracking down
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of junked cars haunt Philadelphia's streets,
sometimes sitting for years before they are towed away. Some are
left by car thieves or unlicensed mechanics after being stripped
for parts. Others are just abandoned by owners who cannot afford to
fix them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mayor John F. Street, who won a close election on a
pledge to clean up Philadelphia's blighted neighborhoods, launched
a major effort to tow 1,000 abandoned cars a day for the next 40
working days.
</P>
<P>
   The city has readied a fleet of 100 tow trucks, set up a hot
line for residents to report cars, raised the amount paid to
salvage companies, and set aside land under a bridge over the
Schuylkill River to store wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   After the biblical-sounding 40-day effort, authorities hope a
centralized police unit and stiff fines for abandoning vehicles
will help them keep ahead of the 4,000 to 5,000 abandoned car
reports each month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once these cars are gone, we are going to make sure that they
never ever accumulate in our neighborhoods ever again. We will have
a zero-tolerance program for all abandoned cars,'' Street said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor -- whose city will receive intense national media
attention when the Republican National Convention is held here in
July -- said he hopes that removing the stripped and burned-out
hulks will change people's attitudes about their city.
</P>
<P>
   One example was the gutted black Oldsmobile occupying a lane and
a half of a side street just off one of Philadelphia's main
thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   All four tires were gone. The ripped-up seat cushion was jammed
up against the steering wheel. The hood was propped open, revealing
the nest of pipes and hoses left after nearly every part had been
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   It had been sitting there for two months -- not that long by
Philly standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''People dump them and just forget about them,'' said John
Jones, 52. ''Neighbors complain, but nothing happens. You call and
you call and you call, and nothing gets done. It happens every day
in North Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's been hard to get a parking space, there's so
many of them,'' said Lucy Leon, 32, washing her own Buick near
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Drug dealers and prostitutes use the abandoned cars for their
business. Last spring, a 7-year-old boy was killed by a gun he
found under an abandoned car.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is so serious that the Philadelphia Daily News has
for months run as a regular feature a photo of the ''Abandoned Car
of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The city towed more than 35,000 cars last year, almost twice the
number two years earlier, but says there is still a backlog of
about 40,000 vehicles. Police and towing companies have blamed red
tape for slowing paperwork and clogging impoundment lots.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, police could tow a car after ticketing it and waiting
for 48 hours, or even less if it poses a safety problem -- ''for
example, if it's blocking traffic, if they've spotted children
climbing in and out, if there's broken glass or twisted metal,''
said Laura Templeton, a state Transportation Department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Once the car was in a storage lot, officials in Harrisburg were
required to notify the last registered owner, giving him 30 days to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   But about one-third of the city's abandoned wrecks lacked
identification numbers, leaving no way to notify anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, a vehicle that has no vehicle
identification number and is worth less than $500 may be towed and
crushed without delay. Cars that have VIN numbers and are worth
more than $500 will be towed after 11 days, then can be crushed
about 30 days later after the owners are notified.

   Judge Rules Against Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today found that Microsoft
Corp. violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, ''maintained its monopoly
power by anticompetitive means'' and attempted to monopolize the
Web browser market. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
also ruled that Microsoft violated another section of the law by
''unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' and
could be sued under state anti-competition laws. Microsoft Corp.
shares were down 15 at 90~. The judgment sets up a new round of
hearings to determine what punishment to impose on Microsoft,
including the question of whether the huge company founded by Bill
Gates should be broken up. The judge accepted 23 of 26 arguments
brought forth by the states that joined the federal government in
the case. Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein said: ''The
decision will benefit consumers and stimulate competition and
innovation in the high-tech industry.''

   Nasdaq Fall Is Biggest; Dow Up 300
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index
today, falling sharply in advance of a judge's ruling its antitrust
case and intensifying investors' stampede away from technology
stocks. The Nasdaq composite index was down 348.65, or 7.6 percent,
at 4,224.18. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in
history, surpassing a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4. But rising
financial shares and a renewed clamoring for blue-chip issues
helped the Dow Jones industrials soar 300.01 points to 11,221.93.
It rose despite the fact that Microsoft is also a component of the
Dow, and its steep plunge was the equivalent of more than 80 Dow
points.

   Construction Spending Rose in Feb.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending on construction projects around the
country rose 1.5 percent in February, led by a big jump in
commercial building. The Commerce Department reported today that
construction spending climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of $758.7 billion, an all-time high monthly level. Meanhile, a
report that the U.S. manufacturing economy was continuing to grow
also brought a warning that prices for energy and raw materials
were going up. The National Association of Purchasing Management
said the manufacturing growth was somewhat slower than last
month's.

   Mattel To Sell Software Unit
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel Inc. is putting its money-losing
Learning Company division up for sale, hoping to get rid of the
burdensome software unit that led to ballooning debt and big losses
at the world's biggest toymaker. Mattel said today that it retained
the investment firm Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. to find a
buyer for the Learning Company, which it acquired last May for $3.6
billion as part of Mattel's effort to tap the growing market for
interactive toys. The Learning Company was supposed to immediately
add $50 million annually to Mattel's bottom line. Instead, it added
losses of $206 million in 1999 and led to Jill E. Barad's
resignation in February as Mattel's chairman and chief executive
officer.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Jumps Back Against Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar jumped back against the yen Monday
after the Japanese central bank intervened in markets to weaken its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was quoted at 104.85 yen in late New York trading, up
from 102.64 yen on Friday. Its moves were less pronounced against
other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan once again stepped into financial markets by
buying dollars and selling yen in a bid to weaken the yen, whose
recent runups have raised alarms among Japanese financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   The bank took action after releasing its latest quarterly survey
of business sentiment which, as expected, showed a slight improved
in Japan's economic outlook. Currency traders anticipating a strong
showing in the report, known as the Tankan, had pushed the yen
higher against the dollar late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese authorities have intervened in currency markets several
times this year to weaken the high yen, which can choke off profits
at Japanese exporting companies that rely on overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   The yen did not appear to react to the political uncertainty
caused by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was less changed against other currencies. The euro
was changing hands at 95.91 cents, up slightly from 95.59 cents
late Friday, and the British pound edged higher to $1.5990 from
$1.5934.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6488 Swiss francs, down from
1.6643, and 1.4515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4499.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0393 German
marks, down from 2.0458; 6.8397 French francs, down from 6.8615;
and 2,018.95 Italian lire, down from 2,025.39.

<HEADLINE> Elian Talks Shift to Handover  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal government Monday began working with
Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives on a plan to turn the 6-year-old
boy over to his father when he arrives in the United States, a
federal official said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 100 protesters outside the relatives' Little Havana
home practiced forming a human chain and vowed they would stop at
nothing to keep the boy from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would have to go over the bodies of all of us Cubans who
are here,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 70, who is not related to the boy.
''They would have to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials had demanded that the relatives here sign
an agreement to hand over the boy if their legal battle to keep him
in the United States failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Immigration officials dropped a threat to revoke
Elian Gonzalez's legal status. Justice Department officials were
working with attorneys for Elian's Miami's relatives on a plan for
the handover, said a Justice Department official, who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father,'' said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ''The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father, but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, said he
would not comment on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The family is appealing a federal judge's ruling that affirms an
INS order to return the boy to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, stepmother and half-brother were among 28 people
in Havana applying Monday for visas to come to the United States.
Other applicants included teachers, Elian's classmates and National
Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, a trusted adviser to Cuban
President Fidel Castro on U.S. issues.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the group could be ready to leave for the United
States as soon as Tuesday if the visas are granted and U.S.
authorities give the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, assurances that
they will give him custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives have said they will abide by any
government ruling, insisting only that the transition take Elian's
psychological well-being into account.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was rescued off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving after
spending 50 hours alone on an inner tube. His mother and 10 others
died in their attempt to flee Cuba. Since then, Elian has been in
the custody of his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Elian spent part of Monday playing with a pet rabbit in the back
yard of Lazaro Gonzalez's home, while in front, protesters
practiced forming a human chain, sitting on the ground with their
arms linked.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters stomped their feet as Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader
of the Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy Movement, used a
bullhorn to call for Cuban-Americans to come to the home to protect
Elian. The Miami area has nearly 800,000 Cuban-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush met with safety officials to determine how to
respond to possible unrest if Elian is removed from the Little
Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas' statement last
week that local authorities would not assist the federal government
if it attempted to remove Elian, the county police department said
it is ready to respond to protests.
</P>
<P>
   Public sentiment across the country is leaning toward sending
Elian back to his father, according to a poll by ABC News and The
Washington Post. The poll found that 59 percent of Americans said
the boy should be returned while 33 percent said he should stay.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 930 adults was taken Thursday through Saturday. It
has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters are pushing to reunite father and son --
but in the United States, not Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will have a better future here,'' said Henry Someillan,
40, who was born in Cuba but has lived in Miami since he was 6
months old.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM Paying Back Taxes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A former Irish prime minister has agreed
to pay about $1.23 million in back taxes on gifts given to him
while in office, the Irish Revenue Commissioners said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with Charles J. Haughey includes an interest
payment set at almost the same amount as gifts made in the late
1980s and early 1990s by Irish supermarket executive Ben Dunne.
Haughey acknowledged taking the money, but has said there was never
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a very difficult and complex case,'' said
revenue board Chairman Dermot Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, 74, who was Ireland's dominant politician in the 1980s,
did not comment on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been charged with obstructing the work of a tribunal
of inquiry into payments made to politicians. If convicted, he
could face a $12,100 fine and two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, who led three different administrations from 1979 to
1992, enjoyed a highly publicized, lavish lifestyle while in
office.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall in T-bill Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $8.6 billion in three-month bills
at a discount rate of 5.710 percent, down from 5.720 percent last
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a
rate of 5.900 percent, down from 5.905 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the lowest since March 6 when the bills
sold for 5.690 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since
March 20 when the rate was 5.895.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.873 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,855.70 and 6.166 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,701.70.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.30
percent last week from 6.24 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down On Crop News; Crude Down  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wheat futures tumbled Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as
investors backed off on earlier speculation that either drought or
a late freeze will harm the winter crop.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, cocoa and crude oil retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The winter wheat crop, which accounts for the bulk of U.S. wheat
production, broke dormancy March 1 amid major concerns that dry
soil conditions dating back to last summer would harm the crop. But
a month of on-and-off showers have steadily lessened those concerns
and kept prices from exploding.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying Friday on forecasts for cold weather in the Great
Plains this week, creating worries about freeze damage, wheat
continued its rise upward briefly on Monday. But when the momentum
slowed, commodity funds went the other way and sold off wheat
contracts in a frenzy, sending the price down 2 percent for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Commercial grain entities feel that conditions have improved
enough and there's just enough rain in the forecast,'' said Tim
Hannagan, chief grains analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
''Until a return to bone-dry conditions, nobody wants to be a buyer
in the wheat market.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 4{ cents to $2.57} a bushel; May
corn fell 1} cent to $2.34\ a bushel; July oats rose 2 cents to
$1.21 a bushel; May soybeans rose 1 cent to $5.46{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa took a beating on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa
Exchange, falling 2 percent to a one-month low as a threat by Ivory
Coast growers to withhold cocoa faded.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the West African nation, the world's No. 1 producer
of cocoa, said last month they would strike or hold back cocoa if
the government didn't accept and implement their sales plan. But
after a meeting of the nation's export authority ended
inconclusively, buying enthusiasm dissipated in the New York
trading pits with the situation in Ivory Coast unclear.
</P>
<P>
   May cocoa fell $16 to $784 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil slipped along with energy products in a market that
has been drifting since adjusting to OPEC's much-awaited decision a
week ago to raise production. Market-watchers said the decline was
prompted largely by news reports out of Venezuela pointing to a
possible further increase by the cartel later this year.
</P>
<P>
   May crude fell 47 cents to $26.43 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Among other energy commodities, May heating oil fell 1.39 cent
to 67.26 cents a gallon, May unleaded regular gasoline fell 1.43
cent to 84.16 cents a gallon and May natural gas fell .56 cent to
$2.889 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, May Brent crude from the North Sea fell 26 cents to
$24.51 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Small Investor's Portfolio Falls  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hard for investors to find a safe haven during the first
quarter, even if they diversified their holdings to protect against
the stock market's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   A sample small investors portfolio tracked by The Associated
Press had a mixture of widely held stocks and mutual funds, but big
declines in Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart as well as the risky Internet
stock eToys meant the portfolio suffered a 6.9 percent loss during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks were pummeled the first three months of the
year amid concerns that rising interest rates would do the greatest
damage to profits of big manufacturers like Coke, whose stock fell
19.4 percent, and retailers like Wal-Mart, whose stock dropped 18.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wal-Mart and Coke are components of the Dow Jones
industrials, which ended the quarter down 5 percent after having
been off nearly 15 percent on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But another Dow component, IBM was one of the portfolio's few
real winners, rising 9.4 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth stock in the portfolio, eToys, provided ample proof
that Internet stocks are very risky. EToys, which looked like a
good bet when it was added to the portfolio at the end of the third
quarter, lost nearly two-thirds of its value during the first three
months of this year. The stock is now down nearly 87 percent since
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Because this portfolio is relatively conservative -- apart from
the gamble on eToys -- it missed out on the Nasdaq's big gains
during the quarter. Although high-tech stocks and Internet issues
gave back some of their gains at the end of March, the Nasdaq was
still up more than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio, which also includes four mutual funds, was valued
at $25,299.85 at its inception in Oct. 23, 1997. It was worth
$38,601.19 as of March 31, for a gain of 52.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the Dow has risen 39.2 percent, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index has gained 57.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite
index, powered by high-tech and Internet stocks, has soared more
than 173 percent. So the portfolio is running slightly behind the
broad market during the past 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds helped cushion the portfolio in the first quarter,
as the Vanguard Index Trust 500 Portfolio fund, which reflects the
performance of the S&AMP;P 500, matched the index's 2 percent gain. The
T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury Long-Term Fund picked up 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Pacific Growth Fund, which had
big gains the previous two quarters, leveled off as Japan's economy
slipped back into recession at the end of 1999. The Morgan Stanley
fund rose about 1 percent for the quarter, offsetting a less than 1
percent drop in the Legg Mason Value Trust.

<HEADLINE> Boy Shot Near Honduras Recuperates  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Pirates suspected of being drug traffickers
boarded a Dutch family's sailboat off the coast of Honduras and
opened fire, paralyzing a 13-year-old boy from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio operators who heard his father's call for help on a
shortwave radio helped bring Willem van Tuijl to a Dallas hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Willem was in fair condition Monday at Children's Medical Center
with kidney and spinal cord damage. He was flown to the hospital
early Saturday from Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told his mother he was pleased she wasn't harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so happy that they shot me, Mom,'' his father, Jacco van
Tuijl, quoted his son as saying. ''If they had killed you, I would
have died from sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Willem said Monday he feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't that bad. I was worried about my parents because
they were sad. I wasn't scared at all,'' he said. ''It went really
swiftly. It was like my legs weren't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was shot with an AK-47 rifle about 120 miles from
Honduras in the Caribbean Sea on Tuesday when four men suspected of
being drug traffickers on a small motorized wooden boat boarded the
family's 40-foot sailboat and one began firing randomly, the elder
van Tuijl said.
</P>
<P>
   The pirates then left, not taking anything. The father said he
believes they didn't steal the sailboat because they didn't know
how to navigate it.
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers often use the waters near the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border to transport cocaine from Colombia to
the United States, according to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents radioed for emergency help and eventually
located Dr. Jim Hirschman, a Miami physician and ham radio
operator, who guided them in treating the boy until help could
arrive. Hirschman was on the radio from 7 p.m. Tuesday to 3 a.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It grieved me that we had so many hours to go and no way to
relieve the boy's suffering,'' Hirschman said.
</P>
<P>
   It took 20 hours for the family to reach medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The teen and his parents first went to a Honduran hospital,
which did not have adequate medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jannie van Tuijl, the mother, said the experience was like a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sometimes think we will wake up and get back on the boat and
go snorkeling,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Aurora Names CEO, Restates Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Aurora Foods Inc., owner of such well-known
brands as Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima, named a new chief executive
Monday and restated its earnings for 1998 and 1999 based on an
investigation into its accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora said James T. Smith, a former executive at food company
ConAgra, would be its CEO and president. It also named Christopher
T. Sortwell, a former executive with the brewer The Stroh Cos., as
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   In February, four executives including the CEO and CFO at Aurora
resigned as the company said it would launch an investigation into
its internal accounting practices, chiefly over how it accounted
for payments for retail promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Monday it has reduced its earnings by $43.3
million for the first three quarters of 1999 and reduced by $38.3
million its 1998 third and fourth quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That left it with a net loss for 1999 of $4.4 million, or seven
cents a share, compared to losses of $69.1 million, or $1.29 a
share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange, Aurora
Foods shares rose 37{ cents, or 12.5 percent, to $3.37{.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and chief executive Ian R. Wilson, vice chairman James
B. Ardrey, executive vice president Ray Chung and chief financial
officer M. Laurie Cummings all resigned in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Aurora has grown by acquiring well-known,
but weak brands and revitalizing them with marketing support,
expanded distribution, and new product development. It recently
moved its headquarters to St. Louis from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In restating its earnings, Aurora also said net sales rose to a
revised $995.4 million in 1999, up from restated sales of $784.6
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The restatement closes a disappointing chapter for the
company,'' said Richard C. Dresdale, Aurora's acting chairman. ''We
have expended considerable effort and resources to ensure that the
company's financial reporting process and business practices adhere
to the highest standards going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting practices under investigation related primarily
to trade promotion expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's brands include Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, Log
Cabin syrup, Chef's Choice frozen meals, Celeste frozen pizza and
Van de Kamp's frozen seafood. In September 1999, Aurora acquired
Lender's Bagels from Kellogg's.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Prosecutor Slain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A gunman on a motorcycle shot and killed
a federal prosecutor as she stepped outside her home in Medellin on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle driven by an accomplice sped away and there were
no arrests made, said police, who didn't specify a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   The slain attorney, 32-year-old Margarita Pulgarin, belonged to
a corps of special prosecutors working on sensitive drug
trafficking and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors had worked anonymously for their protection
until their identities and those of many judges were made public
following complaints that defendants were denied due process by the
so-called ''faceless'' justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Pulgarin was the second prosecutor from Antioquia State
assassinated since the reform, said a statement Monday by her
fellow state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Seven others have fled the country amid threats, said the
colleagues. They threatened to massively resign or flee the country
if the government did not provide greater security.

<HEADLINE> Israel Preparing for Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preparations for an Israeli withdrawal of
troops from southern Lebanon are beginning, as leaders discuss the
use of an international peacekeeping force for a peaceful pullout,
U.S. officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has conferred with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan and Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy will meet with Annan in Geneva on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel would prefer a pullout be part of
an overall agreement with Syria and Lebanon. But U.S. efforts to
revive Israeli negotiations with Syria have not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball of this negotiation is squarely in Syria's court to
respond to the serious proposals the Israelis put forward,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has not revised its stand on major issues since President
Hafez Assad met with President Clinton in Geneva, Switzerland,
March 26, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   At that summit, Assad demanded recovery of all territory Syria
lost to Israel in its defeat in the 1967 Mideast war. Clinton said
last Tuesday Israel had made a ''very significant'' offer but that
Assad had not given him a basis for reopening the negotiations that
broke down in mid-January in Shepherdstown, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said he
intends to go ahead with a withdrawal of troops from a buffer zone
in southern Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
   And, Rubin said, Albright had spoke by telephone to Annan about
the situation, while Israeli sources said Levy would meet with the
U.N. chief in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is hoping for an orderly withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, where Hezbollah guerrillas have attacked Israeli troops.
The troops and Lebanese allies in the enclave have shielded towns
in northern Israel from cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary diplomacy centers on how to secure the border so
it is not used for attacks on departing Israeli soldiers and
Israeli towns. This could involve deploying an international
peacekeeping force at the border.
</P>
<P>
   On a related front, Rubin said Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators would resume talks at Bolling Air Force Base here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under discussion are the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian
demands for a state including part of the city as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is offering territory to both
Syria and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria's case, it is surrender by Israel of most of the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in 1967. In the Palestinians' case,
it involves turning over chunks of the West Bank, including land
near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is due here in late April
for a meeting with President Clinton. Clinton publicly has endorsed
Palestinian ''aspirations'' and sidetracked the pledge he made
while campaigning for the White House in 1992 to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the Clinton-Arafat meeting would focus on how to
speed up negotiations for an agreement between the Palestinians and
Israel by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rubin said the talks at Bolling would be ''intensive,
substantive'' and that ''it's a little early to speculate on
exactly what will be happening.''

<HEADLINE> Court Tosses Out Yale Intern Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has thrown out
$12.2 million in damages awarded to a former Yale intern who was
infected with the AIDS virus during medical training.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Friday ordered a new trial and said the judge who
presided over the original trial had improperly blocked Yale
University's effort to present evidence it is immune from such
suits under worker compensation laws.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also ruled that the verdict against Yale was
flawed because the judge neglected to instruct the jury that it had
to make a decision based on expert testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who sued under the pseudonym Jane Doe, had accused
the school of negligence. She said the school did not properly
train or supervise her when she was ordered to insert a blood line
into the arm of an AIDS patient.
</P>
<P>
   Doe was 25 when she pricked herself in August 1988, just seven
weeks into her internship at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Six weeks
later, she tested positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   When an employee is injured on the job, by law they
automatically receive worker's compensation but cannot sue their
employer. Doe was an employee of the hospital at the time, and
received worker's comp.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's attorney had argued before the high court that the
university had a joint venture agreement with the hospital, making
it Doe's employer.
</P>
<P>
   Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the university was pleased with
the decision and was looking ahead to a retrial. He said the
university still plans to claim it is immune from the suit under
worker's compensation law.
</P>
<P>
   Doe, who was never identified publicly, is now practicing at an
undisclosed location. She has not developed full-blown AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Explore 'New Economy'  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With an assist from Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, President Clinton will convene a daylong White
House conference on Wednesday on the ''New Economy,'' exploring
such issues as how to narrow the gap between the haves and have
nots.
</P>
<P>
   The conference will feature economists and other experts, chief
executives from major corporations and union officials to discuss
what Clinton earlier this year called the ''big cutting-edge
economic issues still before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan will address an afternoon session on the topic,
''Technology and its Impact on the Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the head of the president's National Economic
Council, said that the administration had made a major effort to
make sure that the conference included participants with a wide
range of views to generate a lively discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to raise the toughest issues even if that means
allowing people to offer differing views to challenge our
assumptions,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The first panel will explore the question, ''Is the 'New
Economy' rewriting the rules on productivity and the business
cycle?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Baily, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said that the administration felt it important to hear
experts' views on the on-going debate over just how much of the
current upturn in productivity will last.
</P>
<P>
   The second panel is entitled, ''Closing the global divide,
strategies on health, education and the environment'' and the final
panel of the day will look at the question, ''Can 'New Economy'
tools empower civil society and government.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues scheduled to be addressed at the White House
conference were raised by protesters last December in Seattle, who
disrupted meetings of the World Trade Organization to highlight
their complaints that the poor in many nations were being left
behind in the current global economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   The White House conference will occur a week before many of the
Seattle protest groups are scheduled to stage demonstrations in
conjunction with the spring meetings in Washington of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis and
one of those invited to participate in the White House conference,
said while the administration may have had the demonstrators in
mind when it scheduled its conference, the issues being raised were
important ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is not only creating wealth, it is also creating
economic cleavages,'' Sohn said. ''It is not just a question of the
rich getting richer. In some cases, the poor are becoming worse
off. They are getting pushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the White House economic conference, in Clinton's
last year as president, will be similar to a conference he held in
December, 1992, before his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   He invited top economists and corporate executives to Little
Rock, Ark., for two days of discussions on what could be done to
address ways to strengthen the weak recovery from the 1990-91
recession.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Leader: 2nd Hike May Be Needed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC's new president said Monday that
cartel members will probably need to increase their oil output one
more time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez said last week's agreement
in Vienna, Austria, for an output hike of about 1.7 million barrels
a day would likely be insufficient. The purpose of that hike was to
bring down international oil prices that had reached 9-year highs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prices went down, but less than expected,'' Rodriguez said.
''That's why I think it will be necessary to have an additional
increase in oil production this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez reiterated the new price-band system that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will use for guiding
prices by regulating supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If prices are below $22, we'll cut production by 500,000
barrels a day and when prices are above $28 a barrel, we'll
increase production,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, nine OPEC members agreed to boost output quotas by
1.452 million barrels a day starting April 1, restoring the cuts
made a year ago in an effort to boost prices and stabilize the
market.
</P>
<P>
   After initially balking at the agreement, Iran later said it
would defend its market share and increase output by 264,000
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of regular trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange Monday -- where prices are often about $1 per barrel higher
than the OPEC crude basket -- May crude was down 47 cents to $26.43.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Looks To Raise $1B  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Zoo has raised most of an
estimated $8 million likely to be needed to include a pair of
pandas in its collection, Smithsonian Institution chief Lawrence M.
Small said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   China in the future likely will rent pandas to foreign
countries, he said, not loan them or give them away like
Hsing-Hsing, a gift to America after President Nixon's visit to
China in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Small said he was nearly finished raising the estimated $8
million needed to rent a new pair of pandas from China for 10
years. Any offspring, he said, could be kept though they would
still belong to the Chinese government. But he said he believed it
would take protracted negotiations to work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a team over there now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Panda lovers concerned about the remains of the zoo's last giant
panda, Hsing-Hsing, who died in November, can also relax. His
remains will not be stuffed for display
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many people who care,'' Small said in an
interview with reporters and editors of The Associated Press.
''They felt the panda was part of their lives. To say you were
going to display it was just not a smart thing to do.'' The panda's
body was donated to science, Small said.
</P>
<P>
   Small's ambitious plans for the Smithsonian include trying to
raise $1 billion in donations to complete its new Air and Space
Museum at Dulles International Airport and the Museum of the
American Indian and to refurbish the old Patent office that houses
the Museum of American Art and the National Portrait Gallery. These
days it's not so much a matter of collecting small contributions,
but of waiting for the big donations that have become more common --
tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars at a time, said
Small. Redoing a museum costs $1,000 a square foot, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Small bemoaned the condition of several Smithsonian facilities,
noting the Arts and Industries Museum has plastic suspended from
its ceilings to catch paint falling from the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you go to a pilgrimage destination you go to be
inspired.... Walk into some of these buildings and you'll be
disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was especially enthusiastic about prospects for the
addition to the Air and Space Museum -- the world's most visited --
due to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have what I think will probably be the most spectacular
museum interior in the history of the world...,'' he said. ''We
have a 176{ acre site.... This is going to be two and half football
fields long, and 10 stories high. It's going to have 178 airplanes
inside the one room.''
</P>
<P>
   Small also sees great significance in the American Indian
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a museum that's been developed with the total support of
hundreds of American Indian tribes and it will give the nation ...
a place of reconcilement for an issue that's been a troubling one
in American history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over the Smithsonian's 16 museums and zoo in
January, Small has been working to spread more of the 141 million
objects it owns to affiliates nationwide. The Smithsonian ''is the
repository of the objects of America's 500-year history that
Americans want to see and touch personally,'' Small said, adding
that only about 2 percent of the objects are now on display, most
of them in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many objects have never been seen by the public. For example, he
said, there are 25 suits of Samurai armor than American ships
brought back when they opened Japan to trade before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the things can't be seen by the American public, what good
are they?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated there are 8,500 to 10,000 museums of all kinds in
the United States, and only 29 affiliated with the Smithsonian. The
affiliates can enrich their own collections with supplements from
Washington, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you went to Bisbee, Arizona, for instance, they have a
museum of mining.'' he said. ''They had everything but the kind of
ore that came out of the mines.... Their mines were totally played
out, so they had mining equipment. We sent them the ore.''
</P>
<P>
   Museums nationwide are eager to display authentic materials
owned by the Smithsonian, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just invent something of George Washington's or
Thomas Jefferson's,'' he said. ''You either have it or you don't.''

<HEADLINE> Soldiers' Training Found Deficient  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon needs to do better job of
training soldiers who may be exposed to depleted uranium, a toxin
blamed by some for Gulf War ailments, congressional investigators
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the state of the training program, the General
Accounting Office said it was unable to determine whether Marine
and Army troops were instructed on how to deal with the contaminant
before the deployment to Kosovo, where there is a possibility of
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Rostker, undersecretary of defense for personnel,
acknowledged in a letter to the GAO, Congress' investigative arm,
that training ''continues to fall short of the department's
requirements and expectations'' and said he was pointing out the
problems to the heads of the services.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans, ranking Democratic member of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, chided the Defense Department, saying the report
showed the Pentagon had ''failed our soldiers'' on the health
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report released Monday was to assess what is known about
the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium, whether
veterans were having problems with a Pentagon medical screening
program related to it and how training was progressing.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War marked the first battlefield use of
armor-piercing munitions using depleted uranium-coated shells and
bombs. On impact, the shells create airborne dust.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 30,000 veterans of the war have complained of mysterious
maladies such as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss they contend
are related to service in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said in its report that the ''scientific understanding
of depleted uranium's effects on health is still evolving.'' It
noted two reviews concluded it is unlikely that inhaling or
ingesting it causes radiation or cancer. It also noted that several
more studies are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a clear understanding of the possible health
effects ... and must do more research to get there,'' Rep. Bob
Filner, a California Democrat also on the Veterans Committee, said
in a joint statement with Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the GAO had brought training problems to the
Army's attention as far back as 1993 and recommended at that time
that the services give training on depleted uranium to all military
member who may be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that exposure to the low-level radioactive metal
should be kept ''as low as reasonably possible,'' the report said
the services ''need to do more to ensure that service members
receive safety training on how to properly operate in a depleted
uranium-contaminated battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   It said its review in recent months of training at 17 Army units
showed that training was not given to all troops for various
reasons, such as unavailability of materials or absence from their
units of service members during training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Furthermore, because neither the Army nor Marine Corps monitor
depleted uranium training for deployments,'' the report said,
''they were unable to tell us whether troops who recently deployed
to Kosovo, where depleted uranium munitions were used, had received
... training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force requires the training for everyone subject to
deployment, it said, and the Navy targets for its program personnel
most likely to encounter the contaminant.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Fall Is Tops; Dow Up 300.01  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index
Monday, falling sharply as Wall Street anticipated a federal
judge's antitrust ruling against the software company. The plunge
in Microsoft set off another stampede away from technology stocks
and sent investors searching for blue-chip issues.
</P>
<P>
   The swing toward financial, retail and drug stocks helped the
Dow Jones industrials soar 300 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq plunged 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close at 4,223.68.
It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history, surpassing
a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell 15] to 90~ as the company appeared poised for
harsh penalties. After the close of trading, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson delivered his verdict that Microsoft
violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft is also a component of the Dow, and its steep
plunge was the equivalent of nearly 80 Dow points, Wall Street's
best-known indicator gained as investors sought the stability that
typically comes with blue-chip stocks. The Dow ended the session up
300.01 at 11,221.93.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has traded places with General Electric and
Cisco Systems as the world's largest company according to stock
market value, affected the Nasdaq more dramatically than it did the
Dow because the Nasdaq is a weighted index, giving more
significance to larger companies. The Dow gives equal weight to
each of its 30 components.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decline, Microsoft shed more than $80 billion in
stock market value, an apparently unprecedented decline that sent
the software maker tumbling to No. 3 behind GE and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's woes exacerbated growing nervousness over the entire
technology sector, analysts said. Since closing at a record high
5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has fallen 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft kick-started the selling, but the weakness is pretty
intense across the board,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of
listed trading at SG Cowen in New York. ''A lot of these stocks
went straight up for months, and now they're going straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech decliners included Legato Systems, a maker of
storage software, which lost more than half its value. Shares fell
24} to 19~. The company told the Securities and Exchange Commission
late Friday it would delay the filing of its annual financial
statement, raising concerns that the company would restate earnings
and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology, a maker of computer-aided design
software, plunged 10 5/16 to 10} after announcing that its earnings
for the current quarter will dramatically miss estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In an already nervous market, those disappointments brought
stiff punishment to the entire sector, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
described the Nasdaq's ongoing decline as a ''new economy
correction,'' in which investors are driving down stocks that may
have run too far in favor of long-neglected industrial shares.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some sense coming back into the market,'' Yardeni
said. ''Down the line, there will be a greater appreciation for
stable and predictable earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers generally define a correction as a drop of 10
percent from a peak. It signifies a reversal of an upward trend,
but doesn't necessarily mean a long-term change is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow drew most buyers.
American Express rose 6 9/16 to 155{ and J.P. Morgan shot up 10 to
141}.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot rose 3 to 67{ and Merck gained 4| to 66}.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flip side to the Nasdaq's problems is that there's some
pretty strong buying in quality names,'' Sheinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft occupying center stage on Wall Street and in
Washington, investors paid little attention to the latest report
from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The group
reported growth in the manufacturing economy continued in March,
but at slower rate than in February.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indicators were mixed, with none matching the
drama of the Nasdaq and the Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose
7.39 to 1,505.97 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies
fell 23.03 to 516.04.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, while decliners led by a 3-to-1 margin
on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE consolidated volume totaled 1.25 billion shares, compared
with 1.46 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which had been up 24 percent for the year as of
March 10, now has a year-to-date gain of just 3.8 percent. It is
still running ahead of the Dow, which is down 2.4 percent for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas indexes were mixed. Japan's Nikkei stock average rose
2.0 percent to a new 3-year high, despite the hospitalization of
the prime minister and the appointment of an acting premier.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 2.2 percent, France's CAC-40 fell
2.5 percent and Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Gold Medal for Reagans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Monday to award the
Congressional Gold Medal to former President Reagan and first lady
Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution praised Reagan, president from 1981-1989, for his
leadership in restoring optimism to the nation and bringing an end
to the Cold War. Mrs. Reagan was recognized for her efforts to curb
alcohol and drug abuse among the nation's youth. The bill still
needs Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   ''If today's historians looking back at the end of the 20th
century get it right, they will surely say that Ronald Reagan more
than any other person helped to restore the American dream,'' said
Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Gibbons, R-Nevada, a chief sponsor, said the medal
was ''the most distinguished form of recognition that Congress can
bestow.'' He said it was a ''fitting tribute to the dedication and
service Ronald and Nancy Reagan have given our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The one Democrat who spoke, John LaFalce of New York, remembered
Reagan, now 89 and suffering from Alzheimer's disease, ''for being
such a person of good will toward all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hoped the next Congress would also consider
''honoring the work of our present president and first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was not unanimous, however: seven Democrats and GOP
Rep. Ron Paul of Texas voted against awarding the medal and Rep.
Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., voted present.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 3591.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Arrested for War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By JEROMAE SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- French NATO troops arrested the
most senior Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect to date Monday,
sweeping into the Serb stronghold of Pale in a pre-dawn raid that
galvanized the crusade to bring the architects of the Balkans'
''ethnic cleansing'' campaigns to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilo Krajisnik, a close ally of former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic, was arrested at his home by troops who witnesses
said forced open his door. Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news
agency said Krajisnik was led away in his pajamas and bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik is charged with every war crime on the Yugoslav
tribunal's statute, including genocide, in an indictment filed
secretly by Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte in February so as not
to let the suspect know prosecutors were on his trail.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, unsealed Monday, charges Krajisnik with being
the principal strategist, along with Karadzic, behind civilian
massacres aimed at carving an ethnically pure Serb state out of
Bosnian territory.
</P>
<P>
   It catalogs dozens of destroyed villages and the massacres of
hundreds of people, as well as naming 11 prison camps where
non-Serbs were detained and tortured, executed or deported.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction would mean a maximum life sentence for Krajisnik, 55.
He is expected to appear before the court this week to enter a
plea.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik is the 19th suspect arrested by the military alliance
on a warrant from the tribunal, established seven years ago to
prosecute those responsible for atrocities in the Balkans following
the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson warned remaining war
crimes suspects that ''the net is closing'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was an indication of how far the tribunal -- the first
international war crimes court since after World War II -- has come
since its early years, when its indictments were largely ignored
and support from the Security Council was halfhearted at best.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good day for the tribunal,'' said prosecution
spokesman Paul Risley.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik outranks the 36 other suspects in tribunal custody,
including three Bosnian Serb generals arrested since 1998 for some
of the worst atrocities in the war.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Gen. Radislav Krstic, entered the third week of his
genocide trial for the massacre of thousands of men in the Muslim
enclave of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate proceeding, a Muslim rape victim sat Monday with
her back to the accused as their lawyers cross-examined her
following her harrowing testimony last week of being raped and
tortured nightly as a teen-ager in a Bosnian Serb detention camp.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik was one of the most wanted figures in the 1992-1995
Bosnian war. He is considered secondary only to Karadzic and
wartime Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic, who are also
under indictment and believed to be at large on Serb soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hooray!'' cheered Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations who was the key negotiator of the 1995 Dayton
peace agreement. He said Krajisnik was ''one of the top two leaders
(with Karadzic) of the separatist, racist, murderous people who
started this war in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It isolates Karadzic still further. He can either continue to
run or he can start to negotiate a peaceful move to The Hague,'' he
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Risley described Krajisnik as one of ''the individuals who ran
illegal operations that resulted in the deaths of thousands of
Bosnians.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was present at every meeting where political and military
actions were decided upon that resulted in deportations, illegal
arrests, ethnic cleansing and the deaths of thousands of
Bosnians,'' Risley said.
</P>
<P>
   Amor Masovic, head of the Muslim commission for missing persons,
called Krajisnik ''one of the masterminds of the genocide and
ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   An industrialist by profession, Krajisnik co-founded the Serb
nationalist party with Karadzic and became speaker of the Bosnian
parliament in 1990, before Serbs walked out and the war began.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the signatories of the Dayton peace accords and
served as the Serb representative on the three-member Bosnian
postwar presidency, along with a Croat and a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serb moderates expressed fears that Krajisnik's arrest,
coming ahead of next weekend's Bosnian municipal elections, will
play into the hands of extreme nationalists who oppose
reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Senate committee questions costs of regulations as gas prices rise  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- In an effort to lower the price of
gasoline, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee said Monday
he will introduce a bill to allow New Jersey drivers to pump their
own gas.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gerald Cardinale, R-Bergen, said after a committee hearing
that he'd like to see the state's ban on self-serve gasoline
repealed. New Jersey and Oregon are the only states that require
that gasoline be pumped by a gas station attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline industry representativese told members of the commerce
committee that rising crude oil prices are affecting the price at
the pump, but that state and federal regulations, including New
Jersey's mandate that only service station employees pump gas, also
drive up the price.
</P>
<P>
   Full-serve adds as much as 5 cents a gallon, according to the
New Jersey Petroleum Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is an absurdity, an absolute absurdity,'' said Cardinale.
</P>
<P>
   The committee had asked gas and oil suppliers to testify about
why the price of home heating oil nearly doubled in recent months
and why a gallon of gasoline hovers close to $2.
</P>
<P>
   Senators got answers: everything from the number of days that
refineries were shut down for repairs to the precarious details of
the energy futures markets.
</P>
<P>
   But when oil industry spokesmen turned the talk to the cost of
regulations, they got attention from the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government mandate for full service costs New Jersey
residents several hundred million dollars alone,'' said Jim Benton,
executive director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council.
</P>
<P>
   That translates to anywhere from 3 cents to 5 cents per gallon,
Benton said, citing a 1988 Federal Trade Commission report and a
1998 Rutgers University study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The option of self serve is one of the options this committee
could make,'' Benton said, saying it and tax relief are likely the
only tools available to a state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinale said he wants to see cost impact studies, for not only
the full-serve rule, but other regulations imposed by the state.
Consumers have a right to know how much ''perfection'' costs them
when it comes to environmental safeguards, Cardinale said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to go back to the day when we had smokestacks
spewing out all sorts of noxious stuff,'' Cardinale said. But there
is a rising cost to go from ''90 percent clean to 91 percent,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that information, the Legislature could ''ease some
of the regulations that are not cost-effective,'' Cardinale said,
and that savings could be ''used to aid consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone on the committee was warm to the idea of
repealing state environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The committee hearing was supposed to be on what caused this
fuel ''crisis'' and how it can be prevented, Sen. Gary Furnari,
D-Essex, said.
</P>
<P>
   The self-serve ban ''has nothing whatsoever to do with why we're
here today,'' Furnari said.

<HEADLINE> Questions Around Ugandan Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUGAZI, Uganda (AP) -- Sound carries easily from the village to
the top of the hill, to the place where an excommunicated priest
exhorted his followers to await the apocalypse, and where later two
hidden graves disgorged over 150 rotting corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The hilltop compound can be seen from homes, from schools, from
the village clinic. A week after the bodies of the cult's devotees
were discovered, the choking stench of decaying flesh still fills
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Today, everyone in Rugazi knows what happened where the people
they called ''the visionaries'' gathered.
</P>
<P>
   But after hundreds of bodies were found here and at similar
spots across the lush hills of southwestern Uganda, the question
remains: How could so many people not see what was happening in
their midst?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question they ask with special urgency in Rugazi.
</P>
<P>
   ''How this could happen without anyone else's knowledge?''
demanded Deos Bagomba, head catechism teacher at the Roman Catholic
church just in front of the compound built by excommunicated parish
priest Dominic Kataribabo. ''I'm still asking people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple explanation, but instead a combination of
reasons: Cult members and villagers lived side-by-side but were
still divided; hundreds of cult followers came and went at odd
hours; cult leaders knew how to stop officials from probing too
closely.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a silent fear: Maybe, just maybe, the cult leaders
had powers that would make it better to steer clear of them.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone here, however, insists they had no idea there were
corpses buried at Kataribabo's compound, where followers of the
Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God often
gathered for prayers -- and where 155 of their bodies were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't know anything about the killing,'' said Amos Agaba,
a 21-year-old mechanic who lives nearby, and who walked up one day
recently to look at the now-abandoned site. ''We heard no sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The same words are repeated in Buhonga and Rushojwa, two other
southwestern villages where mass graves were found. Including a
fire at another cult compound, in Kanungu -- a fire that police say
killed about 530 people and set off the investigation that led to
the discovery of the mass graves -- at least 924 people are believed
to have perished in all.
</P>
<P>
   Kataribabo is believed among the dead in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the two top leaders, are widely thought to
have fled.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, it was the cult's isolation that kept
villagers from discovering the killings.
</P>
<P>
   For years in Rugazi, cult members had lived and prayed at the
compound -- sometimes hundreds at a time -- but they had almost no
contact with local villagers. To the people of Rugazi, the cult
members were strangers who spoke only in the hand gestures demanded
by sect leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were two different worlds, completely detached,'' said
Stephen Biru, 28, an English teacher at St. Michael's High School.
</P>
<P>
   The cult's actions apparently were dictated by visions of a
coming apocalypse, where believers would be carried away on
homemade arks and everyone else would perish.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation, the leaders imposed more and more commandments
on their flock: no speaking, no sex, little food, minimal contact
with outsiders. They sold their possessions and cut contact with
relatives. They spent hour after hour in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   At least a couple of times, Ugandan authorities did look into
cult activities.
</P>
<P>
   In Rushojwa, site of another mass grave, officials contacted
police in connection with a series of sudden deaths among cult
children.
</P>
<P>
   Officials arrived, but left after the group showed they were a
registered non-governmental organization. The deaths, they were
told, were the result of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   In Rugazi, police appeared once during a meeting at Kataribabo's
compound. Again, cult leaders produced registration documents, paid
a tax to hold the meeting, and the authorities left.
</P>
<P>
   A final explanation for the villagers' ignorance lies deeper, in
traditional beliefs and an undercurrent of fear.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the vast majority of the people believe in
the supernatural, the strangeness of the sect and the leaders'
control over their followers were unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought if we'd try to stop them they'd curse us ... Maybe
they have spirits,'' said Tushabe Kizito, bursar at St. Michael's
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the claims of ignorance strain credulity.
</P>
<P>
   Arsen Oworyanawe, Kataribabo's brother, lives in a small house a
few feet away from the mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Reed mats placed around the graves shielded the carnage from
view, says Oworyanawe. Cult members told people the mats were
hiding pit toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Stooped by his 78 years and largely deaf, he loudly insists that
he had no idea of what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know,'' he all but shouts. ''I didn't know what was
happening here.''

<HEADLINE> State police chief promotes 300 troopers, some with disciplineissues  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EWING, N.J. (AP) -- State Police Superintendent Col. Carson
Dunbar said Monday he is promoting 300 troopers before the agency
overhauls the method used to upgrade officers, a system criticized
by the attorney general after allegations of racial profiling were
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the troopers promoted this week have been named in
internal affairs investigations, Dunbar said. But he said he and
Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. personally reviewed all of
those promotions.
</P>
<P>
   These promotions, Dunbar said, will double the number of women
and minorities who hold the rank of lieutenant, the highest office
now held by a nonwhite male, with the exception of Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   And by June, all of the captains supervising State Police road
patrols will be replaced, he said. The current captains will all
have either retired or left the job.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar said he ordered the promotions now because it could be at
least two years before any changes in the system take effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we're rebuilding, while we're improving, the problem is
we don't really have any time to stop. Our investigations keep
going on,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers were told of the promotions Monday. They take effect
Friday. Many have been serving in these positions without the
accompanying rank for years, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of State Police procedures last year, the attorney
general challenged the promotions practice, which relied primarily
on seniority. No tests were given, and in many cases, candidates
were not interviewed for the posts.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar now is considering instituting standardized tests for
applicants, according to a memo he shared with reporters Monday.
The superintendent also wants five people to be interviewed for
every captain's post. And supervisors must say in writing why they
choose candidates, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever I do, I have to make sure I do it fairly. I will not
promote people just to be promoted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar said approximately 325 troopers were scheduled to be
promoted. But roughly 60 were the subject of an internal
investigation, he said. All investigation files were reviewed,
Dunbar said, before he decided to promote about half of those
troopers who were investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent would not say what the accusations against
those officers were or if any of them were involved in racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are issues that touch on that,'' said Dunbar, who
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said this ''individualized'' evaluation, where records
for all of those officers were reviewed, was the only ''equitable''
way to make the promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people that did get promoted are worthy individuals,''
Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers who were not promoted are not necessarily guilty of any
charge, Dunbar said, adding that in some cases, investigations were
not completed.
</P>
<P>
   If troopers were promoted who are later found guilty of some
infractions, Dunbar said they will be removed from their new posts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to be able to stand behind my supervisors,'' he said.
''If I am wrong, and I am proven wrong, I will remove those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of minorities and women promoted in this round is
approximately the same as those in the state police ranks -- about
17 percent, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minorities and females that came in now reflects their
seniority levels where they are passing into these jobs,'' Dunbar
said. In the next round of promotions, that many more women and
minorities will be eligible for higher ranks, he said.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Hires 2 Lawyers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray announced
Monday he is hiring two federal prosecutors from Tampa, Fla., in
the investigation of President Clinton and the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Ray's office are Latour Lafferty, an assistant U.S.
attorney who has handled organized crime cases, and Monte
Richardson, who prosecuted complex fraud cases before becoming
executive assistant U.S. attorney for special projects
community-related programs in the federal prosecutor's office in
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has said he is adding staffers to help him determine whether
to file criminal charges against Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal. Clinton was found in civil contempt by a federal judge for
denying a sexual relationship with the former White House intern
and for testifying that he couldn't recall being alone with her.
Ray's office also is compiling final reports on the six-year
criminal investigation of the president and first lady.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pushes Barak To Nix Arms Deal  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak resisted
pressure from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen on Monday to
cancel a deal that would supply China with a sophisticated airborne
surveillance system.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barak implied that Israel would be more sensitive to
U.S. concerns about supplying China with arms in light of recent
escalating tensions between China and U.S.-backed Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who also serves as defense minister, said Israel was
aware of the need to coordinate such arms deals with the United
States but that it had already signed a contract with China for one
such plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of the need to coordinate ... with the United
States on every issue that might risk American interests,'' Barak
said during a joint news conference with Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has on several occasions expressed its
displeasure over Israel's $250 million plan, announced in November,
to sell China the AWACS system, which allows aircraft to conduct
long-range radar surveillance and coordinate forces during battle.
A plane outfitted with the system is to be delivered to China soon,
and the sale of two more planes is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he expressed his opposition to the sale in a meeting
with Barak on Monday morning. ''The United States does not support
the sale of this kind of technology to ... China because of the
potential of changing the strategic balance in that region,'' he
said. ''With tensions running as high as they are in China and
Taiwan, we see this as being counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have expressed that to the prime minister,'' Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli media reports said the United States has linked some of
its annual $3 billion in foreign aid to Israel to cancellation of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said that as far as he knew there were no contingencies to cut
Israel's foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the other hand, it's fair to say that if Israel were not to
respond to our concerns ... it would have some effect; precisely
what, I'm not prepared to speculate,'' Rubin told reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left open the possibility, however, of taking U.S.
interests into consideration in future deals, like the proposal to
provide two additional planes to China.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cohen said proposals for a U.S.-Israeli defense pact
had been put on the back burner since an Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights as part of a peace deal with Syria did not appear
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any discussion about this enhanced relationship was in fact in
the context of the requirements that might be necessary in order to
ensure Israel's security should there be a pact, an agreement with
Syria,'' Cohen said. One version of a defense pact would declare
that an attack against Israel be considered an attack against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said any upgrade of the relationship would have to be done
gradually, to avoid straining the United States' relationship with
moderate Arab governments.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen left Israel later Monday for a trip to Cairo, Jordan and
Persian Gulf states.

<HEADLINE> Boat Sinks, 6 Drown in Peru  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYACUCHO, Peru (AP) -- A 198-foot ferry sank in a turbulent
stretch of the Apurimac River in Peru's central Amazon jungle on
Monday, drowning at least six people and leaving another 20
missing, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat, powered by two outboard motors, was attempting to
cross the churning Apurimac -- a major tributary of the Amazon River
-- near the jungle community of Lobo, 229 miles southeast of the
capital, Lima, when it foundered with some 61 passengers aboard,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Six bodies were recovered and authorities were combing the
shores in search of 20 people who were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five passengers were able to swim to shore.
</P>
<P>
   The victims had been transporting loads of harvested peanuts to
market.
</P>
<P>
   The central jungle is near the end of its rainy season, which
runs from December to April and often creates perilous conditions
for river travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Apurimac River is a major tributary, and some argue the
start, of the Amazon River, which flows from the Peruvian Andes
across northern Brazil and into the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli backs up Corzine's apology; Corzine exposes threats  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli appeared with
Democratic candidate Jon Corzine at a news conference laden with TV
cameras Monday to vouch for his lack of prejudice against Americans
of Italian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who is running against former Gov. Jim Florio for the
nomination for U.S. Senate, apologized last week after jokes
linking Italians to the mob were attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has condemned Corzine for the jokes, saying he considered
them insulting to all Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine called the news conference to denounce what he called
outrageous attempts by an official in an Italian-American group,
Michael Cino, to get a staff job by allegedly threatening to make
public more ''dirt'' about him.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli joined Corzine in condemning dirty political tactics.
But Corzine did not say that Florio was behind Cino's alleged
threats, saying, ''I have no reason to suspect that whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same question, Torricelli said, ''I hope it really is one
man. That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   By his appearance at a Newark hotel Monday, and with his flowing
praise for Corzine's character and qualifications, Torricelli gave
Corzine his tacit endorsement in the race for the Democratic
nomination to be decided in the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli has been coy on endorsing Corzine, limiting his
comments to confirmation that he and Corzine have been friends for
years. Torricelli added to this Monday by saying he encouraged the
former Wall Street executive to run for office when U.S. Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I confess that when Frank Lautenberg announced his retirement,
I suggested to Jon that he consider (running), because I genuinely
believe that he would be an extraordinary United States senator,''
Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg has formally endorsed Corzine in the primary, but
Torricelli heads the Democratic party's national campaign for the
U.S. Senate and so he said he was not supposed to make
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have in every state in the nation had a studied
neutrality,'' said Torricelli. ''There is some need in New Jersey,
however, to be heard on special occasions. This is one of those
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said he would hold Torricelli to his promise that he
would make no endorsement in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is for everyone to make their own assessment. All I know is
someone shook my hand and said they were going to be neutral, and I
am relying on that,'' Florio said. ''If somebody tells you
something, they give you their word, you have to rely on it. He is
a United States senator, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Cino has made threats to his staff and his wife,
Joanne, that he would reveal more dirt if staff did not agree to
meet with him promptly. Cino did not return telephone message left
Monday with the organization, the Columbus Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alfano, head of the Italian-American One Voice Committee,
issued the news statement last week that triggered the controversy,
charging that Corzine had made ethnic jokes during meetings with
Italian Americans. Alfano said Monday he did not know who Cino was
and that Cino was not the source of information about Corzine's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano, in his news statement, said Corzine quipped to an
Italian-American contractor, ''Oh, you make cement shoes.'' Then,
on another occasion, Alfano reported that Corzine had suggested to
a group of Italian-Americans he was meeting that they needed a
Jewish lawyer to keep them out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Florio said Corzine's claims of being subject to dirty politics
by Cino ''does not detract from the event which precipitated this
whole experience in the past week, which is the willingness to make
derogatory comments about a whole classification of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said, ''They were unfortunate comments, an attempt at
humor from a good and decent man who doesn't have a mean bone in
his body, who has never evidenced prejudice against anybody. I
consider this matter over.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Corzine continues to insist that he does not
recall making the wisecracks, for which he promptly offered an
apology to anyone who might be offended anyway.

<HEADLINE> First Lady: Campaigning Is Tough  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that
Rudolph Giuliani is tapping into a network of right-wing, non-New
Yorkers to help pile up his fund-raising lead in their Senate
contest.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said the Republican New York City mayor is
utilizing a ''broad national network of people who are opposed to
what I would do in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is playing on their fears and sending out these direct-mail
requests and people that are seeing them are responding to it,''
said Clinton, who has raised $12 million to Giuliani's $19 million.
''I don't think it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's fund-raising letters are ''more in line with the
right wing of America than the main stream of New Yorkers,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum responded: ''Mrs.
Clinton is obviously disappointed in her campaign and its ability
to attract more support, so now she's reverting to that old Clinton
ruse of blaming the vast right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Clinton said life on the campaign trail has been
harder than she expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a great time, but I'm also seeing how hard it is''
to be a candidate, the first lady told an audience of about 100
people at a community forum in the village of Coxsackie just south
of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm almost embarrassed to think back -- all the times that I
would say to my husband, 'Well, you could have said this
differently, or you could have done that.' Now, I would like to
take all those words back because it's very tough for both men and
women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also repeated her support for gun licensing, a position
shared by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attacked the National Rifle Association for being stuck
on a ''theological view'' about gun control, but she also warned
against ''people on the other extreme who want to take everybody's
guns away.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone hunting,'' she said. ''I don't have anything against
guns if guns are used by responsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, who over the weekend
re-ignited talk of entering the race, said Monday that the contest
between Clinton and Giuliani is shaping up as a personality-driven
''food fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he offers voters a clear alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not trying to be difficult, I am not trying to be
defiant,'' he said. ''I am simply trying to be what I think is a
good public servant and good Republican in saying I think we have
had a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he has set no timetable for deciding whether to join
the race, but noted that James Buckley didn't enter the New York
Senate race in 1970 until June and still won.

<HEADLINE> Bush Gave $334,000 To Charity in '98  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and his wife donated $334,000
to charity in 1998, the same year he sold his interest in the Texas
Rangers baseball team. Al Gore and his wife gave away a little more
than $15,000 in 1998, but it was a larger share of their taxable
income.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' contributions amounted to almost 7 percent of their
1998 taxable income of about $224,000, while the Bushes' donations
represented just under 2 percent of their taxable income of $18.4
million. Bush got more than $14 million when he sold his interest
in the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor who has urged support for faith-based
organizations during his Republican presidential campaign, has
donated sums ranging from $31,290 in 1993 to $9,178 in 1995,
according to records of his charitable giving the campaign released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Bush contributions were to Methodist churches, as
well as the United Way, various foundations and medical causes, and
the George Bush Presidential Library in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bush gave $150,000 to Southern Methodist University,
the alma mater of his wife Laura, on her behalf. They also gave
$15,000 to a breast cancer foundation, $35,000 to a women's shelter
and $5,000 apiece to the Red Cross and Big Brothers-Big Sisters,
among their other gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has outlined a bold proposal to encourage an
outpouring of giving in America by reaching out to faith-based
groups, charities, community organizations that have a proven
record of helping those in need,'' said campaign spokesman Scott
McClellan. ''The governor and Mrs. Bush believe it is important to
give something back by volunteering their time and contributing
what they feel comfortable giving.''

   Gore and his wife Tipper previously reported giving away $15,197
in 1998. A spokeswoman for the vice president did not identify the
charities, but said the beneficiaries ranged from religious
institutions and educational organizations to groups that aid the
homeless and mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore has released their 1999 income tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was criticized in 1998 after it was disclosed that the
couple gave $353 to charity the year before after donating $35,530
in 1996. An aide said then that charitable giving ''is something
the Gores have done when the resources were there'' and that the
1996 donations were mostly proceeds from a photographic book by
Mrs. Gore while they had no similar source of income in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Gores gave away more than $50,000 of an income of
$623,000, mostly to the University of Tennessee, to endow a chair
in memory of Gore's late sister. They were aided that year by
royalties from Gore's book on the environment, ''Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore staffers defended the Gore's 1997 contributions of $353,
noting that they did not claim deductions on some church donations
and gifts of food and clothing from Mrs. Gore to the homeless.

<HEADLINE> Arguments Begin in Marine Case  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain charged in the
heatstroke death of a reservist refused to slow the pace of a night
training hike, then left before a head count was completed, a
prosecutor said Monday in opening statements at the officer's
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Marines on the hike testified they were marched so fast that
many became overheated and ill and straggled out of the sight of
Capt. Victor Arana, 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were going down all over the place,'' said Lance Cpl.
James Vasser. ''I saw Marines in the road vomiting, with cramps in
their legs. Myself, I was vomiting the majority of the hike.''
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Maj. Chris Hamilton, told the judge that Arana was
overheard on the hike saying, ''I don't care who dies,'' and that
Arana told his staff as he left after the hike, ''Mama ain't
waiting up all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Arana, from DuPage County, Ill., is charged with failure to obey
an order and dereliction of duty in the death last July 7 of Lance
Cpl. Giuseppe ''Joey'' Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn. If
convicted, Arana could be sentenced to nine months in prison and be
dismissed from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   A wrestler and lacrosse player, Leto had just completed his
second year at Western New England College when he came to Camp
Lejeune for infantry training. Arana led Leto and 179 other
Marines, all carrying weapons and packs, on an eight-mile night
march in 80-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Leto's body was found two hours after the hike ended near a back
road at Camp Geiger, a training facility that is part of Camp
Lejeune. Prosecutors contend Arana didn't follow established
procedures for training hikes, normally conducted at a slightly
slower pace and with more rest stops than hikes for seasoned
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evidence will show while Captain Arana was concerned about
getting home, his staff was worried about getting a good head
count,'' Hamilton said. ''Evidence will show he left the field just
as he conducted the hike -- in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Mark Stevens said in his opening statement that
Arana's superiors didn't give him specific guidance for conducting
the hike, Arana's first command assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence will show that he did slow down at the request of
his staff,'' Stevens said. ''This was the first and only time any
request was made of Captain Arana to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the hike ended, the group spent the night in the field, and
Arana stayed with them for at least an hour and left when told by a
sergeant the head count was complete, Stevens said. Arana returned
when notified there was a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arana gave his staff instructions on dealing with stragglers,
said Stevens, but ''his guidance was completely disregarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said a defense witness will testify that Leto ''was
holding a perfectly normal conversation'' with a sergeant and
showed no evidence of the heatstroke blamed for his death.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser testified that Leto's comrades knew he was missing after
the first head count, conducted after the hike ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were screaming his name, trying to get some sort of
response, for 20 or 30 minutes,'' Vasser said.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea Expected From Colonel  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Army colonel commanding the military's
anti-drug operation in Colombia knew his wife -- who has admitted
dealing drugs -- was involved in money laundering but failed to turn
her in, prosecutors revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a federal judge, prosecutors said James Hiett,
48, has agreed to plead guilty to ignoring a felony committed by
his wife, Laurie. The charge carries up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the colonel was at all connected to the
scandal, but prosecutors refused to detail the case against him.
His attorney, Abraham Clott, did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in
January, saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of
drugs to New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to
collect the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act
falling under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mrs. Hiett told reporters she purposely kept her
husband in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New
York,'' she said. ''I just told him, 'Don't ask me.'''
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in
Panama has cleared Hiett, saying he had no knowledge of his wife's
crimes. Prosecutors in Brooklyn, however, had insisted their
investigation was not over.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was also propelled by U.S. Customs officers,
said Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customs agents have suspected for some time that U.S. Army
Col. James Hiett had knowledge of his wife's activities and may
have even had some complicity,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Harvey Perritt said Hiett remains on active duty
at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Va., where he was transferred after the
allegations arose against his wife. He said military officials
would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett -- an admitted cocaine addict -- surrendered to
authorities last August after they intercepted two 1.2-kilogram
packages of heroin that she allegedly mailed to New York from the
U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   One of her co-defendants, Hernan Arcila, 54, has pleaded guilty
to drug conspiracy. Another co-defendant, Jorge Ayala, remains a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett, who is free on bond, faces up to nine years in
prison at sentencing April 28. Her husband is to enter his plea on
April 17.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father To Stay in Md.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barring a change in plans, the father of Elian
Gonzalez and his family will stay at the upscale home of Fernando
Remirez, chief of Cuba's diplomatic mission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Remirez, his wife and two children will leave their
home in suburban Maryland and go elsewhere to make room for the
Gonzalez family.
</P>
<P>
   The house, adorned with a patio and ample back yard, was
described as a four-story structure in a pleasant neighborhood not
far from an area in which block after block of cherry blossoms made
their annual appearance recently.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Gonzalez will be his wife -- Elian's step-mother-- and
their infant son. They are expected to be accompanied by a male
cousin of Elian's with whom he has close ties, Elian's pediatrician
and his kindergarten teacher.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Criticizes Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The United Nations' top human-rights official
sharply criticized Russia on Monday for abuses in Chechnya, saying
she heard ''very harrowing'' accounts on a trip to the war-ravaged
republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned about the scale and seriousness of the
allegations,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson said. ''Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and as
a very important member of the United Nations has assumed
international obligations under its national human rights law and
humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
watchdog, is to vote this week on whether to suspend Russia for
rights abuses in Chechnya. A key demand of the Council had been
allowing foreign observers access to the scene of alleged killings
and other abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has only recently allowed international human rights
groups access to Chechnya and has strictly controlled what they are
allowed to see.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, before leaving for Chechnya, had said she was
especially interested in going to Aldi, a suburb of the Chechen
capital Grozny, where human rights groups alleged Russian soldiers
massacred scores of civilians. But she was unable to go there, or
to the Chernokozovo detention camp, where guards allegedly tortured
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Kalamanov, who is President Vladimir Putin's human
rights envoy to Chechnya, accompanied Robinson on the trip and on
Monday blasted her comments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a conversation with the deaf and dumb,'' he said, hours
after Robinson spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Kalamanov said Robinson and her delegation were given ''full
access,'' and that the reason they did not go to Aldi was because a
skirmish between Russian soldiers and Chechen rebels made it
impossible. He also said Robinson herself chose not to go to
Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she was unable to see some of the areas she wanted,
Robinson said she nonetheless saw much that was distressing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have very detailed and very harrowing accounts. It was not
an easy few days,'' she said, without elaborating. The three-day
trip included Grozny, refugee camps and the neighboring region of
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   During a 2{-hour visit to Grozny on Sunday, Robinson visited a
hospital, a jail, spoke with residents of the city, and visited the
site of another reported massacre in the Staropromyslovsky suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Russia previously has allowed foreign journalists and rights
workers to visit the Chernokozovo camp. But a report from Amnesty
International recently contended that evidence of torture was
removed from the camp ahead of such visits.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson reportedly had hoped to meet Putin on Tuesday, but
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Putin's spokesman for Chechnya, said no
meeting had been scheduled, according to the news agency ITAR-Tass.

<HEADLINE> Delta Passenger Finds Loaded Gun  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A passenger found a loaded gun in a bathroom
sink on a Delta Express flight Monday, forcing the plane to be
diverted to Norfolk, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was found about 10 minutes after Flight 2395 left Islip,
N.Y., for Orlando, Fla. The plane landed in Norfolk less than an
hour later.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 passengers were on the Boeing 737. They were taken to
the airport fire station and interviewed by the FBI, agent Stephen
Yount said. Agents searched the plane for other weapons but didn't
find any, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was released to Delta after the search, and the
passengers were allowed to continue their travel.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said it is airline policy not to
discuss security issues.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Kids Saved in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Authorities raided four houses in and
around Guatemala City on Monday, recovering four babies they say
had been kidnapped and were to be sold to wealthy adoptive parents
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While no arrests were made as part of Monday's raids, police
also searched the offices of two local lawyers thought to be
arranging the illegal adoption of the four infants by unknowing
foreign parents.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were ''preparing arrest warrants against several
individuals known to be involved,'' said prosecutor Francisco
Asensio.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's raids come less than a week after the release of a U.N.
report that found that infants here are often ''produced'' for sale
to parents in the United States. When poor mothers and prostitutes
are unwilling to give up their babies, the children are often
kidnapped by baby-selling rings.
</P>
<P>
   The report blamed often well-to-do lawyers for initiating the
illegal adoptions because, while the legal adoption of an infant to
Guatemalan parents can earn about $300 in legal fees, attorneys who
oversee adoptions to parents outside the country can make $25,000
per child.
</P>
<P>
   Police found all of babies in good health and in well-kept
homes, said Candito Breman, another prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Breman said he believed those that had been caring for the
stolen infants must have gotten word of the coming raids and fled
just minutes before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two of the mothers went with us as part of our efforts,''
Breman said. Authorities did not say if they had identified the
mothers of the other two children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mothers who accompanied police, Esperanza Lopez,
finally laid eyes on her only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said during her delivery, doctors gave her a ''drink that
must have been alcoholic'' that put her to sleep. When she awoke,
she told reporters Monday, her new daughter had been successfully
delivered but was nowhere to be found.

<HEADLINE> Cubans in NJ to hold candlelight march for Elian Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos JAZ101-103
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- About 300 Cuban-Americans marched and
chanted Monday in support of the Miami family of Elian Gonzalez and
their fight to keep the 6-year-old boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers made their way down Bergenline Avenue for about 15
blocks at rush hour chanting, ''Libertad para Elian,'' or ''Freedom
for Elian,'' and ''Down with Castro.'' Many held signs with the
boy's face on them and others leaned out their windows waving the
Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the march the group lit candles and held a moment
of silence in a lot across from the Cuban-American National
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson County is home to the nation's highest concentration of
Cuban-Americans outside Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was pulled from the Atlantic Ocean in November after his
mother and 10 other people drowned while fleeing Cuba. Since that
time, he has lived with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department cleared the way Monday night for Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to travel to the United States so he
can be reunited with his son, as negotiations continued between
immigration officials and the boy's relatives in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The department granted the senior Gonzalez's visa request along
with those of his wife, infant son and Elian's male cousin,
kindergarten teacher and pediatrician. The visas for the six could
be issued as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban activist Rolando Rios said before Monday's march here that
the boy belongs in the United States and said that his father
cannot be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ''His father is being watched by Castro,'' Rios said,
reiterating charges made by Elian's Miami family: ''The kid is
afraid of him.''

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Status of Suit Against CBS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal judge Monday approved class-action
status for a sex discrimination lawsuit on behalf of female
technicians at five CBS television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 lawsuit accuses CBS of discriminating against its
female technical employees at stations in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Minneapolis and Green Bay, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Michael Silver said the network was studying the
judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents filed Monday, plaintiff Rebecca
Beckman of WCCO-TV in Minneapolis testified she had been denied
three promotions that went to men.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told she was passed over for one job because
she did not have a certain type of training, which she said she had
requested repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff Beth Senn, also of WCCO-TV, said her supervisor denied
her additional training because he said she ''wasn't smart
enough.'' Senn said that when she complained about her supervisor's
sexually vulgar and derogatory comments, she was told, ''Boys will
be boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prospective members of the class-action lawsuit testified
about supervisors' comments including, ''a woman couldn't handle
the story,'' ''I had one of you girls in this position before, and
it didn't work out'' and ''It's a man's world and there is nothing
we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certified to join the lawsuit are women who worked as
technicians at WCCO-TV or in the engineering and operation

<HEADLINE> Financial Adviser Accused of Theft  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Ben
Affleck and singer Alanis Morrisette are among the rich and famous
clients of an investment adviser accused of stealing millions to
support a lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Dana C. Giacchetto, a 37-year-old New Yorker, allegedly diverted
$20 million from clients. The band Phish -- along with their manager
-- may have lost as much as $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto is also accused of failing to return at least $4
million in money maneuvered through the accounts in his investment
business, The Cassandra Group, which he ran from a loft in the
city's chic Soho section.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors brought criminal securities charges against
Giacchetto in U.S. District Court in Manhattan while the Securities
and Exchange Commission charged him in a civil lawsuit and obtained
a freeze of his assets.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers unsealed Monday, prosecutors and the SEC said
Giacchetto stole from clients to pay for his apartment, hotels,
travel, dining and entertainment. Giacchetto is also accused of
using money belonging to entertainment's A-list to make
unauthorized donations such as $90,000 to the New York Arts Academy
and $5,000 to the New York Police Scholarship Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the last three years, he ''sought to attract
clients from the arts and entertainment industry, many of whom
lacked financial sophistication,'' the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Company literature promised a ''conservative investment
strategy'' focused on large companies but he ''knowingly or
recklessly'' deposited more than $20 million of his clients' money
in bank accounts permitting him to pay the expenses of his business
and himself, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC accused him of issuing fake portfolio statements or
other false documents to clients who wanted proof of their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto's lawyer, Andrew Levander, told Judge Lawrence
McKenna on Monday that his client was returning from a trip abroad.
Outside court, Levander said he couldn't comment further because he
had not yet had a chance to read the court papers or talk to his
client.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client was expected back in New York on Tuesday and
that Giacchetto sent a letter to his customers a week ago telling
them he was getting out of the investment business.
</P>
<P>
   As for his client's next move, Levander said to ''stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''no
one is immune from any kind of scheme, securities or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto was the sole owner, president, chief investment
officer and treasurer of his company, Cassandra Group, since the
time he registered with the SEC in April 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors charged Giacchetto with securities fraud,
fraud and making false statements to the SEC. They said in court
papers that he signed an affidavit in December admitting that he
misappropriated $3.9 million from the band Phish and its members
and another $968,900 from accounts held by the band's manager. They
said he pocketed more than $6 million illegally.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Giacchetto faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
on the most serious charge and $1 million or twice the gross gain
or loss resulting from the crime.

Judge Rules Against Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Humbling a proud giant of the computer age, a federal
judge ruled today that Microsoft violated U.S. antitrust laws by keeping ''an
oppressive thumb'' on competitors during the race to link Americans to the
Internet. In a sweeping verdict against the empire that Bill Gates built, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Microsoft violated the Sherman Act,
the same law used to crush monopolies from Standard Oil to AT&AMP;T. He concluded
that the company was guilty -- as the federal government, 19 states and the
District of Columbia had alleged in a case that began in May 1998 -- of
''unlawfully tying its Web browser'' to its Windows operating system that
dominates the computer market worldwide. Hearings are to be held on possible
punishment.

Record Drop of 349.15 on Nasdaq
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With Microsoft dragging down high-tech shares, the Nasdaq
composite index today plummeted a one-day record 349.15 points, or by 7.6
percent, to close at 4,223.68. But rising shares in financial firms pushed the
Dow industrials up 300.01 to close at 11,221.93. On the NYSE, gainers led losers
1,575-1,517. Since closing at a record high 5,048.62 on March 10, the Nasdaq has
fallen more than 16 percent, but it's still 3.8 percent above where it was on
Jan. 1. Microsoft fell 15] to 90~ as it appeared poised for harsh penalties in a
federal anti-trust suit.

U.N. Envoy Criticizes Russia

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The United Nations' top human-rights official sharply
criticized Russia today for abuses in Chechnya, saying she heard ''very
harrowing'' accounts on a trip to the war-ravaged republic. ''I am very
concerned about the scale and seriousness of the allegations,'' U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said. ''Russia is a member of the
Council of Europe and as a very important member of the United Nations has
assumed international obligations under its national human rights law and
humanitarian law.'' The Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
watchdog, is to vote this week on whether to suspend Russia for rights abuses in
Chechnya.

will contact gun manufacturers and sellers within 15 days to inform them of the
regulations, which also require safety warnings with each gun, tamper-resistant
serial numbers, and indicators on semiautomatic handguns that tell that tell if
a bullet is in the chamber.

authorities said. The gun was found about 10 minutes after Flight 2395 left
Islip, N.Y., for Orlando, Fla. The plane landed in Norfolk less than an hour

Rodman Pleads Innocent To DUI Charge

   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman pleaded innocent today to a
misdemeanor drunken driving charge. The former NBA star's lawyer entered the
plea. Rodman was not required to be in court for the hearing, and is not
required to attend a pretrial conference May 4 at the Harbor Justice Center. The
charge stems from his arrest Dec. 22, when he allegedly drove with a
blood-alcohol level of 0.15 -- nearly twice the legal limit of 0.08.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Preparing Elian's Dad for Trip  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A smiling Fidel Castro joined Elian Gonzalez's
father and about 3,000 university students from across Latin
America and the Caribbean on Monday for a festive rally to call for
the return of the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 31, held his 6-month old
son in his lap in the front row of the audience as the gathering
got under way in a new permanent stage built in front of the U.S.
Interests Section alongside Havana's coastal highway.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the rally began, news was arriving from Washington
that the State Department had decided to approve requests for six
visas: for Elian's father, stepmother, baby half-brother, and
5th-grade boy cousin, his pediatrician and kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The rally marked the inauguration of the new stage, a massive
concrete and steel construction evidently built for future protest
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want Elian! Down with the lie!'' protesters chanted after a
ceremony inaugurating the ''Jose Marti Anti-Imperialist Permanent
Stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The park that once stood on the site has been the scene of a
long series of marches, rallies and televised roundtables held
almost daily since Dec. 5, calling for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Although some have wearied of the continual protests, the
gatherings have been effectively used to keep the public updated on
events in the case, to rally Cubans people behind Castro and
against the Miami exiles, and to involve the nation's children and
youth in the national fight for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's gathering was a celebration of sorts coming amid
reports that the U.S. government was working with Elian's Miami
relatives on a plan to turn the 6-year-old boy over to his father
when he arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The rally featured well-known Cuban folk singer Silvio Rodriguez
and fireworks. University students visiting Cuba for a regional
conference waved white, red and blue Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his traditional olive greens, a beaming Castro
greeted some of Elian's Cuban schoolmates, patting the boys and
girls on the head.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department said the visas for Elian's father and
five others could be issued as early as Tuesday, clearing the way
for Gonzalez to visit the United States for the first time since
his son was rescued off the coast of south Florida four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 22 other visas requested by the Cuban government were being
reviewed, the department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Gonzalez refused requests by Elian's Miami relatives
to go to the United States to claim the boy and his changed stance
was being characterized here as a sign of his flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Gonzalez and other members of the delegation
would stay in Washington at the homes of Cuban diplomats while
awaiting the results of a federal court appeal by Elian's Miami
relatives, who have temporary custody of him and are seeking to
block his return to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore and Bush Tied in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is focusing on education, but
Al Gore has the edge in public perception of who is stronger on the
issue, says a new poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has gained the public's trust on other issues, but has
slipped behind the vice president on education, which tops the list
when people are asked what issue is most important to them,
according to an ABC News-Washington poll on the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who they trust to do a better job of improving
schools and education, 48 percent said Gore, the likely Democratic
nominee, and 39 percent said Bush, the expected GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates were tied on the issue a month ago, and
Republicans see a strong showing on education as a key for Bush to
cut into the traditional Democratic advantage among women.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a 10-point lead among men and Gore had a 10-point lead
among women in the poll that showed the two in a dead heat, 47
percent for Gore to 46 percent for Bush among registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also appeared to hold the upper hand on several specific
education policies -- from increasing federal funding to penalizing
poorly performing schools and subsidizing private school tuition in
districts that perform poorly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Almost two-thirds of Americans said federal spending on
education should be increased, with the majority saying it should
go up ''a great deal.'' Gore's proposals are more sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six in 10 oppose cuts in federal funding to school districts
whose students don't improve on standardized tests. Such a proposal
is a cornerstone of Bush's education portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   -- About half oppose giving federal money to parents to help send
their children to private schools in areas where public schools
aren't improving. Bush supports this idea, Gore opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush rolled out a $5 billion reading program to
combat illiteracy in elementary school students and a $3 billion
plan to help train and retain teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has gained an advantage in public trust on issues such as
taxes, crime, the death penalty, the economy, campaign finance and
moral standards. Gore leads on the issues of education, the
environment, women's issues, abortion rights and patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush were about even on the issues of Social Security,
foreign affairs, the federal budget and gun control in the poll of
1,083 adults taken Thursday through Sunday. It has an error margin
of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a double-digit lead over Bush in a New York poll out
Monday, while Bush had a double-digit lead in a survey in
traditionally Republican Indiana. The two were tied in a Wisconsin
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The New York poll from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion showed the vice president ahead of the Texas governor, 49
percent to 38 percent. Gore has led Bush in several New York polls
out this winter, though the two were close in Marist polls last
December and earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are in a statistical dead heat among male
voters, with 46 percent supporting Gore and 42 percent for Bush,
but Gore leads Bush among women, 53 percent to 35 percent. The
telephone poll of 561 registered voters in New York was conducted
March 27-28 and has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> German President Asking Forgiveness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Germany's president on Monday began an
official visit to Greece, where he will tour a World War II
massacre site and ask Greeks' forgiveness for Nazi war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Rau was greeted by Greek president Costis
Stephanopoulos and an honor guard of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Rau's visit comes as the Supreme Court deliberates over a demand
for compensation from Germany over Nazi atrocities committed in
Greece during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rau will visit the southern mountain town of
Kalavryta, where Nazi troops massacred 1,463 men in 1943 as a
reprisal for 81 soldiers shot by resistance fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Rau said the trip to the town was a ''symbolic visit'' aimed at
reminding Germans not to forget their past.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians were executed during the 1941-44 Nazi
occupation of Greece as part of a brutal campaign to suppress
resistance fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Rau will also hold talks with Premier Costas Simitis and other
top leaders.

<HEADLINE> Study: HIV Tests Can Save Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mandatory HIV screening of pregnant women would
not only reduce the number of newborns with the virus, it would
also cost less than voluntary testing or no tests at all, a
University of Illinois analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   While the study looked at the potential benefits in Chicago, the
researchers said similar benefits could be expected elsewhere. The
study appears in the April issue of Pediatrics, the medical journal
of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, led by Dr. Lilly Cheng Immergluck of the University
of Illinois-Chicago's pediatrics department, said mandatory testing
would save money in the long run because it would reduce the amount
of money spent on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers who test positive for the AIDS virus could be given the
anti-HIV drug zidovudine, AZT, and to take other precautions during
delivery. The authors presumed that screening would take place
fairly early in pregnancy, at 14 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with voluntary screening, universal HIV testing of
100,000 pregnant women in Chicago would prevent 4.8 infant
infections and save nearly $270,000, the researchers said. Compared
with no testing, it would save $3.69 million and avert 64.6 infant
infections, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are based on estimates that about two-fifths of 1
percent of pregnant women in Chicago have HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended universal HIV
testing of pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimate that HIV-infected babies live on
average for slightly more than nine years but because of new
treatments may soon live into their early 20s.

<HEADLINE> Air Bag Crushes Boy, 9, to Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. (AP) -- After his grandmother let him take the
wheel, a 9-year-old boy crashed a car into an embankment of her
driveway and was crushed to death when the air bag inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Pagliarani III was driving his grandmother's 1995
Mercury sedan in her driveway Sunday night, police Sgt. Joel Gould
said.
</P>
<P>
   After returning from a trip for ice cream, the boy's
grandmother, Shirley Pagliarani, 71, allowed the boy to drive the
approximately 140-foot stretch of her driveway, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the boy nor the grandmother were wearing seat belts, and
Gould said it wasn't clear if a restraint could have saved the
child's life.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliarani was ''very shook up and upset'' and was not charged
in connection with the accident, Gould said. It is not illegal for
an adult to allow a child to drive on private property.

<HEADLINE> Minority Admissions Rise at UC  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- The number of black and Hispanic
freshmen admitted to the University of California system has crept
back to affirmative action-era levels, but no one is declaring the
struggle for diversity over.
</P>
<P>
   UC officials said Monday that 7,336 black, Hispanic and American
Indian students have been admitted for the fall semester, 100 more
than were admitted for fall 1997 -- the last year admissions
officers were allowed to take race and gender into account.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't completely clear up UC's enrollment picture,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the resurgence in black and Hispanic admissions has come
at lesser-known campuses. Flagship Berkeley is still well below
1997 totals as is UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Also, black, Hispanic and American Indian students have not
regained their proportional standing: They accounted for 18.8
percent of new freshmen admissions in 1997 and 17.6 percent of
offers this fall.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a significant difference between black and
Hispanic students. The number of black students admitted to UC's
eight undergraduate campuses is still 7 percent below 1997 levels,
1,328 vs. 1,435. Hispanic admissions went up 5 percent, from 5,494
to 5,753.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a certain satisfaction of where we are at this time,
but clearly we realize and appreciate that there's still a lot more
to do,'' said UC spokesman Terry Lightfoot.
</P>
<P>
   UC officials say it's impossible to say how much of the increase
in Hispanic admissions is due to boosted outreach efforts and how
much to the simple fact that their presence in the state is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the admission figures varied.
</P>
<P>
   UC Regent Ward Connerly, who wrote the new race-blind policies
and has become a national figure in the anti-affirmative action
movement, credits the recovering black and Hispanic admissions to
new outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Those include aggressive recruiting, a guarantee that the top 4
percent of graduates in each high school will get a place at UC
provided they meet eligibility requirements, and greater emphasis
on evaluating how each applicant may have overcome adversity such
as poverty or bad schools.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Bad Schools an 'Emergency'  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Borrowing a phrase his Republican rival used a
week ago, Vice President Al Gore said Monday that Americans should
consider bad schools a ''national emergency'' -- and insisted he had
used the phrase first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford to wait another day for the dramatic changes
and improvements that are needed,'' Gore said in a speech at
Morehouse College. ''We need to treat the existence of failing
schools as a national emergency. I used that phrase a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore and Republican George W. Bush are competing for
the title of ''Education Candidate'' as they battle for the White
House, with Gore pushing for more funding to hire teachers and
build and modernize schools and Bush taking the point on literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling his $5 billion reading program last week, Bush
described illiteracy among young students as a ''national
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his point after a Morehouse student pressed him on why
the improvements he is proposing haven't come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel the same sense of urgency that you feel,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he first used the ''national emergency'' phrase at
Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, where he delivered the
commencement address last May.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has a strong interest in computer technology,
reiterated his promise to link every classroom and library to the
Internet by the end of his first term. He also supports funding for
computer-equipped technology centers in poor communities and wants
every child to be computer literate before they start high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Computers and the Internet have become as vital to education
in this century as a blackboard and chalk were in the last
century,'' said Gore, who was participating in a panel discussion
on the technology gap and the Internet's effect on equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, who appeared with Gore, said outside
help is needed for low-income families that don't have the time or
money to embrace the new technology on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not able to learn to use the existing technology,
then you almost become obsolete,'' said King, the son of the late
civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also attended a $100,000-per-couple reception for the
Democratic National Committee at the Atlanta home of party donor
Larry Cooper that was expected to raise $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore was speaking at a Philadelphia community center

<HEADLINE> Mexican Catholics To Affirm Rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Roman Catholic leaders are planning an
unprecedented open-air Mass in Mexico City's central plaza as part
of a campaign to affirm church rights, which have been restricted
in Mexico for nearly 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass will be celebrated in the evening of May 6, followed by
a procession, organizers confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no record of a Mass or religious procession in the
plaza over the past 140 years, according to church officials.
</P>
<P>
   The event is part of a gathering of church leaders that is
expected to outline guidelines for church policy in Mexico,
focusing on issues such as whether the clergy can speak out on
political, social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The event is a landmark for the church, which has been
restricted in Mexico since constitutional reforms of 1857-58 that
stripped it of much of its properties and previous rights.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions were tightened with the post-revolutionary
constitution of 1917 and a string of anti-Catholic measures led to
a virtual halt to church services and the outbreak of the 1926-29
uprising in which tens of thousands died.
</P>
<P>
   After a gradual thaw in relations, the government in 1991
reformed the constitution to ease limits on religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   The church has gradually become more assertive in speaking out
on social and political issues.

<HEADLINE> Group Challenges Tuna Label  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Environmentalists asked a federal judge
Monday to stop the Clinton administration from watering down the
nation's ''dolphin-safe'' tuna label to allow tuna caught with
dolphins that are netted and released.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to conflicting versions of scientific evidence,
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson promised to rule soon on the
label change, the latest in a long-running legal and political
battle.
</P>
<P>
   For about a decade, tuna fleets that want a dolphin-safe label
have been prohibited from using large, encircling nets that trap
both tuna and dolphins, which swim with yellowfin tuna in the
eastern tropical Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Congress first restricted dolphin kills by U.S. tuna boats in
1972 and imposed similar requirements later on foreign fleets that
exported tuna to the United States. Past rulings by Henderson have
strengthened provisions requiring embargoes on nations that fail to
meet the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The labeling practice is scheduled to change April 11, when the
Commerce Department plans to allow tuna caught by Mexican boats to
carry a dolphin-safe label as long as observers on the boats see no
dolphins killed or injured in the encircling nets.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law lifted a U.S. embargo on tuna caught with dolphins in
encircling nets and allowed the dolphin-safe label to apply to
those catches unless the National Marine Fisheries Service found
that the practice significantly harmed dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has split the environmental movement. Groups such as
Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund supported the 1997 law and
filed arguments supporting the government in the current case. The
plaintiffs include the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society.

Microsoft Foes Cheer Judge's Action
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft's biggest foes cheered today's judicial ruling
that the software giant broke federal antitrust laws, but the only immediate
impact on the industry may be emboldened sales pitches from its rivals. Experts
on all sides of the debate agreed that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's decision still doesn't resolve the uncertainty over how Microsoft
might be punished or whether its dominant Windows operating systems might lose
market share any time soon. ''It's just one step in the process,'' said John
Thompson, a spokesman for Dell Computer Corp., which has traditionally
maintained a close relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft said it will appeal
the ruling.

Ruling Haunts Nasdaq, Which Drops 349.15
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index today,
falling 15] to 90~ as Wall Street anticipated a federal judge's antitrust ruling
against the software company. The plunge in Microsoft set off another stampede
away from technology stocks and sent investors searching for blue-chip issues.
The swing toward financial, retail and drug stocks helped the Dow Jones
industrials soar 300 points. The Nasdaq plunged 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close
at 4,223.68. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history, surpassing
a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.

   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- French NATO troops arrested the most senior
Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect to date Monday, sweeping into the Serb
stronghold of Pale in a pre-dawn raid that galvanized the crusade to bring the
architects of the Balkans' ''ethnic cleansing'' campaigns to justice. Momcilo
Krajisnik, a close ally of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was
arrested at his home by troops who witnesses said forced open his door.
Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Krajisnik was led away in his
pajamas and bare feet. Krajisnik is charged with every war crime on the Yugoslav
tribunal's statute, including genocide.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deep under the ocean floor and the Arctic permafrost are

nearly $50 million to find out if this energy source can be developed without
setting off a cataclysmic warming of the globe. The House approved by voice vote

<HEADLINE> Stanford U. Names New President  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Computer science pioneer John Hennessy
was named the next president of Stanford University on Monday,
promising to make life better for undergraduates while maintaining
close ties to Silicon Valley businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy, 47, has been the university's provost for the past
year. A former dean of Stanford's School of Engineering, he takes
over on Sept. 1 from Gerhard Casper, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stanford's best interests will be served by balancing the
lessons of the past with the advances of the future,'' said
Hennessy, who will oversee a $1.5 billion annual budget, 1,600
faculty members and 13,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally known and respected for his computer work,
Hennessy is credited with starting a successful Silicon Valley
company, MIPS Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is an entrepreneur. He has a technological background,''
said Ruben Barrales, president and chief executive of Joint Venture
Silicon Valley, a nonprofit community and business group. ''I think
it's good news for Stanford and for Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy was instrumental in securing a $150 million donation
last year by Netscape founder Jim Clark, a former Stanford
professor. The gift will fund a new cross-disciplinary science
center, dubbed Bio-X, which will focus on advances in biomedicine,
bioengineering and bioscience. It is scheduled to open in 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The former Seattle Times columnist and assistant
managing editor, June Anderson Almquist, who led the way from high
society coverage to contemporary women's issues, died Sunday of
cancer. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Almquist was hired by the newspaper in 1951 to work in the
society department and in the late 1960s, she became women's news
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Almquist followed with articles on women's rights, birth
control, abortion, unwed mothers and unmarried couples, eventually
becoming the first woman to be named assistant managing editor of a
Seattle newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   For years she wrote a column, ''June's Journal,'' that often
reported on society events. She was one of the first two women on
the West Coast to hitch a ride with the Blue Angels, the Navy's
elite jet fighter stunt team.
</P>
<P>
   Almquist was the first woman to be elected president of the
local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and in
1998, she was awarded the group's highest national honor.

<HEADLINE> Capitals 4, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joe Sacco had his first two-goal game of the
season Monday night, lifting the Washington Capitals out of their
mini-slump in a come-from-behind 4-1 victory over the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sacco scored on a breakaway and during a delayed-penalty call,
both in the second period, as the Southeast Division-leading
Capitals broke a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Washington moved within two points of New Jersey in the race for
the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Metropolit and Jeff Halpern added goals in the third
period. Adam Oates had two assists, moving him into 12th place on
the NHL career list with 893.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Nedved scored in the first period on a 5-on-3 power play
for New York, winless in seven games (0-6-1). The Rangers, who
fired general manager Neil Smith and coach John Muckler last week,
have been eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved nearly had a second goal on a breakaway, but was stopped
in the first by a spectacular kick save by Olaf Kolzig. Kolzig, who
made 22 saves, kept the ragged Capitals in the game until Sacco's
first goal brought the team to life.
</P>
<P>
   Sacco, who had scored only once in 31 games, got the Capitals
going when he intercepted Kevin Hatcher's pass in Washington's zone
near the blue line. Sacco outraced the Rangers' converging
defensemen and put the puck above Kirk McLean's left shoulder at
12:06.
</P>
<P>
   Sacco's second came when the Capitals had an extra skater on
during a delayed penalty. The left wing found space in the right
circle and beat McLean in a crowded crease at 17:41.
</P>
<P>
   Oates threaded a nice pass from left wing to set up Metropolit
for the insurance score at 4:07 of the third. It was Metropolit's
sixth goal of the season, and third goal in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Ulf Dahlen fed Halpern in the slot to wrap up the scoring with
3:54 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, a consistent performer in an otherwise dreadful Rangers
season, got his 42nd point in 41 games when he scored on a
one-timer from the right circle at 5:27 of the first.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- With one big swing, Eric Karros silenced the
Montreal Expos' largest opening-crowd since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit a grand slam and the Los Angeles Dodgers overcame
Vladimir Guerrero's two home runs, beating the Expos 10-4 Monday
night before 51,249 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers ace Kevin Brown (1-0) allowed three runs on Guerrero's
RBI single in the first and a two-run shot by the Expos slugger in
the fifth. Guerrero later hit a solo home run.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley also homered for Los Angeles and Gary Sheffield
added a two-run triple off Expos starter Dustin Hermanson (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was the Expos' fourth-largest ever. New owner Jeffrey
Loria greeted fans at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took a 6-3 lead in the seventh when Anthony Telford
walked Dodgers newcomer Shawn Green with the bases loaded and one
out. Karros homered on a 1-1 pitch from Scott Strickland for his
second career slam.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit his first grand slam at Olympic Stadium last Aug. 11
off Telford.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment of silence before the game for Cindy Lloyd,
the wife of Expos reliever Graeme Lloyd, who died suddenly in Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla., on Monday morning. She died at 26 in Florida
after a 14-year bout with Crohn's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed seven hits in six innings. He struck out seven and
walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who signed an $84 million, six-year deal with Los Angeles
after he was acquired in a trade with Toronto last Nov. 8, went
0-for-3, with two walks and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson allowed five runs, though just one earned, in six
innings. The Expos committed four errors, including two by third
baseman Michael Barrett, who mishandled Devon White's grounder on
an 0-2 pitch to open the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have led the majors in errors in each of the last two
seasons, including 160 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Montreal became the fifth and sixth teams to
open the current season outside of the United States, a first in
major league history. The New York Mets and Chicago Cubs opened the
season with a two-game series last week in Japan, and Toronto
played host to Kansas City earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The game was Los Angeles' first opening day outside of
the United States, and the first season opener between the Dodgers
and Expos. ... Expos 1B Lee Stevens made a diving stop of F.P.
Santangelo's sharply hit grounder for the first out of the eighth.
He then committed his first NL error on Mark Grudzielanek's two-out

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A look at the leadership crisis facing the Japanese
government:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING A SUCCESSOR:
</P>
<P>
   The selection process would begin with the nomination of a new
president of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Cabinet would be
dissolved, and the Parliament would vote on the LDP nominee.
Because the LDP has more seats than any other party, its president
is guaranteed the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   POTENTIAL CANDIDATES:
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, has emerged as the most likely successor to Obuchi. Other
possible candidates are Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Chief
Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki, who took over as acting prime
minister on Monday. Aoki, however, is seen as more of a temporary
stand-in than a potential premier.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PRESSING ISSUES:
</P>
<P>
   The ruling LDP is still in firm control, so no big changes were
in store on economic policies, but political stability was needed
to gain the confidence of the markets. Japan is also facing talks
this week with North Korea, volcanic eruptions in the northern part
of the country, and preparations to host the G-8 summit of
industrialized nations in July.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL COMPLICATIONS:
</P>
<P>
   Parliamentary elections must be held by October, but the
leadership crisis is likely to fuel opposition demands for a snap
vote. Obuchi's illness also came as his unwieldy three-party ruling
coalition was beginning to splinter, though the LDP still has
enough seats in Parliament to control the government.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 5, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Pavel Bure scored his league-leading 56th
and 57th goals and extended his points streak to a career-high 12
games as Florida beat New Jersey 5-2 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, 5-1-1 in their last seven games, scored three
straight goals against Devils goalie Chris Terreri, who was subbing
for Martin Brodeur. Panthers goalie Mike Vernon stopped 39 shots
and is unbeaten in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Florida left wing Peter Worrell, sidelined two weeks by a
concussion, returned to action without any serious incident.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Scott Niedermayer hit Worrell over the head with
his stick March 19, earning a 10-game suspension, and several
Devils players vowed payback for Worrell's throat-slashing gestures
toward the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Worrell also threatened Niedermayer, but only four penalties
were called through the first two periods. Worrell and Colin White
got five-minute major penalties for fighting in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers hoped Worrell's situation wouldn't be an issue, so
they could stay focused on the importance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Panthers within a win -- or a loss by
Ottawa -- of clinching the fifth playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey could have used a win as well. The Devils are seeking
to stay atop the Atlantic Division and capture home-ice advantage
throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, 5-5 in their last 10 games, took a 1-0 lead in the
first period on Sergei Brylin's 18th goal. He deflected Ken
Daneyko's shot from just inside the blue line and beat Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Florida got two goals in a span of 22 seconds in the closing
minutes of the first and led 2-1 at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Len Barrie's shot from the left circle deflected off Terreri and
rebounded to Alex Hicks, who tried to poke it in. Hicks' first shot
rebounded into the air, where he caught it, dropped it in front of
the goal and Scott Mellanby tipped it home.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Parrish scored his 25th goal seconds later. He redirected a
shot from Mike Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Bure's first goal came on a power play 22 seconds into the
second period. His second was an empty-netter with 0.8 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey made it 3-2 with about 13 minutes to on Jason
Arnott's 20th goal, but Barrie put the Panthers back in front by
two goals with 6:12 to play.

<HEADLINE> Sabres 3, Maple Leafs 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dixon Ward's early go-ahead goal stood up
and Buffalo's stifling defense did the rest as the Sabres beat the
Toronto Maple Leafs 3-2 Monday night and moved back into playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Satan and Michael Peca also scored for the Sabres, who
limited the Maple Leafs to eight shots during the final 40 minutes.
All of the game's scoring took place in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres -- 6-1 in their last seven games -- moved back into
eighth place in the Eastern Conference standings, jumping over
Carolina which lost at Pittsburgh. Buffalo, with 81 points, leads
the Hurricanes by one point and Montreal by two for the final
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo and Montreal have three games remaining, while Carolina
will play only two more.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Sundin and Sergei Berezin scored for Toronto, which set a
team record with no shots on goal in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs had never gone without a shot on goal in a
period in the 45 years the league has recorded the statistic. The
club's old record was one shot in a period, done 10 times and most
recently in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Joseph kept the Maple Leafs in the game, stopping 26
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast-leading Maple Leafs, who have three games
remaining, wasted an opportunity to clinch their first division
title since the NHL went to that format in 1967-68.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Toronto team finished first was in 1963 when
there were only six NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek wasn't tested much, but he made a
brilliant game-saving stop, robbing Jonas Hoglund's one-timer from
the slot with 6:31 left.
</P>
<P>
   After the teams scored two goals apiece over a 4:29 span in the
first period, the Sabres went ahead to stay on Ward's fluke goal
with 4:43 left in the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Afinogenov set it up when he circled the net and directed
a shot towards the crease, where Ward was battling for position
with Toronto's Gerald Diduck. With Ward looking away, the puck
deflected off the back of his skate and through Joseph's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Sundin opened the scoring 4:24 in. After Satan tied it 56
seconds later, the Sabres went ahead when Peca redirected Vaclav
Varada's centering pass at 8:16.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto tied it after 37 seconds when Berezin snapped a shot
past Hasek, who was bumped by a hard-charging Nik Antropov.
</P>
<P>
   After being out-shot 11-0 in the second period and 20-12 through
40 minutes, the Leafs finally got their 13th shot 20 seconds into
the third on a Sundin blast from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time the Sabres held an opponent without a
shot in a period. The last time was in 1976 against the Kansas City
Scouts.

<HEADLINE> MSU Leads 43-32 Over Fla. at Half  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mateen Cleaves scored 13 points in the first
half and Michigan State showed it could run with Florida, building
a 43-32 halftime lead in the NCAA championship game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who slogged their way to a 53-41 victory over
Wisconsin in the semifinals, willingly turned up the throttle
against the Gators, consistently beating the full-court pressure to
set up easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State had 18 field goals in the first half, two more
than its total in the entire game Saturday. The Spartans were
shooting 53 percent from the field and had committed only four
turnovers against the high-pressure Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who returned for his senior season for a chance to win
a national title, hit a pair of 3s to highlight a 14-3 run that
gave Michigan State its biggest lead, 33-20. Until Monday, Florida
had never faced a deficit of more than seven points in its previous
five tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves was 3-of-3 shooting outside the arc and 5-of-8 overall
after a 1-of-7 performance against Wisconsin. He also had plenty of
help: A.J. Granger scored 9 points, Jason Richardson and Morris
Peterson had 6 apiece, and Charlie Bell added 5.
</P>
<P>
   Udonis Haslem was leading Florida with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, eliminated in the semifinals a year ago, was
trying to win its second national title. In 1979, the Magic
Johnson-led Spartans defeated Larry Bird and Indiana State in the
title game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson watched this game from the green-clad Michigan State
section at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Florida was playing in the final for the first time. The Gators
were eliminated in the semifinals in 1994, their only other trip to
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Florida also was trying to keep alive the Southeastern
Conference's streak of winning the championship in even-numbered
years. Arkansas captured the title in 1994, while Kentucky finished
No. 1 in both 1996 and '98.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's BB Games  </HEADLINE>
AMERICAN LEAGUE
White Sox-Rangers
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The teams got a taste of the new unified umpire crews.
Three of the four working this series used to be NL guys. ...
Reliever Kelly Wunsch made his big league debut for Chicago in the
eighth, retiring the side in order.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Ivan Rodriguez had the 10th multihomer game of his
career. ... Former President George Bush's ceremonial first pitch
was high and outside, much better than the one-hopper he tossed out
before the Rangers' 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Indians-Orioles
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The nine-game road trip is the longest at the
beginning of the season for the Indians since 1906. ... Cleveland
has no rookies on an opening day roster that includes six players
who did not open the 1999 season with the Indians. ... Announced
the signing C Bobby Hughes to a minor league contract. The
28-year-old, released by Milwaukee last week, was assigned to
Triple-A Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: B.J. Surhoff owns the longest active consecutive
games streak in the majors, now at 325 after playing Monday. ...
Cal Ripken made his 19th opening day start, his fifth at third
base.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Royals-Blue Jays
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: P Jeff Suppan was sick Sunday morning with the flu.
He didn't work out with the club on Sunday, but made the start.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Opening day in Toronto is not what it used to be. The
Blue Jays had to paper the SkyDome, giving away 10,000 tickets to
school kids. ... Former Blue Jay manager Cito Gaston is back with
the club as Toronto's hitting coach. He received a loud ovation
when he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Devil Rays-Twins
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: LF Greg Vaughn says he's tired of all the talk about
the Devil Rays' powerful lineup that includes Jose Canseco, Fred
McGriff, Vinny Castilla (15-day DL) and himself. ''We're all
separate pieces of the puzzle. People talk about us like we're
separate from the team. Sure, we can erase a deficit a little
easier. But we've still got to throw strikes, make plays, move the
runner over. Or all this power won't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins will likely have a Rule 5 draft pick in
their starting rotation. Manager Tom Kelly said LaTroy Hawkins has
lost his spot and will probably be replaced by rookie Johan
Santana. Florida selected Santana in last winter's Rule 5 draft and
then traded him to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Tigers-Athletics
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Hideo Nomo became the sixth different opening day
starter for the Tigers in the last six years and the second in that
span to do so in his first year with the club. Doug Brocail in 1997
was the other. The other opening day starters were Mike Moore
(1995), Felipe Lira (1996), Justin Thompson (1998) and Brian
Moehler (1999). ... Nomo is the second Japanese pitcher to wear a
Tigers uniform and the first to start. Reliever Masap Kida appeared
in 48 games for the Tigers last season. ... The Tigers head into
the 2000 season seeking to break a string of of six straight losing
seasons. The Tigers haven't finished .500 or better since 1993,
when they went 85-77.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: There seems to be a pipeline developing between the
Athletics and Kansas City Royals. Between three trades and a free
agent signing, the A's have four players on their roster with past
ties to the Royals. ''We're the Royals rejects,'' said catcher Sal
Fasano, who was acquired from Kansas City in a trade last week.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Yankees-Angels
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Joe Torre plans to use Bernie Williams at DH
until the center fielder's sore right triceps muscle feels better.
He had been icing his right shoulder much of the spring because of
what he said was a tired arm, but the new problem is unrelated,
Torre said. ... Although outfielder Felix Jose was sent down to
Triple-A Columbus on Sunday, he impressed Torre this spring. ''He's
a power guy,'' Torre said. ''He was one of our intriguing stories
this spring.'' Jose, a 34-year-old who played in South Korea last
season, was 6-of-30 this spring, homered twice and drove in four
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS: Tim Salmon's on-base percentage of .541 was tops in the
majors this spring. The Angels right fielder also was sixth with an
.845 slugging percentage and 10th with a .431 batting average. ...
Beginning their 40th season, the Angels announced their all-time
team as chosen by fans voting on the club's web site. The all-time
team included Jim Fregosi as both the manager and shortstop; Rod
Carew at first, Bobby Grich at second and Doug DeCinces at third.
The outfielders were Brian Downing, Jim Edmonds and Reggie Jackson,
with Don Baylor the DH. The starting pitchers were Nolan Ryan, Mike
Witt, Frank Tanana and Chuck Finley. Troy Percival, the current
Anaheim closer, was voted the relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ------
NATIONAL LEAGUE
Brewers-Reds
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers and Reds had never opened the season
before. Cincinnati opened against the Milwaukee Braves three times,
going 1-2. The only Reds win came in 1954 behind left-hander Joe
Nuxhall, now a Reds announcer. ... Davey Lopes got into his first
argument as manager in the second inning, when Dante Bichette threw
out Kevin Barker on a close play at third. Lopes stood and waved
his arms in front of third base umpire Ron Kulpa, one of those
promoted to the NL staff last August.
</P>
<P>
   CINNCINATI: Chief operating officer John Allen confirmed that
the club already has sold about 2 million tickets, its total for
all of last season. ... SS Barry Larkin, who has spent his entire
career with his hometown team, said his agent is waiting to hear
back from the Reds in their negotiations over a contract
extension.... Scott Sullivan's wife gave birth to the couple's
second child at 8:32 a.m. Monday. The Reds reliever was pitching
when the game was called.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Cubs-Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs have eight new players and a new manager, Don
Baylor, after finishing 67-95 last year. Only six players remain
from their 1998 NL division series roster. ... Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire homered on the same day 42 times the last two seasons. ...
SS Ricky Gutierrez started after not seeing action in the Tokyo
series against the New York Mets due to a strain in the left rib
cage muscle. Gutierrez, a free-agent pickup, hit .347 in spring
training. ... Entering the game, the Cubs were 20-7-2 against the
Cardinals on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire had homered each of the last two opening
days. This is the 11th series between McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy
Sosa. ... The Cardinals are opening at home for the third straight
season and offseason pickup Darryl Kile is making his third
straight opening-day start. Kile won on opening day the previous
two seasons for the Colorado Rockies. ... The Cardinals haven't
opened at home against the Cubs, their traditional rivals, since
1986. ... The Cardinals' roster has only 11 holdovers from last
year's opening day and the rotation is all new. ... The Cardinals
have already sold 2.6 million tickets. ... Georgia Frontiere, owner
of the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams, threw out the first
pitch. Several members of the team were honored before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Rockies-Braves
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Jeff Manto and Scott Servais are the first non-roster
invitees to make the Rockies opening day roster since 1997 when the
team purchased the contract of Darnell Coles.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Greg Maddux went 7 2-3 innings in a 2-0 win over
Colorado. The right-hander has 28 shutouts in his career, but had
none last season. His last blanking was Aug. 6, 1998, when he beat
Cincinnati on a three-hitter. ... Mike Remlinger, who had three
career saves before Monday, said he feels he can do the job as
closer. ''It's just a matter of timing. That's the way I look at
it,'' said the left-hander, who is filling in for John Rocker, who
had 38 saves with the Braves last season. Rocker, however, was
suspended for the first 14 days of the season because of his
derogatory remarks about gays, foreigners and minorities in a
magazine article during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Astros-Pirates
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: This is the first time in franchise history the Astros
have opened a season in Pittsburgh. ... The Astros (20-11) tied
Oakland for the best winning percentage in spring training. Only
Arizona (21-13) won more games. ... Dwight Gooden, scheduled to
start Sunday in Houston against Philadelphia, will pitch Tuesday as
the Astros' spring training complex in Kissimmee, Fla. ... 2B Craig
Biggio is making his 12th consecutive opening day start and his
ninth at 2B. His first three were at catcher. ... Only the Yankees
and Braves had a better record the last two seasons than the
Astros, who won 102 games in 1998 and 97 last season. ... Jose
Lima, the 21-game winner who starts Wednesday, is 3-3 with a 5.36
ERA lifetime against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: 2B Warren Morris' infected shin as improved to the
point he probably will start Wednesday night against Houston. The
Pirates originally feared late last week he might have to go on the
disabled list. ... The Pirates set a franchise record by selling
more than 12,600 full season tickets. Season ticket holders get
first priority on seats for PNC Park next season. ... The Pirates
and Astros hadn't met on opening day since April 10, 1968, when
current Houston manager Larry Dierker defeated the Pirates' Juan
Pizarro 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Padres-Mets
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Sterling Hitchcock nearly missed his chance to start
opening day. Cleveland was close to acquiring the left-hander, but
needed to complete another trade, to clear some salary in order to
take on Hitchcock's deal. Hitchcock allowed one run in 6 1-3
innings and got a no-decision in the Padres' 2-1 loss to the Mets.
... Tony Gwynn and Ruben Rivera were the only players in the
Padres' lineup who also started last year's opener. Gwynn made his
17th straight opening day start. ... Sixteen of San Diego's first
25 games are against teams that made the playoffs last year. Those
opponents had a .555 winning percentage last season, giving the
Padres the toughest April schedule in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets gave Garth Brooks a watch and honored him as
their spring training rookie of the year even though the country
singer went 0-for-17. ''We'd prefer to have him in uniform in left
field for us,'' Mets GM Steve Phillips said. Bruce Bochy, who
managed Brooks in Padres spring training last year replied: ''I
love Garth. But I'd love to see him out there in left field in a
Mets uniform.'' Thirteen Mets players made pledges to Brooks' Touch
'Em All foundation for children. ... The Mets' last five wins,
dating to Game 4 of the divisional series against Arizona last
year, have come in their final at-bat. They had 18 last at-bat wins
in the regular season last year. ... Benny Agbayani, who hit the
game-winning grand slam against the Cubs in Japan last Thursday,
got one of the biggest ovations from the crowd before the game.
Agbayani, a favorite of manager Bobby Valentine, is scheduled to be
sent to the minors on Sunday to make room for fifth starter Glendon
Rusch.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Giants-Marlins
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Barry Bonds came into the game with 60 walks in
58 games against Florida. ... Livan Hernandez, the Giants' starter
Monday night, started the 1998 opener for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Purchased the contracts of RHP Ricky Bones and OF Mark
Smith and designated for assignment RHP Jared Camp and OF Derrick
Gibson. Smith arrived Monday in Miami, dressed for pregame drills
and then asked a group of reporters, ''How do I get to the field?''
... The moves mean the Marlins will go with six outfielders and
only 11 pitchers, one less than planned. ''We have to have more
offense,'' manager John Boles said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
Dodgers-Expos
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers and Expos became the fifth and sixth
teams to open the current season outside of the United States, a
first in major league history. The New York Mets and Chicago Cubs
opened the season with a two-game series last week in Japan, and
Toronto played host to Kansas City earlier Monday. ... The game was
Los Angeles' first opening day outside of the United States, and
the first season opener between the Dodgers and Expos.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: A moment of silence was held prior to Monday night's
season opener in memory of Cindy Lloyd, the wife of Expos reliever
Graeme Lloyd, who died in the morning as a result of complications
from Crohn's disease.

<HEADLINE> SF Chronicle Sale Pushed To May 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Hearst Corp., blocked by a federal judge
last week from completing its purchase of the San Francisco
Chronicle, said Monday it would go to trial May 1 on an antitrust
suit opposing the sale.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker issued a temporary restraining
order Friday against the $660 million sale and said he was
concerned it would lead to the collapse of Hearst's 120-year-old
Examiner and the end of daily newspaper competition in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The restraining order was to run through April 13, when a
hearing was scheduled on a preliminary injunction sought by Clint
Reilly, a former candidate for mayor and an unsuccessful bidder for
the Examiner. An injunction would stay in effect until Reilly's
suit went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst lawyer Gary Halling said the company decided to
bypass the injunction stage and go directly to a non-jury trial
before Walker, starting May 1. Halling said a trial could be
completed in two or three days. Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto,
estimated one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get to the merits and get this resolved as
quickly as possible,'' Halling said. ''The deal will not wait
around indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and the Chronicle Publishing Co. have both said in court
papers that the sale could be terminated if not completed by May 2.
But the agreement allows delays for court proceedings, Halling
said.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the purchase of the morning Chronicle last August,
Hearst said it would close the afternoon Examiner unless it found a
buyer. Hearst said last month that it had contacted 81 potential
buyers, but found no one who would pay for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But it did arrange to transfer the paper to InEx LLC, a company
controlled by Ted Fang, publisher of the free Independent newspaper
chain, and subsidized its continued publication with payments of up
to $66 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fang said he would shift the Examiner to morning publication in
August and compete with the Chronicle.

<HEADLINE> Penguins 3, Hurricanes 2  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alexei Kovalev scored twice within 33 seconds
of the second period Monday night as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat
the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 and strengthened their hold on a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins star Jaromir Jagr, who returned for Saturday's loss to
Philadelphia after missing two games with a sore back, was held
scoreless for the game and without a shot for the first two
periods.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave seventh-place Pittsburgh 84 points -- three more
than Buffalo. The Hurricanes fell to ninth place, a non-playoff
position. The Penguins have three games left, all on the road,
compared with Carolina's two.
</P>
<P>
   Arturs Irbe gave up three goals in 3:37 of the second after
shutting out Philadelphia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Slegr put a 25-foot shot past Irbe's left leg at 3:19 and
Kovalev had two goals in the sixth minute. Kovalev's first was
unassisted and unimpeded after he skated free behind the net. Then,
with his back to Irbe, Kovalev flicked the puck over the Irbe's
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev then had half the net open for his second goal, set up
by Robert Lang and Martin Straka.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev had the game-winning goal with Jagr out against New
Jersey last Tuesday and has 26 goals, including three game-winners,
and 39 assists in 79 games.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kron's wrist shot on a short rebound of Bates Battaglia's
20-foot shot gave Carolina a 1-0 lead after 7:36 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes center Rod Brind'Amour left in the last minute of the
second period with a mild concussion after a check from Bob
Boughner, who got a five-minute penalty for boarding, and a game
misconduct. Carolina did not score during the long advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins goalie Jean-Sebastien Aubin left 4:12 into the third
after bending over backwards to try to stop a shot by Sean Hill.
Aubin was replaced by Ron Tugnutt, 2-2 since being acquired from
Ottawa on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff O'Neill deflected Gary Roberts' shot by past Tugnutt 13:24
into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins center Tyler Wright left midway through the first with
a knee strain after Jeff O'Neill slid into his calves behind the
Penguins net. Wright will be examined again Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust-Era Heroes Honored  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- During World War II, 84 diplomats from 24
countries risked their lives to issue visas and passports that
saved more than 300,000 Jews from the Holocaust. After 55 years,
the international community paid tribute Monday night to the
courage of these unsung heroes -- many who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to them some measure of hope and faith was possible --
hope for the future and faith in the creator as well as his
creatures,'' said Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor.
''But ... why didn't others do it?''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony in the General Assembly hall coincided with the
opening of a U.N. exhibition called ''Visas for Life: The Righteous
Diplomats,'' which runs through April 30 and features untold
stories and unpublished photographs of the 80 men and four women.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when evil was all around, they affirmed the enduring
power of human decency,'' New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, one of
more than a dozen speakers, told the crowd of several hundred that
included relatives of the diplomats and some of the Jews they
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are more than 500,000 people alive today as a
result of diplomats who mostly defied the orders of their
governments to issue visas to every country in the free world,''
said Eric Saul, director of the exhibition. ''More than half of
these men were fired from the governments, dishonored, lost their
careers, their dignity -- and in some cases have yet to be honored
in their home country.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the most famous diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg of
Sweden, is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   His niece, Nane Annan, the wife of Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
recalled how her uncle issued Swedish diplomatic papers to more
than 30,000 Hungarian Jews before he was arrested by the Russians
in January 1945 and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Not a day passed that her grandmother didn't try to find him --
''I can see her gripping the phone, knuckles white from the
tension'' -- and since her grandmother's death, her mother has
continued the search, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never met him, but I know how families of disappeared
persons feel. Although he was absent, he was constantly present,''
said Mrs. Annan, who was born three months before her uncle's
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Kidnap 23 Motorists  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels kidnapped 23 motorists
and hampered road and river traffic in central and northern
Colombia Tuesday after calling for a transportation strike.
</P>
<P>
   National Liberation Army guerrillas also burned vehicles, blew
up a bridge and threatened to destroy river boats, the latest in a
series of attacks apparently aimed at putting pressure on the
government to allow the group a place upcoming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions occurred on a highway in northern Cesar state,
where ELN fighters set up a temporary roadblock and dragged
motorists from their vehicles into nearby mountains, said army
spokesman Capt. Edgar Ortega. Colombian rebels routinely kidnap
motorists for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel group, has been angry
over the government's decision to focus its peace strategy on
contacts with a more powerful group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC. The ELN has waged a sabotage campaign in
recent months against the energy infrastructure, bombing power
pylons and causing blackouts over wide areas.
</P>
<P>
   Road traffic was paralyzed on the main highway connecting Bogota
and the second-largest city, Medellin, after rebels dynamited a
bridge and burned three tractor trailers.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN staged an armed occupation of the same highway for
nearly a week in February, holding hundreds of motorists as human
shields before retreating. The affected stretch of road remained
closed Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel threats against commercial and passenger boats along the
Magdalena River cut traffic by 70 percent around northeastern city
of Barrancabermeja, regional police chief Col. Jaime Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Bus and taxi traffic ground to a halt and some schools were
closed after the ELN burned three buses, Martinez added. The rebel
transport strike is scheduled to continue through Apr. 10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brief highway blockades and sporadic vehicle burnings were also
reported in other parts of Antioquia and in the states of Bolivar,
Guajira, Cesar, and Magdalena.

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Bunch' Photo Sells for $85K  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A turn-of the century photograph of ''The Wild
Bunch'' -- an ill-advised joke that robbed the Western gang of its
anonymity -- sold Monday for $85,000 at an auction.
</P>
<P>
   A private collector who was not identified bought the photograph
at the Swann Galleries auction house. The picture, which carries
the imprint of the photographer, John Swartz of Fort Worth, Texas,
was the most famous of the pieces auctioned from the personal
collection of James D. Horan, an author and Western Americana
expert who died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Bunch portrait depicts five notorious outlaws wearing
Derby hats -- including Robert LeRoy Parker and Henry Longabaugh,
aka Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Also pictured are Ben
Kilpatrick, alias the Tall Texan, William Carver and Harvey Logan,
who went by the name Kid Curry.
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, the five robbed a Nevada bank in the early
1900s and soon after, decided to buy new hats because their old
ones were showing their wear.
</P>
<P>
   They found the Derbies, far from Western style, and donned them
for the portrait in jest. Then, in spite, they sent the photograph
to the bank they had just robbed.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a terrible decision. The portrait made its
way to the Pinkerton Agency, where detectives copied it and issued
duplicates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   With their faces splashed throughout the West, the bandits lost
the element of surprise that had been so useful in pillaging banks,
trains and other targets.
</P>
<P>
   With authorities gaining on them, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid -- subjects of the 1969 film that detailed their lives -- headed
to South America. It's believed they met their demise during an
encounter with Bolivian soldiers in 1908.

<HEADLINE> Court papers: Colonel to plead guilty in drug case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A U.S. Army colonel was implicated for the first
time Monday in a scandal in which his wife admitted smuggling
heroin while he was commanding the military's anti-drug operation
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a Brooklyn federal judge, prosecutors revealed
that Col. James Hiett is now facing criminal charges that he failed
to turn in his wife, Laurie, for laundering drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett has agreed to plead guilty to ignoring a felony, the
letter added. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 3 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett, 36, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in
January, saying she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth of
drugs to New York City. She also admitted traveling to New York to
collect the illicit proceeds to take back to Colombia -- an act
falling under the legal definition of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mrs. Hiett told reporters she purposely kept her
husband in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, he may have asked me why I was going to New
York,'' she said. ''I just told him, 'Don't ask me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors refused to detail the case against the colonel. His
attorney, Abraham Clott, did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Harvey Perritt said that Hiett, 48, a 24-year
veteran, remains on active duty at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Va.,
where he was transferred after allegations arose against his wife.
He said military officials would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division in
Panama had cleared Hiett, saying he had ''no prior knowledge'' of
his wife's crimes. Brooklyn prosecutors, meanwhle, had insisted
their investigation was not over.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was also propelled by U.S. Customs officers,
said Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customs agents have suspected for some time that U.S. Army
Col. James Hiett had knowledge of his wife's activities and may
have even had some complicity,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hiett -- an admitted cocaine addict -- surrendered to
authorities last August after they intercepted two 1.2-kilo
packages of heroin that she allegedly mailed to Queens and
Manhattan from a post office at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The parcels had her return address. But she claimed she sent
them for Jorge Ayala, a civilian driver for U.S. military
commanders in Colombia, and that they contained books, candy,
coffee and Colombian artifacts. She pleaded innocent and was freed
on bond.
</P>
<P>
   One of her co-defendants, Hernan Arcila, 54, pleaded guilty on
Jan. 5 to drug conspiracy, admitting that he accepted shipments
from Colombia at his Queens address. Ayala, who also was named in a
13-count indictment, was arrested Feb. 15 in Bogota, and his
extradition is pending, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea, Laurie Hiett told a federal magistrate she
shipped six packages from Bogota to New York City, believing they
contained cocaine. Tests on the two seized shipments revealed they
were heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant also described flying to New York City two times
to pick up cash. Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Dunst also said Laurie
Hiett once took another trip to Miami carrying a half kilo of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still free on bond, Mrs. Hiett faces up to nine years in prison
at sentencing April 28. Her husband is to enter his plea on April
17.

<HEADLINE> MSU's Cleaves Hurts Ankle in Final  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Michigan State star Mateen Cleaves, after
scoring 18 points, twisted his right ankle with 16:18 left in the
second half of the NCAA championship game against Florida on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves got tangled up with Florida's Teddy Dupay while driving
to the basket and rolled his right foot after putting up the shot.
The whistle already had blown for a foul behind the play, but
neither Cleaves nor Dupay could hear the call.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan State point guard crawled along the baseline,
grimacing in pain. But he was able to get to his feet and walk to
the locker room under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves returned to the bench after trainers taped up his ankle.
He told coach Tom Izzo, ''I'm OK,'' and returned to the court with
11:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   During his absence, Michigan State actually stretched its lead
from 50-44 to 58-50.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, a second-team All-America, missed the first 13 games of
the season after breaking the same foot.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Brothel Madam Sentenced in Nev.  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A former madam who remained on a brothel's
payroll after she became a county commissioner was sentenced Monday
to nearly four years in prison for her role in a racketeering and
money laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Shirley Colletti and others conspired
to conceal that they were operating the Mustang Ranch as a front
for former brothel owner Joseph Conforte, a fugitive who FBI agents
think is hiding in South America.
</P>
<P>
   They said she wired payments overseas on several occasions and
remained on the payroll as a consultant to the Mustang Ranch while
serving as a county commissioner so she could benefit the brothel.
</P>
<P>
   Colletti, 63, insisted that she was unaware of any illegal
activity at the Mustang Ranch, a legal house of prostitution just
east of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm devastated because I'm standing here before you and I've
never done anything wrong. If I'd known it was wrong, I would never
have done it,'' Colletti told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Colletti's lawyers said she was duped into helping Conforte and
pointed to her record of helping the community.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben said he took into
consideration Colletti's public service to Storey County in
settling on the sentence of three years and 10 months, instead of
the maximum of four years and nine months.
</P>
<P>
   McKibben also ordered her to forfeit $200,000 and report to
prison June 5.

<HEADLINE> Army Colonel To Plead Guilty  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Army colonel commanding the military's
anti-drug operation in Colombia knew his wife -- who has admitted
dealing drugs -- was involved in money laundering but failed to turn
her in, prosecutors revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a federal judge, prosecutors said James Hiett,
48, has agreed to plead guilty to ignoring a felony committed by

<HEADLINE> Carolina's Brind'Amour Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Carolina Hurricanes center Rod Brind'Amour
sustained a concussion and was removed from the ice on a stretcher
after being checked into the boards by Pittsburgh's Bob Boughner on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brind'Amour had his head immobilized, but was alert and moving
his arms when he was taken to the Hurricanes' locker room for
evaluation during Pittsburgh's 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brind'Amour might not be able to fly back with the team because
the pressure of high elevations could aggravate the concussion,
coach Paul Maurice said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was knocked out briefly,'' Maurice said. ''We still have to
make the decision on whether he is going to stay here overnight for
more tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice said Brind'Amour was sitting up in the locker room and
was coherent. He said he had not seen the tape of the hit but
speculated that Brind'Amour might have been elbowed in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Boughner, who received a major penalty from referee Dan
Marouelli for boarding and a game misconduct, had both arms up when
he pushed Brind'Amour into the boards late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Brind'Amour, acquired from Philadelphia on Jan. 23, has four
goals and nine assists in 31 games for Carolina. Boughner came to
the Penguins on March 13 from Nashville in an effort to beef up
Pittsburgh's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The penalty to Boughner was real questionable,'' Penguins
coach Herb Brooks said. ''I don't know what Dan's reading on the
thing was, but it wasn't a charge. He didn't hit him from behind.
It was the force in which he took him to the boards that caused
it.''

<HEADLINE> Hail, Winds Rip Through the South  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Hail, heavy rain, high winds and tornadoes
tore through the South early Monday, ripping off roofs, tossing
trees into power lines and apparently forcing a small plane into
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The storms struck from Texas to Georgia, with at least one
storm-related death reported in Alabama. Damage was widespread:
Roofs and power lines broke in or near dozens of cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may have been big tornadoes, they just didn't hit
populated areas,'' said meteorologist Tim Destri of the National
Weather Service office in Slidell, La.
</P>
<P>
   In West Feliciana Parish north of Baton Rouge, Fire Chief Tommy
Boyett said a tornado toppled trees onto 25 to 30 houses.
</P>
<P>
   In the apparent plane crash, the pilot was the only person on
board the single-engine Bonanza BE35, which disappeared from radar
screens south of Cameron in southwestern Louisiana about 6 a.m.
Monday, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard had a boat, plane and
helicopter searching for the man in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Piedmont, Ala., a 90-year-old woman was killed when one of
the storms hit a mobile home park, authorities said, throwing her
home about 130 feet. At least seven people were injured. One person
was hospitalized in stable condition; six were treated and
released. About 20 people left homeless were taken to a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In north Georgia, thunderstorms injured six people, two of them
seriously, and destroyed or damaged dozens of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer and Jamie Guice fled their Cedartown, Ga., mobile home
with their two children, seeking safety in a three-foot culvert
under their driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sky was real black and then it was like the whole ground
shook,'' Jennifer Guice said. ''It was horrible. We were praying.''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Gold Glove center fielder Bernie Williams
will be used as the DH by the New York Yankees until his sore right
triceps muscle feels better, manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee started Monday night's opener against the Anaheim
Angels in center with Shane Spencer in left.

<P>
   ''It isn't the type of thing that's going to get worse, but I

somebody out,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been icing his right shoulder much of the spring
because of what he said was a tired arm, but the new problem is
unrelated, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The triceps has been bothering Williams for about a week, and he
sat out the Yankees' final exhibition game Saturday in San
Francisco.

Judge Rules Against Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Humbling a proud giant of the computer age, a federal
judge ruled today that Microsoft Corp. violated U.S. antitrust laws by keeping
''an oppressive thumb'' on competitors during the race to introduce Americans to
the online world. In a sweeping verdict against the empire that Bill Gates
built, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Microsoft violated the
Sherman Act, the same law used to crush monopolies from Standard Oil to AT&AMP;T. He
concluded that the company was guilty -- as the federal government, 19 states
and the District of Columbia had alleged in a case that began in May 1998 -- of
''unlawfully tying its Web browser'' to its Windows operating system that
dominates the computer market worldwide.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index today,
falling 15] to 90~ as Wall Street anticipated a federal judge's antitrust ruling
against the software company. The plunge in Microsoft set off another stampede
away from technology stocks and sent investors searching for blue-chip issues.
The swing toward financial, retail and drug stocks helped the Dow Jones
industrials soar 300 points. The Nasdaq plunged 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close
at 4,223.68. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history, surpassing

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 7, Twins 0  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Charlie Brown threw out the first pitch, then
Brad Radke really got his socks knocked off.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams homered on the game's first pitch and Fred
McGriff hit a grand slam as Steve Trachsel and the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays beat the Minnesota Twins 7-0 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went 3-for-3 off the Twins' ace, who will subjected to
trade rumors all season after turning down a $24 million offer and
cutting off negotiations with the club that won a major league-low
63 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams almost added a three-run homer off Bob Wells in the
sixth, but settled for a long sacrifice fly instead.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel, who joined the Devil Rays in January after nine
seasons in the Chicago Cubs organization, won his first AL start
after 186 NL starts. He gave up five hits in seven shutout innings
with no walks and seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins opened their 40th season in Minneapolis by paying
tribute to ''Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz, a Minnesota native
who died last month, and Calvin Griffith, who brought the team from
Washington, D.C., in 1961. Griffith died last October.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by Lucy, Linus and Snoopy, Charlie Brown threw out
the ceremonial first pitch, a one-hopper to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Williams stepped up and sent Radke's first pitch, a
shoulder-high fastball, into the left field bleachers before much
of the crowd of 43,830 had settled in.
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Vaughn scored from first despite a strained
quadriceps muscle on John Flaherty's two-out double in the fourth,
things fell apart for Radke in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Radke gave up three straight singles, including a
bunt by Williams and an infield hit by Dave Martinez, before
McGriff sent a low fastball over the right-center field wall for
his sixth career grand slam and first since Sept. 21, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Radke gave up six earned runs on nine hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' sacrifice fly made it 7-0 in the sixth. He sent left
fielder Jacque Jones against the wall for a leaping catch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Vaughn and Trachsel are a few of the free agents the
Devil Rays signed over the winter in hopes of rebounding from a
69-93 season. They also lured pitcher Juan Guzman and third baseman
Vinny Castilla.
Notes: Radke, who made his fifth straight home opening start for
the Twins, surrendered six or more earned runs just three times
last year. ... The Twins will wear Griffith's initials ''CRG'' on
their uniforms all season. Minnesota also brought back the original
''TC'' cap this season. It was worn from 1961-86. ... Devil Rays
reliever Jim Morris struck out Jones, the only batter he faced, to
end the game.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Announces Handguns Regulations  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN McELHENNY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts put the nation's strictest gun
regulations into effect Monday, using consumer-protection rules to
ban cheap ''Saturday night specials'' and require childproof locks
on any gun sold in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state will contact gun manufacturers and sellers within 15
days to inform them of the regulations, which also require safety
warnings with each gun, tamper-resistant serial numbers, and
indicators on semiautomatic handguns that tell if a bullet is in
the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''Massachusetts now has the most comprehensive and toughest gun
laws in the nation,'' said John Rosenthal of Stop Handgun Violence
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Gun Owners' Action League said the new enforcement is
unnecessary because strict federal and state regulations are
already in place.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the Maryland House approved legislation requiring
built-in locks on all new guns sold. The bill has already passed
the Senate, and Gov. Parris Glendening is eager to sign it. No
other state has approved such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening predicted that within 18 months, six to 12 states
will move forward on similar legislation. President Clinton called
Glendening immediately after the vote to congratulate him. The
president said Maryland's success will inspire other states.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the locks would actually embolden criminals who
might have a better chance of taking a victim by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts action came about in an unprecedented legal
maneuver, when then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger wrote the
rules in 1997, bypassing the Legislature. He relied instead on the
attorney general's broad powers to regulate consumer products.
Those powers do not specifically mention guns.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four other states have passed legislation that would
allow them to regulate handguns as they would other consumer
products, but Massachusetts is the first to actually impose such
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas Reilly said investigators will begin
spot checks of gun stores within 15 days. Reilly said he is
applying consumer protection standards to guns, just as the state
already does with toys, automobiles and other products.
</P>
<P>
   The Gun Owners' Action League said that educational programs
sponsored by gun owners have succeeded in significantly reducing
firearms accidents, despite an increase in gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   League spokesman Kevin Sowyrda accused the attorney general of
exploiting the issue to increase his own popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an assault on veterans and an assault on gun owners,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations go further than changes announced last month
by gunmaker Smith &AMP; Wesson. The company, under threat of a federal
lawsuit, agreed to provide external safety locks on all of its
handguns within 60 days and built-in locks within two years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Massachusetts requirements is that serial numbers be
tamper-resistant, either placed inside the gun, such as in the
barrel, or imprinted so that they can be read only with an infrared
detector.
</P>
<P>
   Other requirements include one that the gun have a lock, such as
an attached key-operated lock or a combination lock built into the
gun that blocks the barrel, and another that semiautomatic handguns
have a so-called load indicator, which tells if a bullet is in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in child-proofing mechanism would also be required,
which could include increasing the trigger tension so that it must
be pulled with at least 10 pounds of force, changing the firing
mechanism to make it inoperable for child-sized hands, or requiring
a series of motions to fire the gun.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also ban cheap handguns known as Saturday Night
Specials.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge struck down Harshbarger's rules in 1998.
But the Supreme Judicial Court, the state's highest court, ruled
last June that Harshbarger had acted within his authority when he
''sought to take preventative action as to defective handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   The court returned the case to Superior Court for further
proceedings, and in December it, too, ruled in favor of the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle ended March 20, when the gun industry failed to
meet a deadline for further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, the gun-control advocate who said he owns a handgun
and shoots skeet, said guns rightly should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were talking about hamburgers killing 90 people a year,
do you think we would allow the meatpacking industry to go
unregulated? No way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward L. Veduccio, the owner of E &AMP; J Guns in Newton, said
enforcement would make guns more expensive and cut into the profits
of his four-person business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you know how many gun companies won't sell here? They're
boycotting the state, and that's hurting business,'' he said. ''If
a customer wants a particular firearm, I can't get it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Veduccio said he knows of a few Massachusetts gun store owners
who have already moved their shops to New Hampshire. He said he has
already scouted out sites for his own shop, after 33 years in
Newton.

Judge Rules Against Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Humbling a proud giant of the computer age, a federal
judge ruled today that Microsoft Corp. violated U.S. antitrust laws by keeping
''an oppressive thumb'' on competitors during the race to introduce Americans to
the online world. In a sweeping verdict against the empire that Bill Gates
built, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Microsoft violated the
Sherman Act, the same law used to crush monopolies from Standard Oil to AT&AMP;T. He
concluded that the company was guilty -- as the federal government, 19 states
and the District of Columbia had alleged in a case that began in May 1998 -- of
''unlawfully tying its Web browser'' to its Windows operating system that
dominates the computer market worldwide.

Nasdaq Drops 349.15 on Microsoft News

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft devastated the Nasdaq composite index today,
falling 15] to 90~ as Wall Street anticipated a federal judge's antitrust ruling
against the software company. The plunge in Microsoft set off another stampede
away from technology stocks and sent investors searching for blue-chip issues.
The swing toward financial, retail and drug stocks helped the Dow Jones
industrials soar 300 points. The Nasdaq plunged 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close
at 4,223.68. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history, surpassing
a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Phil Housley scored the tying goal with 6:52 left
as the Calgary Flames rallied from a two-goal third-period deficit
Monday night for a 2-2 tie with the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The point helped the 10th-place Flames in their longshot pursuit
of the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shantz broke up the bid of Stars backup goalie Manny
Fernandez for his second career shutout. Shantz scored on a
power-play deflection at 8:27 of the final period to narrow Dallas'
lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Housley got the Flames even on a fluke goal from the right
corner when his centering pass went into the net off Fernandez's
stick. Fernandez played in place of Ed Belfour, who was being
rested.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Brett Hull scored his 610th career goal to tie his
father, Bobby, for ninth place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Hull blasted a one-timer past Calgary goalie Fred Brathwaite at
7:29 of the second period on a power play to give the Stars a 2-0
lead. Hull has 24 goals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hull played for Chicago from 1957-58 to 1971-72 and also
played in the NHL with Winnipeg and Hartford in 1979-80. He scored
303 goals with Winnipeg in the World Hockey Association from

</P>
<P>
   The Hulls are the only father-son combination in league history

</P>
<P>
   Modano got the only goal of the first period at 6:09, scoring
his 38th from the top of the circle on a power play. Modano has 22

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately Tuesday morning amid
political uncertainty in Japan. The dollar edged higher against the
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 104.91 points,
or 0.51 percent, to 20,622.08 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Monday, the average closed up 389.67 points, or 1.92
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.94 yen in late morning, up 0.08 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
104.85 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock exchange, traders said investors remained cautious
of the possibility that the Cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
who remains in a coma after suffering a stroke, will resign in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
   In a regular news conference Tuesday morning, Mikio Aoki,
Japan's chief Cabinet secretary and acting prime minister, said the
Cabinet has yet to decide whether it will resign and nominate a
successor to Obuchi. Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal
Democratic Party, is viewed as the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese media said the resignation of the Cabinet could happen
as early as Tuesday and a new Cabinet could be installed by the end
of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a wait-and-see stance by investors,'' said
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Prices started lower Tuesday on profit-taking following recent
gains. Investors in Tokyo were also discouraged by declines in U.S.
high technology stocks on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 9.00 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,723.45.
The TOPIX closed up 26.51 points, or 1.55 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 349.15 points
to close at 4,223.68. It was the Nasdaq's worst point drop in
history, surpassing a 229-point fall on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was higher against the yen in
narrow trading amid continued concern of another central bank
intervention to stem any drop by the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese importers and U.S. and Canadian banks were among early
players who bought the greenback after Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa reiterated his determination to be ready to take action
against the yen's excessive upsurge.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that Japan is
ready to take necessary action to contain disruptive foreign
exchange moves.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened in the market to weaken
the yen, whose recent rise has alarmed Japanese financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese finance authorities have intervened several times this
year to stem gains by the yen, which make Japanese exports more
expensive overseas, and thus less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.36 yen, up from
100.14 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7900 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8050 percent. Its price
rose 0.13 point to 100.94.

<HEADLINE> MSU's Peterson Stars in Title Game  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Morris Peterson did this for his
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Heartbroken when he learned Clara Mae Spencer died on March 25,
the Michigan State senior flew to Mississippi for her funeral, then
returned for the Final Four. He wrote her name on his sneakers, a
private memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scored 20 points in the semifinal against Wisconsin and
then another 21 in Monday night's 89-76 win over Florida for the
national championship. He also had two rebounds, five assists and a
steal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know she is with me on the court,'' he had said last
weekend. ''I can feel her presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's performance capped a big NCAA tournament for the
fifth-year senior, who came back for this game, this night, this
national championship. He was a huge presence in the Midwest
Regional, scoring 21 points against Syracuse, 18 against Iowa State
and helping Michigan State dominate the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the funeral and his emotional return.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was one of Michigan State's trio of Flintstones, who
grew up with Charlie Bell and Mateen Cleaves in the industrial city
of Flint, playing on concrete courts and becoming buddies.
Together, they went to East Lansing, determined to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Peterson helped Michigan State to the Final Four,
but the Spartans lost to Duke in the semifinals. He could have left
after that, but stayed for one more shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a matter of wanting to be around the Spartan family,''
he said. ''These guys are like brothers to me. We come from a
background where education is important. There was never any doubt.
We talked about winning a national championship together.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night, that's exactly what they did.

<HEADLINE> INS, Elian's Miami Kin Negotiate  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department cleared the way Monday
night for Juan Miguel Gonzalez to travel to the United States so he
can pursue his quest to be reunited with his son Elian, as
negotiations continued between immigration officials and the boy's
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The department granted the senior Gonzalez's visa request along
with those of his wife, infant son and Elian's male cousin,
kindergarten teacher and pediatrician. The visas for the six could
be issued as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans' request for 22 other visas -- to Elian's classmates
as well as National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, a top aide
to Cuban President Fidel Castro, was still being reviewed. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. diplomats in Havana
will submit lists of questions to the Cuban government concerning
these requests to determine the merits of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the custody issues recessed Monday night
without any word on whether any progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Diaz, attorney for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, said,
''We continue to be first and foremost concerned about the mental,
psychological well-being of this young 6-year-old. To that extent
we have spent a lot of time talking about numerous issues and we
will be back tomorrow to continue our conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the family's Miami house, Elian and two cousins played
on a slide. They hid behind a blue tarp hung in front of the slide
and teased photographers by pretending to shoot at them with toy
guns.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 protesters gathered in front of the home, some waving
signs like ''Miss Reno are you ready for another Waco? We are.''
and ''Clinton Coward, Reno Witch, Fidel Loco.'' Reno was a
reference to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had said earlier it
would end the Miami relatives' custody of Elian on Tuesday morning
if they did not agree to give him up if they lose an appeal of a
federal court decision they lost last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations shifted Monday to how to reunite Elian with
his father when he arrives in this country. ''Tuesday's deadline
has been superseded by this change of issues,'' a Justice
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father,'' said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ''The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father, but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wallis, the Immigration Service's director for the Miami
district, said late Monday, ''Revocation of Elian's parole tomorrow
has been superseded by the expected arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez
in the United States. Once Mr. Gonzalez comes, the INS will begin
transferring parole care from Lazaro Gonzalez to the boy's
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallis added that the transfer of temporary custody ''does not
mean that the child will be immediately removed from the home of
the great uncle. Instead it is our hope to begin a smooth and
orderly process that will create as little disruption as possible
to Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Miami relatives, Kendall Coffey said the family
will propose to the government on Tuesday that three independent
child pyschologists be appointed to examine Elian and determine if
it would be best for him to remain in the United States or be sent
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has not seen his son since the boy was
rescued off the Florida coast more than four months ago. The child
has become the target of an impassioned international custody
fight.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family would stay at the home of Cuba's chief
diplomat in Washington, Fernando Remirez, who lives in an upscale
suburban Maryland neighborhood. Remirez, his wife and two children
will vacate the house to make room for the visitors from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A government official who requested anonymity said there is a
possibility that Juan Miguel will travel from Washington to Miami
to pick up his son but not necessarily to the home of Lazaro
Gonzalez, the great-uncle with whom Elian has been staying.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez said Monday night, ''If the father comes or not
we don't know, but he is welcome here. Don't ever doubt the
Gonzalez family has their door open for their family''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the great uncle's home, protesters practiced forming a
human chain and vowed they would stop at nothing to keep the boy
from returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would have to go over the bodies of all of us Cubans who
are here,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 70, who is not related to the boy.
''They would have to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez is appealing a federal judge's ruling that
affirms an INS order to return the boy to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Miami family members have said they will abide by any government
ruling, insisting only that the transition take Elian's
psychological well-being into account.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was rescued off the Florida coast on Thanksgiving after
spending 50 hours alone on an inner tube. His mother and 10 others
died in their attempt to flee Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian spent part of Monday playing with a pet rabbit in the back
yard of Lazaro Gonzalez's home, while in front protesters practiced
forming a human chain, sitting on the ground with their arms
linked.
</P>
<P>
   Many protesters stomped their feet as Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader
of the Miami-based anti-Castro group Democracy Movement, used a
bullhorn to call for Cuban-Americans to come to the home to protect
Elian. The Miami area has nearly 800,000 Cuban-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush met with safety officials to determine how
to respond to possible unrest if Elian is removed from the Little
Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas' statement last
week that local authorities would not assist the federal government
if it attempted to remove Elian, the county police department said
it is ready to respond to protests.

<HEADLINE> Returning Seniors Carried Spartans  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mateen Cleaves and the rest of Michigan
State's tournament-tested seniors weren't satisfied with reaching
the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans lost in the semifinals last year, and Cleaves and
forward Morris Peterson passed up a chance to leave early for the
NBA for an opportunity to get that elusive NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   They got it Monday night with a 89-76 victory over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who left briefly in the second half with a sprained
ankle, had 18 points and was named the tourney MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State started Cleaves, Peterson, senior A.J. Granger
and juniors Andre Hutson and Charlie Bell. The last time three
seniors started for one team in the championship game was in 1995,
when Ed O'Bannon, George Zidek and Tyus Edney started for winner
UCLA and Elmer Martin, Clint McDaniel and Corey Beck started for
runner-up Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our experience definitely got us to this point,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Spartans coach Tom Izzo was glad Cleaves and Peterson returned
for their final season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what Mateen has done, he has made people realize that
college is fun, and I appreciated the (former Michigan State)
players that came back to tell him to stay. I didn't tell him
anything like that. I told him he's got to do what's best for him,
but I think in the future -- I know for Michigan State -- it will
have an impact on people.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NERVOUS? NOT A CHANCE: Mateen Cleaves' mother appeared to be
praying from her seat in the stands, across the court from the
Spartans bench. And that was even before he left the game with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do that off and on during the game because I don't want any
of the kids to get hurt. But I'm real confident this is our game.
We deserve it,'' Frances Cleaves said at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Her concern was justified.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Mateen injured his ankle -- the same
foot he broke before the season started -- and missed just over four
minutes while he had it taped in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw her son come back onto the court, Frances Cleaves
said, she thought, ''Thank you, Lord. I knew if there was any way
possible for him to come back, he would, because that's the kind of
kid he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' mother, who lives in Flint, Mich., said she attended
every game he played throughout high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EVEN-YEAR STREAK: Florida's loss ended a streak of NCAA
champions from the Southeastern Conference in every even-numbered
year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas won the title in 1994 and Kentucky was the champion in
1996 and 1998. Florida beat Arkansas and split a pair of games with
Kentucky this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gators coach Billy Donovan, 34, was trying to become the
third-youngest coach to win an NCAA crown. The youngest was
Indiana's Branch McCracken, who was 31 in 1940, when the Hoosiers
won the first of their five NCAA championships; and Wisconsin's
Harold Foster, was 34 in 1941, the last time the Badgers reached
the Final Four before this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fortunate to be around a lot of good coaches and a
lot of good people throughout my life. But I don't look at myself
as being maybe a new-breed coach,'' said Donovan, who played on the
Rick Pitino-coached Providence team that reached the Final Four in
1987. ''I think people maybe say that because of my being 34 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ALMOST AUTOMATIC: Florida's Kenyan Weaks, the team's only
senior, missed as many free throws in the semifinals as he did all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Gators' semifinal against North Carolina, Weaks
was 52-for-55 (.945) from the foul line but was just 1-for-4 in 18
minutes off the bench on Saturday. He did not attempt a free throw
in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State's Morris Peterson made his first 18 free throws
in the tournament before missing late in the first half. He
finished with 21 points, including 4-of-6 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SECOND MATCHUP: The championship game Monday night was the
second time Michigan State played Florida in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The only other meeting was on Dec. 30, 1987, when Florida beat
Michigan State 83-59 at the Fiesta Bowl Classic in Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   They also played this year in football, with the Spartans
winning 37-34 in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STRONG FINISHES: In the regular season, Michigan State used
quick starts for an average halftime advantage of more than 10
points, double their average margin for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was reversed in the tournament, however, with strong
second halves making the difference for the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Through six tournament games, Michigan outscored its opponents
by a combined 17 points in the first half but by 75 points after
the break.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HIGH SCORING: The 89 points by Michigan State were the most in
a championship game since UCLA's 89-78 victory over Arkansas in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The combined 49.6 percent shooting by Michigan State and Florida
was the best in a title game since Kansas and Oklahoma combined for
.520 in 1988.

Judge Rules Against Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Monday that Microsoft Corp. violated
U.S. antitrust laws by keeping ''an oppressive thumb'' on competitors during the
race to link Americans to the Internet -- a sweeping verdict against the empire
that Bill Gates built. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
Microsoft violated the Sherman Act, the same law used to crush monopolies from
Standard Oil to AT&AMP;T. He concluded that the company was guilty of ''unlawfully
tying its Web browser'' to its Windows operating system that dominates the
computer market worldwide.

Nasdaq Drops 349.15; Dow Up 300
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index was devastated Monday -- a victim
of the Microsoft verdict -- falling 15] to 90~ as Wall Street anticipated a
federal judge's antitrust ruling against the software company. The stampede away
from technology stocks sent investors searching for blue-chip issues, and gains
by financial, retail and drug stocks helped the Dow Jones industrials soar 300
points. The Nasdaq plunged 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close at 4,223.68. It was
the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history.

Visa OK'd for Elian's Father
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As negotiations continued between immigration officials
and Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives, a visa was approved for the Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to travel to the United States so he can pursue his quest to be
reunited with his son. The department also granted visa requests for his wife,
infant son and Elian's male cousin, kindergarten teacher and pediatrician. The
visas for the six could be issued as early as tomorrow.

Japanese Prime Minister in Coma
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was on life support Tuesday after a
stroke, leaving the Japanese government to grapple with a leadership crisis and
the possibility of dissolving the Cabinet and finding a successor. There was
also growing anger over the delays by the government in reporting Obuchi's
illness to the public. As Obuchi's family assembled at the Tokyo hospital where
he has been since Sunday, acting Prime Minister Mikio Aoki called a Cabinet
meeting for Tuesday amid speculation that politicians were moving quickly to
name a successor.

Mass. Announces Strict Gun Laws
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts put the nation's strictest gun regulations into
effect Monday, using consumer-protection rules to ban cheap ''Saturday night
specials'' and require childproof locks on any gun sold in the state. The state
will contact gun manufacturers and sellers within 15 days to inform them of the
regulations, which also require safety warnings with each gun, tamper-resistant
serial numbers, and indicators on semiautomatic handguns that tell if a bullet
is in the chamber. Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening predicted that within 18
months, six to 12 states will move forward on similar legislation.

Bosnian Arrested for War Crimes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- French NATO troops arrested the most senior
Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect to date Monday, sweeping into the Serb
stronghold of Pale in a pre-dawn raid that galvanized the crusade to bring the
architects of the Balkans' ''ethnic cleansing'' campaigns to justice. Momcilo
Krajisnik, a close ally of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was
arrested at his home by troops who witnesses said forced open his door.
Krajisnik is charged with every war crime on the Yugoslav tribunal's statute,
including genocide.

Hail, Winds Rip Through the South
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Hail, heavy rain, high winds and tornadoes tore through
the South early Monday, ripping off roofs, tossing trees into power lines and
apparently forcing a small plane into the Gulf of Mexico. The storms struck from
Texas to Georgia, with at least one storm-related death reported in Alabama.
Damage was widespread: Roofs and power lines broke in or near dozens of cities
and towns.

Tokyo Stocks Fall

   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell moderately on profit-taking in reaction to
recent sharp gains and political uncertainty after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
