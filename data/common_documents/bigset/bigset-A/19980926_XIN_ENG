<HEADLINE> Kissinger Backs Clinton's Policy Despite Sex Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Henry Kissinger, former
U.S. secretary of state, said Friday he stands by President Bill
Clinton's foreign policy despite the president's recent sex
scandal that is threatening his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, here for an international economic forum sponsored
by the U.S.-based Fortune magazine, made the remarks after a
meeting with Hungarian President Goncz Arpad.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made no comment on Clinton's sex scandal, saying he
was perhaps "the only American" who had been silent about whether
Clinton ought to be legally held responsible for the sex scandal
involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
However, the former top diplomat who served from 1973 to 1977
under the administration of President Richard Nixon, said he had
also experienced similar hardships on the American political arena.
</P>
<P>
After the public release of Clinton's videotaped testimony made
to a grand jury, opinion polls showed that most Americans oppose
the impeachment of their president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans intended to bring a formal inquiry of
impeachment to the floor of the House of Representatives within
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
When referring to the worsening situation in Kosovo, Kissinger
said he hoped the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should not
take military actions against the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council has been urging the warring
sides in Kosovo for a political solution to the conflict,
threatening the use of force if the tension persists.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Sees Normal Life After Threat Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The author of the Satanic
Verses, Salman Rushdie, said Friday he was delighted to be free
and could resume a normal life after nearly 10 years' hiding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Rushdie said he was very
"grateful to the British government which seems to have negotiated
very toughly and at great length -- I must say I did not know it
was going on."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government announced Thursday it would dissociate
itself from the fatwa, or religious edict, as "a serious and bold
action" that had removed a "dreadful terrorist threat."
</P>
<P>
The fatwa against Rushdie for blaspheming Islam in his book The
Satanic Verses, issued by the late Iranian revolutionary leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989, has cast a long shadow over
relations between Iran and the West. The British and Iranian
governments have now agreed to re-establish full diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie also paid tribute to the book's translators who were
either murdered or suffered assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to say that I am sorrowful for all the people who
have died in demonstrations against The Satanic Verses,
particularly in the subcontinent -- indeed I feel in many cases
they did not even know what they were demonstrating against," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie praised the work of the UK government and said he had
come to learn that freedom of speech is worth fighting for.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said, "These assurances should
make possible a much more constructive relationship between the
United Kingdom, and I believe the European Union, with Iran and
the opening of a new chapter in our relations."
</P>
<P>
Rushdie said the experience had taught him a lot about free
speech.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Satanic Verses is an important part of my work as
a writer. I can't imagine the body of my work without any of my
books in it."
</P>
<P>
"I've had an extraordinary education in the importance in
fighting for the freedom of imagination, the freedom of the arts
and the generalized issue of freedom of speech," he said.

NICOSIA -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has called on
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to return to the negotiating
table to find a settlement to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the call in New York Thursday at a
gathering on "the Cyprus Question: Prospects for a Settlement,"
organized by the U.S. organization, the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy, Cyprus News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president is currently in New York to attend the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that "I will be calling on Denktash to come and
join me to work together on a solution based within the parameters
of the U.N., which will be beneficial to both communities."
</P>
<P>
He also gave his full support for contacts between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots, especially the youth, noting that the lack of
contact creates serious problems and is not a healthy basis for
the future federation.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has banned bicommunal contacts since last December
following the European Union (EU) decision to start accession
talks with the Clerides-led Cypriot government in March.

CANBERRA -- The Australian Labor Party (ALP) has taken a
potentially decisive lead over the coalition of the Liberal and
National parties, with Opposition Leader Kim Beazley clearly
out-campaigning Prime Minister John Howard, the major polls this

As the election campaign enters its final week, the average of
the four polls over the past week showed support for ALP climbing
for the second week in a row to 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Support for the coalition, meanwhile, fell for the first time
since the election was called on August 30, to 40.4 percent, a 1.7
 point margin.

<HEADLINE> OECD Endorses U.N. Call for Action in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) supports the call by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for action in Africa, Annan said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the annual ministerial meeting of the
Group of 77 here.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with the representatives of the donor countries
grouped in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee Wednesday,
the latter "uniformly and strongly" endorsed his call, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The priority areas emphasized by Annan are:
</P>
<P>
-- to increase the volume and improve the quality of official
development assistance to Africa,
</P>
<P>
-- to convert all remaining official debt owned by the poorest
African countries into grants,
</P>
<P>
-- to liberalize access to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
initiative,
</P>
<P>
-- to open markets to, and ease terms of access for, African
exports, and
</P>
<P>
-- to encourage investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since there are some very poor countries in other continents,
the task of the international community is to make efforts for
poverty eradication not only in Africa but also in the
developing world as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan's proposals were included in his report on Africa
presented to the U.N. General Assembly in April.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, IMF to Continue Talks Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and Pakistan will continue their talks next week in
Washington on providing financial support to the country which is
facing a serious economic crisis, the IMF's representative in
Pakistan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission has held "comprehensive" policy discussions
with the Pakistani government, the IMF's resident representative
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It said the Pakistani government, while operating under a
difficult economic environment and severe balance of payments
constraints, had succeeded in maintaining low inflation and a
buoyant outlook for agricultural sector growth.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the Pakistani government has undertaken a
significant adjustment effort by reinforcing fiscal policy and
maintaining monetary discipline, it said.
</P>
<P>
Given the need to improve the balance of payments growth
prospects, the IMF mission endorses the government's strategy to
strengthen further the stance of financial policies and move
decisively on a broad range of structural reforms, it said.
</P>
<P>
Discussions for the second review under the extended
arrangement and second annual arrangement under a soft loan
program to Pakistan will be continued next week in Washington with
Pakistani delegations to the Annual Meetings of the Board of
Governors of the IMF and the World Bank, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Georges Lashes Southern Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Georges lashed
the Florida Keys Friday morning, sending waves crashing onto
streets and knocking out power, TV and other media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Shelters and hotels from Miami to Orlando filled up after more
than 1 million people from Key West to Tampa were urged or
ordered to leave coastal and low-lying areas and mobile homes
before the storm came.
</P>
<P>
The storm, having killed more than 300 people in the Caribbean,
was expected to attack the northern Gulf coast after it leaves
southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
A hail of leaves, branches and palm fronds blew across the
Overseas Highway in Marathon, in the middle Keys, and strong wind
lifted rainwater off roofs. Some 150,000 people lost power as the
edges of the storm lashed the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas.
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. EDT, Georges' eye was about 25 kilometers south of
Key West. The eye was expected to pass west of Key West by late
morning and the storm was expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
A hurricane warning was posted for the Keys and the Gulf Coast
north to Longboat Key. The coast from Longboat Key to Bayport was
under a tropical storm warning.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 members of the National Guard were ordered to be
ready for hurricane assignments. Four C-130 cargo aircraft were
reserved to fly troops to the Keys for post-storm security.
</P>
<P>
The storm landed the Keys area shortly before sunset Thursday.
Wind and rain became more steady and rendered 4,000 people without
power.
</P>
<P>
Georges is the first major hurricane to hit southern Florida
since Andrew, which caused 25 billion U.S. dollars damage in the
state in 1992 and killed 26 people.

LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government Friday
expressed the hope that it would promote its bilateral cooperation
with Iran following the formalization of relations between the two
countries.
</P>

British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio early

Cook noted that Britain had a lot of "common interests" with
Iran, including stopping of the drugs trade from Afghanistan,
which is said to be the source of 90 percent of the heroin
imported into Britain.
</P>
<P>
Cook also stressed that Britain would work with Iran to enforce
international sanctions against Iraq by preventing Iraq from using
the waters of the Gulf to try to evade international sanctions
imposed on Iraqi oil.

</P>
<P>
The British government will carry out an extensive information

and economy.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Arab Academy of Financial and Banking Sciences
will hold its eighth annual conference in Cairo on November 17-19.
</P>

markets and institutions in promoting investments.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is expected to sign agreements in the near
future with Bahrain and Kuwait on setting up two free trade zones,
the Al Akhbar daily said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is discussing the same issue with Syria, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, Turkey and Canada, and holding talks on concluding free
trade agreements with Switzerland, Norway and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water is ready

<HEADLINE> Global Action Urged to Stem Illegal Flow of Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Friday called for global action to stem "the flow and use of small
arms as primary instruments of violence and armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Small Arms Special Information Session held here
Friday, Jayantha Dhanapala, under-secretary-general for
disarmament affairs, said that sustained efforts should be also
made to achieve clear understanding and widely shared objectives.
</P>
<P>
The global efforts include strict state control over the flow
of small arms into the conflict-torn areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that armed conflicts are regrettably a part of the
human landscape rather than aberrations of history," he said. "And
yet, most of the present day conflicts are somewhat unique."
</P>
<P>
One characteristic of this uniqueness lies in an interface
between crime, violence, adversarial politics and irregular
warfare as a mode of combat for mostly internal conflicts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The abundant and ready supply of (being) easy to use tools of
conflict is another characteristic," he said. "A still more
telling characteristic is the relative absence of legitimate state
control over the tools used in most of current conflicts and over
the purposes of which these conflicts are fought."
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. role in this global effort, he said, "After it took
the lead in placing the issue of small arms on the global agenda,
the United Nations has become a central forum for generating
better public understanding of the direct consequences of the use
of small arms."
</P>
<P>
In defining those objectives, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said emphatically in his latest report on Africa to the Security
Council, "For the United Nations, there is no higher goal, no
deeper commitment and no greater ambition than preventing armed
conflict."

ATHENS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ioannis Georgakopoulos, the
former first deputy police chief, was appointed Friday by the
Greek government Council of Foreign Affairs and Defense to the
position of the new chief of police.
</P>
<P>
Georgakopoulos is one of the police officers injured in
Wednesday night's raid on an escaped Romanian criminal holding
three hostages in central Athens.
</P>
<P>
Athanasios Vasilopoulos, the former police chief, was removed
from the post Thursday after the failed operation to handle the
hostage crisis which left 12 people injured, including three
seriously.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said after a four-hour cabinet meeting that the failed operation
proved the police's inability to effectively combat criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
He added that it had also created serious concerns in Greek
society about security and the role of the police.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Friday that he welcomes the decision of the Group
of 77 developing countries to hold the South Summit in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said this at the annual ministerial meeting of the group
which opened here.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure it will produce many valuable ideas, and I trust you
will choose a date early enough for those ideas to feed into the
Millennium Assembly," referring to his proposal for a U.N.
Assembly in September 2000 to deal with the challenges in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the G-77's "constructive involvement has been crucial
to the success of United Nations reform."
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial crisis, the secretary-general said the
U.N. has a responsibility to stress the global nature of the
crisis and to insist on the need for global solutions based on
global rules fair to all.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has to find best ways to protect those left behind and
victimized by globalization, with an aim of poverty eradication,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that industrialized countries make greater efforts
to ensure that their markets are fully and genuinely opean to
exports from developing countries," Annan noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consulate in Hamburg Under Heavy Guard Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consulate in the
northern German port city of Hamburg has been put under heavy
guard since Thursday after German police said they have received
information from a "serious source" indicating an imminent
terrorist attack on the building.
</P>
<P>
Armored vehicles and more than 100 police officers have been
deployed around the clock to seal off the surrounding area and
protect the consulate.
</P>
<P>
Police also placed some big sand-loaded containers in some
streets near the building to block possible car bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that nothing suspicious had been found
around the consulate building until Friday morning, but the
security measures would remain in place at least until Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hamburg police said that the warning about a possible revenge
attack on the U.S. consulate was being taken "very seriously"
after the arrest last week in the southern German state of Bavaria
of a top aide of Osama bin Laden, who is suspected of having
orchestrated the bombings last month of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Over 260 people were killed and thousands wounded in the two
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, who was traveling on a Sudanese
passport, was arrested on September 16 by German police while
visiting a friend near the Bavarian town of Freisling.
</P>
<P>
He has been identified by U.S. authorities as the top financial
accountant and weapons procurer for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
German authorities have urged Washington to accelerate an
extradition of Salim as soon as possible for fear of possible
terrorist reprisals.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Vice-Premier Decides to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's newly-appointed
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin announced his decision to
resign Friday evening, considering the appointment of Mikhail
Zadornov as finance minister as a "political mistake."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the president's
administration head Valentin Yumashev had already been informed of
Shokhin's resignation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin said, "The key posts in the government are held by the
people who have already deceived the country by declaring it
bankrupt in an especially cynical manner, by violating the Russian
laws."
</P>
<P>
In the process of new Cabinet formation, Shokhin repeatedly
objected to the appointment of Zadornov, who was finance minister
in the Sergei Kiriyenko's government, to the post again.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin insists that all high-level officials involved in
drafting the August 17 statement by the government and the Central
Bank, including Zadornov, should step down because the move
triggered a financial and economic crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Describing Zadornov as a "professional," the deputy prime
minister noted that "he has not demonstrated his professional
skills over the past month."
</P>
<P>
Shokhin did not rule out the possibility of returning to the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov was just appointed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
with another nine new ministers Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, first deputy speaker of the State Duma Vladimir
Ryzhkov hailed Zadornov's appointment, saying Zadornov is one of
the most professional members of the old government.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for World Summit on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Friday asked the
U.N. General Assembly to consider a call by President Hosni
Mubarak to convene an international summit under the auspices of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came when Egyptian Foreign Minister Amre Moussa
was addressing the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to start
working towards the convening of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The summit should lead and direct the international community
to deal with terrorism legally, economically and technologically,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian call was supported in the final communique of a
recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement at Durban, South Africa.
U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan said that the proposed summit needs to
be seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak put forward the proposal following the August
7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Washington later
responded with missile strikes on alleged terrorist targets in
Afghanistan and Sudan. The U.S. unilateral move was lashed out by
countries during the general debate of the current General
Assembly session.

BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Friday urged Belgrade to comply with the U.N. Security
Council resolution on Kosovo, and said it would face NATO military
attacks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Bonn, Kinkel stressed that it was now
up to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop military
attacks in Kosovo and to open a dialogue on an autonomy for the
Kosovo-Albanian majority in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the adoption of the U.N. Security Council
resolution on the Kosovo issue and the NATO decision to prepare
for possible air strikes in Kosovo had sent a clear message to
Belgrade that if it still refused to comply with U.N. and NATO
decisions and continued to reject a political solution to the
Kosovo conflict, it must take military consequences.
</P>
<P>
The German Defense Ministry said Friday that Bonn was prepared
to contribute 14 Tornado fighter jets to a possible NATO military
intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said that he expected
broad support from the German parliament for the German
participation in such an operation.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Majority of Greeks Have Positive Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Greeks had a
positive opinion about the banking system around the country,
according to a survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in March among 2,000 people, aged
18-75, from the general public and 700 businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 75 percent of respondents said that they
were happy or very happy with the service provided by their main
bank, with only 13 percent saying that they were not at all happy.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three percent of Greeks said that they were satisfied
with the operation of the country's banking system, while 19
percent had a negative opinion.
</P>
<P>
The reasons given for dissatisfaction with banks were high
lending rates, low interest on deposit accounts and long queues in
banks.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that 37 percent of Greeks were in favor
of a single European currency with 17 percent against but that 46
percent could not answer.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that Greeks lacked information on the euro
and only five in 10 knew about the single currency. Greece's aim
is to join the euro on January 1, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Foreign Minister on U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre Moussa Friday rejected any attempt at a partial
or selective expansion of the Security Council membership.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister made the statement when he was addressing
the 53rd General Assembly session. He paid tribute to the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, for his ideas and initiatives for
the reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt at a partial or selective expansion of the
membership of the Security Council is unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
In defining the Egyptian position on the U.N. reform, the
foreign minister underlined "the need to deal with the questions
of the reform of the working methods of the Security Council and
the expansion of its membership within an integral framework."
</P>
<P>
He said that his government stands by "the increase of the
Security Council membership by no less than 11 members and the
allocation of a number of permanent seats for developing countries
with strict observance of the principle of equitable geographical
distribution and equality of states."
</P>
<P>
"There can be no predetermined time frame to complete the
process of restructuring the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a regional power in the Middle East, was said to seek a
permanent seat in the Security Council, which currently groups
five permanent members and 10 non-permanent ones, in the process
of the reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Egypt is committed to a decision adopted at the
summit of the Organization of African Unity in Harrari, Zimbabwe,
in 1997, he said. The decision was about the allocation of five
non-permanent seats and two permanent seats for the African
continent to be rotated in accordance with agreed criteria of the
African group.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. reform remains a highly sensitive and most difficult
issue, and the reform of the Security Council is a very critical
part of the proposed reform. Kofi Annan, the U.N.
secretary-general, hammered out a reform program, including
streamlining the world body, about three months after he took
office in January 1997.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great
importance to the role of the Group of 77 in the multilateral
economic field, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual ministerial meeting of the group, he
called it a staunch defender of the collective interests of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding 34 years ago, it has made unremitting
efforts to promote international economic cooperation and change
the unfair international economic order, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is a growingly pressing task for developing countries to
promote international economic cooperation as economic
globalization has brought about formidable challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, developed countries are vigorously promoting the
introduction of new "rules of game" in the trade, investment,
environment and other fields, and once the rules are instituted,
they "will have a significant and far-reaching impact on the
economic development of all countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is the first Chinese foreign minister to attend such
a G-77 meeting, said, "China will never change its fundamental
guiding principle of strengthening and developing solidarity and
cooperation with developing countries."

<HEADLINE> Angola's Daily Oil Output Hits 735,000 Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola's daily crude output
hit 735,000 barrels in the first half of this year. With the
discovery of new fields, its daily output is expected to reach
one million barrels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the daily output of this oil-rich south African
country registered 713,583 barrels, with 664,312 barrels
exported, according to the latest issue of the Energy quarterly.
</P>
<P>
The total export in 1997 was 7.4 million barrels more than
that of 1996. The increase is attributed to the fact that some
new oil fields in the northern enclave of Cabinda Province went
into production, while other onshore fields in the lower Congo
Basin resumed production.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the lower international oil prices, the average
per barrel price for Angola's petroleum exported through the
State Petroleum Corporation was only 18.54 U.S. Dollars, about
1.78 Dollars down from the 1996 price.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, despite the remarkable increase in output in 1997,
there was little growth in the country's revenue from petroleum
production.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov called the resignation of Vice-Premier Alexander Shokhin
a "whim of demarche," the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin has just made a statement about
his resignation because of the appointment of Mikhail Zadornov as
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said, "I think this move is irresponsible, especially
in such a crucial moment for the country, the government and the
president who did Shokhin the honour by appointing him to the
post."
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed prime minister said he and his colleagues
took this whim of demarche calmly. He is confident that Shokhin's
demarche will not weaken the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure that it will not weaken the government which soon
will be finally formed and which is already busy with real work,"
Primakov stressed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Friday appointed 10 new
ministers, including Finance Minister Zadornov, who was also
finance minister in the Kiriyenko government.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin insisted that all high-level officials involved in
drafting the August 17 statement by the government and the Central
Bank, including Zadornov, should step down because the move
triggered a financial and economic crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Shokhin considered the appointment of Zadornov again as finance
minister as "a political mistake."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, head of the Russian Federal Securities
Commission Dmitri Vasilyev has also submitted his resignation at
the same reason as Shokhin, the Interfax new agency quoted the
commission's press service as reporting Friday.

KAMPALA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Recent arrests in the
capital and other parts of the country are for the security of
every Ugandan regardless of tribe and religion, a Ugandan senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade
and Industry Moses Ali made the statement when addressing a
congregation of muslims who attended Juma prayers here.
</P>
<P>
Moses Ali advised the parents to
talk to their children on the dangers of joining the rebel
activities, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
He warned the muslims non-governmental organizations operating
in Uganda to always concentrate on their programs other than
posing any threat to the security of the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of muslims who are considered as fundamentalists have
been arrested recently, setting afloat a rumor that the Ugandan
police target muslims only.
</P>
<P>
The wives of some of those arrested are reported to have gone
to demand that the government should release their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Since bombings in Kenyan capital Nairobi and Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam on August 7, the Ugandan authorities have beefed up
security in Kampala and some other areas which they think can be
targeted.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, three bombs planted under buses went off in
Uganda, killing 30 people and injuring many others.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the bombings, some embassies and United Nations
agencies have to suspend their operations temporarily after
receiving bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Security Muruli Mukasa told reporters
Thursday that 18 suspects have recently been arrested for
planning to plant bombs to blow off the U.S. embassy here, the
Post Office, the Bank of Uganda and a big market.
</P>
<P>
They are said to have planned to plant the bombs at the same
time of the Nairobi bombing. Fortunately, Ugandan security
personnel detected their plot and arrested them in time.

BUCHAREST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said Friday that the Petrotel refinery, recently
purchased by the Russian LUKoil company, is a type of private
companies the Romanian state would like to encourage, since these
are the future.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the Cotroceni presidential palace after
meeting a delegation of LUKoil, the most powerful Russian company
in the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu said that LUKoil has rapidly
modernized the Romanian refinery with high-tech devices. The head

Saturday.
</P>
<P>
LUKoil made its presence in Romania felt only at the beginning
of this year, but it has bought the Petrotel refinery, upgraded it
and rehired 3,000 Romanian workers, keeping the Romanian
management, the president added.
</P>
<P>
In February, LUKoil purchased the majority share package of
Petrotel with an investment of 300 million U.S. dollars, and
became the first Russian colossus which invested in Romania in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Sees Last-Minute Boost from New Jobs Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Friday got a much-needed boost for his re-election campaign from
an unofficial projection, which put the country's jobless total in
September below 4 million for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
With Germany's national elections just two days away, the
labor office in the southern German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg,
which is governed by Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
published a projection forecasting the national jobless total in
September at between 3.7 and 3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
That would put the jobless rate at 10.3 percent, down from 10.6
percent registered in August, the state labor office said.
</P>
<P>
The official jobless data are not due to be released until
October 6, nine days after the national election.
</P>
<P>
But Berhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labor Office,
which tabulated the official data, confirmed late Friday that it
was "very likely" that unemployment would drop below the 4 million
mark by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the unofficial forecast, Kohl's spokesman Otto Hauser
described the latest development as a confirmation of the reform
policies pursued by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We have broken the sound barrier, and it is a good news for
our country," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), which wishes
to defeat Kohl at the election on September 27, dismissed the
forecast as a trick played by the government to court voters.
</P>
<P>
"The speculations about unemployment data are not serious,"
said Walter Riester, who has been designated by the SPD as labor
minister in case of an election victory.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been the top issue of Germany's election
campaign and has been seen as the "heel of Achilles" of Kohl.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment hovering at near post-war-record highs for
more than one year, Kohl is dubbed by his challenger, the SPD
chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder, as "the chancellor of
unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been German chancellor since 1982 but is fighting
an uphill battle to win re-election, has reassured voters that the
jobless total is set to fall below the magic 4-million mark within
this year.
</P>
<P>
With recent opinion polls putting Kohl's lag behind Schroeder
as narrow as two percentage points, the expected drop in
unemployment could be very instrumental for Kohl to win over a
large number of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
However, there was also bad news for Kohl Friday, with two
polling institutes saying that the SPD still enjoys a relatively
big lead over the CDU.
</P>
<P>
The poll issued by the Forsa institute put the SPD at 42
percent, the CDU at 38 percent, while the Allensbach poll showed
the SPD at 40.5 percent and the CDU at 36 percent.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Launch Travelers' Check in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) will launch its travelers' check in Abuja
next month, ECOWAS officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Adrianne Diop, the ECOWAS spokesperson, was quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria as saying that the launching would take place
at the ECOWAS summit set for October in Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS travelers' check should have been launched in
Dakar, Senegal, last November, but was aborted by disagreements
over the role of central banks and the indebtedness of three
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The launching was stalled after the central banks of
Francophone countries, the BCEAO, raised two objections to the
take-off of the instrument meant to facilitate transactions in
the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The BCEAO members had expressed reservations over the
involvement of central banks and the indebtedness of Liberia,
Guinea Bissau and Mauritania to the defunct West African Clearing
House, which preceded the West African Monetary Agency.
</P>
<P>
Diop said the two issues had been resolved and that the
launching would be one of the first things to be done by ECOWAS
leaders in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the issue of debts have been resolved while
an agreement has been reached to allow central banks to
participate at the initial stage of implementation of the scheme
before it is handed over to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
After the launching, member central banks will meet to decide
on the date to begin implementation and the number of
participating banks, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS travelers' check is in five, 10, 20, 50 and 100
West African Units of Account. Each unit is equivalent to 1.43
U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Clinton Gains After Videotape Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Polls show the American
public's support for President Bill Clinton has bounced back after
the release of his videotaped testimony, while indicating
Congressional Republicans have slipped in public approval of their
handling of Clinton's president's legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
A CBS/New York Times poll taken at midweek reinforced poll
findings earlier in the week that the Monday showing of the
videotape actually helped the president.
</P>
<P>
His job approval climbed from 61 percent before the video
release to 67 percent in the CBS/Times poll and the number of
people who feel Congress should begin impeachment hearings shifted
from 36 percent before the release to 31 percent afterward.
Support for censure, which is the most popular option, dipped from
55 percent to 46 percent when respondents were given the three
choices of resignation, impeachment or censure.
</P>
<P>
But with midterm elections approaching, it is significant that
people considered more likely to vote preferred Republican
candidates for Congress in the upcoming elections by 50 percent to
41 percent for Democrats. And 39 percent of the more likely voters
favored impeachment, compared to 29 percent who wanted censure of
the president and 31 percent who wanted to drop the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Before Monday, polls indicated Americans believed by a 2-1
margin that the president obstructed justice by encouraging Monica
Lewinsky to lie. But the public is now divided on that question,
according to the CBS/Times poll. And more than half disapprove of
the way the House Judiciary Committee is handling the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll says the public was sharply divided
over the course Congress should pursue in the Lewinsky matter.
Thirty-seven percent wanted Congress to censure Clinton and stop
holding hearings, 35 percent wanted the matter dropped and 27
percent wanted hearings to proceed on whether to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The CBS/Times poll of 960 adults, conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday, and the Gallup poll of 1,046 adults, taken Wednesday
and Thursday, have margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
For months, the core group of people who want Clinton impeached
or think it would be better if he resigned has remained at about a
third. They are mostly well-to-do, well-educated, white and
Republican, according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
The hard-core opponents of Clinton during the Lewinsky
investigation are not a dramatically different group than those
who opposed him when he first ran for office, pollsters say.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of

<HEADLINE> Romanian President on Corruption and Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Firm measures would be
taken to intensify the fight against corruption and organized
crimes, and solve all the cases under investigation as soon as
possible, Romanian President Emil Constantinescu Friday evening
stressed in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement at the close of the meeting of
the National Council of Action Against Corruption and Organized
Crimes (CNAICCO), the main anti-corruption and organized crime
body in Romania, under the leadership of the president himself.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever might infringe the law, whatever his position, should
have to pay for his deeds," Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
He presented concrete data on the dimension of corruption and
organized crimes and the results yielded in the fight against
these phenomena, saying that the authorities in charge had
announced damage worth over 3,500 billion lei (about 400 million
U.S. dollars), of which some 875 billion lei (100 million U.S.
dollars) had been recouped till now and poured into the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, CNAICCO, taking stock of the
actions so far deployed against corruption and organized crime,
one year and a half since its coming into being, decided to take
further steps toward the drawing up of a comprehensive law against
corruption and the modifications in the existing legal framework
to allow for greater efficiency in the actions of the state bodies
in charge with fighting corruption and organized crime, as well as
for better co-operation among them.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided at the meeting that special training be
made for police men, prosecutors and lawyers in the field of
financial and banking crime, with a view to setting up a special
task force able to check the Mafia-like organizations operational
in Romania.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Iran's Decision on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States welcomes
Iran's decision to remove its death threat against British author
Salman Rushdie but acknowledged that troubles still exist between
Tehran and Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The decision on Rushdie is a very positive development. And
one of the issues that was always on our agenda was human rights,
and this is an action on human rights that is a welcome
development," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also cited other welcome developments, including Iran's
cooperation in drug interdiction, cooperation in the U.N. context
on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin said, "That doesn't mean that there are not
other areas that trouble us. And we have indicated that we're
going to monitor this closely, we're going to be waiting to see
what they say and waiting to see what they do."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain agreed early this week to resume full
relations after Tehran decided that it will not carry out its
death threat against Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iran said it "has no intention, nor is it going to take any
action whatsoever to threaten the life of the author of The
Satanic Verses or anybody associated with his work, nor will it
encourage or assist anybody to do so."
</P>
<P>
Accordingly the Iranian government disassociates itself from
any reward which has been offered in this regard and does not
support it.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. is disappointed that Iran normalized its
relations with Britain, but not the U.S., Rubin said,"We are the
United States and we are different than other countries."
</P>
<P>
"And other countries it perhaps has less significance to them to
make such a step. That is the nature of being the United
States," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iran to take steps for better relations with the
United States. "We've made quite clear that we are ready when they
are ready to develop a road map and to take parallel steps. We
can't be more ready than they are."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Start Afghan Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations
special envoy will begin a new Afghan peace mission on October 3,
a follow up to a meeting this week of major national powers on the
explosive issue, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a news conference that former Algerian foreign
minister Lakhdar Brahimi would "explore ways in which the United
Nations might help reduce tensions" between Afghanistan and
neighboring Iran.
</P>
<P>
The tensions have been escalated by the recent military buildup
by Iran close to its borders with Afghanistan, angered by the
killing of its diplomats in the area seized by Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi will first visit Iran, which has massed about 200,000
troops for exercises on its Afghan border, before travelling to
Pakistan, the main backer of the Taliban, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that Brahimi's itinerary would be decided once he
was in the region. But he made no mention of a possible visit to
Afghanistan itself.
</P>
<P>
The international community does not recognize Taliban as the
sole legitimate representative of Afghanistan, though the militia
has captured most of its territory following a sweep through the
north this summer.
</P>
<P>
Eight countries, including China, convened an international
meeting on Afghanistan under the auspices of the United Nations,
they agreed on Monday upon a U.n. probe into the reported murder
of Iranian diplomats in the wake of the Taliban offensive.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Dragged Down with Bank Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- European bourses were
depressed by worries over the solvency of the banking sector after
a leading US hedge fund had to be rescued, but recovered in late
trading over renewed hopes of a cut in US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
London's leading Footsie index recorded sharp losses as banks
tumbled on concern about their exposure to hedge funds, and Glaxo
Wellcome slipped back after Goldman Sachs cut profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 106.6 points at 5061,
having touched the day's low at 5016. The index recovered slightly
after Wall Street pared its losses.
</P>
<P>
Barclays and NatWest Bank were among the worst performing
shares down 7.4 percent and 6.3 percent respectively. Barclays was
among the banks who participated in the rescue of the US hedge
fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
Other bank stocks down included Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Standard
Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Glaxo was down 5.8 percent after Goldman downgraded the stock
to hold from a buy after revising its price target to 1800 pence,
from 2000 pence.
</P>
<P>
A profit warning from UBS, Europe's largest bank, and reports
of a 3.5 billion US dollars bailout of hedge fund Long-Term
Capital Management sent the FTSE 100's banking index down 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is just another thing that was not expected," said Steve
Wright, a strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "What
confidence can we have that the big banks are not going to pull
something else out of their hats?"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a poll of leading economists said that nearly all
expect a rate cut by the end of the year. Also, the head of the
Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said he expected European interest
rates to converge around Germany's 3.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares fell a bit after investors remained
nervous about the losses suffered by Europe's biggest bank, UBS,
in the hedge fund rescue. Shares recovered after a poor
performance in New York reversed course. The Xetra Dax finished
26.93 points lower at 4585.41.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was relatively quiet on Friday as
people were nervous going into the national election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Kuhl of Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in Frankfurt said
a rebound next Monday as high as 5200 points on the Xetra DAX was
possible.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares followed the international trend as Wall
Street turned lower. Worries about the solvency of the banking
sector dragged other shares lower, too. The Cac 40 finished 70.54
points lower at 3310.59.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were hardest hit, with Paribas, Societe
Generale, and BNP all down. Traders said the market jitters were
making buyers scare.
</P>
<P>
"In these kinds of markets, where the index rises 2 percent one
day and drops 3 percent the next, nobody seems to want to put a
finger in the cake," said one trader at ABN Abro.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans to Fly out Liberian Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday plans
to fly out Liberia's fugitive and ex-warlord Roosevelt Johnson, a
report from Liberia's capital Monrovia quoted an U.S. embassy
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
John Bowman, the Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. embassy, said
that Johnson is tooking refugee in the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a major rival of Liberian President Charles Taylor
during the seven years of the civil war, escaped into the U.S.
embassy last Saturday when government troops rounded up him and
his supporters in central Monrovia in an attempt to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting started last Friday night and continued until
Saturday morning, resulting in the loss of hundreds of lives,
according to unconfirmed reports. But the Liberian government
put the death toll at 50 to 60.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's Defense Minister Daniel Chea said that the government
troops moved in after the director general of budget was taken
hostage by Johnson's men last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's two sons and two aides are with him in the embassy.
Another senior aide was shot dead by Liberian police in
the gateway.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government then announced Johnson and 21 others
wanted on treason charges. Another ex-warlord, Alhaji Kroma is
also among the wanted persons.
</P>
<P>
The incident has resulted in a tension between Liberia and the
U.S. which has reportedly instructed its embassy not to hand over
Johnson to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"Johnson received temporary refuge in our embassy in
accordance with the international law because of an immediate and
clear threat to his life," U.S. State Department Spokesman James
Rubin said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's spokesman Reginald Goodridge said Thursday that
Liberia would not stand in the way of an attempt by Washington to
fly out Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"Since they are technically on American soil, this government
will not take issue with the Americans on flying him out,"
Goodridge said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a belief that his continued presence here in Liberia
may be raising tensions," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. embassy previously had
planned to fly out Johnson by helicopter to Sierra Leone Thursday
but the flight had been delayed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Upbeat Over Bosnia Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday said the overall results of the recent election in Bosnia
were a victory for the Dayton accord despite the success of an
ultra-nationalist in Bosnia's Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, special envoy Robert
Gelbard told reporters the most important result had been an
increase in support for the Sloga (Unity) coalition in the Bosnian
Serb parliament.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has been supportive of the Dayton agreements.
"That's where the power is," said the envoy.
</P>
<P>
"The overall results of the elections have been extraordinarily
important and positive in terms of moving in the directions to
further the goals of the Dayton agreement and to promote further
development of democratic pluralism," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"There is much greater development of democratic pluralism and
in all three ethnic groups, in varying degrees, the nationalist
parties which dominated during the war and immediately thereafter
show clear downward trends," the envoy added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Calls for Security Co-Op with Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye Friday urged security forces in his
country to enhance cooperation with their Kenyan counterparts so
as to curb crimes in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the Prime Minister's office,
Sumaye said that cooperations between security forces of the two
countries will help reduce crimes along the border.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye at his office met with the out-going Kenyan Ambassador
to Tanzania Jelani Habib who paid a courtesy call on him. During
their meeting, the Tanzanian prime minister said that car
robberies and thefts of high-voltage electric wire have recently
increased along the Tanzania-Kenya border.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye also took the opportunity to commend the visit by
Kenyan Chief of the General Staff General Daudi Tonje this week,
saying that the visit has strengthened the existing cordial
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting, the prime minister told the new Swedish
Ambassador to Tanzania, Sten Rylander, that the only solution to
the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is to conduct
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Debates over Clinton Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- As the Judiciary Committee
of the U.S. House of Representatives met in closed session Friday
to prepare 60,000 pages of potential impeachment evidence for
public release, one Democratic lawmaker sought to postpone the
deadline and keep the information secret for now.
</P>
<P>
Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California,
proposed over Republican opposition that the committee determine _
before releasing anything else -- whether President Bill Clinton's
conduct in his relation with a former White House intern
constituted a "high crime and misdemeanor." That is the standard
for impeachment, but the term is not defined in the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Lofgren handed out copies of the motion she made as the
committee met to approve deletions of irrelevant material in the
documents -- much of it sexually graphic.
</P>
<P>
Her resolution indicates differences between the parties.
Republicans want to release information provided by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr and then begin an impeachment inquiry before
delving into such legal issues. Democrats believe the legal
standard must be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say their constant calls for fairness to Clinton is
taking hold with the public -- as demonstrated by the president's
still-strong job approval rating and opposition by most Americans
to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"The public perceives the handling of these procedures as
terribly unfair," said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for Democrats on
the Judiciary Committee. "I'd be surprised if we didn't see a
significant tactical recalibration by committee Republicans."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Republicans used their majority power to
release Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony and 2,800 pages
of backup material -- including the grand jury testimony of Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the committee has to consider much more material
from Starr. After it approves deletions of irrelevant and sexually
graphic material involving Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky,
the information would become public next week.
</P>
<P>
Included in the material is the grand jury testimony of
presidential friend Vernon Jordan, Clinton secretary Betty Currie,
Lewinsky's former friend Linda Tripp and transcripts of Tripp's
recorded conversations with Lewinsky. The committee was to discuss
releasing the audio tapes, which might have to be edited to
expunge sexually explicit conversations.
</P>
<P>
Under a timetable announced Thursday by committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, a Republican, the House could be expected to vote by
October 9 on a resolution to convene an impeachment inquiry
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Starr has listed 11 possible grounds for impeachment involving
alleged perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Tang Jiaxuan on Taiwan Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The early realization of the
reunification between Taiwan and the mainland serves not only the
fundamental interests of the people across the Straits, but also
the interests of all parties including the United States, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations
and the Asia Society, Tang Jiaxuan said the reunification would
not affect the existing economic, trade and cultural relations
and personnel exchange between the United States and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tang said it would only enable them to develop better and the
U.S. economic interests in Taiwan would be better protected, and
an early resolution of the Taiwan issue would remove the obstacle
in China-U.S. relations, facilitate a sound and steady growth of
the bilateral relations and continued peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Tang said since in 1972, all the U.S Administrations had
reaffirmed their adherence to the one China policy, and the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the joint China-U.S.
Statement have set forth unmistakable guiding principles on how
to handle the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Minister said U.S. leaders had recently
reiterated the above-mentioned policy, principles and the
relevant U.S. commitments on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
 Tang said it was China's hope that the U.S. side would
handle the Taiwan issue in accordance with the principles set
forth in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the Joint
China-U.S. Statement in real earnest, honor their commitments
and truly work for a sustained, sound and stable growth of
China-U.S. relations.

<HEADLINE> Microcredit: Tool to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Southern African regional
microcredit summit said here Friday that the time has come to
recognize microcredit as a powerful tool in the struggle to
eradicate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the four-day summit meeting
said: "We the microcredit practitioners and advocates
acknowledge that resource-wise or technology-wise, there is no
reason why poverty should exist and continue to deepen and
widen."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that microcredit can be used as a tool in
helping the poor start micro enterprises in order to earn a
sustaining income.
</P>
<P>
Micro enterprises can serve as a training ground for
entrepreneurial ability and managerial talent, and enable and
motivate risk-taking individuals to find avenues for the talents
to engage in new types of business activities and innovations,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It said, "The provision of microcredit will spur the
energies of people living in poverty and enable them to undertake
entrepreneurial activities which will facilitate their capacities
to earn them a livelihood."
</P>
<P>
But the provision of credit alone is not adequate and other
facilities such as provision of information, access to market,
provision of appropriate technology and social and physical
infrastructure are equally important, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of delegates from southern African countries and
other parts of the world attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit is a follow-up to the global microcredit summit
held in Washington in February last year. Southern Africa's
target is to reach 1.2 million poorest families, especially the
women of these families.

DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The situation has returned to

rivers in the country's four basins continuing to recede at almost
all points, the Flood Information Center said Saturday.

The floods in the country have made a complete pull-back, as
all the rivers were flowing below the danger levels at their

The rivers in Brahmaputra, Meghna and southeastern hill basins
fell at all points while the Padma in Ganges basin marked slight

Rehabilitation programs would be launched in October to help
millions of flood victims to rebuild their homes and plant crops,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Rely on Themselves to Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Saturday challenged the people to exploit the country's
resources to overcome current economic difficulties, according to
Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
While swearing in David Saviye as Minister for Transport and
Communications and several other permanent secretaries in Lusaka,
Chiluba said the Zambians should exploit their own abundant
resources since help from the donor community would not be avilable
this time round.
</P>
<P>
"What we need is to exploit our only resources although that
will take time to bear fruit," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He asked all senior government officials to tell the people
the truth about the economic difficulties although it might be
hard.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's economic situation in the past months has
deteriorated due to shortfall in agricultural output, bad
performance of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which
has been an main pillar of the economy,falling copper prices in
the world market as well as little aid flows from donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Zambia, therefore, had to lower the country's
economic growth target from 5.5 percent to four percent in last
July.
</P>
<P>
"Jobs are being threatened, the standard of living is also
being threatened," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader called on senior officials to show
honesty and dedicaiton in their effort to overcome the
economic difficulties facing the country.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Rushdie Issue Remains Though </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Although London and Tehran on
Thursday agreed to upgrade their decade-strained relations, the
death sentence by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini on the British writer Salman Rushdie remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's fatwa (religious decree) on Rushdie's life is
irrevocable, Iranian analysts said, and as a matter of fact the
Iranian government did not make any change on the policy
regarding the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Thursday agreed to put aside the
Rushdie issue in order to improve relations between the two
countries, after Kharrazi reiterated that the Iranian government
would not take or help any action against Rushdie's life.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, during his first visit to
the United Nations, also announced that the Rushdie case was
"completely finished" and he did not want to be asked about the
issue again.

<P>
However, public opinion here noted the remarks made by Khatami
and Kharrazi in New York was exactly the same as what former
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani made three years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the Iranian government reiterated
on different occasions that Tehran would not send commandos to
kill Rushdie for his controversial book the Satanic Verses,
which was believed to insult the Islamic Prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
But Iranian officials have insisted that Khomeini's fatwa is a
religious decree and could not be revoked, and the Iranian
government had nothing to do with the private Khordad 15
Foundation, which offered an award for those who will carry out
Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie issued in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic teachings, any Muslim blaspheming
Prophet Mohammad will automatically face a death penalty, Imam
Khomeini as a Muslim jurist only announced the Islamic ruling and
he did not issue the fatwa on his own, the pro-conservative daily
Tehran Times said in a commentary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
For London, it is a face-saving device when the British
officials say they have taken necessary assurances from Tehran
whereas in reality what Kharrazi said was nothing new, the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the pro-moderate daily Iran News said that the
Western media has twisted the truth in an effort to convince the
public that Iran has adjusted its policies in order to conform to
those of the West.
</P>
<P>
The fact was that Tehran made no fundamental changes in its
policy vis-a-vis Britain or Rushdie, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the main factors behind the
improvement of London-Tehran relations were the economic
incentives for both sides and need of cooperation at regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
The detente and tension-reducing policies of Khatami have
resulted in the rapprochement between Iran and the European Union
(EU) and provided an opportunity for the EU countries to compete
in the Iranian market as Iran needs large foreign investment to
save its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Britain can not tolerate that it would be left out of the
lucrative business deals Iran would have with other European
countries, particularly Italy and France, which have taken the
initiatives to open a new chapter for political, economic
cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Before Cook-Kharrazi meeting, an official from the British
Foreign Office made clear on Wednesday that the issue of Rushdie
could not dominate London's policy towards Iran. But observers and
diplomats here believe so long as Khomeini's fatwa remains valid,
Rushdie is forced to live in hiding.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Turns Down Accusation of Expelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean foreign
ministry, in a statement Saturday, said that it had "no policy of
expulsion of Ethiopian nationals living in Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea denied it had expelled any Ethiopians since a border
dispute between the two countries erupted in May, this year.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa-based media said Friday that 24,970 Ethiopians
had been expelled from Eritrea since it invaded Ethiopia on May 6
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea said that some 20,000 Eritreans were expelled
from Ethiopia since last May. But Ethiopia said only 4,000 were
expelled for security seasons.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean foreign ministry statement said that since early
May, 6,600 Ethiopians had left Eritrea "of their own free will",
mainly because they had lost their jobs, said a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
It called for an independent inquiry into the allegations of
mistreatment of Ethiopians in Eritrea, which include claims of
harassment, beatings and torture.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea blamed Ethiopia's boycott of the red sea port of
Assab, which employed hundreds of Ethiopian migrant workers, for
many of the job losses.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopian decisions to boycott the use of the port of Assab
and its decision to blockade the port made all Ethiopians working
in Assab redundant and therefore victims of their own
government's policy," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were killed in ground and air battles
between early May and mid-June after a long running border
dispute boiled into a violent conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity has failed to find a
peaceful solution to the dispute between the two neighbors.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel called Saturday for an international conference to ward off
a looming humanitarian catastrophe among Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's call, made in two separate letters, came in the wake
of a growing concern among United Nations agencies over the
deteriorating humanitarian condition in the Yugoslav province,
where 90 percent of the total population is albanian.
</P>
<P>
In the letters, to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, Kinkel suggested
that the international conference be held next week in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross and other
humanitarian agencies, members of the six-nation Contact Group,
representatives of the Yugoslav government and Kosovo Albanian
leaders should be invited, he said.
</P>
<P>
As reported by international humanitarian organizations, the
fighting between ethnic Albanian separatists and Yugoslav forces
in Kosovo has claimed about 700 lives so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 300,000 people have been displaced and 50,000
of them have fled into woods and hills to seek temporary shelters.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies have warned of the possibility of a humanitarian
catastrophe in the upcoming winter, prompting a stronger call for
a political solution to the ongoing conflict in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> AL Backs Declaration of Independent Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League supports the
declaration of the Palestinian state on the grounds that it is the
legitimate right of the Palestinian people, Arab League (AL)
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Resolution 181 of 1947 which was Israel's birth
certificate also provided for setting up the Palestinian state,"
he added in an interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration of the Palestinian state would come in
implementation of Oslo agreements and a reply to the Israeli
government's procrastination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid who is to leave on Sunday for New York to take
part in the U.N. General Assembly meetings said that this question
will top issues to be discussed with U.N. chief Kofi Annan and a
number of foreign ministers with whom he will meet on the fringe
of these meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab states should not spare any effort for supporting the
Palestinian stand in the U.N.," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat said
Friday that he had the "sacred right" to declare a state in the
West Bank and Gaza strip in May 1999 and asked for international
backing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to address the 53rd U.N. General Assembly session on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on
Thursday that such a declaration would lead to a "complete
collapse" of Mideast peacemaking and that Israel would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been languishing
since March 1996. Both sides are haggling over a U.S. proposal on
a 13 percent Israeli West Bank withdrawal. Arafat has accepted the
offer long before while Netanyahu said this week that he is ready
to take it.

NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K. R.
Narayanan said Saturday that tolerance among people and country's
unity were essential not only for regenerating society but also
for survival of India as a nation.
</P>
<P>
He told a national conference that the country had constantly
worked to overcome shortcomings in its pluralistic character, but
the political, economic and cultural unity was yet to be fully
assured to the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the basic and foremost objective today should be the
uplift of millions of downtrodden, as regeneration of society was
not possible without eradication of poverty. The prerequisite is
unity and cohesion without which "we can't build, regenerate or
develop" political, economic and social unity in the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The dynamic core of the Indian civilization lies in its spirit
of tolerance which was essential to revive and regenerate the
society, he said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Sanctions Against Malaysia Possible: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday there is a possibility that foreign
nations will use the issue of the sacking of his deputy Anwar
Ibrahim to impose economic sanctions against Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Views to that effect have already been expressed by a senior
World Bank official who alleged that the Malaysian government was
trying to silence political dissent, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The views were reportedly expressed by World Bank Chief
Economist Joseph Stiglitz in an interview with the Strait Times in
Washington in the run-up to the annual meeting of the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund there next week.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official reportedly said Malaysia could face the
same very strong actions taken by the world community against
South Africa during its apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
"They hope they could use this, firstly, maybe, in an attempt
to defend Anwar. But I think it is more an attempt to make us fail
in our efforts to insulate the economy especially measures of
capital control," Mahathir told a news conference at his official
residence here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the economic recovery measures taken by the
government early this month according to the government's
observations, had begun to show signs of success.
</P>
<P>
"We noticed that initial success can be clearly seen although
it has been just over three weeks. I believe this recovery is not
welcomed by the nation's economic adversaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the measures, he said, Bank Negara (Central
Bank)'s international reserves had increased by almost 1 billion
U.S. dollars to 21.191 billion U.S. dollars against 20.228 billion
U.S. dollars last August.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said although Anwar himself had not planned for
economic sanctions to be imposed against Malaysia, foreign
opportunists would like to have such action taken to impede
Malaysia's success in implementing measures to revive its economy
by exploiting the Anwar issue.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) a day later for alleged moral
misconduct.

<HEADLINE> More SADC Troops to Be Sent to Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- More troops from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) were expected to be
deployed in Lesotho Saturday to bolster the military intervention
in the country, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South African National Defense Force (SANDF) chief Siphiwe
Nyanda said Friday that the reinforcement required political
authorization. But meanwhile, SANDF spokeswoman Laverne Machine
said the implementation was a fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
The number of reinforcement was not disclosed, but Machine
said it was essential that the size of the force be increased to
secure areas beyond capital Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda, who toured Maseru Friday, said that the initial
objective of suppressing a Lesotho defense force mutiny and
seizing weaponry had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
South Africa sent 600 troops to Lesotho Tuesday to help
control the situation in the tiny land-locked country where
government had been forced to shut down amid the opposition
parties' intensified campaign to protest the country's May
election results.
</P>
<P>
Botswana also sent troops to Lesotho Wednesday to back the
SADC mission.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Nyanda denied that the SADC
force had invaded Lesotho. He said the force had been invited by
the Lesotho government and would leave once the government
requires a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda said that he regretted the destruction of Maseru's
business district but denied the SADC force was responsible for
this. The SADC force was unable to prevent the looting and arson
in Maseru on Tuesday and Wednesday because of the resistance of
rebel Lesotho defense forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda noted that the force's strategy was to use minimum
force to achieve maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
Operation commander Robbie Hartslief said that the SADC force
wanted to minimize loss of life and destruction of property and
therefore did not fire at looters and arg/Y%MQM94R $RX9:slief said although the
central business district of
Maseru had been burnt down, the city's industrial area including
chemical and fuel storage facilities had been secured.
</P>
<P>
He said that 160 Lesotho soldiers had been taken prisoner and
some soldiers had been killed. But the task force did not know
the whereabouts of the bulk of Lesotho's approximately
3,000-strong army.
</P>
<P>
Machine said that an unknown number of troops had sealed
themselves in underground bunkers at the Makoanyane base near
Maseru. They had only limited oxygen supplied and no food or
electricity, she said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for More U.S. Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh Saturday asked the U.S. government to press the Israeli
government into accepting accept the U.S. peace proposal on
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At his first press conference since he was appointed prime
minister at the end of last month, Tarawneh expressed the hope
that such pressure will be exerted during the current and upcoming
meetings in the U.S. between senior U.S. officials and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's leading Arabic daily the Al Ra'I reported Saturday
that U.S. President Bill Clinton will separately meet Netanyahu
and Arafat this week in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conducted a series
of talks on peace issues with a number of Arab leaders in New York
and Washington during the past days, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said that since "the overall move is negative," it
becomes urgent for the U.S. to press the Israeli government into
accepting the U.S. proposal, under which Israel is asked to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. government really makes efforts in this regard,
Jordan believes that "there is hope" to revive the long-stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the proposal, while Israel has
proposed that its troops withdraw from 10 percent of the West Bank
and another 3 percent be kept as "nature reserve."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is widely criticized for not exerting
enough pressure on the Israeli government to make it accept the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said on Friday in New York that his
government will hammer out an agreement with the Palestinians in
the next two weeks over the troop withdrawal and a "total
agreement" on this subject has been reached between the Israeli
and the U.S. government, according to reports of Israeli radio.
</P>
<P>
Jordan supports the Palestinians to establish an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital and meanwhile, it sticks to a
policy of normalization of ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now Israel's closest ally in the Arab world. It is
one of the two Arab countries that signed peace treaty with
Israel. The other is Egypt.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese lawmaker has
urged that people utilize and protect resources scientifically and
properly and integrate the utilization of resources with
environmental protection for the purpose of sustained development.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, made the call at a recent symposium on
the development of resources and the strategy of sustained
development in China, which was held in this Chinese capital and

</P>
<P>
China should earnestly implement its strategy for coordination
between economic and social development and the protection of
resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The protection of resources should be included in the national
economic and social development plans and long-term outlines, he
said, noting that the country's should adopt the principle of
attaching equal importance to both the development and utilization
of resources and the saving and protection of resources.
</P>
<P>
China has promulgated a series of state laws and local
administrative regulations on utilization and development of
various resources, according to the NPC vice-chairman. The laws
and regulations have played an important role in the protection of
the country's resources and the environment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Borrow 300 Million Dollars for Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Energy Minister
Habibollah Bitaraf announced on Saturday that his ministry would
borrow 300 million U.S. dollars from foreign countries to meet
its foreign exchange demands.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Fars province, southern Iran, he said the
borrowing would enable the construction of three large dams, one
of which is in Fars province, the official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bitaraf also announced that his ministry would start to sell
bonds in mid-October to compensate for its budget shortage in
order to speed up the completion of dams under construction.
</P>
<P>
He said the investment from the sale of bonds would be
distributed on a regional basis and each province's share in the
investment would be proportional to the revenues of the bonds.
</P>
<P>
The interest for the bonds will be, at the minimum, 20
percent annually, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bitaraf, seven giant dams, Karoun 3, Karoun 4,
Masjed Soleyman, Abbaspour, Karkheh, Shoushtar and Seymareh, are
currently under construction in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
When operational, the dams will totally generate some 8,000
megawatts of energy annually, which will be equal to one
quarter of the current amount of energy produced.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Declares Refugee Disaster Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has declared a "state of disaster" in the districts
bordering Lesotho because of the influx of refugees from the tiny
mountain kingdom, a national newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to The Citizen, the towns of Ladybrand, Ficksburg,
Wepener, Fouriesburg, Zastron and Clocolan in the Free State were
declared Friday to be in a "state of disaster" as an estimated
4,000 Lesotho refugees had flocked into these towns since the
fighting in country began Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A South African-led Southern African Development Community
(SADC) task force entered Lesotho Tuesday to suppress an alleged
army mutiny in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many shops in the capital Maseru and other Lesotho towns have
been looted and set alight by Lesotho citizens in the chaos, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
As more refugees are expected soon, these towns may not have
the ability and capacity to keep up with the influx of the
fleeing people, the South African ministry of provincial affairs
and constitutional development said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A prolonged stay of refugees will be "inevitable" as most of
the people might not have a home, work or family to go back to
even after the situation in Lesotho normalizes, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Maseru bridge border post was clogged by
Basothos traveling to nearby Ladybrand to do shopping as no shops
were trading in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that shops in Ladybrand have reported a 100
percent increase in business since Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Strive for Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council
Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala) said Saturday the Palestinians are
determined to declare their independent state in next May.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs radio
broadcast by telephone from Jerusalem, he described the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state as a "strategic"
and not a "tactical" issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people will continue to strive to establish an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Israel's threats
will not affect our will to announce our state," he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat Friday
reiterated plans to declare a Palestinian state in next May
despite Israeli objections.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he would prefer a negotiated settlement with Israel
by May 4, 1999, the deadline set in the Oslo peace accords for a
final agreement. But after that date, he said he would make use of
his "sacred right" to declare statehood in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Just Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned
that a unilateral statehood declaration would lead to a "complete
collapse" of Mideast peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Qureia underscored the Palestinian side's rejection to keep the
transitional phase open and accused the Israeli government of
continuing its "time-wasting" policy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Market Left by Philippine Airlines Being Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- After the closure of
Philippine Airlines (PAL) at midnight on Wednesday, the vacuum
left by the oldest airlines in Asia and the national flag carrier
is being eyed by both foreign and local airlines.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio program on Saturday, Philippine President
Joseph Estrada announced that Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific will
begin flying domestic routes in the country next week.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with their chief executive who assured me that they
are ready to help on a temporary basis to cover the flight
shortage," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Cathay Pacific will start sending five large
Airbus aircraft to the Philippines next Monday. It will also run
three PAL planes and employ some of the PAL pilots, ground workers
and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
"That will make up for the shortage of flights of PAL so we
should not worry that we will lack planes," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cathay Pacific is not yet the winner of the Philippine
air traffic market. So far, at least seven foreign firms have
expressed interest to buy part or the entire operations of the
debt-ridden Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
These airlines are Lufthansan AG, Northwest Airlines Corp.,
Swire Pacific Ltd., Evergreen Marine, Singapore Airlines, Swissair
and Cathay Pacific. Some of the airlines have already begun talks
with Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three local airlines have also sought the
government's assistance in procuring more planes for domestic
flights and expanding domestic operations following PAl's closure.
</P>
<P>
The three small companies, Grand Air, Cebu Pacific Airways and
Air Philippines, held a two-hour discussion with President Estrada
after PAL announced its closure. Estrada allowed them to fly part
of the domestic routes abandoned by Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Philippine government has not yet given up
PAL. On Friday night, Estrada persuaded the PAL management and the
PAL labor union to sit down again at his residence in hopes that
both parties can reach an acceptable proposal to re-open the
airlines which was very important to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
In a last-ditch effort before the PAL's closure, its management
had originally offered the union 60,000 shares of stock per
employee plus three seats in the board of directors in exchange
for a 10-year suspension of the union's Collective Bargain
Agreements.
</P>
<P>
The union turned down the offer, forcing PAL which is suffering
a heavy loss of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars to close shop after 57
years of operation.
</P>
<P>
"The burden of cumulative losses over many years and the losses
caused by the strike (by the labor union) during the on-going
Asian financial crisis have run into billions of pesos and become
too heavy for the company to bear," PAL said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
At the latest round of talks brokered by the president on
Friday, the labor union said it was drawing up a new formula more
attractive to the management and that PAL may re-open next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said it is not possible that an agreement
would come up within such a short period of time because the
positions of the two parties remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
Even if revived, Philippine Airlines should also be
"downsized," Presidential spokesman Fernando Barican said, adding
that PAL would require the retrenchment of a large portion of its
workforce.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Hold Textile Exhibition in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will hold its annul
textiles exhibition, Bangladesh Textile Exposition (BATEXPO), next
month, a top official of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and
Exporters' Association (BGMEA) announced here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The BATEXPO, the largest exposition of the country's textile
industry, will be held from October 16 to 18, BGMEA President
Mostafa Golam Quddus told reporters of the Overseas
Correspondents' Association of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The ready-made garments industry, which has been growing at a
rate of over 20 percent over the past few years, is the largest
foreign exchange earner of the country.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 3.43 billion U.S. dollars' worth of
apparel in 1997, and the export is expected to cross 4 billion
dollars this year, according to Quddus.
</P>
<P>
During the prolonged floods this year which lasted from July to
September, the BGMEA adopted emergency transportation alternatives
to transport garments from Dhaka to the country's southeastern
seaport Chittagong to safeguard the buyers' interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Quddus said that when the Dhaka-Chittagong road connection was
snapped, BGMEA chartered aircraft to carry apparel and apparel
accessory cargoes to the port, and fixed temporary ferry terminals
for transporting the products.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. government to increase the quota of
Bangladeshi-made garments by a proposed 30 percent, to "help a
nation that loves to survive fighting the adversities."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh was seriously hit by floods this year, which left
over 1,000 people dead and affected nearly half of its 127 million
population.

development and maintain steady growth in this area while facing
the challenge of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a fact-finding tour of east China's
Anhui Province September 21-26. He said that the deepening of

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Importance of Agricultural Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang told Yan Junchang and Yan Hongchang, who led 18 rural
households in making a written pledge for the implementation of
the household contract system 20 years ago, that they had taken a
great risk politically in initiating the household system at that
time.
</P>
<P>
He added that their step was backed by courage to implement
reform and the strength of unity.
</P>
<P>
In the courtyard of Yang Hongchang, the president told
officials and farmers gathered there that China's reform and
opening-up drive, initiated by Deng Xiaoping, first made
achievements in rural areas, and the rural reform started in
Xiaogang Village.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the fact that the household contract system is a
major component of the Party's policy in the rural
areas. Moreover, China will persist in implementing the policy for
a long time to come without any change.
</P>
<P>
The farmers applauded upon hearing Jiang's remarks, and said
that Jiang's words had ``set their minds at ease".
</P>
<P>
Jiang also attached great importance to the advancement of
democracy in the grass-roots rural areas. In Qutai Village, Wuhe
County, he heard reports from the village committee on the
election process of the village committee and the openness of
village affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the promotion of grass-roots democracy in rural
areas is of great importance for the maintenance of long-term
stability and for enabling farmers to play an active role in
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made two fact-finding tours to Anhui when the province
was hit by heavy floods in 1991.

<P>
In Maoji Town, Fengtai County, Jiang said that he was happy to
see the clean streets and rows of new dwellings in an area which
had been destroyed by the disastrous flood of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Local officials told Jiang that after seven years'
rehabilitation and all-round development, the town is now leading
all the other towns and townships in the county in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has become one of the state's experimental zones
for comprehensive social development, and the pilot town for small
town construction and comprehensive reform, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang then visited farmers' homes to get to know about their
daily lives and rehabilitation efforts in the wake of this year's
floods.
</P>
<P>
He learned that some flood victims have not only built
comfortable and spacious houses, but now also use electric
appliances such as TV sets, stereos and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a swimming pool and a roller-skating rink have been
built in the town.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local farmers, Jiang said that he hoped that they
would be able to lead more comfortable and well-off lives. The
local farmers responded him with warm applause.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the eastern province, Jiang inspected its
model area for the development of modern agricultural science and
technology. At the Institute of Plasma Physics of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Jiang asked the institute's scientists about
the progress in and prospects for crop breeding through plasma
technology.
</P>
<P>
Visiting an exhibition held by a local seed company, Jiang said
that research into and manufacturing of seeds are very important
for crop production. Seed companies must provide quality seeds for
farmers, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
As he talked about invigorating agriculture through science and
technology, Jiang said that some developed countries have employed
genetic engineering and advanced electronic information networks
to accelerate agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese experts to keep abreast of these developments
as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also inspected a local high-tech development zone,
economic and technological development zone and a number of large
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He also visited families in Hefei, the provincial capital,
including that of Wu Liangzhu, an army driver who distinguished
himself in this summer's anti-flood operations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jiang highly praised the troops for their
great contributions to combating this summer's flooding.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 26 (XINHUA) -- Ethiopia's Fund Raising
Committee has announced that 4,587 metric tons of food and about
16.5 million Birr (2.3 million U.S. dollars) are needed to
rehabilitate Ethiopians expelled from Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Simon Mechale, Chairman of the committee, who is also the
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commissioner, told an
international donors meeting here Friday that food supply enough
for nine months is needed to resettle 22,000 displaced
Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
He said that the displaced will also need clothes, blankets,
household utensils and transport vehicles which will cost more
than 16.5 million Birr.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement made by the Office of
Ethiopian Government Spokeswoman Selome Taddesse, 24,970
Ethiopians have been expelled from Eritrea and 188,690 others
forced to flee their homes since the border dispute between the
two countries erupted in May, this year.
</P>
<P>
Simon said the number of expelled Ethiopians is expected to
reach 50,000 in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Saving the lives of the victims of Eritrean aggression was
the priority of the Ethiopian people and government," Simon said.
"This was achieved through donations obtained from local
sources," he added.
</P>
<P>
The international community could be expected to assist
efforts to rehabilitate displaced Ethiopians in the coming
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight bilateral donors, U.N. agencies and
non-governmental organizations attended the international donors'
meeting.

BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher of Germany
led a 1-2 Ferrari finish in Saturday's qualifying session and
gained the pole position for the Luxembourg Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen, Schumacher's only rival for the season's
driver's title, had the third fastest qualifying time in a
McLaren-Mercedes and will start from the second row in Sunday's
race.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen and Schumacher are tied at 80 points in the standings
with two races left in the season.
</P>
<P>
But Sunday's race will be tough for Hakkinen as he starts the
race from the second row, especially before 140,000 German fans.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher feels Hakkinen should be under pressure as he has
never won the title. Schumacher himself has won the title twice,
with Williams and Benetton.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of sacked
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim staged a
demonstration in Kuala Lumpur Saturday in defiance of police
warning, and several people were seen arrested, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the
demonstrators at the Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square).
</P>
<P>
Police first ordered the demonstrators, estimated at a few
thousand chanting "reformasi" (reform), to disperse. But when the
order was ignored, police began to push them back, according to
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police then started using water cannon and tear gas, sending
the crowds including onlookers running away.
</P>
<P>
Several people were seen taken away by police who pursued the
demonstrators to pull back as far as about one km from the square.
It was however not immediately known how many people had been
detained.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration appeared to have ended by early evening as
policemen entered their trucks and left the scene.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and expelled from the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) a day later, was arrested on
September 20.
</P>
<P>
He was expected to be brought for open trial next week on
charges of sexual misconduct, including sodomy.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Warns Against High Expectations for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday warned
against any high expectations from the forthcoming foreign
secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India, saying that it
is "only a beginning" made by the two countries in their efforts
for an negotiated settlement of their bilateral disputes.
</P>
<P>
"While we look forward to the resumption of the dialogue
particularly on the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir I should
emphasize that this is, yet again, only a beginning," a Foreign
Office spokesman said at a weekly news briefing here Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"And while this beginning has been made the real task lies
ahead," he said. "Our experience of the past does not fill us with
great hope."
</P>
<P>
"We are not oblivious of the fact that all bilateral efforts to
find a just settlement of the Kashmir issue have in the past
foundered on the rock of Indian intransigence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the resumption of the dialogue between the two
sides in a "specific and substantive manner", the spokesman,
however, declared that Islamabad would enter into the talks with
New Dehli "with sincerity and all seriousness."
</P>
<P>
"Yet we are ready to sincerely make a fresh effort. We do not
want to hold the dialogue for the sake of dialogue. We wish to
make concrete progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir
dispute on the basis of the United Nations Security Council
resolutions," he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the international community's continued
engagement and active involvement "even if in the form of moral
pressure on India," that could "ensure that India summons the
political will to address the Kashmir dispute in a serious and
result-oriented manner."
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of Pakistan and India in their meeting in
New York have agreed that a peaceful settlement of all outstanding
issues including Jammu and Kashmir was essential to secure an
environment of peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the foreign secretaries of the two countries will
resume their dialogue which broke down in September, with separate
meetings on peace and security including confidence building
measures and Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad on October 15-18,
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The categorical reference to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in
a joint statement at the level of the prime ministers of Pakistan
and India, perhaps for the first time in a quarter century, is a
welcome development," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> French PM Calls for Dialogue in Reshaping World Monetary System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said here Saturday that the dialogue among
nations and among large regional economic groupings must be
reinforced in order to rebuild the international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, on his first visit to Hong Kong since becoming prime
minister in June 1997 and the last leg of his China visit, made
the remarks when delivering a speech on economic partnership
between Europe and Asia at an economic forum shortly after his
arrival here.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said it is apparent today that the
international monetary and financial system is "in need of a fresh
impetus," and "we need to move towards a remodeling of the world's
financial architecture."
</P>
<P>
"A globalized economy needs strong and legitimate institutions,
capable of enforcing respect for the rules of the international
economic and financial game," he said.
</P>
<P>
The growing share of emerging countries in the world economy
justifies increased dialogue with the industrial countries, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said Europe, from the periods of tension it has lived
through, has deduced two major priorities: regional cooperation
and willingness for structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Regional cooperation must be strengthened in order to avoid at
all costs the temptation of turning inward upon oneself and the
illusion of using competitive devaluation to export the costs of
adjustment to one's neighbors," the French prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a willingness to consider that structural
reforms are a prerequisite for a lasting resumption of growth," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The price paid for Asia's headlong growth is that the economic
structures and mode of social development of the past have been
made obsolete," Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
As far as Europe is concerned, he said, "the Euro can act as a
mainstay in furthering international monetary stability, and
concerted action on economic and exchange rate policies among
large regional economic groupings is a necessity."
</P>
<P>
Europe, as the leading source of official development
assistance, has a vital role to play in forestalling crises in the
developing countries, by using this aid to support structural and
social reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished business leaders and scholars in Hong Kong
attended the forum.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official on Contingency Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Good contingency planning
is not synonymous with panic or paranoid but is a sensible,
prudent way of ensuring reliable and quality service to the
clients and part of every organization's service culture, Anson
Chan, Administrative Secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Central Policy Unit seminar titled "Contingency
Planning - A Must For All," Chan said that no manager can afford
to ignore crisis management and contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
Though smaller but much more complex than ever before, the
world moves faster and changes faster, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, whether we are in the public or the private
sector, whether our business is big or small, we are constantly
reminded of the need for vigilance and good forward planning.
Service-providers are usually expected to have a Plan B, C, or
even E at hand to forestall mishaps," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
As a government has to have contingency plans to deal with
natural disasters, epidemics, accidents caused by men and machine
etc., even a small neighborhood store has to plan against the
possible dangers of fire, burglary, electricity failure or goods
lost in delivery. All businesses and public agencies must
understand the importance of planning for eventualities, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has had to cope with some very serious challenges
from unexpected quarters in the past 15 months and the pressure
has often come from influences beyond our control," Chan said,
hinting such unexpected happenings such the regional financial
crises and its consequences.
</P>
<P>
The government and civil servants must get themselves better
prepared for anything that is possible and an expert advice will
help a lot, she said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar, chaired by SAR's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, were corporate representatives, academics,
professionals and government officials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Committed to Restoring Growth, Confidence in Asia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here Saturday that the United States will intensify its efforts to
speed economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alan Larson, who is on a tour
in Asia centering on Asia's financial crisis, said Saturday
morning that the United States has a responsibility to lead in
organizing an effective international response to the biggest
financial crisis the international community faces in fifty years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast meeting organized by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham), Larson said that the
economy of the United States is strong, but America cannot expect
to remain indefinitely an island of prosperity in a sea of
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the United States has a stake in working to
restore financial stability and growth in economies whose people
are our friends, customers, and security partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Larson said that U.S. President Bill Clinton has asked
Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin to enhance efforts to explore
comprehensive plans to help Asian corporations work their way out
of debt problems that are preventing them from making products and
creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
Larson went on to say that trade has been an engine of growth
for Asia and the United States must do everything it can to ensure
that trade finance -- the lubricant for the trade engine -- is
available.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the U.S. Export Import Bank is increasing
commitments to provide critical inputs to development projects
which augment growth in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As President Clinton said, we have to be ready to respond,
with financial force if necessary, if the currency crisis spreads
to other economies where nations have struggled to do the right
thing," Larson noted.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready, if necessary, to activate the General
Arrangement to Borrow and we will leave no stone unturned in our
effort to secure Congressional support for meeting our obligations
to the International Monetary Fund," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is committed to strengthening trade and
financial institutions that are so essential to the world economy
at large.
</P>
<P>
The United States looks forward to hosting the next ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization next year and "we will
press for renewed commitments to trade expansion at the APEC
meeting in November this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Next month the United States will host a meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors from the G-7 and key emerging
economies to develop a report on strengthening the world financial
system.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn to tap the energy of free capital movements in a
safe, sustainable manner," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Larson said a couple of years ago, everyone was looking
confidently toward the "Century of the Pacific." Today, people
hear voices of doubt and pessimism about the future. "We can not
give in to those voices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let me assure you that America will work alongside you to
overcome the current problems. We want to be Asia's partner in
prosperity. Working together we can make the "Century of the
Pacific" a reality," Larson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered here Saturday the Department of Energy to freeze a
fresh plan to jack up power rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has instructed Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui
to freeze the National Power Corporation's rate adjustment plan so
as not to further burden ordinary Filipinos reeling from the
ever-spiraling cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Although such a power rate adjustment is necessary, the
president said, the government will move back this plan as far as
possible in view of the present economic difficulties caused by
the ongoing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I told Energy Secretary Tiaoqui not to increase power rates.
There is a plan because a rate increase is needed, but we are
putting that off as far as possible," Estrada said.

Zealand is estimated to reach more than 20 billion NZ dollars
(about 10 billion U.S. dollars) by year 2020.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures recently released by the New Zealand
Ministry of Education, in a little more than a decade New Zealand
students will borrow from the student loans scheme more than one
billion NZ dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
By 2020, students are projected to draw down 1.3 billion NZ
dollars a year from the scheme, more than double the 577 million
NZ dollars borrowed last year.
</P>
<P>
They will then have a collective debt of more than 20 billion
NZ dollars, about one fifth of New Zealand's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
GDP is the value of all goods and services produced in an
economy. In New Zealand, GDP is currently just under 89 billion NZ
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education figures show that total outstanding
debt, now more than 2.4 billion NZ dollars, will top three
billion next year and four billion by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government has been reviewing "problem areas"
in the student loans scheme. It is said that there are incidences
of students' borrowing money for non-educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
The review, which began in May, looks at whether parental
consent should be required for students under 18.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Launches Six Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday called on officials of integrated economic
development zones to prevent these projects from displacing the
local people, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"All our efforts to develop these economic zones would be in
vain if the people could not enjoy their results," Habibie said in
Manado, capital of North Sulawesi province, during the launch of
six economic zones built in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The economic zones, developed by the Indonesian government and
domestic and foreign investors, are located in the Manado-Bitung
area (North Sulawesi), Sasamba (East Kalimantan), Batu Licin
(South Kalimantan), Sanggau (West Kalimantan), Mbay (East Nusa
Tenggara) and Sabang (Aceh).
</P>
<P>
"Amid the presence of domestic and foreign investors, local
businessmen and people might feel displaced due to their lack of
skills," the president said, warning that this could cause social
problems.
</P>
<P>
He also urged investors in the economic zones to build good
relations with local businessmen and pay attention to the plight
of local farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the president launched the observance of
1998 as International Maritime Year, saying this should increase
the people's awareness of the importance of the ocean to their
lives.
</P>
<P>
He said the preservation of marine resources is being
threatened by over-exploitation following technological
achievements.

<HEADLINE> Iran Appoints Spokesman as Ambassador to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has been appointed as ambassador to
Britain after Tehran and London agreed to improve their relations,
local daily Iran News revealed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreement reached between Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi and his British counterpart Robin Cook in
New York on Thursday, Mohammadi will soon assume the post of
Iran's ambassador to Britain, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi had been appointed as Iran's charges d'affaires in
London prior to the improvement of bilateral relations, but he had
not yet left for London as the two countries were discussing
updating their relations.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi is expected to help the two countries successfully
implement their new policies aimed at further expansion of
economic, cultural and political relations, said the daily.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Tehran and London were strained in 1989
after late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
issued a religious decree against the life of British writer
Salman Rushdie, author of the controversial novel the Satanic
Verses.
</P>
<P>
The two countries resumed their diplomatic relations at the
level of charges d'affaires in September, 1990. Cook and Kharrazi
on Thursday agreed to put aside the Rushdie issue in order to
promote bilateral relations to the ambassadorial level.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Production Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) decreased its production to 282,833 tons of copper
during the year ended last March from 320,446 tons in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
A ZCCM spokesman disclosed Friday that during the same period,
the conglomerate's cobalt production reduced by more than 20 percent,
falling to 4,016 tons from 5,126 tons in the previous year, Times
of Zambia reported Saturday..
</P>
<P>
Copper prices suffered a severe decline on the London Metal
Exchange from the latter half of the 1997 calendar year from 1.25
U.S. Dollars per pound in June 1997 to 0.74 Dollars per pound in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Due to low metal production and low metal realization prices,
the ZCCM group "recorded an operating loss of 235,823 million
Kwacha (about 120 million U.S. Dollars in terms of the current
exchange rate) for exchange losses, 89,153 million Kwacha (about
45 million Dollars) of interest charges and credit of interest
income," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that directors of the conglomerate even did not declare a
dividend in the financial year ended on March 31.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM once produced more than 700,000 tons of copper per year
in the 1970s and it has been losing its production momentum in
the past years owing to little inputs, backward techniques,
obsolete equipments and sluggish world markets.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said earlier that the conglomerate loses one
million to two million U.S. Dollars everyday to maintain its
production which is at a very low level.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Up in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of the jobless in
Vietnam has risen to 2.66 million this year, or seven percent of
the 38 million labor force, Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rising unemployment rate, which was 5.88 percent of a 36
million labor force, or an equivalent of 2.1 million people in
1996, has put an increasing strain on the socio-economic
development, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The rate is even higher in major cities and industrial areas,
8.4 percent in the capital city of Hanoi, 8.6 percent in Ho Chi
Minh City, 8.11 percent in the northern port city of Hai Phong,
9.36 and 9.33 percent in the northern provinces of Nam Dinh and
Quang Ninh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, due to the recent prolonged droughts, about 17,500
laborers in agriculture had to sit idle for 30 percent of the
working days in 1998, said the report, which also attributed the
worsened situation in the country to the current regional
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government has approved a program on national employment
last July with a target to create five million jobs by the year
2000. The move is aimed at reducing the unemployment rate in urban
areas to five percent, the report added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana has appealed to the U.N. Security Council to
convene a world conference on terrorism, according to a Kenya
Times report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special session of the U.N. Security Council on
the situation in Africa Thursday in New York, Godana called on
the international community to make more concerted and
comprehensive efforts to remove terrorism so that tragedies like
what happened in east Africa last month will not return.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, two bomb blasts aimed at the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam killed more than 260 people and wounded
about 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Kenya currently is a non-permanent member of the council.
</P>
<P>
Bonaya stressed the intrinsic linkage between peace
and development, noting that the challenges Africa faces demand a
comprehensive response.
</P>
<P>
"This relationship between peace, security and development is
one that we in Africa have for many years emphasized at many
fora. Without peace and stability. There can be no development
and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said in the past years, a lack of resolve
has led to "unfortunate blemish" on the U.N. relationship with
Africa, recalling U.N.'s failed operations in Somalia,
non-intervention in the Rwanda genocide and the hestitation to
intervene in the former Zaire and Congo (Brazaville).
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya has the "fervent hope that the current
re-assessment by the council with regard to its charter
obliagations would make it possible for the council to avoid such
moments of indecisiveness when faced with similar situations."
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. Security Council to establish a clear
criteria for authorizing peacekeeping and enforcement action
whenever and whereever conflicts arise.

<HEADLINE> China Possesses Depth in Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China served notice that she
is an ever growing major force in the gymnastic world with
considerable depth by turning in masterly displays in the China
Cup tournament which came to an end here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The home crowd was treated to spirited performances from
China's next waves of gymnasts, capturing 13 out of 14 gold
medals up for grabs and attracting a profusion of praises from
the visiting top officials of Internation Gymnastics Federation
(FIG).
</P>
<P>
Hardy Fink, president of FIG's Men's Technical Committee
(MTC), was convinced that China is "absolutely standing
world-class" and "will remain world champions for many, many
years" after watching the guest gymnasts had to content
themselves with just one gold, five silvers and six bronzes.
</P>
<P>
The last night's most shining star, 15-year-old Ling Jie from
Hunan province, whose impeccable routines on beam and uneven bars
earned her two meet-high 9.850s and a pair of golds, was hugely
admired by Fink's women counterpart in FIG.
</P>
<P>
"She is bright, cheery, exciting, energetic, childlike but
professional in her presentation," Jackie Fie, president of
Women's Technical Committee (WTC) said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day China Cup proved the host has Ling Jies in galore.
Women's all-round champion Rao Meizhen, women's floor titlist
Huang Mandan, men's all-round gold medalist Huang Xu, pommel
horse champion Zhao Sheng and parallel bars champion Li Xiaopeng,
all of them no more than 20 years old, all of them talented and
ambitious in the new Olympic cycle.
</P>
<P>
"You have a big depth in this country with your gymnasts," Fie
told the reporters.
</P>
<P>
Her words were echoed by the prestigous "International
Gymnastics" magazine, whose publisher Paul Ziert said earlier
this year after watching the American Cup and Internation Team
Championship "...I have finally come to the realization that the
Chinese gymnasts program is light years ahead of the rest of the
world. Not only do their men and women show incredible attention
to detail in the technical area, but they have such an amazing
variety of difficult skills that make most of the other gymnasts'
routines look like compulsory exercise."
</P>
<P>
"We have a promising new generation of gymnasts, both men and
women," Zhang Jian, vice president of the Chinese Gymnastics
Association (CGA) said.
</P>
<P>
But what turned the Chinese team into a formidable package is
its perfect blend of experienced old guards and refreshing new
kids on the block. In the national championships for September
15-20 also here, two familiar names rang loud again as veterans
Zhang Jinjing, 21-year-old world and World Cup bars champion, and
Liu Xuan, 19-year-old World Cup beam champion, defied the strong
challenges from youngsters to secure the men and women's
individual all-round titles respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Our old athletes still maintain a very high competitive level
while the young gymnasts are moving ahead at a rapid rate, " Gao
Jian, another vice-president of CGA remarked.
</P>
<P>
Maybe some would say that it's harsh to judge from the China
Cup since it could hardly claim to be a showcase of the world's
bests with no Russian gymnasts present and other participating
countries apparently not sending their first-string teams.
</P>
<P>
However, the tournament at least offered the host nation an
opportunity to evaluate Japan and DPR Korea, their main rivals at
the Bangkok Asian Games this December, who did dispatch their top
gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Isao Yoneda, who clinched the men's horizontal bar
title last night while two Chinese gymnasts Huang Xu and Lu Yufu
both flubbed their routines, will be the man to reckon with at
the Bangkok Games.
</P>
<P>
China has targetted 8-10 golds in gymnastics in Bangkok, a
goal described by Zhang Jian as "realistic but only can be
achieved by fighting hard".
</P>
<P>
The Asian gymnastics heavyweights only let one of a total of
14 golds slip away from their hands at the Hiroshima Asian Games
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Improvement Needed for 1999 Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The competitive environment
for next year's gymnastics World Championships needs to be
improved, a top International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)
official warned the host city Tianjin here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Fie, the visiting president of Women's Technical
Committee (WTC), told the Tianjin organizers that they must pay
enough attention to the air condition in the stadium of the
Tianjin Sports Center, after she watched the China Cup
international gymnastics tournament for two successive days in it.
</P>
<P>
"Last night it's really bad in here, very bad," Fie said after
the tournament came to an end on Friday night, "It's not really
easy to breathe when you are working out."
</P>
<P>
The 8,000-seat stadium, which will act as the competitive hall
for next year's Worlds slated for October 8-16, was full of
smothering dust on the first night of the two-day China Cup. The
airing seemed to have stopped and people just feel suffocated.
</P>
<P>
"The enviroment in this stadium is not good. If next year it's
packed with 8,000 spectators, it will be a big, big problem,"
Swiss coach Michael-Goetz Glitscher said.
</P>
<P>
The discomfort also got to his Chinese counterpart. "The
condition here is too poor and unbearable," Huang Yubin, head
coach of the Chinese team, said. "I feel ashamed in the face of
so many foreign guests."
</P>
<P>
But things seemed to be fixed out last night, with less dust
and more fresh air in the Sports Center stadium.
</P>
<P>
Fie, who was on tour here with her men's counterpart Hardy
Fink in FIG to inspect the preparation work by the organizing
committee, also made recommendations about the colour skin on the
floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit too drabby." Fie said, "We should make it
more eye-catching."
</P>
<P>
But otherwise, Fie said she was very impressed by the
organizers' work, citing they have a "wonderful start" for next
year's gymnastics gala.
</P>
<P>
"They have a qualified and comprehensive start," she said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific to Fly in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific
will begin flying domestic routes in the Philippines next week to
fill the void left by the collapse of Philippine Airlines.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with their chief executive who assured me that they
are ready to help on a temporary basis to cover the flight
shortage," the president said, adding that Cathay Pacific will
start sending five large Airbus aircraft here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"That will make up for the shortage of flights of Philippine
Airlines so we should not worry that we will lack planes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cathay Pacific can not fly all the domestic routes
left by Philippine Airlines which had an 80 percent share of the
domestic market. Three local airlines will join Cathay Pacific in
flying these routes.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Philippine Airlines was the Philippines'
national flag carrier and the oldest airlines in Asia. It closed
at midnight Wednesday due to heavy losses and the breakdown of
talks between the management and the labor union.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader on NLD's Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the ruling Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC), has spoken fiercely about the National League for
Democracy's (NLD) move of forming a people's parliament and
planning to convene a people's parliament itself.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a Special Refresher Course for Basic
Education Teachers here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt was quoted by Saturday's official newspaper New
Light of Myanmar as saying that "the NLD, with a view to seizing
power through shortcut, is opposing all the existing laws and
acting in a lawless manner."
</P>
<P>
"The convening of a people's parliament can be carried out by
the current legal government, and only the SPDC recognized by the
 international community and the United Nations is able to carry
out issuing, amending and revoking of laws," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The government will be tolerating the unlawful acts
with magnanimity as long as there is no harm to the state and the
people."
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the NLD formed a ten-member Committee
Representing the People's Parliament Elected in the 1990 General
Election to arrange for the convening of a people's parliament.
NLD Chairman U Aung Shwe was chosen as the committee's chairman
with U Than Tun and U Aye Tha Aung as secretaries. Other members
include NLD Vice Chairman U Tin Oo and NLD General Secretary Aung
San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
A people's parliament was also formed unilaterally on the same
day by the committee, and U Saw Mya Aung, chairman of the Rakhine
League for Democracy (RLD), was elected chairman of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here Thursday by the NLD, a
total of 921 NLD members including 200 parliament
representatives-elect and 721 organizers have been detained by the
authorities since May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election participated in by 93 political
parties, the NLD won 396 parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
But no parliament emerged at the end of the election, the
committee announcement said last week.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Faces Long Haul, Say NZ Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand economists
predict that the recessionary conditions for their country's
economy are expected to prevail for at least a year before it
stages a solid recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, quoted some local
economists as saying that New Zealanders could still expect
"rising unemployment, little or nothing in the way of wage rises,
static or falling house prices, and a depressed sharemarket"
during the next year.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to have a big export-led recovery while the
rest of the world is slowing," Bank of New Zealand economist Peter
Jolly said Friday.
</P>
<P>
House prices would stay flat, wages growth would slow and the
unemployment rate would rise above 8.5 percent by March next year,
Jolly said. That would equate to more than 20,000 people joining
the ranks of the unemployed, taking the total above 163,000, from
143,000 recorded in June.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust chief economist David Plank said he did not
expect a significant economic recovery till the middle of next
year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Air New Zealand economist David Drage said the recovery would
be slow and gradual, spanning the next 12 to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> HK Airline to Help Philippines with Chartered Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flagship
airline, Cathay Pacific Airways, will start next Monday to operate
chartered flights in the Philippines to fill the void left by the
closure of the latter's leading airline this week.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific announced in a press release here Saturday that
it had agreed to provide chartered services at the request of the
Philippine President to help support the country's domestic air
network.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines ended its half-century operation Wednesday
after negotiations collapsed between management and union on a
recovery plan for the airline. It used to handle about 80 percent
of domestic flights and about 55 percent of all passenger traffic
in the Philippine. After its breakdown, three of the country's
smaller airlines promised to boost their carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
Philip Chen, chief operating officer of Cathay Pacific, said
Saturday: "We are pleased to be able to help maintain aviation
services around the Philippines during this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong airline will start with 10 domestic chartered
flights a day to link key cities in the Philippines, and may add
destinations and frequencies as needed in the future.
</P>
<P>
In response to reports that Cathay Pacific may get involved in
taking over the operation of Philippine Airlines, Chen said: "Our
initial focus is on providing sufficient charter capacity, it is
too early to talk about what developments may occur beyond that."
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific currently operates 38 international round-trip
flights a week between Hong Kong and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Disburse Agri-Loan to Flood-Affected Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
begin this week to disburse a large amount of agri-loan, with a
view to rehabilitating the flood-affected farmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of 32.69 billion taka (about 695.53 million
U.S. dollars) for agri-loan could make flood-affected farmers
minimize their huge crop loss by producing rice without facing any
financial problem, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper Saturday
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The worst-ever flooding in a century in Bangladesh that gripped
as much as two thirds of the country for ten weeks washed away 1.3
million hectares of paddy-field and paddy-seedlings, causing a
loss of two million tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Since the flood waters have receded in 39 of the 52 flood-hit
districts, thousands of farmers are crying for cash incentives for
buying rice seedlings and seeds.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Finance Ministry has directed the nationalized
banks and agro-based development institutes to start disbursement
of farm loan without going through the usual time consuming
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The agri-loan will be disbursed through the branches of four
nationalized commercial banks, two specialized banks, one
cooperative bank and one agro-based development institute, in
accordance with the Finance Ministry's decision.
</P>
<P>
The loans would be provided to the flood-affected farmers to
buy seeds and seedlings, cattle, tractors and other inputs for
farming, a high-level bank official said, adding that all the
affected farmers including those who got agri-loan earlier and
failed to repay it due to the flood would be eligible to obtain
fresh loan.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has already asked the high-level bankers
of the nationalized banks to start visiting the flood-hit areas
across the country to keep surveillance on the disbursement of
farm loan, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture has directed the
Agriculture Expansion Department for taking necessary measures to
bring at least one million hectares of land under paddy crop to
minimize the crop damage caused by the flood.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also outlined a 10.03 billion taka (about
213.4 million dollars) program to help rehabilitate the
flood-affected farmers.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian mining giant
Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd (BHP) has put off plans to set
up a 300 million US dollar steel project in India due to the Asian
downturn, the BHP company sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
BHP, which got an approval from India's Foreign Investment
Promotion Board (FIPB) only last week to invest in downstream
ventures, had decided to keep its plans to set up plants in
Chennai and Druhera near New Delhi, capital of India, for making
refined steel.
</P>
<P>
BHP had obtained the FIPB and other clearances for setting up
the 300-million dollar steel project two and a half years ago and
had even acquired land for the projects when the Asian crisis
started.
</P>
<P>
The BHP's planned plants were to manufacture construction
materials like corrugated colored sheets from semi-finished steel.

BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) has vowed to maintain its promotional activities in
Japan, its largest overseas market, to minimize the impact of the
country's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
A TAT press release available Saturday quoted TAT governor Seri

arriving.

<HEADLINE> Albania Concerned Over Kosovo Refugees in Montenegro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano Friday expressed his concern over the situation of Albanian
refugees in Montenegro who were forced to leave from their homes
in Kosovo after the armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Montenegrin President Milo Gjukanovic, Nano
extended his appreciation to the Montenegrin government for its
work in coping with the humanitarian situation after the arrival
of thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a province of Serbia within the Federal Repubic of
Yugoslavia, where ethnic Albanians. who make up 90 percent of the
province's 2 million people, is seeking independence from
Yugoslavia. The conflict broke out in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Nano also expressed his concern over "several operations
carried out recently by the Montenegrin border authorities with
regard to blocking the Kosovo refugees at border check points and
sending them to third countries, or with the refusal to offer them
the necessary assistance in several cases", reported the Albanian
Telegraph Agency (ATA).
</P>
<P>
Nano also appealed to the Montenegrin government to stop such
actions and provide necessary treatment for the refugees according
to international practice.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Injects More Funds into Education Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An additional 2.5 billion
baht (62.5 million U.S. dollars) will be allocated to the
education and university affairs ministries for various education
loan schemes, the Bangkok Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Bunyarat Wongyai, director of the
Education Ministry's education loan program, as saying that the
Finance Ministry has agreed to allocate the additional budget to
help alleviate the hardship of needy students whose parents are
hard-hit by the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Under the new loan allocation, the Education Ministry's loan
scheme will receive 1.67 billion baht (41.67 million dollars)
while the University Affairs Ministry's loan program will be given
833.34 million baht (20.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bunyarat said he would submit a list of loan applicants next
week to the Education Ministry. Over 180,000 students had put in
requests for loans amounting to 4.7 billion baht (117.5 million
dollars) to finance their education.
</P>
<P>
According to him, priority will be given to students whose
families earn less then 120,000 baht (3,000 dollars) a year.
Students from families earning between 120,000 and 150,000 baht
(3,000-3,750 dollars) will be the next group to benefit from the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry scheme, set up three years ago, has been
flooded with loan applications from students of all levels.
</P>
<P>
The additional funds become necessary since if no such funds
are allocated, a sharp rise in the number of school dropouts can
be expected, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches National Tree Planting Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
Saturday inaugurated a national tree planting campaign to mark the
National Tree Planting Day which falls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Forest Department Saturday distributed more than 500,000
trees for planting. Arrangements have also been made to plant
100,000 bamboo plants in river banks, marshy lands and other
selected areas prone to high erosion.
</P>
<P>
Schools, government and non-governmental organizations will
also participate in the campaign, Ministry of Environment sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Areas which harbor historical temples and other valuable
archaeological sites have also been selected for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
The tree planting campaign is considered vital to sustaining
the country's agro forestry which has been denuded in recent years
both by man and the nature, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Forest cover of Sri Lanka has dropped to the current 24 percent
from 70 percent at the start of this century due to population
expansion and clearing of jungles to open commercial crops and for
new development projects.
</P>
<P>
The plundering of the country's forest resources for timber has
caused an imbalance in the country's rainfall pattern and
consequently adversely affected the hydro electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
Natural erosion in swamps and mangroves have also affected
several parts of the country. The tree planting campaign was
launched in order to establish an ecological balance.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon to Pull Sensitive Information off Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon on Friday
ordered the pulling of sensitive information off its Internet
sites in consideration of national and personnel security.
</P>
<P>
Troop movements, weapons development, social security numbers
and reviews that could reveal secrets to adversaries will be
included in the measure announced by Deputy Secretary of Defense
John Hamre.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department's 1,000 publicly accessible World Wide
Web sites may be stripped down further by the end of the year
after a Pentagon-wide review of data that was being thrown out
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
John Hamre said he recently became aware that some web sites
were offering "too much detail on DOD (Department of Defense)
capabilities, infrastructure, personnel and operation procedures".
</P>
<P>
"Such details, especially when combined with information from
other sources, may increase the vulnerability of DOD systems and
potentially be used to threaten or harass DOD personnel and their
families," Hamre said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He ordered immediate removal of personal data from Internet
sites pending results of the review in November. Specifics also
were eliminated on military movements, the location of units,
installations or personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said in a statement that the department must
assess the information posted on public DOD Web sites to ensure
national security is not compromised or personnel placed at risk.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has been using the Internet to spread information
to members of the military serving around the world to speed up
business and eliminate paperwork for contracts and administration.
</P>
<P>
On Pentagon web sites, maps and floor plans of military
facilities can be reviewed and details about what new weapons do
can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon fears that enemies of the United States such as
terrorists, adversarial governments, members of organized crime
and drug traffickers could find the Pentagon sites a treasure
trove of useful information.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's unclassified computers were hit by the most
organized and systematic attack in February, targeting mostly
personnel records, and last year, hackers penetrated medical data
banks at veterans hospitals and changed blood types in soldiers'
records, it was reported.

reasonable proposal" for their territorial dispute soon.
</P>
<P>
He said "we are nearing a reasonable proposal" for the two

<HEADLINE> Employment in Italy Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobs in Italy grew
by 115,000 in July, 0.6 more than the same month in 1997, the
National Statistics Institute (Istat) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of people looking for work rose by 80,000
to boost the rate of unemployment in July from 11.7 percent to
11.9 percent,
</P>
<P>
The increase in July meant that the number of people holding
jobs in the country rose to 20,425,000 and the seasonally adjusted
data showed a gain of 76,000, or 0.4 percent, over April this
year, said Istat.
</P>
<P>
The indications of recovery were especially strong in the
depressed southern regions where the number of jobs grow by
44,000, or 0.8 percent, to return employment to levels last seen
in the Mezzogiorno four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Istat said progress on this front was especially noticeable for
women and young people.
</P>
<P>
For unemployment, the more favorable jobs trend convinced new
job-seekers to enter the market in numbers which could not be
absorbed, said Istat.
</P>
<P>
The number of people looking for work rose 0.7 percent over
April this year, according to the seasonally adjusted data, and
rose to 2,768,000 in July, an increase of three percent over July
last year.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment held steady from
April through July.
</P>
<P>
The decline in jobs in agriculture continued with a fall-off of
2.2 percent in jobs in July, compared to July 1997, with most of
the losses accounted for by wage-earning farmhands.
</P>
<P>
In industry, the number of jobs in July was down 26,000, or 0.4
percent, compared to July last year, and the number of jobs in the
services sector rose by 174,000 or 1.4 percent, said Istat.

ROUSSE (Bulgaria), September 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime
Minister Ivan Kostov and his Romanian counterpart Radu Vasile
agreed on the finalization of agreements on trade and borders on
Friday during talks in the Danube town of Rousse.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers agreed on the way to structure the dialogue
between their executives through a series of ministerial meetings,
Kostov said in a joint news conference with Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Vasile announced that he and Kostov were concerned by the drop
in bilateral trade, but were convinced that it would get a boost
under the free trade regime of the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA) which covers seven central European counties.
</P>
<P>
The pair said they were prepared for the Monday meeting on
Caspian oil and for the October meeting of the mixed
Bulgarian-Romanian Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Vasile announced the commencement of the updating of the Danube
border with the first expert meeting in Bucharest and of expert
negotiations in Sofia on the Black Sea shelf border.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that work on agreements for the reciprocal
recognition of diplomas and for the establishment of a Bulgarian
school in Bucharest and of a Wallacian school in Sofia should be
expedited. A shared agreement was reached that the two countries'
culture ministries should address the issue of cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
They talked about their shared opinion that the two countries
should try to integrate with the European Union not through
rivalry, but cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also voiced their concern over the turn of events in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of a Bulgarian-Romanian bank is to be postponed
due to problems in the Bulgarian banking system and to the
upcoming privatization of the Romanian bank that is to participate
in the joint financial institution, it emerged after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Free Trade Plan To Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN member countries could
delay implementing the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by three years
because of the economic downturn sweeping the region.
</P>
<P>
A delay in the implementation schedule might be necessary to
allow recession-hit members to recover, Saturday's Bangkok Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
Members of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
had set 2000 as the target for trade liberalization under AFTA to
help attract trade and capital flows to the region away from other
trade blocs.
</P>
<P>
As part of AFTA, most tariffs on regional trade would be
reduced to 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
An ASEAN coordination committee discussed a delay in AFTA at a
meeting earlier this month, the report quoted Charnchai
Musiknisakorn, deputy director of Thailand's Fiscal Policy Office,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations will be deliberated by the AFTA Council on
October 6 in Manila. Thailand will be represented by Supachai
Panitchpakdi, deputy prime minister and commerce minister.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members will also meet in December in Vietnam to discuss
the group's vision for the future under the present economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai said that although a delay for AFTA might occur,
ASEAN still agreed that final tariff rates in the trade area would
be 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the coordination committee had agreed that four other
issues remained to be deliberated by ASEAN trade ministers,
including the question of how many agricultural items would be
deemed sensitive and excluded from tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
The second topic concerns the general exception list, or
products completely excluded from tariff reductions under AFTA.
Currently 26 products are listed.
</P>
<P>
The coordination committee felt that no exceptions should be
made at all. Most of the products on the exception list such as
video game consoles are goods which have virtually no trade within
the region.
</P>
<P>
Members are fully able to issue laws or internal controls
regulating trade of such products already, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The third topic to be raised for discussion by trade ministers
concerns transferring goods on the temporary exclusion list to the
normal liberalization scheme, most likely in phase-in periods.
</P>
<P>
The last item for discussion concerns 15 categories scheduled
for fast track liberalization, and whether delays may be required
for tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Brunei, Singapore, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Two Australians Found Dead As State Runs Out of Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Victoria is fast becoming
the gasless state in Australia, and a 300 U.S. dollar penalty is
in force for anyone caught using a domestic or gas appliance
following the massive fire which killed two workers at the state's
major gas plant.
</P>
<P>
One body was found Friday night and the other was found early
Saturday morning in the massive fire at the Esso plant near Sale,
about 180 km southeast of Melbourne, local police said in a brief
statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eight others were injured Friday in the fire, which has not yet
be put out Saturday. Police evacuated houses within a 5 km radius
of the plant Friday, involving 120 residents.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which supplies 80 percent of gas to Victoria, one of
the leading business and industrial centers in Australia, was
still shut down Saturday as firefighters continued to fight a
massive blaze which broke out at 12.30pm (local time) Friday after
a series of explosion.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters were using "offensive tactics" on the blaze,
working in cooperation with Esso employees Saturday morning to
cool down equipment so gas supply valves could be shut down.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate the fire should be brought under control within 12
hours, and the blaze is diminishing by 50 percent every six
hours," a local fire fighting department spokesman said Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Victoria's gas supply authority VENCorp has invoked emergency
laws, ordering all industry and home owners to stop using gas to
maintain supplies.
</P>
<P>
As Victoria state runs out of gas, no non-essential gas
consumers are exempt, including restaurants, hotels and bakeries,
and car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Friday night's late shift at Toyota's plants were sent home and
unless normal supplies resumed on Monday there would be no work
for the company's 2,600 employees, a Toyota company spokesman

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A two-day informal meeting of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers to discuss
possible military action in Kosovo ended in the southern
Portuguese resort town of Vilamoura on Friday.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana expressed NATO's "strong
support" for a U.N. resolution demanding an end to violence in the
Serbian province of Kosovo and threatening further action if
fighting continued. The U.N. Security Council passed the Kosovo
resolution on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Council also asked the NATO member countries
to be ready for military strikes against Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The NATO defense ministers met after the North Atlantic Council
decided to request an air force for possible action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation alliance issued an "activation warning", saying
air forces would be required for "both the limited air option and
a phased air campaign in Kosovo".
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-year Loan Agreement with Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a three-year loan agreement worth about 840
million US dollars with Bulgaria, the Government Information
Service said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement Bulgaria will receive 627,062,000 special
drawing rights, which are used as a substitute for gold in
international payments.
</P>
<P>
The first of 12 instalments, about 70 million dollars, will be
released immediately. The second instalment will be received in
mid-November depending on the country's economic performance. The
rest will be made available quarterly until May 2001.
</P>
<P>
The three-year agreement is a logical continuation of the
previous standby arrangement, the first accepted by Bulgaria, the
Information Service said.
</P>
<P>
In the latest review of the standby arrangement, the IMF
praised the Bulgarian Government, urging it to carry on its stable
macroeconomic policy and structural reforms aimed at stabilization
and growth, IMF Mission Leader for Bulgaria Anne McGuirk wrote in
her report.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria achieved a remarkable turnaround after the financial
crisis in early 1997 by adopting an economic policy which broke
with the past and drew considerable external support, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
McGuirk called the achievements in stabilization "impressive".
</P>
<P>
She said that economic development remained positive in 1998
despite obstacles arising from the crisis in emerging markets.
Economic recovery was continuing as evidenced by the fact that the
gross domestic product would be higher, and the inflation rate
lower, than projected in the 1998 Budget Act, the report said.
GDP growth is projected to exceed 4 percent.

<HEADLINE>   U.S. House Panel to Release More Starr Material </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to release audio
tapes that Linda Tripp made of her conversations with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The panel also agreed to make public thousands of secret
documents that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr gathered as part
of his eight-month investigation into President Bill Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The panel members met in a day-long, closed-door session as
Clinton accused Republicans of placing "partisanship over
progress, politics over people".
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called the president's
remarks "a gratuitous slap".
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our work," said Lott. "What he's trying to do is
distract attention from his problems."
</P>
<P>
Members of the Judiciary Committee debated behind closed doors
how to handle the release of tens of thousands of pages compiled
by Starr. Material to be released next Thursday includes grand
jury testimony by Clinton's secretary Betty Currie, his friend,
Vernon Jordan, and Tripp who first alerted Starr to the president
and the Lewinsky's relationnhip.
</P>
<P>
The tapes of Tripp's phone conversations with Lewinsky will be
released sometime after Thursday, to give experts time to edit out
portions the committee deemed inappropriate for public release.
</P>
<P>
Several officials said the committee proceedings were less
partisan than last week, when Republicans forced the release of
some of the sexually explicit material that Democrats proposed
deleting.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans rejected a call from Democrats to have Starr
give lawmakers the remainder of the material he has collected, and
lawmakers sparred verbally at the microphones after emerging from
the committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Democrats suggested that Republicans had retreated in the face
of public opinion polls indicating the public wants the issue
concluded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
A CBS-New York Times poll, released Thursday night, reported
that Clinton's overall standing has improved with the public since
the release of his grand jury videotape on Monday, and criticism
of the committee's handling of the investigation has risen.
</P>
<P>
The decision to release additional documents was a foregone
conclusion, and the bulk of the material is expected to be made
public next Thursday, when the committee also plans to hear its
own lawyers methodically present Starr's evidence of potentially
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
That will be followed by a committee vote on October 5 or 6 on
whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Assuming committee
approval, the full house will vote on the issue later that week,

<HEADLINE> Two New Planets Found Outside Solar System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers aided by
an amateur have found two new planets orbiting Sun-like stars,
bringing the total number of confirmed extra-solar system planets
to 12.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Washington Post, Geoffrey Marcy,
of San Francisco State University and the University of California
at Berkeley, and his team detected the new planets with the
powerful Keck telescope in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
The first planet, located around a star known only as HD210277,
68 light-years away in the direction of the constellation
Aguarius, is about the mass of Jupiter. This means it is most
likely another giant gas planet with no hard surface.
</P>
<P>
The second newly discovered planet, whipping around its star
HD187123 which is 154 light years away in the direction of Cygnus,
is at the smallest distance found so far -- one twenty-fifth the
distance of Earth from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
They said that none of the planets had orbits like Earth's.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Receives Medical Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson is undergoing
a
various of tests to determine whether he is psychologically fit
to return to the boxing ring at the Massachusetts General
Hospital, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's evaluation requires him to answer hundreds of
questions from psychiatrists and neuropsychologists. He was to
have electrodes strapped to his head, an MRI scan his brain for
abnormalities and explain to doctors what he sees in odd-shaped
ink blots, a report from AP said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson said with a smile: "Some people think I'm a psycho
because I bit that guy's ear off. I just want to let the Nevada
commission know I'm extremely sorry and I'm really a good guy."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edwin Homansky, who is overseeing Tyson's evaluation for
the Nevada Athletic Commission, said: "In New Jersey he was with
a psychiatrist for 45 minutes who commented he was like a teddy
bear in his office."
</P>
<P>
Tyson will undergo at least 10 examinations which among other
things, will measure his level of stress, social conformity,
suspiciousness, impulsive behavior and excitability.
</P>
<P>
The tests are exepcted to last three days. Robert Schleser, a
psychology professor, said he doubts the medical team will be
able to predict Tyson's behavior any better than a coin toss.
</P>
<P>
"This is a weird situation," he said. "There's no test that
specifically is going to tell you wheter a boxer is going to bite
someone's ear. That is why this is a huge task for these guys."
</P>
<P>
After the testing, the team of doctors will have to answer
several questions about Tyson's state of mind, which include: How
will Tyson handle unpredictable situations? What's his potential
to commit another major foul in the boxing ring? Will he be able
to avoid a repeat of the Holyfield ear-biting incdient?
</P>
<P>
If doctors say Tyson is normal, the Nevada commission is
expected to give him a new license on October 3.

<HEADLINE> NBA Offers New Proposal, Sticks to Hard Salary Cap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The NBA made a new
collective bargaining offer to the players union Friday, but the
union claimed it was almost the same as the owner's previous
proposal of the "hard" salary cap.
</P>
<P>
It was the first formal offer made by the owners since May 27.
The Players Association director Bill Hunter said he would
prepare a detailed response to be presented to the owners next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Once we respond, we'll decide collectively where we go from
there," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
If a new labor agreement is settled by the second week of
October, the 82-game regular season will be saved. The league
has already canceled 24 preseason games and postponed the start
of training camps indefinitely, and the players have been told to
expect the lockout to extend into December or even longer.
</P>
<P>
Union officials spent several hours reviewing the proposal
Friday after it was sent over from the NBA offices.
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to find out where they moved off their
last proposal," Hunter said. "Generally, it still deals with a
hard salary cap. They have not moved or retreated from their
position."
</P>
<P>
In the May 27 proposal, the owners asked for a four-year phase
out of the Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to exceed the
salary cap to retain their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
Owners also asked that the percentage of basketball-related
income went to player salaries be reduced from 57 to 48 percent.
The owners had the right to seek a new agreement once BRI rose
above 51.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hunter didn't reveal the details of the new offer. The
players made their last proposal on August 6, but the owners
responded by leaving the room.
</P>
<P>
The union's position is that they won't talk or bargain
anymore if the owners keep a policy of a hard salary cap and a ph
ase out of the Bird exception. But it is unclear if their stance
has changed or not.
</P>
<P>
"We will submit a comprehensive response and maybe a
counterproposal," Hunter said. "I don't want to discuss it any
more until I've had a chance to give my response to them first."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Maternity Mortality Rates Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's maternity
mortality rates have declined to 295 per 100,000 births, the
Jakarta Post Saturday quoted Minister of Health Faried Anfasa
Moeloek as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This achievement is closely tied to the success of the family
planning program and the midwife profession," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 12th congress of the Indonesian Midwives
Association in Bali on Friday, the minister said that midwives had
played a significant role in handling deliveries skillfully across
the country, particularly in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
In his 1998 accountability speech to the People's Consultative
Assembly, former president Soeharto said maternity mortality rates
had declined from 425 per 100,000 births in 1993 to 390 per
100,000 births in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Moeloek said, the government has also
trained traditional midwives and assigned professional midwives to
rural areas in an attempt to bring down maternity mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The country had 65,000 midwives and the government was still
trying to increase the quality and access of their services, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The congress attended by 889 people from across the country
also featured presentations on ways to improve midwifery services,
the paper said.

</P>
<P>
They said that neighbors tried to put out the fire with loose
earth because they had no water, but they failed to save the
children, all of them brothers and sisters, who were asleep inside
the house.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said that at the time of the fire the father of
the children was at work with his 16-year-old elder son.
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred in an area without basic services that had
been settled by some 130 low-income families of squatters.
</P>
<P>
It was the third such fire in the area. The two previous fires
razed all the houses, but fortunately there were no casualties.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Commends China's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger on Friday praised China for its ongoing
reforms and stressed the importance of cutting the international
flow of speculative capital.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger made the remarks at the World Economy Forum hosted by
the American magazine of Fortune in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
He said that China succeeded in carrying out economic reforms
in the frame of the original political system, while Russia,
supported by western countries, had first embarked on political
reform and become mired in financial crisis and heavy corruption.
</P>
<P>
Western countries could only wait patiently for the improvement
of Russia's economic situation while giving aid and advice, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger also urged a crackdown on global speculative
activity. The world was divided into economic zones and
governments stressed the importance of economic links in their
area, but the global flow speculative capital made economies hard
to control, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying
some of its traditional activities were "out of date". Many of
its suggestions only hindered the economic development and more
than once it had imposed purely economic solutions on countries in
crisis while neglecting their social and political conditions.

VIENNA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- EU finance ministers began a
three-day meeting here on Friday to discuss how the euro will be
represented in international forums and how Europe could help
resolve global economic crises.
</P>
<P>
The informal council of 11 Euro-zone finance ministers will in
particular discuss economic and budgetary forecasts, but also
structural deficits which the European Commission says are still
too high.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-11 meeting was also attended by ministers of the four
EU states which will not be in the first wave of monetary
union: Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The issue of who will represent the euro in institutions such
as the Group of Seven (G7) is a particularly thorny one.
</P>
<P>
The single European currency is scheduled to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European commissioner in charge of
the euro, said the Russian problem represented a "crisis", and
Europe had to take steps to prevent it spreading.

But the Nationalist Party, which won in the general elections on
September 5, resumed the application.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Distribution Monopoly Being Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A new film distributor has
been set up to halt the monopoly on films in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Ermei Film Distribution Co, Ltd. is a union of the
Sichuan Film Studio and Chengdu Film Corporation and will compete
with the Southwest Film Industry Corp. in film making and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese Administration of Film Industry, this
is the first time for China to have two distribution corporations
in one province and a spokesman said he believes that the
competition will open a new page in Chinese film history.
</P>
<P>
For years, China's film industry has stuck to the old practice
where film studios, distributors, and cinemas operate separately
and all films were released by China's Film Corporation and its
branches.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the monopoly was one of the major causes of a
lack of initiative in film studios and cinemas.
</P>
<P>
China's film industry had a big decline in 1992, with 6 of the
16 film studios suffering a loss.
</P>
<P>
Gao Honghu, secretary of the Chinese Film Association, says
that the reform in the film industry will mean a flexible system
to meet market economy developments.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Sticks to Tough Stance in European Super League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The soccer's world governing
body FIFA threatened on Friday to ban national associations,
clubs and players should they link with the proposed European
Super League.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, FIFA said it would use every means to prevent
any formation of a new league outside its auspices or those of
UEFA, European soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
"Soccer's principles are under attack by commercial companies,
with the agreement of certain prestigious clubs, which intend
primarily to make huge financial gains," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"One of the aims of FIFA, as stipulated in its statutes, is to
control every type of football, taking whatever steps are
appropriate to prevent infringement, improper practices and
abuse," it said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA president Sepp Blatter explained that those steps include
banning national associations, clubs and players taking part in
any new league from all international competitions.
</P>
<P>
However, FIFA could run into legal difficulties with the
European Union if it tried to suspend a national association on
account of a club's involvement with a proposed league outside
its control.
</P>
<P>
The new league is being proposed by a Milan-based media sales
group called Media Partners who are proposing that an initial
18-club league is formed and starts competing in the 2000-01
season.

<HEADLINE> Reform Improves Urban Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists point out that Deng Xiaoping formulated the policy
encouraging certain areas of the nation to gain initial prosperity
and in turn play a positive role in ensuring the even distribution
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
East China was the first to achieve relative prosperity and
remains the nation's most developed area.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 income of urbanites in the region was up 12-fold on
the level for 1981.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic categories, employees of private owned and
foreign-funded businesses enjoyed greater income increases than
their counterparts in state-owned and collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 income level for self-employed individuals and
employees of private and foreign-funded enterprises doubled that
of their contemporaries working for collectives and was 1.3-fold
more than the level for employees of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the income gap continues to expand. For
example, the average 1978 income level for high-income households,
or 20 percent of wage earners, doubled that of the low income wage
earners which account for the bottom 20 percent of the total. The
1997 ratio grew to 4.2:2.
</P>
<P>
Some people have gained wealth by either usurping social and
natural resources, trading power for money or evading taxes,
according to the report. The government has responded by
strengthening laws and regulations to safeguard the healthy
distribution of social wealth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese urbanites have
enjoyed continually improving living standards, with their
disposal income up 3.12-fold in real terms compared with only two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
A recent report issued by the State Statistics Bureau showed
that personal income has accounted for an increasingly greater
ratio of the gross domestic product (GDP) since the initiation of
reform in 1979. For example, personal income accounted for 69.1
percent of the 1995 GDP.
</P>
<P>
The reform drive was initiated in China's vast rural areas in
1979 and was introduced to urban areas in the late
1980s. Urbanites have enjoyed year-on-year 16.4 percent jumps in
average disposable income for ll straight years.
</P>
<P>
The central government has raised urban salaries nine times
since 1979, with total salaries for 1997 hitting 940.5 billion
yuan, up 16.4-fold on 1978.
</P>
<P>
Urbanites have also exhibited new spending patterns and are now
trying to improve their quality of life while at the same time
focusing on quantitative gains.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of durable goods such as color televisions,
refrigerators and washing machines is common, with automobiles,
sound systems, VCRs and pianos entering urban households on a
greater scale.
</P>
<P>
Living conditions are constantly improving and urbanites are
dedicating a greater portion of their income to housing.
</P>
<P>
Increased savings have at the same time prompted more people to
invest in the securities market.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Reduces 1998 Economic Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Friday
announced a further reduction in its economic growth plan for
1998, but said it would not affect the upturn in employment.
</P>
<P>
After several economic research institutes lowered their
forecasts, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi admitted on
September 9 that the gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by
two percent this year, rather than the 2.5 percent predicted
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said Friday that
the growth would be no more than 1.8 percent. He said the
Treasury expected the growth to fall back into line with "other
European countries closest to us". The government estimated 1999
GDP growth at 2.7 percent in its three-year economic planning
document released earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The slower increase would not worsen unemployment as the job
crisis appeared to have bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
The national statistics bureau, Ista, said employment rose by
0.6 percent up to July with the creation of 115,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
It is a first step, the first sign of success in the long
battle against unemployment, Veltroni said.

<P>
XI'AN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An 11-year-old girl who had the
first liver transplant in China, in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi
Province, a year ago was able to return to school recently.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Yu Faqin, who is from a peasant family in Henan
Province, suffered from bouts of fever and jaundice frequently
since the age of two and eventually had to give up schooling when
her condition became worse.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Xijing Hospital of the PLA's Fourth Medical College
diagnosed her condition as cirrhosis of the liver in November,
1996 and decided that restoring proper liver function was
impossible. So they decided to try a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 doctors took part in the operation on June 30,
1997, which involved replacing the girl's liver with a third of
her father's.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent examinations showed that the transplanted liver was
functioning properly. After a year of recovery, Yu has put on more
weight and added 4 centimeters in height. Her father's liver has
almost returned to its original size.

staging the vote in the heat of the election season.
</P>
<P>
"Now was clearly the wrong time to vote on it," the president
said in a written statement. He added, "At a time when we need to
forge a new consensus on trade, Congress has chosen partisanship
over progress."
</P>
<P>
Clinton once regarded the "fast track" trade negotiation
authority as a top priority. His earlier stance had helped mark
him as a centrist who differed from more traditional,
protectionist-minded Democrats.
</P>
<P>
But the White House objected when Republicans scheduled the
vote so close to the November congressional elections, arguing
that they were forcing some Democrats in closely contested
districts to risk angering hometown union members, farmers,
environmentalists and business interests.
</P>
<P>
So this time, the administration withheld its support, turning
the issue into a testy partisan fracas.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders, who opposed the proposal, applauded its defeat
and accused Republicans of ignoring more important issues, such as
education.
</P>
<P>
However, business groups expressed their obvious disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans believed that Clinton's reversal was a sign
that a weakened president was meekly following the dictates of
congressional Democrats and his party's labor supporters.
</P>
<P>
Under fast track authority, the Congress would not be able to
amend trade treaties when considering their ratification, but only
vote yes or no.
</P>
<P>
Since President Ford received fast track negotiating power in
1974, every president had it until it expired in 1994. Lack of the
authority has hindered U.S. attempts to forge new free-trade
agreements, including one sought with Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has not yet voted on fast track authority.

<HEADLINE> Possible Red Tide May Attack Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The sea waters around east
China's Zhejiang Province may be hit by a red tide because the
marine algae count is increasing dramatically, according to Wang
Zhengfang, a research fellow at the National Oceanography Bureau's
Second Oceanography Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Wang reached this conclusion after studying the results of a
marine pollution survey in the province. He pointed out that the
high proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sea waters is
the cause of red tides.
</P>
<P>
A 1980s study showed that inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus
were as high as 50 micromoles and 0.66 micromoles per liter
respectively near Zhejiang, as opposed to 10-20 micromoles and 0.2
micromoles in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The levels today are 100 micromoles and 1.6 micromoles per
liter, because of loose controls on waste water discharge along
the Yangtze River area, he said. The rapid development of
aquiculture, fertilizers and pesticides in the area has
accelerated the explosive reproduction of algae.
</P>
<P>
Red tides have meant huge losses for fishermen, and Zhejiang
authorities are now trying to work out measures to prevent the
occurrence.

<HEADLINE> Baby Twin Giant Pandas Going Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Diandian, the younger of the
twin giant panda cubs born 12 days ago, has survived her first ten
days, usually the most risky time for newborn pandas.
</P>
<P>
Diandian, meaning "little thing" in Chinese, weighed only 58
grams at birth on September 10 at the Giant Panda Breeding Center
in Chengdu in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
She has gained more than 30 grams under the care of zoologists
at the center, while the older twin, "Shishi," now weights 173
grams.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas usually give birth to one cub at at time, and
there are no reports of twin panda cubs born in captivity both
surviving.
</P>
<P>
Now kept in an incubator, Diandian is fed 12 times a day with
milk from her mother Chengcheng, and a limited amount of sheep
milk. She is expected to be left to her mother's care in another
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
The mother Chengcheng is presently attending the older twin by
herself, and Shishi is growing very well, with glowing fur and
loud cries.
</P>
<P>
Female giant pandas are said to be very picky in chosing mates,
so it is very rare for them to become pregnant through mating,
especially for those in captivity.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 giant pandas are roaming in the wild in southwest
and northwest China, with about 80 percent in Sichuan
Province.

<HEADLINE> China Exports More Passenger Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's export of Y-12 planes
to Egypt this week brought the total number of passenger plane
exports to 100, Beijing's "International Business Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Since China signed its first airplane export contract in 1986,
it has sold short and medium-range aircraft to Iran, Sri Lanka,
Burma, Mauritania, Guinea, and 15 other countries.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 of the exported aircraft were Y-12s made by the Harbin
Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the growing number of exports to the good
quality, low price, prompt delivery, and improved after-sale
services.
</P>
<P>
The China National Aviation Technology Import and Export
Corporation, the main exporter, has set up spare parts centers in
several countries and will open a training center, a maintenance
center, and some spare parts distribution warehouses in Africa and
South Pacific regions, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Saudi Crown Prince Discuss Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah, on this third day of a week-long visit to the United
States, met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Friday over a range of Middle East issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said that making a breakthrough in the Middle East
peace process was a major topic of discussion.
</P>
<P>
"There was a clear meeting of the minds about the common
interests in promoting the peace in the Middle East and the
discussion was very detailed," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We talked about where the Saudi government could be helpful in
encouraging progress for the parties," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to say what the U.S. thought the Saudis
could do to help the peace process along.
</P>
<P>
"Those are the kind of details that diplomats like to keep to
themselves, so that they have a chance of being successful," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed concern" about the "prolonged stalemate" in
the peace process, and supports U.S. efforts to make a
breakthrough in the matter with next week's talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Prince Abdullah also discussed the need for Iraq
to cooperate with U.N. inspectors searching for weapons of mass
destruction, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Like us, the Saudis are concerned about the threat that Saddam
Hussein continues to pose to the region and they, like us, insist
on full compliance with all security council resolutions," Rubin
said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Leads 2-0 against Spain in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Thomas Johansson toppled
Carlos Moya in three tough sets to give Sweden a commanding 2-0
lead over Spain in the Davis Cup semifinals here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Johansson who made his Davis Cup debut, sealed his singles
against fifth-ranked Moya 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6) in front of a
sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
</P>
<P>
Early in the first singles, Jonas Bjorkman defeated Alex
Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in three hours 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Among the sellout crowd was former great Bjorn Borg, who led
Sweden to its first Davis Cup title in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Sweden has won the Davis Cup another five times
and is now favored to reach its 12th final. Sweden has never
lost a Davis Cup tie after taking a 2-0 first-day lead.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, 23, a quarterfinalist in the recent U.S. Open, said
he "was tense and nervous before the match, but after a couple of
games I felt much better. The fans were unbelievable! A crowd
can't be much better than this."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Bjorkman, the Swedish No. 1, will be back for the
doubles match with Nicklas Kulti against veteran Javier Sanchez
and Julian Alonso.
</P>
<P>
Spain reached two Davis Cup finals in the 1960s, but never won
the competition. With its six wins and five runners-up finishes,
Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two
decades.

<HEADLINE> Land of Lakes and Rivers Threatened By Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province, which used to be known for its beautiful scenery because
of its many rivers and lakes is now threatened by a severe water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
A recent study found that many of the cities and counties in
the province are suffering from water supply problems. Urban
construction officials say that the gap between water supply and
demand will widen by a billion cu.m. by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages have put pressure on local economic
development, officials say, pointing to protracted drought in the
province three years ago that left 2.73 million residents
struggling to get drinking water and caused 10 billion yuan (850
million US dollars) of losses.
</P>
<P>
The drought in the city of Zhoushan last year cost it about one
billion yuan in industrial and agricultural output, in addition to
drinking water shortage for 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages have been exacerbated by the pollution problem
recently, sources say. Two-thirds of the water plants in the
cities get their water from contaminated sources. Water plants in
Jiaxing in northern Zhejiang last year suspended operation for
several days becaused of serious pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
And, water pipe leaks and reckless use of water are still
appallingly bad in spite of the water squeeze. A survey of pipe
leakage in 16 major cities indicated losses of some 197 million
cu.m. of water each year from pipes.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Cooperation in Oil Exploration in Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and the U.S. Texaco and Arco are planning
to undertake oil exploration in the Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfield in
China's Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan, CNOOC's General Manager, R. A. Solberg of Texaco, and
J. Weeks, president of Arco China, signed an agreement on this on
September 18.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC will do the actual exploration and the two U.S. companies
will play a supporting role.
</P>
<P>
China has generally played the supporting role in the 14
oilfields opened to overseas cooperation since the early 1980s,
and overseas investors were responsible for the actual exploration.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 was discovered in 1995 by a Chinese company in
the center of Bohai Bay. It is the second oilfield with reserves
of more 100 million tons in Bohai Bay. Depth of the oilfield
ranges from 15 to 20 meters.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will last for 20 years. The Chinese side will
be responsible for 51 percent of the financing for exploration,
with the remainer to be covered by the two U.S. companies.

<HEADLINE> Evans: Referees are Ruining the Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Roy Evans could face
disciplinary action after a verbal attack on the standard of
refereeing in English football.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool's joint manager accused officials of "ruining the
game" after crucial decisions went against his team in Thursday's
2-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Evans is not the first boss to speak out, but the Football
Association has given officials its full backing.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great product in the Premier League but I just
think the majority of referees aren't good enough - and I'm not
ashamed to say that," local reports quoted Evans as saying on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool claim Jason McAteer's handball which led to United's
first goal from the penalty spot was accidental.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to give a penalty was diabolical. We're getting
sick to death with decision like that going against us," said
Evans.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying the ball didn't strike his arm but he was
being mauled to death by Paul Scholes and there was no way there
was any intent on Jason's behalf."
</P>
<P>
He was also unhappy when referee Stephen Lodge rejected
Liverpool's appeals for a penalty when the ball hit Ryan Giggs'
arm later in the game.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to speak to the referee but it's like trying to get
into Fort Knox to speak to referees these days as they surround
themselves with so many people that you forget about it as it's a
waste of time," added Evans.
</P>
<P>
But FA spokesman Steve Double insisted refereeing standards
were "as high as ever".

WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of mourners,
some wearing running shoes, others leaning on canes or pushing
strollers, lined up before dawn Friday to pay their respect to
Florence Griffith Joyner who died suddenly Monday, according to
press reports here.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old world fastest female sprinter, who won three
gold medals on her way to set the 100-meter and 200-meter world
records, died at her home in sleep, and the cause has not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
Inside the chapel, Griffith Joyner was resplendent in a silk
top decorated with bright flowers. Her flowing black hair,
arranged in large ringlets, softly framed her face. She wore red
lipstick and her famously long fingernails were painted a riot of
colors, AP recorded.
</P>
<P>
"I admired her for being a great athlete, devoted mom and role
model for children," Carla Lee, 46, said. "I know we don't have
any set time to go, but it was a shock."
</P>
<P>
"We were proud of her that she got out. She proved we can do
more," said Rochelle Graves, who said Griffith Joyner was on the
planning committee for their 20th high school reunion in November.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking forward to seeing her. She was a cool person
to know," Graves said.
</P>
<P>
Melvin Pinkney, 38, was a teammate with Griffith Joyner at
high school, saying: "We all knew she was awfully fast. She was
always down to earth. She never felt she was better than anyone
else."
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickey of Los Angeles said: "You feel like you just lost
a member of your family. She's a shining example of someone who's
overcome. Not only she success, she reached back and lifted
others up. She is an icon."
</P>
<P>
"I just loved her," said Horace Mansfield, 80. "She came out
of poverty and was successful, she was a role model."
</P>
<P>
The funeral is on Saturday in Lake Forest in Orange County.

WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi
beat American Jan-Michael Gambill in the opening single match of
their Davis Cup semifinal this afternoon in Milwaukee, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Gambill lost his debut match in four sets in 2-6, 0-6, 6-7
(0-7), 6-7 (4-7) at the Milwaukee Center Arena.
</P>
<P>
Gambill, who improved his ranking from No. 2227 to 50 after
reaching the third round of the U.S. Open, replaced Jim Courier's
place in the draw. Courier is out because of muscle fatigue in
his right arm.
</P>
<P>
Gambill survived eight match points before succumbing in the
second of the tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
Another American Todd Martin played Davide Sanguinetti in the
other singles match on Day 1. They swap opponents Sunday after
Martin and Davis Cup rookie Justin Gimelstob take on Gaudenzi and
Diego Nargiso in Saturday's doubles match.

The spokesman said Brahimi's itinerary would be decided once
he was in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Weapons Experts End Talks On Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chemical weapons
experts from six countries had concluded their two-day talks on
whether Iraq had put nerve gas VX on warheads, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held after discrepancies on laboratory tests
were performed in France and Switzerland compared to those
performed in the United States, said Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting was attended by 14 experts from
outside the United Nations, including representatives from the
United States, French and Swiss laboratories as well as delegates
from Russia, Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
No report would come out after the meetings, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. diplomats said the experts were completing a report and
might be released next week or held until U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler presents his major half-year report on
Iraq due in mid October.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomats, the results of the tests could
be potentially embarrassing for the United Nations Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction as well as the United States after the French and
Swiss labs found no VX on Iraq's missile warheads.
</P>
<P>
American experts at a military testing lab in June reported
traces of VX in Scud-type missile warhead fragments recovered
from a destruction site in Iraq earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Canada to Take Action on Farm Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
said on Friday that it was "highly concerned" about Canada's farm
trade policies causing a border dispute over livestock and grain
shipments between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issed Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said that it is time for Canada to "take decisive
action to level the playing field."
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky met Thursday with Canadian officials after Ottawa
decided to formally protest a move by some U.S. states to block
Canadian farm shipments by asking for paperwork not previously
required.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the Plains states complained that Canada unfairly
dumps cattle and wheat in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. state of South Dakota said it began imposing new
paperwork on Canadian truck shipments to protest Canada's
inspection standards that make it difficult for U.S. farm goods to
export to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa said it will ask the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
make a judgement on South Dakota's action.
</P>
<P>
"These actions do not bring us any closer to solving issues at
the U.S.-Canada border," Barshefsky said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"While Canada certainly has the right to take these steps, we
need to directly address the issues in front of us in an open and
constructive manner," said she.
