<HEADLINE> SADC Vows to Promote Regional Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The annual Consultative
Conference of the South African Development Community (SADC)
opened in Windhoek, Namibia today with participants calling for
an integrated approach to economic problems of the region.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 delegates from the 12 SADC countries, China and
international organizations from around the world are attending
the conference with the theme "Productivity, key to sustainable
development".
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, who is also current
Chairman of the regional development body, said, "gender equality
and full engagement of the majority of our populations in the
process of governance and development are critical twin pillars
upon which productivity for sustainable development should be
based."
</P>
<P>
Nzo pointed out the SADC is at the forefront of political and
economic reform in Africa, noting the organization has actively
engaged the private sector since the last consultative
conference, especially at two economic summits in May and
September last year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "outstanding progress" has been made in developing
protocols to guide regional integration and provide a legal
framework for the cooperation of member nations.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the conference, Namibian President Sam
Nujoma also attached importance to the making of "gender
equality".
</P>
<P>
"The struggle for gender equality is actually a struggle for
justice and human rights," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
SADC, established in Windhoek in August 1992 to promote
regional economic development, consists of 12 countries. They are
Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Mauritius and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> 7 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Seven Israeli soldiers were
wounded today in an attack by Lebanese guerrillas in south
Lebanon, Israel Radio reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers, six moderately and one lightly, were
evacuated immediately for treatment, while the Israeli army
returned fire to suspected targets in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah (Party of God) of Lebanon has claimed responsibility
for the attack, which took place in the western sector of the
Israeli self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
No further details about the attack are available at this
time.
</P>
<P>
The new clash between Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters
occurred after a relatively quiet period of time since heavy
fighting erupted last Tuesday and ceased that afternoon, a few
hours before the collision of two Israeli helicopters, killing 73
soldiers aboard.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah announced at the time that its gunmen had attacked
over 20 Israeli army and South Lebanese Army positions with
long-range mortar and anti-tank missile fires to mark "Jerusalem
Day" at the end of the month-long Ramadan fast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah activists, who maintained that the
disaster was a "godly punishment," continued to claim that the
soldiers had intended to carry out a special mission inside
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a Lebanese
newspaper article Saturday that the troops aboard the
helicopters had intended to carry out a commando-style kidnap
mission and he was probably the intended victim.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter transports had been designed to bypass the
threat posed by Hezbollah roadside bomb and Sagger anti-tank
missile attacks and ambushes. The transports, which stopped
following the disaster, were resumed today.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli media reports earlier today, the Israeli
army has been on full alert in the "security zone", as Hezbollah
is expected to escalate its activities in the coming days because
of other memorial dates which also fall this month.
</P>
<P>
The most notable is February 16, which marks the killing five
years ago of then Hezbollah secretary-general Abbas Musawi and
members of his family in an attack by Israeli helicopter
gunships.

Arafat at Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip,
to discuss peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was first scheduled for last Thursday

disaster in which 73 of Israeli soldiers were killed, will
start at 8 p.m. local time (1800GMT).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack on Israeli Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, ambushed an Israeli
patrol in the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon
this afternoon, causing heavy casualties to the Israeli force.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Islamic Resistance,
the military wing of the Shiite Hezbollah, announced that its
guerrillas carried out the ambush near the Israeli position of
Blat in the central sector of the bordering buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that all elements of the Israeli
patrol, including an officer, were "killed or wounded."
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia
confirmed that seven Israeli soldiers were wounded in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's guerrilla group said that its fighters launched
the attack at 2:25 p.m. (1225 GMT), in which a variety of
weapons including grenades were used.
</P>
<P>
It added that the fierce clash between the Israeli force
and the guerrillas draw an intervention of Israeli helicopters
which tried to evacuate the wounded from the battlefield and
only succeeded after several attempts.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas fired machineguns and rocket-propelled grenades
at the helicopters and forced them back, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces at the nearby positions of blat, Gauzah
and Rujmin opened artillery fire at the attackers, but causing
no casualties among the guerrillas, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
This was the first attack by Hezbollah guerrillas on the
Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon since the beginning
of Eid Al-Fitr, the Moslem feast marking the end of the holy
fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent retaliation for the attack, Israeli warplanes
launched an air strike at suspected bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the south sector of Beqaa
Valley later this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In three successive bombing rounds, the Israeli jet fighters,
covered by Helicopters, fired at least four air-to-surface
missiles at the targets in the Hezbollah-controlled Western
Beqaa without causing casualties, security sources in the area
reported.
</P>
<P>
Except occasional exchanges of fire between Moslem guerrillas
on one side and Israeli forces and the Israeli client SLA
militia on the other, a relative calm has shrouded south
Lebanon in the past one month.
</P>
<P>
In the violence on the last active battle front
of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the days after the New Year,
one Israeli soldier was killed and 15 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the Israeli
occupation forces in south Lebanon, and refuses to put down
arms before Israel pulls its forces out of the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the
Jewish state will not withdraw from the 1,100-square-kilometer
"security zone" it self-proclaimed in 1985, unless south
Lebanon no longer constitutes a threat for northern Israel.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Ali Juma today urged Tanzanian Moslems to take efforts to
educate their children so as to enable them to help develop the
eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Moslems are main residents in Zanzibar and Pemba, two major
islands in the eastern part of the country, and Juma is the main
leader of the Zanzibar islands.
</P>
<P>
Juma told a Moslem gathering for the Idd Baraza celebrations
that the Moslem community should make maximum use of the
available schools in educating children.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough schools in the country and everybody should
make use of them effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government offers equal opportunities for education to
everybody regardless of his religious belief, Juma said.
</P>
<P>
Some secondary schools built by the Moslem community now lack
students, he said, urging the parents to ensure that the
vacancies are fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
He repeated the government appeal on religious institutions to
support the government efforts to provide social services to the
local community.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the religious leaders to support the
government in fighting corruption, drug trafficking, child abuse
and other vices rampant in the society.
</P>
<P>
"Let us fight such vices which are now at an alarming rate
among our community," he urged, adding the government has started
to take punitive measures against any culprit and the whole
society should support the measures.

LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Poaching has been reduced and
elephant population has risen in some national parks and game
management areas in Zambia, Tourism Minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The improvement is due to more efforts taken by field wildlife
police in the southern African country, he said, urging the
police to maintain their dedication in bids for curbing poaching.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,635 elephant tusks and 144 various animal skins
were found from poachers around the country in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police also confiscated 496 military weapons,
85 rifles, 1,803 muzzle loading guns and 3,000 wire snares from
poachers, said Mwanamwambwa.

<HEADLINE> Greek Farmers End Protest Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Greek farmers in Thessaly,
central Greece, who had been on protest action in the past week,
announced today that they decided to end the current
mobilizations.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after police deflated Friday the tires of
about 1,500 tractors the protesting farmers threatened to use to
block the national highways.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Thessaly said the Pan-Thessaly coordinating
committee will begin a series of consultations with farmers'
unions and cooperatives in order to begin a third round of
protests in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the protesting farmers filed charges today against
police for damaging their machinery.
</P>
<P>
"We request the government to stop misinforming the public and
realize that it is fully responsible for its political and penal
actions and will soon be called to pay," said a Pan-Thessaly
coordinating committee announcement this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Volos court in northern Greece
Saturday sentenced nine farmers to six months in prison. The
convicted were arrested Friday morning in scuffles with police who
tried to deflate the tractors' tires. The vehicles had been parked
along the highway near Midrothives, about 300 kilometers north of
Athens, in a tactic aimed at pressuring the government into giving
in to the farmers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The demands, which include higher subsidies, cheaper fuel, tax
concessions and cancellation of debts, led to a 25-day blockade of
the nation's highways in December, paralyzing traffic and business
activities.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Minister Says Brcko Must Remain in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Defense Minister
Milan Ninkovic said Sunday that the fairest arbitration solution
for Brcko was that it remains part of the Serb entity in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Ninkovic told Radio Doboj in northern Bosnia that Brcko should
not be called into question, but that he feared problems
surrounding the city in north Bosnia would be solved in a way not
provided for under the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Brcko, located in northeastern Bosnia, is the only place still
disputable under the Dayton agreement. It links the northwestern
part with the eastern part of Republika Srpska, but its Sava River
is also strategically important to the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
An international arbitration committee will make a final
judgment to the fate of the controversial town on February 14.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be a change in the Dayton agreement, its entire
implementation would be called into question," Tanjug news agency
quoted Ninkovic as saying. He also said that under international
arbitration was not Brcko but part of the inter-ethnic line in its
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that Serbs will have to make certain
concessions to the Muslim-Croat federation, first and foremost
access to the Brcko port zone and to one road and one railroad
leading to it.

<HEADLINE> Head of Russia's Security Council to attend Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin today authorized Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin
to attend the ceremony of the inauguration of newly-elected
president of the republic of Chechnya Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
The press office of the Russian head of state said the
president's authorization had been made during his meeting with
Ivan Rybkin which began on Monday afternoon at the Russian
President's out-of-town residence Gorki-9.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin was appointed Russia's mediator in Chechnya after
Yeltsin sacked his predecessor Alexander Lebed from the post last
year.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov had been elected President of the Republic of
Chechnya on January 27 and his inauguration ceremony is scheduled
for February 12, in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov's election was welcomed by Yeltsin last month, who
said it provided "a serious chance for the center and the new
Chechen leadership to continue negotiations and arrive at
mutually acceptable decisions on Chechnya's status."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Rybkin informed the Russian President that
the federal authorities had well fulfilled the securing of the
release of 362 people, both soldiers and civilians, from captivity
in Chechnya over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Rybkin discussed a tentative agenda of the
forthcoming Security Council meeting in late February and early
March at which Yeltsin is planning to preside personally.
</P>
<P>
The two men also exchanged views on the need to set up a
state committee for the North Caucasus and institute the office
of the president's representative in that region.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin meanwhile pointed out the need to
effectively use the funds earmarked by the Federal budget for
1997 for the Chechen republic primarily for the purpose of
paying pensions, social benefits, as well as for the
restoration of social, healthcare and educational facilities.

Li awarded Qiao with the certification after he announced the
order issued by DPRK's Central People's Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao thanked Li for the award and affirmed his belief that the
friendly relationship, established and fostered by the older

<HEADLINE> Russia Wins Carlsberg Cup Soccer Tournament in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A better organized and more
aggressive Russian team won over Switzerland 2-1 to win the
championship trophy at the Carlsberg Cup soccer tournament which
closed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russians also won the 25,000 U.S, dollars top prize.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this evening, Yugoslavia beat a Hong Kong League
selection side 3-1 to take the third place.
</P>
<P>
Forward Igor Simoutenkov was obviously the hero of the final
match. The quick-footed attacker opened the score with a
22nd-minute goal in a melee at the Switzerland goal mouth.
</P>
<P>
He scored again just a bit more than two minutes later when he
coveted a cross pass from a teammate.
</P>
<P>
With impressive individual skills though, the Switzerland team
lacked the overall attacking power and their attempts almost all
went in vain.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the crowd though, the Switzerland team could not
make a goal until the 80th minute, when P. Thuler scored through a
short-range shot.
</P>
<P>
The score remained unchanged through the rest of the game.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Recalling Floods at the Dinner Table (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Wangs of Siwumen Village in
Honghu County in central China's Hubei Province, comprising 12
members of four generations, usually live in three separate
households.
</P>
<P>
But on the most important occasion for family reunions in
China, the Spring Festival, they gathered this month for a
full-scale family dinner at the newly-built house of Wang Nanlin,
a member of the family's third generation.
</P>
<P>
This area was stricken by a flood of a seriousness not seen
once in 100 years in the summer of 1996, when homes were destroyed
and farmland devastated. However, no one in the village was
drowned.
</P>
<P>
With the villagers' own savings and help from the government,
all the collapsed houses have been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
There were brief but solemn sacrificial rites before the
dinner. In addition to ancestors and the local gods to ensure the
harvest in the coming year, sacrifices were also offered to the
Chinese Communist Party and the government.
</P>
<P>
"We thank the Party and the government for they were what we
relied on to save us from the severe floods last year," said
58-year-old Wang Jiquan, Nanlin's father and head of the big
family.
</P>
<P>
After several rounds of toasts, they focused their discussions
on the floods, which are not uncommon on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"This place was hit by torrential rain in 1931, or the 20th
year of the Republic of China under the rule of the Kuomintang
(Nationalist) Party as local farmers often refer to," said Wang
Jijin's mother, Liao La'an, who is approaching the 80 years of age.
</P>
<P>
"Many people were drowned and killed, especially elderly people
and children. Others were starved of died of epidemics. What made
things worse was that the floods did not subside for a long period
of time and there was not even space to bury the dead," Liao
reminisced in tears.
</P>
<P>
"Corpses were often seen floating in the water," she sobbed.

<P>
With practically nothing to eat, the flood victims then had to
eat grass and tree bark. After the only things available were
eaten up, people started to sell their own children and wives.
</P>
<P>
One child could be traded for 50 kg of grain, Liao said, noting
that she herself was sold to the Wangs at the age of 12 by her
parents, and later became the daughter-in-law of the family.
</P>
<P>
Liao's eight-year-old granddaughter asked curiously: "Why was
there no relief from the government?"
</P>
<P>
"Well, that government was different from the government today,
and nobody cared about the victims at that time," Liao explained,
wondering whether her granddaughter could understand.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiquan said that he remembered the 1954 flood, when he
was 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
"It was only a few years after Liberation, when the country was
still very poor and the government did not have much to spare for
the victims. But the government evacuated us to safety and
provided some food. When epidemics started to spread, doctors from
the People's Liberation Army came," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the food was not adequate, a large number of the
villagers left home to beg for a living," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Dad, you are talking about 1954 flood. How could it be
mentioned in the same breath as today?" Wang Jiquan's second son
Wang Nanlin interrupted.
</P>
<P>
"The flood last year here was much bigger than that in 1931,
but no one was drowned, no one died from hunger and no epidemic
has broken out," the 30-year-old farmer said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have become well-off in recent years, and the Party
and government provided relief funds and food for those in
need. Nobody ever worries about their food, clothing and shelter
today." Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"With good weather for crops in the coming year, we'll have all
we possessed in the past," he said. Stimulated by the drinks, his
earnest expression and excited voice made the whole family laugh
heartily.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon  Rules out Immediate Resumption of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz today ruled out an immediate resumption of peace
talks between Israel on the one side and Lebanon and Syria on the
other, urging Israel to "show its peace intentions."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that positions of the Israeli government are
still "far away from bases" of the Middle East peace process
defined in the 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister made the remarks before he left
Beirut this afternoon for a one-week visit to Paris on the
invitation of the French  Center of Studies of Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz is scheduled to meet his French counterpart Herve
de Charette in the French capital Tuesday morning, according to
the official Lebanese National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
foreign minister said that the Lebanese and Syrian peace
negotiations with Israel, which have been suspended since one
year ago, could not be resumed "at the present time."
</P>
<P>
He said that the resumption needs the Israeli government to
"clearly show its intentions toward the peace."
</P>
<P>
"There will not be negotiations as long as Israel refuses
to change its positions, and to implement United Nations
resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace,"
Boueiz underlined.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister emphasized that the peace talks should
be resumed from where it stopped rather than from the "zero
point."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Arab countries to safeguard their unity
and avoid a "slid in the direction of normalization" with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"It is demanded at the preset to maintain the Arab unity
and to prevent a slide in the direction of normalization as
long as those Arab states which are directly concerned, namely
Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinians side, have not retrieved
their rights," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
On his government's diplomatic efforts to ease a tension in
south Lebanon, Boueiz accused Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu of "trying to impose his special intention" on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri is currently paying a
private visit to France and will have a meeting with French
President Jacques Chirac Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian ADC 086 Flight Crashes in Avoiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The ill-fated Nigerian ADC 086 fligt
crashed on November 17, 1996 in avoiding a head-on collision with
another aircraft on its path, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted unidentified diplomatic sources who have been
monitoring the event as saying that the crashed Boeing 727 plane was
descending in preparations for landing at the Lagos airport, when its
pilot found another plane heading to it from the front.
</P>
<P>
The plane had just taken off from the Lagos airport and was
ascending, when it was unduely wiped out of the radar by air
traffic controllers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the report, caused a confusion between the
control tower and the ADC 086 flight about the exact position of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that in a desperate effort to avoid the
imminent collsion, the pilot may have swerved the plane suddenly,
which caused a "stall", meaning the plane has lost "lift" on its wings
and started falling.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, there was a scream in the cockpit and a
"knocking noise" before the Black Box of the plane stopped recording.
They belive that the "knocking noise" was made when the falling plane
hit the water of a lagoon near Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The new theory is contrary to earlier witness reports of strong
explosions before the crash and speculations of malfunctioning
engines.
</P>
<P>
All 143 passengers and crew members on board
died in the crash.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hua, chief
executive designate of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), said here today he hoped that all incumbent members in
the municipal councils and district boards could continue to serve
Hong Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Tung made this remark while meeting with 26 Urban councilors
and 18 chairmen of District Boards on Monday, in an effort to
solicit opinions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Today's meeting is very constructive and very helpful to me,"
said the chief executive, who acknowledged that time was pressing
for the establishment of provisional municipal councils and
district boards.
</P>
<P>
Tung called on all incumbents, on the basis of "loving the
country and loving Hong Kong" and "upholding the Basic Law", to do
their best to ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The first government of the HKSAR is held responsible for the
establishment of the provisional urban and regional councils and
district boards, according to a resolution passed by the
Preparatory Committee early this month.
</P>
<P>
Urban and Regional Councils and District Boards are Hong Kong's
grassroots advisory organizations, which provide the government
with advices on district administration and other matters.
</P>
<P>
China made it clear in 1994 that the current municipal councils
and district boards of the British Hong Kong Government would come
to an end on June 30, 1997.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Plans to Tighten Rules on Goalkeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body
FIFA plans to limit the time goalkeepers have to get the ball back
into play but make it legal for them to move on the line before a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter said on Monday that the
governing body would discuss the changes to the rules at a meeting
on March 1.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against goalkeepers. Quite the opposite. They
have it hard enough. But FIFA wants to stop them getting away with
wasting so much time," Blatter wrote in a column for the German
football magazine Kicker.
</P>
<P>
"Too often you notice a goalkeeper because he is standing still
rather than moving. He catches the ball, strokes it, holds it
tightly, waves at all the other players that they should leave him
alone with his private property, lets a few more seconds tick by,
looks around a bit more and then he finally gets rid of it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In all that, 10 seconds, sometimes 20 seconds, are lost," said
Blatter, adding that FIFA was thinking of limiting goalkeepers to
five seconds.
</P>
<P>
In return, keepers will now be allowed to move on the line
before a penalty kick which is presently against the rules but
very common, he said.

<HEADLINE> More People in Hebei Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has eliminated poverty for another 1.17 million people in
the past year in spite of the disastrous floods which hit the area
last August.
</P>
<P>
The northern province launched its poverty-elimination drive in
1986 and has so far got 5.66 million people out of poverty. During
the process, the provincial government has given full play to the
roles of all social forces and has granted preferential policies
to the poverty-stricken villages.
</P>
<P>
In August last year some 33 counties and cities in Hebei were
struck by severe floods. However, the flooding never slackened the
will of the local people to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
They developed 38,000 ha of new farmland and built highways
with a total length of 7,556 km in 1996. In addition, the province
set up power transmission lines with a total length topping 1,074
km.
</P>
<P>
In the past year the province has succeeded in eliminating
poverty for 1,195 of the poorest villages. In addition, so far, 16
out of the province's 46 poverty-stricken counties have shaken off
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Spread of Leprosy Feared in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Fear for the spread of
infectious leprosy disease is mounting in Somalia as the number
of its victims is on the increase in Lower Shabelle Region.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities said new victims of the disease are
emerging day after day in Golwein, Bulo Mareer, Mrin Guba,
Awdhegle and Jilib towns.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Omar Ali, the Chairman of the Health Committee in
Merca, the regional capital of Lower Shabelle, 85 leprosy patients
have been registered while numerous others could not be reached for
lack of medical personnel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nur Ahmed, a medical expert on leprosy, said the disease
has at present its best chance to spread in the country since
there are no health isolation camps and the victims are in direct
contact with others.
</P>
<P>
For instance, one of the leprosy patients currently sells meat
in Golwein Town Butchery, 118 km south of capital Mogadishu.
Other leprosy patients also undergo similar jobs where they can
easily transmit the disease.
</P>
<P>
In the past, leprosy patients had been treated in isolation
camps such as Forlanini Hospital of Mogadishu and Labadad Village
of Middle Jubba Region which is believed to be the leprosy origin
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms of the disease include the loss of feeling, change of
the skin color, blindness, removal of nails and fingers. Finally,
the whole human body is broken into pieces.
</P>
<P>
"At first they feel like being administered with anaesthesia,"
said Dr. Ali, adding that 40 patients are living in Golwein
District while 15 in Jilib.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities expressed concern over the movements of
the leprosy victims as well as the lack of special care for those
patients need.
</P>
<P>
"We can get only two medicines from the multiple drug system
these patients are required to take," said Dr. Ali.
</P>
<P>
He called the World Health Organization (WHO), which is
planning to eradicate leprosy from the surface of the earth by
year 2000, to provide necessary medical aid to leprosy-hit
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 926,000 leprosy patients worldwide, mainly
in Africa and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Seafood Industry Urged To Do Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Seafood companies in
Queensland, Australia, should export more and more products to
Asian markets where demand outstripped supply, Queensland Primary
Industries Minister Trevor Perrett said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that exports of Queensland seafood had grown at
an average nine percent a year over the five years to 1994-95 to
reach a value of 238 million Australian dollars (190 million US
dollars), Perrett told reporters before leaving with a trade
mission to pursue seafood sales to Japan, Hong Kong, China and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Japan is the largest seafood market in the world with a market
size of almost 11 million tons in 1995, while Taiwan is a major
export destination representing 21 percent of total seafood export
from Queensland in 1995-96", he said in Brisbane, according to a
news release available here.
</P>
<P>
He was also keen to pursue investment opportunities in China,
"because of the rapid economic and social change accompanying the
country's massive industrial expansion".
</P>
<P>
Queensland's major seafood export to China in 1995-96 had been
frozen shrimp and prawns which had accounted for almost three
quarters of Queensland's total seafood exports.

<HEADLINE> Five-Time World Cup Overall Champion Girardelli Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bad knees has forced five-time
World Cup champion Marc Girardelli to retire.
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, 33, has been notably absent from the two-week World
Alpine Ski Championships. He was unable to defend the world
combined title he won a year ago in the worlds in Sierra Nevada,
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian-born Girardelli, who races for Luxembourg, injured
himself in a race earlier this year, damaging one of his few
healthy knee ligaments. He was advised by his doctors that any
more racing would risk serious damage.
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, who was to hold a news conference later Monday to
elaborate on his retirement, won his first World Cup race in 1983
and has won 46 overall - No. 3 on the all-time men's list behind
Italy's Alberto Tomba and leader Ingemar Stenmark.
</P>
<P>
He won World Cup races in all five Alpine disciplines, his top
total coming in slalom with 16.
</P>
<P>
Girardelli also won the overall World Cup title five times
(1985, '86, '89, '91 and '93) and won 13 medals in the Olympics
and worlds, four of them gold.
</P>
<P>
His only blemish was his failure to win gold in the Olympics.
He came close in the 1992 Olympics with silver medals in both
giant slalom and super-G.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more foreigners are
coming to reside in this, north China's biggest port city, with
the increasing amount of foreign investment and the improvement of
the city's investment and living environments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the city's Public Security Bureau show
that 2,521 foreigners applied for residence certificates last
year, a 31 percent rise from the year before, and 225 foreigners
applied for transient residence certificates, more than double the
number of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Tianjin Public Security Bureau said the
large increase in the number of foreign enterprises investing in
the city has contributed to the rise of the number of foreign
residents; among the foreigners who applied for residence
certificates last year, 456 were relatives of foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,087 foreign enterprises were approved in the city
in 1996, with a total contractual investment of five billion US
dollars. The total number of such enterprises in the city has
topped 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The city has been selected as the best city in a security
management evaluation competition among China's big cities for

<HEADLINE> 1997 to be Tough for Criminals, Says SA Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has vowed
to take harsh and conrete measures to fight against rampant
crimes, the local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough for criminals this year," Justice Minister
Dullah Omar told reporters yesterday, stressing that "we want to
ensure crime does not pay."
</P>
<P>
Omar made the remarks after South African President Nelson
Mandela promised to end the wave of lawlessness at the opening
ceremony of Parliament last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the measures, Omar said the cabinet has agreed to
allocate 400 million Rands (89 million U.S. dollars) to improve
the effectiveness of police, the courts and prisons.
</P>
<P>
A new bill has been drawn up for introduction in Parliament to
provide minimum sentences for those who use firearms and violence
in committing crimes, ranging from rape and robbery to hijacking,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that quicker identification of suspects who
have past records, speedier trials and stiffer sentences were
among the measures to be taken in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is in a period of transition from
apartheid to democracy, has been much troubled with increasing
violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest survey by the South African Police
Services, Johannesburg, a well-known trade center in the country,
was the hardest hit in the crime wave.
</P>
<P>
Of all violent crimes that happened in the city last year, are
133 armed robberies in December alone, the survey said. enditem

<HEADLINE> OIC: Palestinian Cause Tops Islamic Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) today cautioned the Islamic world to be aware of
the Israeli attempts to temper the feature of Jerusalem, a holy
city to the world's three major religions.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian cause is a prime issue for the Islamic world
especially when Jerusalem is jeopardized by an Israeli attempt to
Judaize and eliminate its Arab and Islamic features," said OIC
Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Abu Ghush.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the Voice of Arab radio, Abu Ghush said the OIC
Jerusalem Committee decided to raise funds to save the city,
sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Israeli authorities try to cordon off Jerusalem
by a number of settlements, he said Israeli is still denying
digging new tunnels in the city as it had denied before the
presence of the tunnel which was opened last year under Aqsa
Mosque, the third holiest shrine of Islam.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based radio last Saturday,
Palestinian Authority Local Government Minister Saeb Erakat also
warned against Israel's continued digging operations and other
"oppressive measures" aimed to preempt final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opening of a tourist tunnel near the Jerusalem's
mosque compound sparked gun battles between Israeli soldiers and
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) police in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip as well as widespread demonstrations. A total of 65
Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want east Jerusalem, which Israel captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War, as the capital of a future
state.
</P>
<P>
Under a Palestinian-Israeli deal signed last month, the final
status negotiations on Jerusalem will start on March 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Chung Jae-chull, National
Assembly member of South Korea's ruling New Korea Party, was
questioned today by prosecutors on his alleged receipt of bribes
from Hanbo Business Group General Chairman Chung Tae-soo in return
for helping the business leader obtain preferential bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't uncovered any solid lead to suspicions as yet that
Chung Jae-chull has received bribes," a prosecution official said,
adding that whether or not to file charges against him will be
determined by the outcome of further investigations.
</P>
<P>
Chung Jae-chull, 69, a fourth-term parliament member, chairs
the party convention and ranks third in the party.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo Business Group leader Chung Tae-soo is suspected of
having poured huge amounts of money into politicians' pockets in
the process of financing his pet project to set up a steel mill in
South Chungchong Province.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also plan to summon several other legislators from
the ruling and opposition camps to investigate on whether they
have received bribes from the Hanbo leader in exchange for their
influence upon banks loans.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo was arrested on January 31 on charges of fraud
and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
He had secured six billion U.S. dollars in loans between 1992
and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his flagship firm Hanbo
Iron and Steel Company, which was declared bankrupt by its
creditors on January 23.

<HEADLINE> Eriksson Retakes Lead in Swedish Auto Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden
recaptured the overall lead in Karlstad on Monday in the Swedish
rally with just two special states remaining in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Swede leads Spain's Carlos Sainz, bidding to become the
first non-Scandinavian to win the rally, by nine seconds with
world champion Tommi Makinen of Finland in third 30 seconds back
and Britain's Colin McRae in fourth a further nine seconds in
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson, who led on Saturday, was third overnight, 27 seconds
adrift of Sainz, but by the 21st special stage he had regained the
lead off 1995 World champion Colin McRae -- who spun twice on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
McRae had taken the lead off former teammate Sainz, who had
driven like a man inspired on Sunday, on the 20th stage as the
Spaniard had made the wrong choice of tyres.
</P>
<P>
Makinen kept up his vain hopes of winning, after he was docked
time for a late arrival on Saturday, recording the fastest times
on the 20th and 22nd special stages.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Sets New Target for Housing Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area
has set the target of enhancing its average per capita living
space to 12 sq m by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By then, some 80 percent of the apartments in Pudong will be
equipped with kitchens and toilets, and 30 percent of the total
residential areas in Pudong will be green space, according to a
local housing construction conference.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years Pudong has completed housing
construction totalling 17 million sq m, with average per capita
living space hitting 10.4 sq m. It means that Pudong has realized
the goal set by the Shanghai municipal government four years ahead
of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
To date, Pudong has built 30 residential quarters each with a
population above 20,000. Moreover, housing space totalling 3.43
million sq m has been built in various rural towns in the Pudong
New Area.
</P>
<P>
The local authority revealed that housing construction
totalling 15 million sq m will be built there in the coming four
years, including 2.26 million sq m to be completed this year.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army has crippled
the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels operating in the north, a
high-ranking commander said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Kazini, the Commander of the Fourth Division of
the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF), told the New Vision
newspaper that only three rebel groups remained active at present
in northern Kitgum District while the 10 others had been
dismembered.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 13 IRA groups had about 200 soldiers earlier last
year. The plan of Joseph Kony, the IRA leader, to abduct
civilians to build a force of over 10,000 was foiled by the
UPDF.
</P>
<P>
The commander attributed the victory to a strategy
introduced by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni which combined
military force with political means.

<HEADLINE> Yancheng Reserve Winter Paradise for Rare Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yancheng Rare Birds Nature
Reserve in the northern Jiangsu Province, east China, the world's
biggest tidal wetland nature reserve, has drawn 1,020 red-crowned
cranes, a rare species, from north China to spend the winter there.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the world for so many red-crowned
cranes to winter in one place.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said there are only about 2,000 red-crowned cranes
left in the wild in the world.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve, occupying 30,200 ha, has proved to be a
good "winter paradise" for rare birds, with the preservation of
reedy wetland and a breeding center for clam worms, a kind of
fodder for rare birds.
</P>
<P>
Apart from red-crowned cranes, tens of thousands of other rare
birds enjoying first-grade state protection, including black
storks, white storks, black-headed cranes and black-beaked gulls
have also arrived at the reserve for the winter.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve was established in 1984. Before that, only
about 200 red-crowned cranes came for the winter every year.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has meanwhile been cracking down on illegal
hunting of rare birds in the reserve. The reserve's wardens have
confiscated more than 200 guns and rescued some 30 red-crowned
cranes and swans from hunters.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has tamed 22 red-crowned cranes since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Researchers Design New Cassava Graters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan researchers have made
progress in designing low-cost manpower graters to help local
farmers get high-grade cassava flour, according to the New
Vision, a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Sicco Kolijn, an engineer of the Post-Harvest Section in
the Kawanda Agriculture Institute, said some of the five types of
their designs have proved efficient and have been accepted by
the local farmers.
</P>
<P>
How to crash cassava, one of the main food crops in Uganda,
into flour is always a challenge facing local agricultural
researchers. The imported graters are too expensive and
unwieldy for the farmers in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Sicco and his colleagues are trying to modify them into
bicycle-like, portable and less expensive graters.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Russia to Cement Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Russia will sign next
month three economic and trade agreements with the aim of boosting
exports and investments between the two countries, Egyptian
Ambassador in Moscow Reda Shehata has said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency today quoted him as saying that
these agreements are designed to prevent dual taxation, guarantee
exports and encourage and protect investment.
</P>
<P>
A number of Russian economic delegations will visit Cairo next
month for talks on setting up joint projects and participation in
an economic seminar on Egyptian-Russian investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said last week that Russia wants to establish
projects in the New Delta and Tushki areas in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Democratic Party Economic and Financial
Affairs Committee that next month Egypt and Russia will sign an
agreement for attracting Russian investors to establish projects
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies have much experience in establishing projects
in Egypt since the construction of the High Dam, which were built
during 1960-1970 with the financial and technical assistance of
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Besides the deal on investment projects in the underdeveloped
Egyptian land, another agreement will be signed to encourage
companies to increase their exports to the Russia and promote
trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the agreements next month, businessmen
from both countries will sign trade contracts and discuss joint
investments during a symposium on Egyptian-Russian investment
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, Shehata noted that volume of trade between them does
not match their long economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade now is estimated at less than half a percent of
Russia's annual foreign trade volume which stands at around 130
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He called for enormous efforts to re-occupy the Russian markets
as Egyptian exports to Russia are plummeting every year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared by a People's Assembly
committee, the 7.3 percent decrease in the revenues of Egyptian
exports in 1995-96 year ending June 30 was due to the drop in
export on Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The volume of Egyptian exports to Russia hit 144 million
dollars in 1993 but it declined to 62 million and 37.2 million
dollars in the following two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian exports to Egypt rose from 170 million
dollars in 1993 to 305 million dollars in the following year. In
1995, the Russian exports shot to 393.6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Index Workers' Savings to Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will create a scheme to
index workers' salaries to inflation under a new national pension law,
Zambia's Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaer quoted Labor and Social Security Minister
Peter Machungwa as confirming that the subject was tabled at a
tripartite meeting last week attended by representatives of the
government, the Zambia Federation of Employers and the Zambia
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
</P>
<P>
"This is a good and progressive law which will improve workers'
benefits because their savings will no longger be beaten by inflation.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see why it should be opposed because it is meant to
protect workers against inflation and what we should do is to wait and
give it a chance and see how it works," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, workers' savings will be pitted against the rise
and fall of the strength of the country's currency Kwacha so that
the value of one's savings is not eroded with the passing of time.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned employers that it will be a punishable
offence for them to deduct money from workers' salaries without
remitting it to the new scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government also plans to amend the industrial and
labor relations act on provision of housing for employees so as to
create a living wage for all workers to enable them to acquire
accommodation for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The government does not have the capacity to provide accommodation
for all its employees, said Machungwa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Weakening Baht Keeps Thai Bourse Sagging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index today lost another 10.53 points to close at 737.23,
plunging further from a bearish market last week.
</P>
<P>
The share market last week saw a total loss of 5.11 percent, or
40.28 points, from the previous week, to end the week at 747.76
points.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday alone the SET index dropped 20.83 points, or 2.7
percent, to close at 744.59, which was a 54-month low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchange rate of the Thai currency baht against
the surging U.S. dollar rose from 25.87 baht to 25.92, up five
satang, hitting a 10-year-high since January 1987.
</P>
<P>
The skyrocketing value of the U.S. dollar is considered a key
factor behind the stock market's steep 50-point plunge last week.
</P>
<P>
As the greenback continued its surge against the baht,
liquidity in the money market dried up as the Bank of Thailand
maintained high short-term rates to stem currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
As long as the threat of currency speculation persists, foreign
investors are expected to continue selling shares and shifting
their money to the currency market.
</P>
<P>
The stock market's sluggishness last week was also attributable
to the lunar new year. During the festival period local investors
were absent from the scene, while foreign investors were reluctant
to return due to the persistently high risk of playing the Thai
bourse, according to a source from a foreign brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, who once valued the Thai bourse by
inflation, now turned their ears to the weakening of the baht and
rumors of devaluation, which have been intensifying since 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the baht endured a relentless attack by currency
speculators, the stock market did not receive any good news last
week.
</P>
<P>
The situation was aggravated as banks moved to meet their
bi-monthly reserve requirements last Friday, and at the same time
huge amounts of capital were being withdrawn over the lunar new
year, which fell on Friday, February 7.
</P>
<P>
Tight liquidity was the result and the overnight interbank rate
skyrocketed to 30 percent late last week, while the inter-finance
rate reached 40 percent in the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The strong dollar also cast a shadow over the country's
macro-economic stability, prompting investors to sell Thai shares,
particularly of large-capitalized stocks.
</P>
<P>
The exit of foreign investors from the stock exchange deflated
the entire market. They were net sellers of 9.61 billion baht
(384.4 million dollars) last week, but the selling volume fell as
the weekend approached, according to a foreign broker.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the baht also cast fears over the corporate
foreign debt exposure of the companies, especially finance
companies. That only fueled the lack of confidence in the
country's economic stability, considering the possibility that
Thailand could run a budget deficit for the first time in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
The market was hit hard Wednesday by word of Somprasong Land
Plc's default on an interest payment on its Euro-convertible
debentures. The SET index dropped 20.83 points on that day alone.
</P>
<P>
The default spread fears among investors that other companies,
especially those in finance and property, might also fail to honor
their interest payment obligations.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are optimistic that the stock market would stage
a rebound next week, noting that the market has nearly bottomed
out and that the index should not fall under the 700-point level.
</P>
<P>
However, the optimism is not shared by many others, who do not
believe that a rebound is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors are keeping a close watch on the currency
market as the world's most wealthy nations, the G-7, have
expressed their displeasure with the strong dollar. Their
discomfort could precipitate a big change in the exchange rates of
the dollar against other currencies including the baht.
</P>
<P>
However, pressure on the baht to devalue is still as strong as
ever, as the country faced an economic slowdown and zero export
growth last year.

the verge of falling to the Tutsi-led rebels within weeks.

<P>
The city now risks to be submerged by 150,000 Hutu refugees
fleeing the Tingi-Tingi refugee camp near Lubutu, a city within

accident and five of them remained in hospital were in a stable
and satisfactory condition.

traveling on a tour group organized by a British travel agency.
</P>
<P>
Wong Wai-kwok, the 48-year-old driver of the float sponsored by
a local organization, was reported to have lost consciousness at
the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Officials of The Hong Kong Tourist Association, which organized
the parade to celebrate China's Lunar New Year, insisted that
all the floats had been checked and tested with no defects found
before the parade.

<HEADLINE> Iran Marks Anniversary of Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today hailed his country's independence when joining in
half a million people to mark the 18th anniversary of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the grand rally at Azadi square here, Rafsanjani
said "No one can deny that all decisions in Iran are made by the
representatives of the people. This independence is beautiful."
</P>
<P>
The revolution was pioneered by the late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and designed to oust the Iranian
monarchy, leading to the establishment of Islamic Republic of Iran
on April 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about economic achievements, Rafsanjani said that the
whole country has been turned into a large construction workshop.
</P>
<P>
"All over the country, gas, oil, mining, agricultural, power,
communications, education and industrial projects are underway with
full force," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that 250 industrial townships have been built in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"People are loyal and have hopes for better future because all
the present achievements have been made in the midst of the
enormous problems of the early years of the revolution and eight
years of the Iraqi imposed war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, huge masses of people, carrying pictures of
Khomeini and Ali Khamenei and chanting slogans in support of the
Islamic revolution, thronged into the streets of the Iranian
capital from different directions to march to Tehran's Azadi
square.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Increase Investments in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government is set
to invest at least one billion U.S. dollars a year in the
Philippines, Philippine House Speaker Jose de Venecia said here
today.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, who just completed a week-long official visit to
Japan, said his Japanese counterpart, Speaker Ito, made an
assurance that Japan is determined to increase its investments in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The House speaker said Japanese investments will be more on
mass housing projects, agriculture-related development schemes and
small and medium size enterprises.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia made the announcement after Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad intended to cut down Malaysian investments in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the decision Sunday after the Philippine Supreme
Court voided the sale of Manila Hotel to a Malaysian firm in favor
of a local corporation several days ago.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian firm won the bidding in 1995, but the court
awarded the bidding to the Manila Hotel Corporation, considering
that Manila Hotel is part of the country's "patrimony". Foreign
investors are complaining that the court should not change the
rule after the game was over.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Olympic Organisers Duck New Demand to Cut Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The organisers of next year's
Nagano Winter Olympics on Monday refused the International Ski
Federation (FIS) to upgrade Games venues.
</P>
<P>
John Johnston, head of the FIS freestyle ski committee, has
demanded the Nagano Olympic Organising Committee (NAOC) cut down
trees along the Olympic moguls course to build spectator stands.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder why Nagano doesn't make the most of this
opportunity," he told reporters at the end of the freestyle ski
world championships in Nagano on Sunday. "Trees will grow again in
the future, but the Olympics will probably never come back."
</P>
<P>
But NAOC deputy director general Fumio Watanabe insisted Monday
the FIS last year agreed to plans to accommodate 8,000 spectators
for the moguls and 12,000 for the aerials.
</P>
<P>
"I am not certain if officials within the FIS are fully aware
of the confirmed points," reports quoted Watanabe as saying. "We
should point them out if any request comes."
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the FIS had previously requested the change and
would make a fresh request in writing soon in the hope of
accomodating 18,000-20,000 for the moguls and 25,000 for the
aerials.
</P>
<P>
But the NAOC official highlighted that the Olympic freestyle
ski venue in Iizuna-Kogen was part of a national park where
wildlife is strictly protected by law.
</P>
<P>
"We may take steps to provide a better view for spectators but
we cannot unilaterally fell trees," he said, citing the daunting
task to convince the state environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
Johnston recalled that freestyle ski was the first sport to
have its tickets sold out at the last Olympics in Lillehammer
where capacity crowds of 15,000 and 12,000 watched the aerials and
the moguls respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fresh pressure mounted on the NAOC as they began the
one-year countdown Friday to the biggest Winter Games in history
while a string of pre-Olympic events exposed a host of
organisational, logistic and financial headaches.
</P>
<P>
Citing financial and environmental constraints, the NAOC have
been resisting FIS requests to raise the start point for the men's
downhill course and to install floodlights at the ski jumping hill
so events can be rescheduled easily in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
Narrow road links and a cross-country ski course with no
spectators along its mountain tracks also came under criticism
during Nordic skiing World Cup events last month in Hakuba, 40
kilometers (25 miles) west of Nagano City.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- David Kipiani was appointed by
Georgian Soccer Federation as the new head coach of the national
team, officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kipiani was chosen to succeed Alexander Chivadze, who resigned

fall.
</P>
<P>
Once a successful player on the Soviet national team, Kipiani's
playing career ended in 1982 due to an injury.
</P>
<P>
He has been coaching the Dinamo Tbilisi team, which has
dominated Georgian soccer in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Kipiani will keep the Dinamo Tbilisi job along with his new
post, said Nodar Akhalkazi, the federation chairman.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Warriors Invade Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkana warriors of Kenya have
invaded Kabong in Uganda's northeastern District of Kotido in search
of pasture and water, reported the local daily the New Vision
today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yellem, a local official of the district, was quoted as
saying that the warriors estimated at 10,000 together with their
families and animals, are now pitching camp in Tamu Parish in the
district.
</P>
<P>
He said the warriors came from Kakuma in Kenya's Turkana District.
</P>
<P>
He added they started arriving at Karamoja in northeastern
Uganda last week and the number has since increased.
</P>
<P>
''We are worried because the influx of the warriors is alarming
in our sub-district. The biggest problem is the larger number of
cows. We are in a dry spell, we do not have enough grazing land,''
Yellem said.
</P>
<P>
He said Edward Eko, the Commissioner of his district, visited the
warriors and signed an agreement with them on not disrupting peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Yellem said although the warriors outnumber the local
population, both communities are beneficiaries. ''We sell them
food in exchange for animals,'' he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Security Talks to Start Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and the
Palestinians are due to start negotiations in eight panels
dealing with security and other issues to further implement the
Interim Agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
This was decided during a summit meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat Sunday night at Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The panels, which are called for in the recent Hebron
pullback accord, include ones regarding the establishment of a
Palestinian airport in Gaza, the construction of a Gaza
seaport and safe passage for Palestinians between the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army is expected to head the Israeli side of
the talks, since the main point of contention over these
issues is Israel's insistence on adequate security provision to
prevent smuggling into the West Bank and unauthorized entry
into Israel.
</P>
<P>
Other talks to resume include those on transferring Israeli
excise taxes and other moneys to the PNA, whose financial
distress reportedly emerged as one of Arafat's major concerns at
Sunday night's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The economic committee is to meet as early as this week,
headed by Arafat's economic adviser Khalid Salam.
</P>
<P>
Under the Paris economic agreement of 1994 between Israeli
government and the PNA, Israel agreed to rebate to PNA tax money
collected from Palestinians in petroleum excise taxes, customs,
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a promising continuation of the Hebron
agreement," Netanyahu told reporters after the meeting. "We are
continuing in that spirit of cooperation to resolve all our
outstanding problems and matters."
</P>
<P>
Arafat described the meeting as "important," saying that they
have discussed "the details of the problems, especially the
points which have to be implemented after the Hebron agreement."
</P>
<P>
Kicking off the talks next Sunday will be Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, who
both participated in Sunday's summit meeting, and head the
ongoing liaison committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was also accompanied to the meeting by top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat and Palestinian Preventive
Security chiefs Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials termed the meeting "constructive" and "very
upbeat," and were pleased to hear their Palestinian counterparts
saying they believe "the chemistry between the leaders is
improving."
</P>
<P>
Among other issues raised during the meeting was Netanyahu's
insistence that the PNA close its institutions operating in
Jerusalem in contravention of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier also called for ensuring that militants
are promptly apprehended, prosecuted and punished, and not
released.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to go to Hebron today, to celebrated Id al-Fitr,
Islamic holiday marking the end to a-month-long Ramadan fast, and
receive Palestinian women prisoners who are to be released there
Tuesday, a senior Palestinian official said.

<HEADLINE> Hot Lines "Hot" in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Tongwan, a resident of
Pudong New Area in China's leading industrial and commercial city
of Shanghai called the hot line, 58601999, for help on the eve of
the Chinese Lunar New Year, because his color TV set did not work.
</P>
<P>
The hot line, run by the Social Development Bureau of the
Pudong New Area, sent a volunteer to help Zhang with the problem
right after receiving the call.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhai Jieping, an employee of the "58601999" hot
line, said that the center has received more than 5,000 such calls
since its establishment less than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The center has helped repair household electric applicances,
and has helped with medical services and telephone purchases, she
added.
</P>
<P>
She said the center is non-profit and most of the people
working here are volunteers. People only need to pay for materials
consumed in the repair services.
</P>
<P>
So far, the hot line has attracted more than 800 volunteers
with various skills, she added.
</P>
<P>
The hot line is only one of Shanghai's 260 hot lines covering
aid to the needy, protection of women and children, psychological
consulting service, health care information for old people,
complains of consumers and tourists, education of young people,
power and water supply, urban construction and public
transportations.
</P>
<P>
Now Shanghai has opened over 20 hot lines for supervising goods
sold in the city as a part of the effort to crack down on shoddy
and fake goods.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers may seek jobs by calling the special hot line.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists here believed that the hot lines will play a more
and more important role in this city with people over 60 years old
accounting for 17 percent of the city's total population, which is
13 million.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Issue Regional Passport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A regional passport is
expected to be issued by the East African Co-operation (EAC),
formed by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, to facilitate free movement
of people in the region.
</P>
<P>
A decision to this effect would be made during the next EAC
heads of state summit scheduled to be held in Tanzania's northern
town of Arusha in April, according to the local weekly East
African today.
</P>
<P>
During a preparatory meeting for the summit earlier this
month, immigration and customs officers from the three EAC member
countries discussed the reintroduction of inter-state passes and
the harmonization of charges for temporary import of motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Separate counters for east Africans have been established at
international airports and border posts to facilitate free
movement of persons within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
But according to EAC officials, regional efforts to ease
border crossing for east Africans have been hampered by a lack of
budget which should be provided by the member states.
</P>
<P>
EAC was revived in March 1996. As a regional bloc, it is
stepping up pace to enhance regional economic integration in east
Africa.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gold, Foreign Exchange Reserves Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold and
foreign exchange reserves reached 2.61 billion U.S. Dollars in
January, according to an official report from the Reserve Bank
today.
</P>
<P>
This was a 324-million-U.S.-Dollar increase over the
previous month, and the reserves were at their highest level
since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects the thaw in foreign investors's attitudes towards
South Africa after freezing out the country for almost a year,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from currency and bond markets also
confirmed that the much-needed foreign capital is flowing back
into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's local currency Rand last week ended at a
mid-rate of 4.44, having firmed about 24 cents to the U.S. Dollar
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the gold price is relatively weak, falling below 340
U.S. Dollars. The lower gold price and strong Rand are taking
their toll on the Rand gold price, which is said to be at lowest
level in 11 months last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Report: EU Sends Letter of Hebron Assurance to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
reportedly wrote a letter of assurance to Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat on the eve of the Hebron
redeployment deal, pledging that it would "use all its
political and moral weight" to ensure that the agreement is
"fully implemented."
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted EU Middle East coordinator
Miguel Moratinos as saying that the letter helped clinch the
Hebron accord, and it was officially presented to Arafat after
the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos participated in the summit meeting between Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat last month when the
Hebron deal was finally initialed.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo
whose country currently holds the rotating chairmanship of the EU,
was apparently written at Arafat's behest.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Moratinos refused to discuss the
letter in detail, but did deny an interpretation of it that
the EU, Israel's largest trading partner, would put massive
pressure upon Israel if Israel does not live up to its
side of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We are against pressure," Moratinos said. "We believe that
the approach to take is to seek to persuade the parties to
move forward on peace."
</P>
<P>
He said that the contents of the letter were drafted after
consultations with the United States, whose former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher wrote a letter of assurance to both
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. letter to the Palestinians, Christopher said the
U.S. is "committed" to a full implementation, while that
to Israel does not go beyond saying that the U.S. policy is
to "support and promote" full implementation.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reference to Netanyahu, who has championed the
phrase, the EU letter to the Palestinians includes the idea
of "reciprocity," the Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Moratinos also insisted that
Netanyahu be aware of the EU letter before it was sent.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Herbs Doctors Visit Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A four-man team of Japanese
doctors is visiting Uganda, reported the local daily the New
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
The team arrived in the country last Monday and has been received
in Mbarara, southwestern Uganda, by Resident District Commissioner
of the Mbarara area Sikubwabo Kyeune.
</P>
<P>
Sikubwabo said the coming of the team was timely and can
orientate the thinking of Ugandans so that they can also start
looking at local herbs as a cure to some diseases.
</P>
<P>
''Today our people cannot imagine how their ancestors used to
servive without factory manufactured drugs. If they had sense they
would use this chance because our vegetation is rich in natural herbs
which are very effective,'' Sikubwabo said.
</P>
<P>
The team will also visit Bushenyi Town, 50 km west of Mbarara, and
all the subcounties in Kabale District near Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
It will interact with Ugandan traditional healers and educate
the population on the general use of their methods of healing.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese doctors belong to a global organization, Kai-Igaku
Network, which is also referred to as Comfortable Healing, based in
Tokyo, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The network has taken the best out of every traditional
practise in the world to use in their method of treatment. The
doctors of the organization use the simplest tools which every
household can easily use because it is affordable , available,
accessible and scientifically viable. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S. East Beats West 132-120 to Win NBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. East Conference won the
1997 NBA All-Star Game by beating the West a 132-120 tonight in
Cleveland, Ohio, claiming a victory of the Game for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
The West led the game all the way through the second period and
scored over 20 points more than its counterpart before the East
began to organize its offensives.
</P>
<P>
But, the East rallied by Chicago's Michael Jordan, started to
revenge in the later period of the first half and over-passed the
West in the earlier time of the second half. The East since
brought the advantage to the end of the game and left its rival
behind by some 10 or more points all the way.
</P>
<P>
Glen Rice of Charlotte was named the game's most valuable
player as he made three straight three-point shots early in the
second half to culminate the rally and established All-Star
records for most points in a period (20) and a half (24).
</P>
<P>
Rice had 26 for the game with Anfernee Hardaway of Orlando
scoring 19 and Vin Baker of Milwaukee adding 19.
</P>
<P>
Jordan posted the first triple-double in the history of the
event to rally his team in the earlier half way. Playing just
about half the game, he scored 14 points with 11 rebounds and 11
assists.
</P>
<P>
The West was led by Latrell Sprewell of Golden State with 19,
Gary Payton of Seattle with 17 and John Stockton of Utah with 12.
</P>
<P>
Payton scored seven points for the West in the first period
when his team was in a 34-21 favorable situation. But he has
hardly added much of the cores to his team in the second half as
the East's players began to control the Game soon.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Asks Malaysia to Reconsider Move to Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that he hopes Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad would reconsider his move to cut down investments
in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Mahathir's move was "natural and expected" following
the Philippine Supreme Court's recent voiding of the sale of the
historic Manila Hotel to Malaysia's Renong Ltd. in favor of the
Manila Prince Hotel Group.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir warned Sunday that Malaysian investors "must be
careful and should not invest too much" in the Philippines after
the Supreme Court made the adverse ruling.
</P>
<P>
However, President Ramos said, business decisions are made by
the private sector who have the money to invest, not heads of
government.
</P>
<P>
"I hope, therefore, that Malaysia, as a whole, government as
well as the business sector look at the totality of the
Philippines as an attractive, friendly, hospitable investment
destination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos criticized the Supreme Court's decision, saying
that "an intrusive supreme court" would affect the business
climate in the country, particularly foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
He said he had to make public his sentiment on this issue
because "too much is at stake," saying the war against poverty
being waged by his government and the country's sustainable
development will be set back by the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
The ruling also drew flak from the local chambers of commerce
of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and
some European Countries. They warned that their money "will go
elsewhere unless the rules are clear (in the Philippines)."

LISBON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria defeated Spain 3-2 in
Alverca, Portugal on Sunday in the final of the Meridian Cup, a
nine-day under-17 tournament involving eight national teams from

</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Hashimo Garba opened the scoring after 10 minutes

in a spectacular first-time volley.
</P>
<P>
Spain equalized just before the interval, Francisco Jusue
pouncing on an error by the Nigerian defense, but Bright
Igbinalador put the Africans back on top with a 70th-minute shot
from the edge of the area.
</P>
<P>
Despite being reduced to 10 men after Antonio Hidalgo was sent
off the pitch, the Spaniards managed to pull back level through
Pablo Gonzalez before Chijioke Nwankpa burst through to beat the
keeper and seal victory in the 80th minute.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the third place, Portugal defeated Greece
2-1 with a golden goal in the extra time.

<HEADLINE> India's Import Surge Unlikely in Consumer Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- India's recent move to
liberalize trade restrictions will not result in a flood of
consumer durables imports and consequently will not put any
pressure on the balance of payments (BOP), government officials
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government relaxed last Saturday import restrictions
for 92 items of consumer goods including electronics.
</P>
<P>
"Back-of-the-book calculations show that the increased imports
on this count would measure 400-500 million US dollars in the
first year and then taper off to about 100 million dollars in the
following year. Most of the items are available in the country and
the only difference is quality. this segment of the demand is
negligible," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, with most of the segments like televisions and
refrigerators being dominated by foreign companies through joint
ventures in the post-liberalization phase, an adverse impact on
domestic players, too, is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The latest move was part of the government's efforts to
gradually withdraw quantitative restrictions on imports and
replace them with tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Under the World Trade Organization ( WTO) obligations,
quantitative restrictions cannot be sustained unless and until
they are justified due to balance of payments considerations, the
officials said.

<HEADLINE> India's Export Growth Plummets This Year: Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- India's strong export growth
post in 1995-96 could not be sustained in the first half of the
current financial year (April 1, 1996-March 31, 1997), according
to the provisional data received from the Directorate General of
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI &AMP; S).
</P>
<P>
The DGCI &AMP; S report said that the exports at 16.14 billion US
dollars rose by 9.9 percent during April-September, 1996-97, as
against a 26.4 percent rise during the same period in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Imports, on the other hand, registered a decelerated growth of
5.2 percent to 17.953 billion dollars compared to a 32.8 percent
rise against the previous fiscal.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade deficit narrowed down to 1.813 billion
dollars during the period under review (lower by 567 million
dollars) than that of 2.380 billion dollars in April-September,
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a sustained expansion in the domestic economic
activity and the continued trade liberalization, the exports
registered a surge of 20.9 percent while the imports rose by 26.9
percent in the US dollar terms in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The DGCI &AMP; S report did not give any reason for the lower
growth of the country's export this year. Some press reports
attributed this to political unstability in the country.

<HEADLINE> East Beats West in NBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Glen Rice scored a record 20
points in the third quarter and Michael Jordan had the first
triple-double in All-Star Game history to lead the East for a
132-120 victory over the West in Cleveland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rice was also named most valuable player of the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
On a day where 49 of 50 greatest players in league history
stood before the crowds at halftime, Rice shot his way to the
greatest quarter and Jordan posted the greatest all-around game in
the history of the series, which the Eastern Conference leads,
30-17.
</P>
<P>
The East took control for good in the third quarter behind
Rice, who shot poorly in Saturday's Long Distance Shootout and
missed six of seven first-half shots. The Charlotte Hornets guard
drilled four straight three-pointers and never cooled off, making
eight of 11 shots in the period as the East built a 97-87 lead.
He had more points in the period than any other player had in the
game.
</P>
<P>
Rice broke the record set in 1968 by Philadelphia 76ers guard
Hal Greer, on hand as one of the 50 all-time greatest. Rice ended
up with 26 points, including a record 24 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Wilt Chamberlain -- also a top-50 member -- scored 23 points in
a half in 1962. Tom Chambers equaled the mark in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the first of the 50 introduced at intermission, keyed a
second-quarter surge that saw the East erase almost all of a
23-point deficit in a five-minute span. The superstar guard of
the Chicago Bulls did not shoot well but finished with 14 points,
11 rebounds and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Magic point guard Penny Hardaway made sure the West
didn't rally, directing the offense and finishing with 19 points.
Milwaukee Bucks forward Vin Baker also added 19 for the East,
which has won three of the last four All-Star Games.

COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) will provide 15.8 million U.S. dollars to Sri Lanka
for a program to benefit women and children, according to official
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The program of cooperation between the Sri Lankan government
and the UNICEF was singed here last Friday for the period of
1997-2001.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the UNICEF is urging donor countries to fund a 10
million U.S. dollars program to assist women and children affected
by the ongoing ethnic war in Sri Lanka, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As malnutrition is the major problem facing Sri Lanka's
children, the UNICEF has placed emphasis on nutrition improvement
program.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of child labor and sexual exploitation of
children is another important program under the project, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNICEF launched a child immunization program
successfully where 85 percent of the children were immunized
against TB, polio, whopping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and
measles. Consequently, the infant mortality rate has reduced
remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's infant mortality rate reached a low level of 17 per
1,000 live births in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Peru's government and rebels will
hold talks on Tuesday in a bid to solve the hostage crisis at the
Japanese ambassador's residence, President Alberto Fujimori said
today.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who is in London for a visit, announced that his
chief negotiator for the hostage crisis, Domingo Palermo, would
meet the rebel chief's deputy in preliminary talks.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was quoted as saying by Peruvian radio that he hoped
the preliminary talks would make enough progress to enter
definitive talks.
</P>
<P>
The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) and the
government have not had talks since December 28. The MRTA rebels,
who are holding 72 hostages in the 54-day-old siege in Lima, have
brought their cause to worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
The hostages still in the Japanese ambassador's residence
included the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia, Peruvian government
minister, Japanese and local businessmen, and Fujimori's brother,
Pedro.
</P>
<P>
MRTA's main demand is the release of its 400 jailed followers,
but Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants, refuses to do so.
</P>
<P>
MRTA's deputy Roli Rojas, 34, is from a poor family. After
graduating from college, he joined MRTA in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Investigating Alleged Kidnapping of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it
was investigating a foreign news report that a Malaysian forest
engineer had been kidnapped by separatists in Angola for alleged
spying for the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Malaysian High
Commission in Harare, which also covers Angola, was directed to
investigate the news report, but it has yet to receive any report
confirming the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said today his ministry will have to verify the report before
commenting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"I have to verify the truth of the report before making any
comments," Badawi was quoted by Malaysia's official news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the foreign ministry and the High Commission
in Harare would monitor the situation and take the necessary
action should there be confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The news report, carried in the newspapers here today, said a
Malaysian, Omar Norola, along with a Filipino, Marcelin Alime,
both working as forest engineers for a Malaysian firm, Iniwangsa
Private Limited, were kidnapped on February 8 in the oil-rich
enclave of Cabinda, by the separatist Cabinda Liberation Front --
Cabindan Armed Forces (CAF).
</P>
<P>
The separatists alleged they were sent to work in the forestry
company by the Angolan government on a "spying and reconnaissance
mission in the CAF controlled zones," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A separatist official Emmanuel N'Zita was quoted as saying in
the report that they would be punished according to "the
revolutionary law" which calls either for expulsion or death.
</P>
<P>
The separatists warned all staff of foreign companies to leave
Cabinda or risk capture and possible execution, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government declared a
national emergency Sunday after heavy rains pounding most part of
country left tens of thousands homeless and paralyzed key roads.
</P>
<P>
The rains, which the government said were the worst in Bolivia
in nearly three decades, destroyed the homes and crops of tens of
thousands of farmers, drowned large numbers of livestock and
flooded key roads, according reports from La Paz, Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
In central Bolivia, overflowing rivers in the coca
leaf-producing region of Chapare have left at least 20,000 farmers
homeless and without crops, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern state of Santa Cruz, soybean, corn and cotton
fields were flooded. Landslides and overflowing rivers were
expected to leave the main road between Santa Cruz, Bolivia's
second largest city, and La Paz closed for the next month.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern lowlands, tens of thousands of cattle have been
drowned, Agriculture Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent food, medical supplies and temporary
shelters to several disaster regions.
</P>
<P>
Health officials reported sharp increases in cases of malaria
and yellow fever, both spread by mosquitos that thrive in
water-soaked regions.
</P>
<P>
The government is concerned that should the rains continue,
they could seriously damage food crops that are Bolivia's third
largest export income earners.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Stresses Need for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda has stressed an urgent need for foreign investment in the
country to overcome the severe budgetary constraints the
government was facing, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the Steering Committee meeting of the United Front
government held here Sunday, the prime minister said that by the
next financial year, the government would have to find ways of
servicing a debt of 850 billion rupees (23.9 billion US dollars),
and find the money to make good an oil pool deficit of 200 billion
rupees (5.6 billion dollars) and fulfill the Pay Commission's
commitment of an additional 120 billion rupees (3.3 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister wanted his 13-party coalition partners,
particularly the left parties, to understand that the government
would find it difficult to honor its pledge to the poor and put
more money into the social sector unless it actively stimulated
foreign investment, the same official said.
</P>
<P>
The current financial year will come to an end by March 31,
1997 (April 1, 1996-March 31, 1997) and the government is expected
to table a new budget in the parliament session scheduled to start
from February 20.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Further Streamline State-Owned Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's current system of
state-owned businesses will be further streamlined to ensure its
leading role in the national economy, Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh
Hung said today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam boasts more than 6,000 state-owned businesses, which
account for more than 40 percent of domestic revenues and 80
percent of the country's total business turnover.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government introduced a new management mechanism
for state-owned enterprises in 1996 so that they will conform to
the country's new law on state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the government will continue to promote this mechanism
and develop new policies to overcome errors and fill gaps in the
management mechanism, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the 1997-2000 period the equitization of the
money-losing state-owned enterprises would be promoted in parallel
with the guarantee of state control, the granting of autonomy to
all state-owned businesses and the vigorous development of private
businesses.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 183 families were
made homeless on Sunday after a fire razed their homes in Kelapa
Gading district of north Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Antara
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
No lives were claimed in the incident but the material loss it
caused could reach a billion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 2,340
rupiah) in value, an official from the North Jakarta Fire
Department said last night.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started at 2 p.m., was likely caused by a
short-circuit and destroyed the houses easily because they were
built very close to each other.
</P>
<P>
The fire was extinguished at 5:45 p.m. by the fire department
with eight fire engines, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus under the
current account shrank 30.9 percent to 7.18 trillion yen (58.8
billion U.S. dollars) in calendar 1996, the finance ministry said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus, the broadest measure of goods and services as well
as investment income and other monetary transfers, fell 23.1
percent in December from a year earlier to 820.7 billion yen (6.72
billion dollars), but up from 664.1 billion yen (5.44 billion
dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise trade surplus for 1996 declined 26.2 percent to
9.1152 trillion yen (74.71 billion dollars). Exports grew 8.2
percent from a year earlier to 43,571.5 billion yen (357.14
billion dollars) as imports expanded by a 23.4 percent to reach
34,456.3 billion yen (282.43 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the pace of surplus decline is likely
to slow down in the coming months, as the weaker yen is expected
to boost exports and halt the fall of trade surplus -- the core of
the current account calculation.

<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the National Committee for Patriotic Health
Campaigns(NCPHC) made the remarks in a review of the
organizations' goals and achievements, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuliang, NCPHC's director, said that the NCPHC, in
co-operation with the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, will intensify its management over the production and
marketing for pesticides this year.
</P>
<P>
Poisonous chemicals must not be used to make pesticides and
violators must be handled severely in line with State regulations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pilot work has also been carried out to encourage farmers to
renovate toilets and protect the environment, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Most rural people who are still suffering from a shortage of
water and drinking unhygienic water are concentrated in the
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the NCPHC indicate that about 14 percent of the
villages do not have house-hold toilets and that only eight
percent of the renovated toilets are equipped to treat night soil
so that it will cause no harm.
</P>
<P>
Liu asks economically developed areas to support water
improvemnt and toilet renovation projects in the poor
districts. The NCPHC will launch training programs for waterworks
technicians in the rural area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Household toilet construction must be considered when plans are
drawn up for village development, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Reviews Philippines' Tax Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today began to put special focus on the Philippines' tax
reform program in its two-week assessment of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing review is expected to be the last to be undertaken
by the IMF and is intended to pave the way for the country's exit
from the fund's supervision after decades of tutelage.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the review last Friday, the IMF zeroed in on
the country's tax effort (the ratio of taxes over the gross
national product) which posted 16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The target for the year was 16.2 percent, but the IMF was said
to be satisfied with the 16.1 percent since it reflected the
success of reforms so far made by the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
Tax reforms promised by the government to the IMF is so
important that the review team and its government counterparts
have agreed to focus on examining the Comprehensive Tax Reform
Program and the few remaining components that Congress still has
to enact.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far completed two of the three parts of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Program which is aimed at broadening the
base for tax collecting.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said earlier that the
country's expected exit from the IMF in June this year will boost
the image of the country as one of Asia's emerging tiger
economies.

BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Investment Area
(AIA) will be completed by 2010, with each member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) free to liberalize
its investment climate on a unilateral basis.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand was
quoted today by local press as saying that the main goals of the
AIA were first the promotion of intra-ASEAN investment and then
investment from countries outside the group.
</P>
<P>
The source said officials would draft a framework agreement for
the establishment of the area in time to be signed by ASEAN
economic ministers at their annual meeting next year in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The source said the AIA would cover both the manufacturing and
service sectors but would focus on the manufacturing industries
during the first stage of implementation.
</P>
<P>
Measures to have the AIA in place in 2010 would be divided into
three segments -- investment facilitation and cooperation,
investment promotion and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The facilitation segment would involve the free flow of
capital, technology and skilled labor within the region.

MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov held talks for a second day on Sunday with kidnappers

</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported that the results of the

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Further Efforts for Closer Russian-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Both Russia and the United
States should make further efforts to remove the factors hampering
the development of their relations, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today after returning from a U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that removing legislative obstacles to the
development of bilateral trade is a prerequisite for smoother
Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
For Russia, he said, the main task is to improve its
legislation in the areas of ownership protection, investment
encouragement, trade, taxation, mortgage rights and financial
account settlement.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the prime minister emphasized, the United
States should remove its trade discrimination against Russia. He
urged the United States to completely repeal the Jackson-Vanik
amendment, a bill passed in 1974 establishing that a communist
country denying its citizens the right to emigrate, or imposing
conditions on emigration, cannot be granted most-favored-nation
trading status.
</P>
<P>
The amendment has prevented Russia from enjoying the
most-favored-nation treatment in the U.S. on a permanent and
unconditional basis, Chernomyrdin noted.
</P>
<P>
During Chernomyrdin's February 3-5 U.S. visit, the two sides
signed dozens of cooperation agreements and agreed that
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will hold a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, on March 20-31.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that his meeting with President Clinton was
"constructive," in which the Russian side reiterated that NATO's
eastward expansion would only complicate the situation.

<HEADLINE> More Thai Police Deployed to Stop Aliens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's border patrol
police and volunteers have been put on full alert along the border
with Malaysia to prevent the influx of illegal foreign workers
following Malaysia's recent policy to drastically crack down on
these aliens, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
A source in southern Thailand was quoted as saying that police
officers and villagers have been deployed to keep a close watch on
illegal workers along Kolok river bordering Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has begun a crackdown on an estimated
one million illegal foreign workers since January, driving a large
number of unwanted aliens into Thailand. Most of the aliens are
from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Since the crackdown, local Thai authorities were able to
arrested 400 illegal workers who were pushed back into Thai border
villages by Malaysian authorities, the source said.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the problem of illegal foreign workers, the Thai
National Security Council has recently proposed a visa-on-arrival
ban on South Asian nationals, particularly those from Bangladesh,
Pakistan, Nepal and India.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Challenge Ancient Customs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Rural Chinese used to stay
home during the traditional Chinese lunar New Year's day, wishing
each other happiness and prosperity in the year.
</P>
<P>
For generations, Chinese customs have spelt that people should
stay up late or for the whole night at home on the lunar New
Year's Eve. They were not supposed to get away from their home
in the first seven days of the new year.
</P>
<P>
However, such customs with regard to the annual longest
traditional lunar New Year Spring Festival, which fell on February
7 this year, are being challenged and, in many cases, neglected in
China as its traditional planned economic system is changing to a
socialist market economic system.
</P>
<P>
Wengang Town in Jinxian County of eastern Jiangxi Province,
east China, is the largest pelt and Chinese writing brushes market
in southern China. Almost all the 1,500 trading booths still
opened during the three-day national holiday and trading remained
active.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the town only had a population of some 1,000 people a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 pieces of pelt and tens of millions of
writing brushes are sold to other Chinese provinces and to Hong
Kong, Taiwan regions and other areas in southeast Asia each year,
with an annual business volume of more than 300 million yuan
(about 36 million US dollars), according to Wu Laizhong, a local
official.
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's a good opportunity for fur business and I
cannot afford to leave here for home," a fur trader from south
China's Guangdong Province told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The trader, who declined to give his name, said that he has
been doing so during the spring festival for three consecutive
years.

<P>
In China, it is a tradition that family members come home and
have a reunion during the lunar New Year Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
But Lai Shiqiu, a folklore scholar, said that the way Chinese
people spend traditional holidays such as the Spring Festival
changes naturally at a time of developing a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"As the economic and population structures change, people's
holiday celebrations change accordingly," Lai said, adding that
"this is social progress."
</P>
<P>
Wu said that more than 5,000 farmers of his town sell pelts and
writing brushes in other parts of China all the year round.
</P>
<P>
"A fairly large number of them don't come back home for the
Spring Festival because of good business," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zou Qingfeng, a farmer who runs a stationery shop and whose
father operates another one in Beijing, said that "our shops
open during the Spring Festival holiday every year."
</P>
<P>
"Business gets brisk during the new year holiday," Zou added.
</P>
<P>
Business is also brisk in other areas of in China during the
holiday, according to reports filed to Xinhua by its reporters
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the mushrooming of rural towns and various
specialized markets has brought great changes to the way Chinese
farmers live and work.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangxi, which is less developed compared with other
provinces in east China, the number of rural towns and markets
has gone up to more than 500, up seven times from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's total number of towns has
expanded by ten times to nearly 50,000 since 1979, when the
country introduced the policy of reform and opening up to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, some 200 million farmers, or 20 percent of
China's rural population, have ventured into new businesses apart
from farming.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Rebel NDF to Sign Peace Pact in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The peace negotiations between
the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front (NDF)
are showing signs of a fruitful end with the two sides being
expected to sign a peace agreement in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Government chief negotiator Howard Dee said the two parties
have expressed optimism to complete the peace talks by June after
having an eight-day meeting in the Netherlands, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Both panels said the meeting, which began on February 1,
proceeded as an informal meeting for several days and became a
formal one after they hammered out a number of important topics
which are subject to approval by their respective principals.
</P>
<P>
"Very very fruitful considering the atmosphere became very
cordial so it gave us basis to hope we can achieve what we have
been hoping for the past three years," said Solicitor General
Silvestre Bello, a member of the government peace panel.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos said on the same day that it is his
"fervent wish that the momentum of the talks be sustained until a
final peace settlement between the government panel and the NDF is
attained to continue the process of bringing peace with justice to
the Filipino people."
</P>
<P>
The NDF is one of the rebel groups in the country. After
signing a peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front
last year, the government is pursuing peace talks with the NDF and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Further Efforts for Closer Russian-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Both Russia and the United
States should make further efforts to remove the factors hampering
the development of their relations, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today after returning from a U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that solving legislative problems in the
economic field is a prerequisite for the smooth development of
Russian-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
For Russia, he said, the main task is to improve its
legislation in the areas of ownership protection, investment
encouragement, trade, taxation, mortgage rights and financial
account settlement.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the prime minister emphasized, the United
States should remove its trade discrimination against Russia. He
urged the United States to completely repeal the Jackson-Vanik
amendment which has prevented Russia from enjoying the
most-favored-nation treatment in the U.S. on a permanent and
unconditional basis.
</P>
<P>
During Chernomyrdin's February 3-5 U.S. visit, the two sides
signed dozens of cooperation agreements and agreed that
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will hold a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, on March 20-31.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that his meeting with President Clinton was
"constructive," in which the Russian side reiterated that NATO's
eastward expansion would only complicate the situation.

<HEADLINE> Sainz Leads in Swedish Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Former world rallying
champion Carlos Sainz of Spain drove superbly to hold a 12 seconds
lead over former British teammate Colin McRae at the Swedish Rally
in Karlstad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Overnight leader Kenneth Eriksson of Sweden was in third 27
seconds in arrears of Sainz and Finnish world champion Tommi
Makinen was fourth 54 seconds off the pace.
</P>
<P>
Sainz, bidding to become the first non Scandinavian to win the
rally, seized the initiative from the start and recorded the best
times in the 10th and 11th special stages.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, penalised on Saturday for arriving late to begin one
of the afternoon sections, recorded the second fastest time on the
10th special stage despite hitting a rock as did first day leader
Thomas Radstrom, who later received a 10 second penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sainz then took advantage of the brake problems that McRae and
Eriksson's Subaru's were suffering and took the lead off the
Briton, who had held it since the 12th stage, on the 17th stage,
while Makinen mounted something of a comeback overtaking Radstrom
for fourth place overall.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Says Americans Are Partners, Not Superiors of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said today that after the ending of the Cold War, Americans have
become partners, not superiors of Europe.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with French Television Channel One (TF1) in
Bonn, Kohl said that although Germany and France declared their
adherence to NATO in their joint defense strategic concept signed
in Nuremberg last December, this does not mean that they have
submitted themselves to Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Being part of NATO is not submission to Americans. The Cold
War is no more, the Americans are our partners, not superiors,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Germany does not want to enter the club of
nuclear powers "through a by-door."
</P>
<P>
By stressing the joint security interests between France and
Germany, French President Jacques Chirac and Kohl agreed in the
Nuremberg accord to develop a common nuclear deterrent strategy
under the auspices of the trans-Atlantic military alliance, NATO.
</P>
<P>
On European construction, Kohl said that no country should be
excluded from European single currency due to be realized by 1999,
which he said is indispensable for the development of political
union of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will decide in the spring of 1998 which
countries will be in the first to launch the single currency,
Euro, by January 1, 1999, after meeting the criteria for joining
the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, and Benelux are expected to be in the first
wave to join the EMU.
</P>
<P>
"Let each do what it has got to do, and then, in the spring of
1998, we will see,"said Kohl. "This is a difficult process for
each country, I don't want that the Germans give advices to
others."
</P>
<P>
On a future European central bank to be established in
Frankfurt, Kohl said that he does not agree with France's proposal
to set up a political authority, to be capable of intervention in
monetary policies, along with such a bank.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, for a government, it can be useful to make
orientation of the policy of a central bank... But the German
experience shows that, finally, it is not so bad that the
government does not intervene," he said.

auspices of the French government and with the participation of
the U.N., Egypt and Ethiopia, stipulates that the arbitration
commission will resolve the conflict by taking up the case in two
stages. The first stage is to examine the issue of territorial
sovereignty over the Hanish archipelago, and the second, to
consider the issue of maritime borders between the two countries.
