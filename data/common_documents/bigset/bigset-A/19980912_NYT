LISTLESS METS LOSE TO EXPOS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>

 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ It seems every time the Chicago Cubs win, the New
York Mets win. So, it was only natural that on a day when the Cubs
lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates at Wrigley Field, the Mets kept in
step with their main rival for the National League wild card, by
losing Friday night to the Montreal Expos, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was galling for the Mets, who have lost five of eight
games to the Expos this season. Montreal received six and one-third
strong innings from the starter Carl Pavano and back-to-back eighth
inning homers from Vladimir Guerrero and Fernando Seguignol to put
the game away. And yes, Montreal had just taken two of three here
from the Atlanta Braves, prompting the perennial NL champions into
calling their first closed-door meeting of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like that since I've been here,'' said John Franco.
``The teams that we need to beat, it seems like we can't beat them.
And we need to beat these teams. It just looked like we were kind
of flat tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which stands to figure, considering their were only 10,584
paying customers in Olympic Stadium Friday night. The only reminder
that there was a pennant race was on the scoreboard in left, which
showed that Milwaukee had outslugged Chicago, 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae _ who drove in the Mets' only run with a
seventh-inning double that followed a Mike Piazza one-out double _
later said that the Expos, who may not have a home here for much
longer, are obviously playing this week as if this were their
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And, for at least one night, the Mets did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was any fault of Bobby Jones, who allowed five hits
in seven innings. But Jones (9-8) allowed a run-scoring double in
the fifth to Montreal's No. 8 hitter, Mike Mordecai, after Jones
had just walked a catcher named Bob Henley.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Expos nicked Jones for a pair of two-out runs in
the sixth for a 3-0 lead, the run-scoring hits coming from Henley
and Mordecai. Mordecai's came on a freak play at first, one that
left Matt Franco watching replays of the play after the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets trailing 1-0, Guerrero singled to left on a
full-count pitch with one out. After Guerrero advanced to second on
a ground-out, Jones intentionally walked Derrick May to bring up
Henley. But on a 1-2 pitch, Henley sent a dying line drive to right
field that Lenny Harris could not come up with. Guerrero scored
from second for a 2-0 lead. And pinch-runner Terry Jones advanced
from first to third.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Mordicay, who drilled a one-hopper back up the
middle. Jones blocked the ball with his right forearm and threw
from his knees to first. Franco, who was at first for the second
consecutive game with John Olerud back in New York (Olerud is
tentatively expected back for Saturday night's game), initially
gloved the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Mordicai, who appeared to be running just inside the
baseline, knocked Franco's glove off his hand with his left knee.
The ball went spinning up the baseline. And Jones scored from third
to make it a 3-0 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it,'' said Franco of Jones' throw. ``I caught it. But he
hit my glove. And it just took my glove off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets still had a chance entering the eighth. But when Greg
McMichael surrendered the consecutive homers _ Guerrero's 36th to
tie a franchise record and Seguignol's first in the major leagues _
the Mets had wasted a golden opportunity to overtake the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game you lose is a missed opportunity,'' Mets manager
Bobby Valentine said. ``And if we win the rest of ours, we know we
are at least going to tie the Cubs. We are going to lose some
games, though. I like to think we can win them all, but I don't
think that's realistic. They have good arms. They matched each
other for five innings. But they cashed in on a couple of walks.
And we didn't cash in on much.''

 &HT;    With garden's help, lifetime of memories springs ever fresh
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue Ridge -- Edna Dickey is sitting on the porch of her trailer
home, enjoying the last full flush of summer. Everything in her
garden is lush on this day: the elephant's-ear, hosta, rose, holly,
chrysanthemum.
</P>
<P>
   In her 90s and frail, Dickey doesn't dig, plant or water anymore
_ friends and neighbors stop in and do that for her. But, like many
in her situation, she gardens in her mind. And, ``I have all these
remembrances.''
</P>
<P>
   So many memories. Of the garden and the garden of life. She is
said to be the last member of a community of black people living in
Blue Ridge. Other homes in what once was called Lost End now are
grown over, obscured and consumed by kudzu and other ravages of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey is one of the many people featured in the comprehensive
``Facets of Fannin: A History of Fannin County, Georgia,'' edited
by Ethelene Dyer Jones. Moving to the area in the mid-1930s from
her native Marietta to take a job as a maid, Dickey married, had
children, overcame Jim Crow and became a respected member of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the experiences of black people in Fannin, she says
in the book that life in the county was bad for some. ``They had to
move away to have opportunities. But for me, it's been a good
place. In the 53 years that I've lived in Fannin County, folks have
always been real good to me. Real good!''
</P>
<P>
   Years have passed since that interview, and on the August day
Lyn and I visited, she said the same words.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche Tilley, her neighbor and friend of 25 years, is one of
the reasons Dickey has had such a good experience here. And these
days, Tilley is one of the reasons Dickey's garden looks so loved.
But the competition is stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go down a lot of time and offer to water,'' says Tilley,
``and she'll say, `No, somebody's beat you to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   That there are so many people so willing to care for another
person's garden is a graphic illustration of the bond gardeners
share _ a bond that overcomes all the separators so prevalent in
society: race, class, age, income, geography. Gardening is the
great connector.
</P>
<P>
   If she is brought down over her inability to tend the garden she
built (``I set out all this junk,'' Dickey says irreverently), she
doesn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she sees her current status _ observer, appreciator _ as
simply another phase in the evolution of gardening life. To be
sure, if any gardener lives long enough, she stands a chance of
having something happen that prevents her going out there to throw
herself into backaching work. Stroke got Dickey three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the porch, she talks, as all mountain gardeners do,
about the difficulty of making anything grow in the rocky earth.
Looking out over her space, Dickey acknowledges that she has done
all right.
</P>
<P>
   And because she planted so many perennials and reseeding
annuals, the garden she can no longer groom still is hers. As these
flowers spread, it is as if she goes out there each spring and
plants anew. One of her favorites is touch-me-not, which grows all
around one section to the right of her door: ``You put them out,
and you never have to plant them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and as they return each year, you can sit and watch them
grow, spread and flower amid all those remembrances.

 &HT;    Mushrooms are popping up all over the place
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   September is a great month for mushrooms in Georgia _ if there
is sufficient rain. Water triggers the reproductive mechanisms in
mushrooms, which are actually the fruiting bodies of fungi that
live below the soil surface or on wood. ``We had a burst of
rainfall a few weeks ago, and there were a lot of mushrooms out,''
says University of Georgia mushroom expert David Porter. Since
then, however, it's been dry over most of the state. Still, there
are a fair number of mushrooms showing themselves, says Porter. ``I
am seeing some species of boletes (fleshy, stalked mushrooms that
usually grow in the ground in woods), a good number of different
species of
</P>
<P>
   lepiotas (the common urban and suburban mushrooms that grow in
grassy areas, lawns and along roadsides), russulas (gilled
mushrooms that have a distinctively brittle flesh) and others,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He is also keeping a close eye on some rotting logs in his yard.
Earlier this year, he ``inoculated'' them with spores of the very
tasty oyster mushroom, and he is expecting a good crop for use in
his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   If there is some heavy rain during the next few weeks, other
mushrooms likely will be popping up all over the place, including
the jelly fungi, which can be soft, gelatinous, stiff or rubbery
and appear bloblike, brainlike, earlike or leaflike; the bird nest
fungi, so named because their cuplike shape resembles bird nests
with eggs inside; and the deadly amanitas.
</P>
<P>
   To see some of these mushrooms, you can accompany Porter on a
mushroom walk at 10 a.m. Sept. 26 in the Dukes Creek-Smithgall
Woods Conservation Area near Helen in northwest Georgia. Porter
will lead another walk at 10 a.m. Sept. 27 at the State Botanical
Garden in Athens. The walks are free and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD NOTES: The trails in the Chattahoochee National Recreation
Area _ especially the Mulberry Loop Trail in the Johnson's Ferry
unit _ are good places to see fall butterflies right now, says
naturalist Jerry Hightower. The blooming joe-pye weed, ironweed,
elephant's-foot, liatris and other fall wildflowers ``are covered
with butterflies,'' he says. ``You can also see a lot of the larva
(caterpillars) of various butterflies and moths right now.''
Especially interesting, he says, are the scores of cankerworms
hanging from their long silk strands. ``The wind blows the strands
and the worms over to other trees, where the worms find new food
sources,'' he says. But getting the most attention, he notes, are
the orange-stripe oak worms. Scores of them are munching on oak
leaves throughout the recreation area. In many oak trees, the
worms, which have black bodies with a mustard-colored stripe, are
so plentiful that one can hear their droppings hitting the forest
floor _ ``sort of like a gentle rainfall,'' says Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   The big, orb-weaving spiders are out, and there's a good chance
you may be engulfed in their sticky, silky webs _ magnificent feats
of engineering _ when you walk outdoors. The largest orb weaver is
the argiope. Other orb weavers include the neoscona, which has a
black square highlighted with a white strip and dots on its belly;
micrathena, a smaller spider with an elongated abdomen; and
verrucosa, which can be recognized by its triangular back.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE SKY: The moon will be at last quarter phase this evening,
rising out of the east about midnight, says Fernbank Science Center
astronomer David Dundee. The planets Jupiter and Saturn rise out of
the east just after dark while Mars rises out of the east about 3.5
hours before sunrise. Mercury is very low in the east just before
sunrise.

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ The last time Samuel Champi was in
Vietnam, he was a 24-year-old Army engineer, building a
1,000-foot-long steel bridge across the Ban Thach River on the
central coast. The bridge was to be a crucial link on the main
north-south highway used by U.S. military convoys, so he pulled
round-the-clock shifts to complete it by early 1969.
</P>
<P>
   On a tropical afternoon nearly three decades later, Champi stood
stiffly in a gilded reception room here as the deputy chairman of
the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City awarded him a license to
build 40,000 low-cost apartment units in the suburbs of this
teeming city, once known as Saigon. If completed, the project will
be one of the largest U.S. business investments ever in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   For Champi, now 53 and a contractor in Bernardsville, N.J., it
would also be a chance to return to Vietnam and pick up where he
left off _ as a builder in a land where Americans mostly destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he would put it that way. Champi says he has few
misgivings about his experiences in the Vietnam War. And he rejects
the suggestion that he is coming back on a personal odyssey to
right old wrongs or to put the war behind him. ``I don't think we
owe the Vietnamese anything, because we were doing what we thought
was right for them at the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that history hangs over the project. Three of
his partners are Vietnam veterans, and so is the retired admiral
who brokered the deal, Edward Sheafer. Champi's company, Point
Enterprises International, is named after the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point, where he and two other partners were part of the
class of 1966. Over all, that group suffered one of the highest
mortality rates in the war of all West Point classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say this is an accident, but it ain't no accident,''
said Tom Carhart, a partner and classmate of Champi's who was
wounded twice as an infantry officer in Vietnam. ``I was a soldier,
and I did my duty as a soldier. But we caused a lot of damage in
that country. It's nice to go back and do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Carhart and Champi are among growing numbers of veterans who are
returning to Vietnam to forge ties in a place where they once
fought in battle. Several executives at Vietnam offices of U.S.
corporations served in the war; so did many of the U.S.
consultants, entrepreneurs and even diplomats who are now active
here. Pete Peterson, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, is a former
Navy pilot who was shot down by the North Vietnamese and imprisoned
for more than six years; Charles Ray, the newly appointed consul
general in Ho Chi Minh City, served tours in Saigon and Da Nang as
an Army staff officer.
</P>
<P>
   Most veterans here, like thousands of other Americans who have
arrived since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in 1994,
are hoping to make money in this awakening land. With 75 million
people, a plentiful supply of cheap labor and one of the few
economies in Southeast Asia that is still growing, Vietnam is a
tempting target for sharp-eyed business people.
</P>
<P>
   But for veterans, there are motives beyond the monetary one.
Whether they feel at peace with their experience here or are still
nursing scars, the war has left a lasting imprint on them. Because
they were witnesses to the anguish borne by the Vietnamese, most
believe they can play a part in healing the wounds between the
United States and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real feeling of happiness on both sides that former
enemies can work together in a positive way,'' Ray said. ``The best
people to bridge the past and the future are the people who were
here in the past. That will make it easier for Americans in the
future to get on with business.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the veterans are dogged in their determination to
succeed in a country where many foreign investors have failed. Like
most new arrivals, Champi and his partners have found doing
business here nearly as difficult as fighting a war, complicated by
capricious regulation, endless red tape and the hostility of
Communist bureaucrats to free-market principles.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles are so great that some U.S. companies, like
Chrysler, have pulled out of Vietnam, while others, like Procter &AMP;
Gamble, have fallen into vicious squabbles with their
state-controlled partners. Asia's financial crisis has compounded
the problem by forcing the main investing nations, like Singapore,
Taiwan and Japan, to scale back their ambitions in the country. New
foreign investment in Vietnam plunged to $1.15 billion in the first
six months of 1998, 15 percent less than in the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Champi believes that his housing project will be one of the rare
successes because it meets a crying need. With a population that
has swelled to 5.5 million, Ho Chi Minh City is seriously
overcrowded. Families of 10 cram into tiny apartments; people sleep
on the sidewalks on bamboo mats. In 1994, the government announced
a plan to address the overcrowding by moving 2 million people from
the city center to outlying districts. But to do that, it must
supply them with affordable places to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to build luxury hotels or take advantage of the
labor force,'' Champi said. ``We're here to build something there's
a great need for. It's not something that we have to sell them
on.''

STARR REPORT SPELLS OUT DETAILS OF AFFAIR, ALLEGED COVERUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY AND MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton repeatedly lied under oath, urged others to
commit perjury, and deliberately tried to obstruct prosecutors as
they worked to uncover his affair with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, independent counsel Kenneth Starr's dramatic 445-page
report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   In a sordid and sometimes shockingly steamy account, Starr
details 10 White House sexual encounters and more than a dozen
episodes of phone sex as he seeks to provide grounds for 11
potentially impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr's first formal report to Congress since he began
the Whitewater probe more than four years ago. Notably absent is
any mention of Whitewater or his later investigations into the
suicide of a White House staffer and the firings of the White House
travel office staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has pursued a strategy of deceiving the American
people and Congress since January 1998, delaying and impeding the
investigation for seven months and deceiving the American people
and Congress in August 1998,'' the report released to Congress on
Friday says.
</P>
<P>
   Starr accused Clinton of:
</P>
<P>
   _Lying under oath during the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _Lying under oath to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to influence the testimony of potential grand jury
witnesses, including Lewinsky and Oval Office secretary Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to obstruct justice by having Lewinsky return gifts he
had given her, even after they had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent
with his Constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws,''
Starr's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Starr report reached the public eye, the White House
tried to limit damage by issuing a 73-page rebuttal saying that
Starr's report was a weak attempt to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This private mistake (the Lewinsky affair) does not amount to
an impeachable action,'' the White House rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also said there is a ``complete lack of any
credible evidence'' to initiate an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for Starr's conclusions come from an exhaustive
recitation of the president's liaisons with the then-22-year-old
Lewinsky. The report luridly describes sexual encounters and
secretive pillow talk in the corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   It reprints Lewinsky's accounts of how she had oral sex with
Clinton as he spoke with a member of Congress and of how he used a
cigar as a sexual prop during one of their encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The report for the first time reveals that an FBI analysis
conclusively proved that it was Clinton's semen found on Lewinsky's
now-famous Navy blue dress. A sample of Clinton's blood was used to
provide a DNA match. The report says there is a one in 7.87
trillion chance among Caucasians that the semen is not Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report provides no insight into other White House
investigations conducted by Starr during the last four years. It
focuses exclusively on the eight-month investigation of the
Lewinsky scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Starr initially probed Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater
financial scandal in Arkansas. He later had it expanded to include
the death of former White House counsel Vincent Foster, the firing
of White House travel staff in what became known as ``Travelgate,''
and the transfer of FBI files on GOP activists to the White House
in a scandal called ``Filegate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it was Clinton's on-again, off-again relationship with a
starry-eyed intern _ and his subsequent efforts to conceal it _
that piqued the prosecutorial interest. It also could prove most
damaging to Clinton, because assertions that he lied under oath and
tried to obstruct justice could form the basis of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The report also tells a story of a young intern who became
emotionally attached to Clinton. She even hoped that she might one
day replace Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to fall in love with the President. I was
surprised that I did,'' Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Lewinsky told a friend that Clinton
``once confided . . . that he was uncertain he would remain married
after he left the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing private moments in the White House, Lewinsky said
there was ``a lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes. He always
used to push the hair out of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Lewinsy called Clinton ``Handsome,''
while the president occasionally called her ``Sweetie,'' ``Baby,''
or sometimes ``Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said Clinton told her she made him feel young, and said
the two were ``emotive and full of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors also portrayed a darker side of the
relationship, saying Clinton and Lewinsky had reached a ``mutual
understanding'' that they would lie under oath about their
relationship in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it said Clinton tried to obstruct justice by suggesting
Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid having to give a deposition.
That way, ``she would not contradict his testimony and he could
attempt to avoid questions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky, Clinton sometimes asked whether she had
revealed their sexual relationship to anyone or told anyone about
the gifts they had exchanged. Lewinsky falsely assured the
president, ``I would always deny it, I would always protect him.``
</P>
<P>
   The report said the affair began in late 1995 and continued on
and off until May 1997. According to Lewinsky, the sexual
encounters occurred in or near a private study off the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   One of those encounters occurred on Easter 1996, several days
after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that over the months, Lewinsky had oral sex with
Clinton nine times, and that Clinton fondled and kissed her
intimately. It also said the two engaged in phone sex 10 to 15
times.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they included highly detailed accounts because
they wanted to prove Clinton lied before the grand jury when he
insisted he gave ``legally accurate'' testimony in the Paula Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Lewinsky made eye contact with Clinton in the
months after she began her White House job as an intern in the
chief of staff's office in July 1995. The two first kissed during
the November 1995 government shutdown, when Clinton invited
Lewinsky to his private office. He asked her permission to kiss
her, and she said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, the two had their first sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   After ending their intimate relationship between June and
October 1997, the report said, Clinton remained in contact with
Lewinsky in an effort to keep her from turning on him in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its rebuttal, said Clinton remained in
contact with Lewinsky not to influence her testimony in the Jones
case but out of ``feelings both of friendship and responsibility''
to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's case for impeachment rests on his conclusions that
Clinton did, in fact, lie _ and cajoled Lewinsky and others to do
the same _ to keep the world from learning of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows that these acts, and others, were part of a
pattern that began as an effort to prevent the disclosure of
information about the President's relationship with a former White
House intern . . . and continued as an effort to prevent the
information from being disclosed in an ongoing criminal
investigation,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was the Jones case. Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee, alleged that Clinton sought oral sex from her in an
Arkansas hotel room when he was Arkansas governor. In 1997, Jones'
attorneys sought information on trysts in which Clinton had been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Clinton declared under oath in the Jones case
that there were no state or federal employees with whom he had had
recently had sexual relations. In January 1998, he again denied
under oath any ``sexual affair,'' ``sexual relationship'' or
``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky. He said he had no ``specific
memory'' of having been alone with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr says Clinton lied under oath, citing Lewinsky's
grand-jury testimony earlier this year about their sexual
encounters. The facts, Starr says, were corroborated by 10 people _
friends, family members and counselors _ in whom Lewinsky had
confided.
</P>
<P>
   Starr further accuses Clinton of lying to the federal grand jury
last month. While Clinton admitted ``inappropriately intimate''
relations in that testimony, he denied that he had perjured himself
in the Jones case because he considered sexual relations as having
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   But the Starr report concludes that Clinton knew oral sex should
have been disclosed. It also holds him accountable for saying he
never touched Lewinsky's breasts or genitals during the trysts. In
fact, Lewinsky offered ``detailed and specific'' testimony to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Currie, Clinton's loyal secretary, plays an
important role as well. Currie, a half-dozen Secret Service agents
and a White House steward testified that Clinton had spent time
alone with Lewinsky, contradicting a civil deposition in which
Clinton swore he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that he lied is bolstered by noting Clinton's
inability to recall in the same deposition that he and Lewinsky had
exchanged gifts. In fact, three weeks before the deposition he sent
Lewinsky a trove of goodies collected during presidential trips.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Starr said, Clinton gave Lewinsky 38 gifts. She
responded in kind with neckties and books, including a novel about
telephone sex.
</P>
<P>
   Another charge of lying under oath was levelled by Starr in
connection with Clinton's claims that he never talked to Lewinsky
about the Jones case or the possibility of their affair being
dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony indicated that they did, in fact, discuss
the case three times in late 1997 and early 1998. She told
prosecutors that Clinton offered ideas for how she could explain
away their relationship if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Lewinsky was subpoenaed in the Jones case, as was
Clinton. Starr accuses Clinton of trying to obstruct justice by:
</P>
<P>
   _Seeking to conceal the gifts he had given Lewinsky by having
Currie retrieve them several days after Christmas 1997. Currie kept
them in a box under her bed. Currie left it unclear whether Clinton
asked her to retrieve the gifts. Starr concludes that Clinton did,
but Clinton denies it.
</P>
<P>
   _Concealing a note Lewinsky sent to him along with a gift book
on Jan. 4, 1998. The note came after Clinton had been subpoenaed
for correspondence between them. ``In the note, Ms. Lewinsky told
the President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him,
at least once,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Once Lewinsky was subpoenaed, she submitted an affidavit denying
the affair in January 1998. According to Starr, Clinton hoped an
affidavit would forestall her personal testimony and would make it
easier for each of them to tell the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Starr that Clinton also discussed ``cover
stories'' they could use to explain away their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential confidant Vernon Jordon corroborated Lewinsky's
account that Clinton knew about the affidavit. Clinton denies
having asked Lewinsky to lie, although he acknowledged last month
to a grand jury that he hoped the affidavit would keep Lewinsky
from testifying in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   As his affair became grist for the legal mill, Clinton and
Jordan worked to land Lewinsky a job _ first with the United
Nations, which she turned down, and later with a private New York
firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr, Lewinsky was unhappy with a transfer to the
Pentagon and wanted to go back to the White House or into the
private sector. First, Clinton asked his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, to find her a job. When that didn't work, the UN post was
offered, but Lewinsky demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a bad first interview, Lewinsky got a second
chance _ and a job offer _ from the New York firm of MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes after Jordan interceded on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   When the job offer came through, Jordan testified, Lewinsky
called him and he called Clinton ``with the news: Mission
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr concedes there is no proof that Clinton intended to
obstruct justice by finding Lewinsky a job, he infers such an
intent from the circumstances: Clinton was trying to keep Lewinsky
from revealing details of their affair, and he took an active
interest in her job search.
</P>
<P>
   Other charges by Starr accuse Clinton of:
</P>
<P>
   _Lying in depositions about his conversations with Jordan about
Lewinsky, and trying to direct Currie's testimony on the subject
once it became clear his staff was being prodded for answers.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Clinton's January 1998 deposition regarding
the Lewinsky affair, Currie testified, Clinton called her at home
and asked her to work the following day, a Sunday. It was an
unusual request.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Currie told the grand jury, she met Clinton at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had had his deposition yesterday, and they had
asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky. And I was a little
shocked by that or _ (shrugging). And he said _ I don't know if he
said _ I think he may have said, `There are several things you may
want to know,'' or ``there are things - '' He asked me some
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions and statements included, ``You were always there
when she was there, right? We were never really alone.'' Or, ``You
could see and hear everything.'' And, ``Monica came on to me, and I
never touched her, right?'' ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie felt his comments were ``more like statements than
questions.'' Starr's report says Currie concluded that ``the
President wanted her to agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   _Obstructing justice by lying about the affair to staffers who
passed along the inaccuracies during testimony in the case, and
failing to faithfully execute the nation's laws by trying to
conceal the truth about his affair from lawyers in the Jones case
and from a federal grand jury. &QL;

 HO CHI MINH CITY: them on.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, after two years of tortuous negotiations, Point
Enterprises could still see its efforts come to nothing. The
company has an agreement in principle for the municipal government
to buy $321 million of apartments over 11 years. The partners stand
to make a profit of $39 million, but first they need financing to
build a factory that would churn out the pre-cast concrete slabs
for the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   To get the financing, they will need a guarantee from the
municipal government _ and perhaps the national one, too _ that the
city will honor the contract terms. On Aug. 18, Champi and Sheafer
received a verbal commitment for such a guarantee from city
officials. They are now nervously awaiting the written document.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're unable to finance this deal, it's going to bring the
sharks out,'' said Carhart, a gregarious man whose free-flowing
pessimism neatly balances Champi's reserved confidence. ``This is a
crap shoot. It's a high-risk venture thousands of miles from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   But the partners have not wavered, despite having invested
$250,000 so far with no assurance of a return. They have maintained
their resolve by drawing on a lifetime of close friendships and a
shared experience that makes Vietnam a passion as well as a
project.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Carhart and Champi, the partners are John Morris,
a retired Army lieutenant general and chief of engineers of the
Army Corps of Engineers; Vincent Casillo, a New York City
contractor; and James Fabiani, a senior executive at a Washington
lobbying firm. With the exception of Fabiani, all are West Point
graduates, Vietnam veterans or both.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was Champi's regimental captain at West Point and later a
group commander of the Corps of Engineers in Vietnam, where he
again supervised Champi. At 77, with service in World War II, Korea
and Vietnam behind him, Morris is a sort of guiding light for the
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt the Vietnamese deserved a better shake than
they got,'' he said. ``They were caught in the middle of historical
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Casillo played middle linebacker on the West Point football team
in the same years that Champi, who is 6 feet 5 inches tall, played
tight end. They graduated together in 1966, and even though they
did not serve together afterward _ Casillo was assigned to duty in
Europe _ they stayed in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who go to West Point are conditioned to be particularly
close,'' Casillo said. ``When you are with a group of people who
came from the same system, there's a camaraderie that never ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the West Point contingent had already teamed up to
explore projects overseas, it was a Naval Academy graduate,
Sheafer, who put them on the road to Vietnam. A bluff,
barrel-chested man who had risen to rear admiral and director of
naval intelligence, he had been struggling to build a consulting
practice in Vietnam since he retired from the Navy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Like Champi, Sheafer is not one to dwell on the war. But as a
career military officer, he felt its lingering effect. He served
several tours of duty in Vietnam between 1963 and 1970, at one time
commanding a minesweeper that prowled the coastal waters near the
border between South and North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In one memorable incident, he said, he watched helplessly as two
fishing boats smuggled ammunition across the border from the south.
He tried to block the boats, but the Navy's rules of engagement
barred him from firing on them unless they fired first. He ordered
an air strike, but the bombers arrived after the boats had landed
in the north and emptied their cargo.
</P>
<P>
   For years afterward, Sheafer labored in a military that had been
demoralized by its failure in Vietnam. He said he did not come to
terms with the war until 1984, when he paid a midnight visit to the
rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. The body of an unknown soldier from
Vietnam, who has since been identified as an Air Force pilot,
Michael Blassie, was lying in state there before its entombment at
Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing there in my dress uniform, and suddenly I began
crying, not because of my own hostility, but because of the
futility of the whole thing,'' Sheafer recalled. ``There was no
good legacy for these people. What did they die for?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he retired, the U.S. military had rehabilitated its
reputation with the Persian Gulf War. But to him, Vietnam was still
unfinished business. So when a lawyer he knew approached him about
starting a home security company in Vietnam, he jumped at the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sheafer plotted his return methodically. He recruited his own
interpreter. He played up his admiral's rank and connections to
senior American officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the going was slow. He had trouble making contacts with the
right Vietnamese officials. The lawyer who promised to open doors
for him failed to deliver. He spent long days in an office set up
in the lounge at the upscale but somewhat dreary New World Hotel
here, waiting for the phone to ring.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in late July 1996, he won a meeting with Vo Viet Thanh,
the chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City. As it
happened, Thanh had been a general in the North Vietnamese army and
had supervised intelligence operations. Sheafer and Thanh chatted
about the shadowy world of military intelligence, and a rapport was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Thanh told Sheafer that the city's biggest need was for cheap
housing that could be built quickly. He said he had an immediate
need for about 200,000 apartments, with a long-term goal of
500,000. Sheafer replied that he would find an American contractor
who could do the job. Through Carhart, who is his neighbor in
McLean, Va., Sheafer stumbled onto Champi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first, Champi was fearful about going back to Vietnam. But he
made a happy discovery upon his arrival: Younger Vietnamese did not
care about his background, while older people, many of whom had
fought in the North Vietnamese Army or with the Vietcong, felt a
sort of kinship with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all military people have a bond, regardless of what
side they were on,'' Champi said. ``We were all doing our jobs for
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, Champi and Sheafer made a dozen trips
to Ho Chi Minh City. Their goal was to persuade the municipal
government to agree to buy as many apartments from them as
possible. Eventually, they hammered out a deal for 40,000 units at
an average price of $8,025 each.
</P>
<P>
   The apartments, 320 to 860 square feet in size, will be stacked
in four-story blocks, using prefabrication technology developed by
a Finnish company, Partek Concrete Engineering. In that process, a
factory produces standardized panels of pre-cast concrete, which
are then assembled quickly into buildings, eliminating the need for
structural steel girders, beams or columns.

 HO CHI MINH CITY: or columns.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the Lego-block construction method, Champi said the
finished buildings could last 100 years. To sell the design, he
flew a team of Vietnamese architects to Singapore to inspect
apartments built with the same technology.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiatons would follow a serpentine path, with
breakthroughs in one session often being erased in the next.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, for example, the government pushed foreign investors
to establish joint ventures. So Point Enterprises took on a
Vietnamese company as a minority partner. But last February, the
Vietnamese partner _ a company that collects bills for the city
government _ petitioned to change the terms of the joint venture in
a way that would have relegated the Americans to mere
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   The move stunned Champi and his partners, who had put up all the
seed money for the project. Fortunately for them, it came just as a
ground swell of anger and frustration with joint ventures was
developing among prominent foreign investors, including Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai agreed to
allow foreigners to own 100 percent of business ventures in any
industry not deemed strategically important, like oil and gas or
communications. Point Enterprises received permission to sever ties
with its Vietnamese partner and go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carhart said, ``there are other impediments to doing
business in Vietnam.'' Progress is often slow, and ``individuals
that approve projects have to answer to higher-ups, so no decision
is ever final,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony in Ho Chi Minh City where Champi received his
investment license, the deputy chairman of the People's Committee,
Tran Thanh Hai, tried to sound definitive. ``We are committed to
extend our support for the continuation of the project,'' he said
as he gingerly raised a glass of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who had come from Hanoi to attend the ceremony, struck
a more cautionary note in a speech. ``Issuing licenses is the
easiest part of the job,'' he said, ``Implementation is the key
word.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception after the ceremony, several Americans who live in
Ho Chi Minh City handicapped the project's future with weary
cynicism. They predicted that the partners would suffer more
setbacks before they broke ground. ``They're about 5 percent of the
way there,'' said Peter N. Sheridan, a Vietnam veteran who, like
Sheafer, helps put together ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials know all too well that their country has a
bad reputation among foreign investors. But they say the government
is working to clear the bureaucratic underbrush. One official noted
that when Vietnam decided to open its economy in 1986, the
government expected to have a decade or more in which to move from
central planning to a market economy. But foreign investment began
flooding into Vietnam by 1991 _ and with it came calls for
accelerated change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, things are not as smooth as we would wish,'' said
Nguyen Dinh Mai, the vice director of Ho Chi Minh City's department
of planning and investment. ``But they have improved a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, given the time and money they have invested, the partners
of Point Enterprises seem almost fatalistic about the outcome.
Champi said he would treasure his trips to Vietnam even if he never
got to put up an apartment block. ``That may sound naive and
unbusinesslike, but it's true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Carhart, the mere act of returning to Vietnam was its own
reward. As an infantry platoon leader, Carhart saw fierce fighting
in the war, and was shot twice in 1968. Then he was recruited into
Operation Phoenix, a controversial program supported by the CIA
that sought to root out Vietcong agents working in South Vietnam,
sometimes by killing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have terribly mixed feelings about Vietnam,'' Carhart said.
``On the one hand, I did my duty. On the other hand, I've grieved
deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, on one of his business trips to Vietnam, Carhart
took a day off and visited the small town south of Ho Chi Minh City
where he was based during his tour with Operation Phoenix. The
house where he had planned his missions, he said, had been
converted into a convent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back to that town put wings on my heart,'' he said.
``You can't go home again, but you can sure close the circle.''

CHARTER SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO GAIN IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Minn.)  
(nk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Nine months ago, Beth Mackin, a teacher at
the new Gateway Charter School, did not know whether there would be
a school to come back to after the Christmas break. The principal
had just resigned. The only other teacher had been fired a month
before. The school's part-time nurse and a computer consultant had
decided to quit, too.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Ms. Mackin stood in her classroom at Gateway and
greeted 15 sixth-graders, all dressed in green sweaters and khaki
pants or skirts, and welcomed them to a new school year. The school
not only survived but is also in expanded quarters in downtown
Jersey City and has grown to 60 sixth- and seventh-graders from
last year's 24.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway was one of 13 charter schools that opened in New Jersey
last year after Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill allowing the
creation of these new independent but publicly funded schools.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, the charter school experience in New Jersey
has been a success, with parents showing by their applications that
they want more alternatives to the traditional public schools. This
month, 31 charter schools will open for the new school year, with
5,000 students, and eight more have been approved for next year.
Most of the charter schools already in operation have long waiting
lists and have to choose students by lottery. Last month, the state
Department of Education received applications for 35 more new
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt it important to provide parents with a
choice of where their children attend school,'' said Whitman, a
major proponent of the charter school movement.
</P>
<P>
   In their first year, all 13 of the schools went through growing
pains, but the problems were most severe at Gateway and the Second
Chance High School here. Second Chance was put on probation after
parents complained that their children were not getting a proper
education and that report cards were not being sent out. But unlike
Gateway, Second Chance did not reopen this month.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, advocates of charter schools say that over all, the New
Jersey program has been a success that points to a huge demand for
public school alternatives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charter school movement is continuing to grow and
expand,'' said Sarah Tantillo of the New Jersey Charter School
Resource Center, a nonprofit group that helps charter schools get
started. ``This is especially true in urban areas, where the needs
of students and parents are apparently not being well met.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first charter school opened in Minnesota six years
ago, interest in starting charter schools has mushroomed. This
fall, 505 new charter schools are to open around the country to add
to the 784 in operation last year, according to the Center for
Education Reform, a Washington advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of years, superintendents and school boards
were complaining about them,'' said Jeanne Allen, president of the
Center for Education Reform. ``But now, they've seen them transform
children. Now some of the traditional schools are mirroring what
the charter schools are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, five new schools opened this month, bringing the
total number of charter schools to 17. New York does not have a
charter school law, although interest in adopting one has been
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Parents like the idea of charter schools _ publicly funded
schools approved by the state Department of Education that are not
directly tied to the local school bureaucracy. While they must meet
state curriculum guidelines, charter schools generally employ more
innovative and nontraditional teaching methods. And when parents
talk about why they chose a charter school, most mention class size
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 34 kids in my daughter's old school,'' said Angela
Carone, whose daughter, Jennifer, 13, is a new student at Gateway,
where class size will be about 15 students to a teacher. ``When she
would ask the teacher for help, she didn't get it. My daughter
figured, if they don't care, I don't care. I had to bring her
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has been enthusiastic about charter schools
coming to New Jersey. While they do not quarrel with the
educational concepts, superintendents in the local districts have
complained about losing 90 percent of state education funds for
every child who leaves their schools to attend a charter school in
their district.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're creating financial problems for the districts,'' said
Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards
Association. ``You can't reduce the staff of a public school if
five children decide to go to a charter school, but you lose that
money. There are fixed costs of maintaining the same number of
buildings.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mackin left a career in publishing to teach at Gateway last
year. She was excited about working with a small staff _ only one
other teacher and a coordinator who acts as the principal _ and
about the freedom such a small setting would bring. But she never
expected the bumpy road the new school would go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very rough for everyone at the beginning,'' Ms. Mackin
said. ``The kids just did not want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the first semester things began to turn around, thanks
largely, parents say, to Jacqui Sinclair Lewis, a former teacher
who took over as coordinator in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school, from January through June, was so totally
different than it was from September until December,'' said Donald
Yates, a former superintendent in Bergen County who now teaches at
the University of Jersey City and works as a curriculum consultant
for Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of classes, Mrs. Lewis sat students and parents
down for an orientation session that lasted more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would not tolerate students wearing their shirts
untucked. In the middle of the meeting, she made a boy, Angel, get
up, go to the bathroom and not return until his shirt was properly
tucked in. Angel left, shaking his head sheepishly, and did what he
was told.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gateway students are from racial minorities. Some come from
poor families, and some have well-educated parents. But as with
most charter schools, most students come from families whose
parents are very involved in their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think charter schools are a good idea and they are here to
stay,'' said Rita Johnson, whose daughter Ashley, 10, attended a
Catholic school last year before her parents learned about Gateway.
``It's a great idea for parents who are really dedicated to their
children and don't have the means to pay for private school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Cruz, a 26-year-old single mother of two boys, said that
she quit law school last year after one son, Michael, began having
trouble concentrating in public school, where his class had 30
students.
</P>

STARR REPORT SPELLS OUT DETAILS OF AFFAIR, ALLEGED COVERUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY AND MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton repeatedly lied under oath, urged others to
commit perjury, and deliberately tried to obstruct prosecutors as
they worked to uncover his affair with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, independent counsel Kenneth Starr's dramatic 445-page
report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   In a sordid and sometimes shockingly steamy account, Starr
details 10 White House sexual encounters and more than a dozen
episodes of phone sex as he seeks to provide grounds for 11
potentially impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr's first formal report to Congress since he began
the Whitewater probe more than four years ago. Notably absent is
any mention of Whitewater or his later investigations into the
suicide of a White House staffer and the firings of the White House
travel office staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has pursued a strategy of deceiving the American
people and Congress since January 1998, delaying and impeding the
investigation for seven months and deceiving the American people
and Congress in August 1998,'' the report released to Congress on
Friday says.
</P>
<P>
   Starr accused Clinton of:
</P>
<P>
   _Lying under oath during the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _Lying under oath to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to influence the testimony of potential grand jury
witnesses, including Lewinsky and Oval Office secretary Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   _Trying to obstruct justice by having Lewinsky return gifts he
had given her, even after they had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent
with his Constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws,''
Starr's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Starr report reached the public eye, the White House
tried to limit damage by issuing a 73-page rebuttal saying that
Starr's report was a weak attempt to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This private mistake (the Lewinsky affair) does not amount to
an impeachable action,'' the White House rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also said there is a ``complete lack of any
credible evidence'' to initiate an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for Starr's conclusions come from an exhaustive
recitation of the president's liaisons with the then-22-year-old
Lewinsky. The report luridly describes sexual encounters and
secretive pillow talk in the corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   It reprints Lewinsky's accounts of how she had oral sex with
Clinton as he spoke with a member of Congress and of how he used a
cigar as a sexual prop during one of their encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The report for the first time reveals that an FBI analysis
conclusively proved that it was Clinton's semen found on Lewinsky's
now-famous Navy blue dress. A sample of Clinton's blood was used to
provide a DNA match. The report says there is a one in 7.87
trillion chance among Caucasians that the semen is not Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report provides no insight into other White House
investigations conducted by Starr during the last four years. It
focuses exclusively on the eight-month investigation of the
Lewinsky scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Starr initially probed Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater
financial scandal in Arkansas. He later had it expanded to include
the death of former White House counsel Vincent Foster, the firing
of White House travel staff in what became known as ``Travelgate,''
and the transfer of FBI files on GOP activists to the White House
in a scandal called ``Filegate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it was Clinton's on-again, off-again relationship with a
starry-eyed intern _ and his subsequent efforts to conceal it _
that piqued the prosecutorial interest. It also could prove most
damaging to Clinton, because assertions that he lied under oath and
tried to obstruct justice could form the basis of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The report also tells a story of a young intern who became
emotionally attached to Clinton. She even hoped that she might one
day replace Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to fall in love with the President. I was
surprised that I did,'' Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Lewinsky told a friend that Clinton
``once confided . . . that he was uncertain he would remain married
after he left the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing private moments in the White House, Lewinsky said
there was ``a lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes. He always
used to push the hair out of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Lewinsy called Clinton ``Handsome,''
while the president occasionally called her ``Sweetie,'' ``Baby,''
or sometimes ``Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said Clinton told her she made him feel young, and said
the two were ``emotive and full of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors also portrayed a darker side of the
relationship, saying Clinton and Lewinsky had reached a ``mutual
understanding'' that they would lie under oath about their
relationship in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it said Clinton tried to obstruct justice by suggesting
Lewinsky file an affidavit to avoid having to give a deposition.
That way, ``she would not contradict his testimony and he could
attempt to avoid questions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky, Clinton sometimes asked whether she had
revealed their sexual relationship to anyone or told anyone about
the gifts they had exchanged. Lewinsky falsely assured the
president, ``I would always deny it, I would always protect him.``
</P>
<P>
   The report said the affair began in late 1995 and continued on
and off until May 1997. According to Lewinsky, the sexual
encounters occurred in or near a private study off the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   One of those encounters occurred on Easter 1996, several days
after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was killed in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that over the months, Lewinsky had oral sex with
Clinton nine times, and that Clinton fondled and kissed her
intimately. It also said the two engaged in phone sex 10 to 15
times.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they included highly detailed accounts because
they wanted to prove Clinton lied before the grand jury when he
insisted he gave ``legally accurate'' testimony in the Paula Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Lewinsky made eye contact with Clinton in the
months after she began her White House job as an intern in the
chief of staff's office in July 1995. The two first kissed during
the November 1995 government shutdown, when Clinton invited
Lewinsky to his private office. He asked her permission to kiss
her, and she said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, the two had their first sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   After ending their intimate relationship between June and
October 1997, the report said, Clinton remained in contact with
Lewinsky in an effort to keep her from turning on him in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in its rebuttal, said Clinton remained in
contact with Lewinsky not to influence her testimony in the Jones
case but out of ``feelings both of friendship and responsibility''
to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's case for impeachment rests on his conclusions that
Clinton did, in fact, lie _ and cajoled Lewinsky and others to do
the same _ to keep the world from learning of their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence shows that these acts, and others, were part of a
pattern that began as an effort to prevent the disclosure of
information about the President's relationship with a former White
House intern . . . and continued as an effort to prevent the
information from being disclosed in an ongoing criminal
investigation,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was the Jones case. Jones, a former Arkansas state
employee, alleged that Clinton sought oral sex from her in an
Arkansas hotel room when he was Arkansas governor. In 1997, Jones'
attorneys sought information on trysts in which Clinton had been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Clinton declared under oath in the Jones case
that there were no state or federal employees with whom he had had
recently had sexual relations. In January 1998, he again denied
under oath any ``sexual affair,'' ``sexual relationship'' or
``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky. He said he had no ``specific
memory'' of having been alone with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr says Clinton lied under oath, citing Lewinsky's
grand-jury testimony earlier this year about their sexual
encounters. The facts, Starr says, were corroborated by 10 people _
friends, family members and counselors _ in whom Lewinsky had
confided.
</P>
<P>
   Starr further accuses Clinton of lying to the federal grand jury
last month. While Clinton admitted ``inappropriately intimate''
relations in that testimony, he denied that he had perjured himself
in the Jones case because he considered sexual relations as having
intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   But the Starr report concludes that Clinton knew oral sex should
have been disclosed. It also holds him accountable for saying he
never touched Lewinsky's breasts or genitals during the trysts. In
fact, Lewinsky offered ``detailed and specific'' testimony to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Currie, Clinton's loyal secretary, plays an
important role as well. Currie, a half-dozen Secret Service agents
and a White House steward testified that Clinton had spent time
alone with Lewinsky, contradicting a civil deposition in which
Clinton swore he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that he lied is bolstered by noting Clinton's
inability to recall in the same deposition that he and Lewinsky had
exchanged gifts. In fact, three weeks before the deposition he sent
Lewinsky a trove of goodies collected during presidential trips.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Starr said, Clinton gave Lewinsky 38 gifts. She
responded in kind with neckties and books, including a novel about
telephone sex.
</P>
<P>
   Another charge of lying under oath was levelled by Starr in
connection with Clinton's claims that he never talked to Lewinsky
about the Jones case or the possibility of their affair being
dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony indicated that they did, in fact, discuss
the case three times in late 1997 and early 1998. She told
prosecutors that Clinton offered ideas for how she could explain
away their relationship if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Lewinsky was subpoenaed in the Jones case, as was
Clinton. Starr accuses Clinton of trying to obstruct justice by:
</P>
<P>
   _Seeking to conceal the gifts he had given Lewinsky by having
Currie retrieve them several days after Christmas 1997. Currie kept
them in a box under her bed. Currie left it unclear whether Clinton
asked her to retrieve the gifts. Starr concludes that Clinton did,
but Clinton denies it.
</P>
<P>
   _Concealing a note Lewinsky sent to him along with a gift book
on Jan. 4, 1998. The note came after Clinton had been subpoenaed
for correspondence between them. ``In the note, Ms. Lewinsky told
the President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him,
at least once,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Once Lewinsky was subpoenaed, she submitted an affidavit denying
the affair in January 1998. According to Starr, Clinton hoped an
affidavit would forestall her personal testimony and would make it
easier for each of them to tell the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told Starr that Clinton also discussed ``cover
stories'' they could use to explain away their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential confidant Vernon Jordon corroborated Lewinsky's
account that Clinton knew about the affidavit. Clinton denies
having asked Lewinsky to lie, although he acknowledged last month
to a grand jury that he hoped the affidavit would keep Lewinsky
from testifying in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   As his affair became grist for the legal mill, Clinton and
Jordan worked to land Lewinsky a job _ first with the United
Nations, which she turned down, and later with a private New York
firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr, Lewinsky was unhappy with a transfer to the
Pentagon and wanted to go back to the White House or into the
private sector. First, Clinton asked his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, to find her a job. When that didn't work, the UN post was
offered, but Lewinsky demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a bad first interview, Lewinsky got a second
chance _ and a job offer _ from the New York firm of MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes after Jordan interceded on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   When the job offer came through, Jordan testified, Lewinsky
called him and he called Clinton ``with the news: Mission
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr concedes there is no proof that Clinton intended to
obstruct justice by finding Lewinsky a job, he infers such an
intent from the circumstances: Clinton was trying to keep Lewinsky
from revealing details of their affair, and he took an active
interest in her job search.
</P>
<P>
   Other charges by Starr accuse Clinton of:
</P>
<P>
   _Lying in depositions about his conversations with Jordan about
Lewinsky, and trying to direct Currie's testimony on the subject
once it became clear his staff was being prodded for answers.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Clinton's January 1998 deposition regarding
the Lewinsky affair, Currie testified, Clinton called her at home
and asked her to work the following day, a Sunday. It was an
unusual request.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Currie told the grand jury, she met Clinton at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he had had his deposition yesterday, and they had
asked several questions about Monica Lewinsky. And I was a little
shocked by that or _ (shrugging). And he said _ I don't know if he
said _ I think he may have said, `There are several things you may
want to know,'' or ``there are things - '' He asked me some
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions and statements included, ``You were always there
when she was there, right? We were never really alone.'' Or, ``You
could see and hear everything.'' And, ``Monica came on to me, and I
never touched her, right?'' ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie felt his comments were ``more like statements than
questions.'' Starr's report says Currie concluded that ``the
President wanted her to agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   _Obstructing justice by lying about the affair to staffers who
passed along the inaccuracies during testimony in the case, and
failing to faithfully execute the nation's laws by trying to
conceal the truth about his affair from lawyers in the Jones case
and from a federal grand jury. &QL;

CLINTON LAWYERS ATTACK STARR REPORT EVEN BEFORE IT REACHES
CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY AND PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's sizzling
report landed on Capitol Hill, President Clinton's lawyers were
attacking it as ``flimsy and unsubstantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 73-page rebuttal that hit the Internet early Friday,
Clinton's lawyers said the chief purpose of Starr's report ``is to
embarrass the President and titillate the public by producing a
document that is little more than an unreliable, one-sided account
of sexual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   And, they concluded, ``there is a complete lack of any credible
evidence to initiate an impeachment inquiry concerning the
President.'
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal's release just an hour before Starr's report was
unsealed was part of a White House strategy to cushion the impact
of lurid accounts of Clinton's sexual encounters and to challenge
Starr's findings of potentially impeachable offenses. A request to
Starr to allow the White House an advance copy of the report and
time to respond to it was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of gratuitous allegations about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, no matter how graphic, can alter the fact that
the president did not commit perjury, he did not obstruct justice,
he did not tamper with witnesses, and he did not abuse the power of
his office,'' David Kendall, the president's private lawyer, told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lurid allegations in the prosecutor's
referral, but there is no credible evidence of impeachable
offenses,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers paint the president's
relationship with Lewinsky as a private mistake, not a matter grave
enough to paralyze the government and topple the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A relationship outside one's marriage is wrong, and the
president admits that,'' they said. ``It is not a high crime or
misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the Constitution outlines a clear path for
Congress to follow in laying the groundwork for impeachment. It
says Congress shall impeach only for ``treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment clause was designed to protect our country
against a president who was using his official powers against the
nation, against the American people, against our society. It was
never designed to allow a political body to force a president from
office for a very personal mistake,'' Clinton's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers said:
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton never committed perjury in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, his answers were admittedly ambiguous, but he
did not intentionally mislead anyone, the report says. In most
cases, the problem was a difference in the definition of sexual
relations: Clinton did not consider oral sex to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   _There was no obstruction of justice in connection with the
retrieval of gifts from Lewinsky by presidential secretary Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President admitted giving and receiving gifts from Ms.
Lewinsky when he was asked about it. The President never asked Ms.
Lewinsky to get rid of the gifts, and he never asked Ms. Currie to
get them,'' the rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gifts simply were not a concern to him.''
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton never tried to influence Lewinsky's testimony in the
Jones case by offering to help her find a job after she left the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never instructed anyone to hire her, or even indicated that
he very much wanted it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said actions by Currie and lawyer Vernon Jordan,
Clinton's close friend, to help Lewinsky were ``totally
appropriate.'' The actions began ``well before'' Lewinsky was named
a witness in the Jones case, and ``were in no way intended to
influence Ms. Lewinsky to keep secret what was at that time an
already terminated relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton's admission that he misled his family, staff and the
country about the nature of his relationship with Lewinsky does not
constitute a criminal abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this allegation were not so serious, such a suggestion
would be ludicrous,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also asked pointedly, ``Where's Whitewater?,'' a
reference to the investigation that Starr began four years ago into
an Arkansas land deal involving the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report makes little mention of Whitewater, or
Starr's investigations into the FBI files or the White House travel
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began as an inquiry into a 24-year-old land deal in
Arkansas has ended as an inquest into brief, improper personal
encounters between the President and Monica Lewinksy,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House document called the Lewinsky investigation ``the
most recent phase of an amorphous, languorous, expensive, and
seemingly interminable investigation into the affairs of a small
Arkansas real estate firm, Whitewater Development Co. Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers also take a swipe at Starr for using a
federal grand jury's powers to extract testimony that is one-sided
by its nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of a federal grand jury to compile evidence for possible
impeachment proceedings in Congress raises numerous troubling
questions regarding the credibility of that evidence,'' the
rebuttal says. ``Indeed, given the limited role of a grand jury in
our system and the total absence of procedural protections in the
process, the Independent Counsel's insistence that his
investigation has been a search for `truth' is deeply misleading.
In fact, it has been a one-sided effort to present the worst
possible version of a limited set of facts.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers said Starr's report should have included
exculpatory evidence and an examination of witness credibility and
biases. &QL;

TROJANS ABSORB HISTORY LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time Ted Tollner coached in the Coliseum,
most USC players were in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it's nearly impossible to convince those same
players the importance this game holds for the former USC coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking for redemption,'' USC linebacker David Gibson
said. ``I heard he was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard he was fired?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their big game and I hear he's got some bad blood from
when he was here,'' Gibson added.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Tollner's days at USC are barely vague memories for
the current Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Even USC coach Paul Hackett's attempt to give his players a
history lesson had limited success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so long ago,'' Hackett said. ``That's like the stories I
tell them about me the first time I was here. They yawn and listen
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the ``Tollner returns'' angle may not motivate his
players, but here is another thing for USC to worry about when it
plays San Diego State tonight at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Trojans played a Western Athletic Conference
team at night in the Coliseum, they nearly lost.
</P>
<P>
   USC barely squeaked past Nevada-Las Vegas 35-21 last season. The
Trojans actually trailed 21-14 in the fourth quarter, before R. Jay
Soward scored on two long touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of another embarrassing encounter with a
less-than-prestigious opponent remains fresh for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take (San Diego State) lightly? I wouldn't lie and say there's
not a chance but I know I'm not,'' wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
said. ``For the people here last year that played UNLV, they know
sometimes you can take a team lightly without knowing it. I
definitely remember last year. We almost lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Trojans take the Aztecs lightly, Hackett
feels USC has to concentrate on itself anyway, and can't worry too
much about the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think at this point, San Diego State can worry about
us or we can worry about them,'' Hackett said. ``We're so much in a
developmental stage, we have to play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   That means hoping the defense picks up where it left off for the
final three quarters of the Purdue game, and the offense takes
another stab at the two-quarterback rotation of Mike Van Raaphorst
and Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst will start but Hackett said he will probably play
Palmer in the first half. Palmer, a true freshman, loves that idea
but admitted he felt he had a bad week of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had a terrible week,'' he said. ``I was off on a lot
of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkably poised 18-year-old quickly added that none of
this will affect his performance tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen in a game,'' Palmer said. ``My confidence is
still fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The other question marks for the Trojans remain similar to the
Purdue game. USC's offensive line still needs to prove itself,
although it played adequately against Purdue. And the tailback
situation appears in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Morton will start, but a knee injury to Malaefou MacKenzie
has jumbled the depth chart. Petros Papadakis is the No. 2
tailback, but true freshman Frank Strong and junior Jabari Jackson
are expected to make their season debuts.
</P>
<P>
   As for the defense, the line remains shuffled. Shamsud-Din
Abdul-Shaheed will start at defensive end, after Ryan Nielsen
started against Purdue. Lawrence Larry is still considered a
starter, but is nursing a tender ankle and will play a reserve
role.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps USC has to worry about itself, simply because playing
San Diego State isn't likely to stir the Trojans. Certainly not in
comparison to playing Florida State in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a team in our way to where we want to go. We have
to treat them like Arizona State or Washington,'' Bastianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tollner, he's not about to say anything to inspire USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``My memories, I wouldn't trade for anything,'' he said. ``I
have two children that went to USC and married USC grads. The
experience had many more positives than regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A crowd of 50,000 to 55,000 is expected.... Matt McShane
will start in place of Eric Denmon at center, but both will play.
The fullback position is the most interesting, with Hackett saying
Brennan Ochs or Ted Iacenda will start, depending upon the
situation. ``I hope in the next few weeks somebody emerges,''
Hackett said. ``Teddy might be the best runner but Brennan does a
good job of blocking.'' Marvin Powell is also expected to play
fullback.... Linebacker Mark Cusano (ankle) has been upgraded from
out to questionable for the game.... Hackett confirmed that Quincy
Woods is the emergency quarterback, although Woods has not received
any snaps in practice. Woods is likely to receive some snaps next
week.

   LOS ANGELES _ In his first major move to create a revolution in
Los Angeles schools, Mayor Richard Riordan said he and a group of
education and business leaders are handpicking a slate of
candidates to try to capture majority control of the Los Angeles
school board.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said Friday the drastic action is needed to turn around
the troubled Los Angeles Unified School District and empower
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a huge step,'' said Riordan. ``We've done a lot
of thinking in the last year on how to change the way the district
is governed. The LAUSD is a total disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the needed changes Riordan identified: boosting the
superintendent's power to fire bureaucrats, restructure departments
and giving more authority to principals.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and the coalition intend by the end of next month to
choose four candidates for the April 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent board members, whose terms expire in April, are
David Tokofsky, who represents portions of the east San Fernando
Valley and east Los Angeles; George Kiriyama, of the San Pedro
area; Jeff Horton, who represents the Hollywood area; and Barbara
Boudreaux, who represents South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Julie Korenstein, who represents most of the
Valley; Valerie Fields, who represents part of the West Valley; and
Victoria Castro have two more years left in their terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Riordan group, top executives from Sony Pictures, Arco and
officials from the University of California, Los Angeles, are
searching for candidates who will supply strong overall leadership,
but not micromanage the superintendent or the district.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyama said it's within Riordan's rights to use his political
force to support other candidates, but defended his work on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm doing what I should be doing, the district is
focused now and we're starting to turn student achievement
around,'' said Kiriyama, referring to test scores that showed a
slight improvement this year but remained below the national and
state averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever (Zacarias) has asked for, we've never said no. I
don't think that's micromanaging.''
</P>
<P>
   A candidate to oppose Boudreaux has already been selected by the
committee _ Genethia Hudley Hayes, executive director of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights
organization. Hayes could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Mitchell, vice president for education at the Getty Center
and one of 19 coalition members, said it was crucial to have the
best people on the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to all of us that the school board is the highest
calling in public office in L.A.,'' said Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Although Riordan has no constitutional authority over schools,
he has used his office as a bully pulpit to push for reform of the
LAUSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been on the top of my radar screen for a long time
now,'' said Riordan. ``People question why the mayor should be
involved in education. There is nothing more important than the
education of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   A loose group of concerned citizens has for a year considered
what could be done to change the governance of the LAUSD, said
Riordan. They debated and dismissed the possibility of
constitutional change or legislative action that would have put the
mayor in charge of the school district.
</P>
<P>
   The group has discussed the plans with unions, including the
United Teachers Los Angeles, as well as the state Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles. Riordan said the UTLA was
partially receptive to the plan, but they support Tokofsky and
Kiriyama. Villaraigosa, Riordan said, was ``supportive of the
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Day Higuchi, president of UTLA, said he was keeping an open
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the mayor's candidates will be supportive of our
issues,'' said Higuchi. ``We're hopeful it will be candidates like
David and George, who everyone can support.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias was unreachable Friday and LAUSD spokesman Brad Sales
declined to comment on the committee's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tokofsky, a former social studies teacher who has been praised
by Riordan as the ``Winston Churchill of the school district,''
said he hopes the reform candidates espouse family-friendly
policies that make a meaningful difference for LAUSD students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make sure people on this slate have children in
the school district,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution to our public schools is about substantive
curriculum and measurable results. It's not about power that is
symbolic. We've had fights between the teachers union and the
administrators union and that didn't lead to anything good for
children. We've had fights about the status quo and outside
reformers and that hasn't led to test scores above the 50th
percentile.''

THIS TIME, UCLA NOT COUNTING ON A ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They popped in the videotape a few weeks ago, and
perfection reappeared. There was Skip Hicks carving up the Texas
defense for three touchdowns. There was Jim McElroy dashing for two
more. There was Chad Overhauser blocking and Brian Willmer tackling
and the Bruins charging to an unforgettable win on that September
afternoon in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   As the tape rolled, UCLA offensive tackle Kris Farris glanced at
his transfixed linemates _ the younger ones, the ones who didn't
contribute a lick to UCLA's 66-3 victory. What he saw sent shivers
down his massive spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me (from their reaction) that they thought they
were part of what happened,'' Farris said. ``But we (the veterans)
stressed that they didn't block, they didn't score a touchdown,
they didn't make a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything for the win, but they seemed to think
Texas was a pushover. We told them Texas wasn't a pushover. We said
66-3 doesn't just happen, and that they shouldn't expect it to
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   No one does. Publicly and privately, the Bruins say they expect
a close game this afternoon when the teams meet in the Rose Bowl,
364 days after 66-3. The Longhorns have a new coach, an
All-American tailback, a veteran offensive line and a game in hand,
having defeated New Mexico State 66-36 last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the most concerned Bruins are those who lived the
thrashing, like Farris. They know it was a game of mistakes and
capitalization _ not one team dominating the other at the point of
contact. They know the Longhorns won't commit eight turnovers
again. And they know what everyone else apparently has forgotten:
that Texas moved the ball with ease, gaining 48 yards on its first
four plays, before the implosion began.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put their mistakes on our side,'' Bruins guard Andy
Meyers said, ``they could have easily beaten us 66-3.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning outcome, devastating one season and giving
birth to another. Texas never recovered, losing six of its next
nine and its coach, John Mackovic, after the season. Meanwhile,
UCLA won its next nine, finished fifth in the polls and landed the
nation's top recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   One game, one-sided, all consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a program with this much pride gets beaten that badly,
it's tough,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown, who replaced Mackovic in
December. ``It's tough on the program and it's tough on the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, their chance for revenge has arrived. Defensive
end Aaron Humphrey fired the first salvo, calling Bruins
quarterback Cade McNown ``a dead man.'' (He later claimed to be
joking.) Brown must steer his players to a psychological balance,
keeping them hot but not boiling, turning their gaze inward rather
than on UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be direct with them,'' Brown said. ``But this is a new
season, and we need to worry about us. We're a team that's trying
to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Brown may need to ride the emotional break, Bruins coach
Bob Toledo must be prepared to hit the gas. Complacency is a
natural by-product of 63-point victories. But Texas is not a
typical 63-point loser and this is not a typical season opener for
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are typically slow starters, having lost three of
their last five openers. They've had a winning September just three
times this decade. Often, the losses were non-conference and had no
affect on their Rose Bowl chances.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the stakes are different. This year, the Bruins
are talking national championship, however quietly, and by that
standard each game is an elimination game. One loss is one too
many, just ask Michigan. The Bruins must start '98 as they finished
'97 _ sizzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last big question about this program,'' Farris
said. ``We've talked (about slow starts). This is more important
than our non-league games the last couple years because we aren't
thinking about the Rose Bowl anymore. We're thinking about the
bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a must-win than any opening game we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   How will it unfurl? Expect a high-scoring game, taut and
entertaining. The offenses are powerful _ Texas with Ricky Williams
and the running game, UCLA with McNown and the aerial attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the defenses are unproven. Both teams are implementing new
systems and have just two senior starters. Texas' secondary is
loaded with sophomores, while five members of UCLA's front seven
are first-time starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people feel we're going to start out like we ended
('97), but I don't know if that's going to happen,'' Toledo said.
``Is the defense ready? We'll find out. I'm as anxious as you are
to see how good or bad we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: No tickets are available today at the Rose Bowl. If you
don't have them already, don't bother showing up.

NIGHT LIKE THIS THE SOURCE OF HAUNTING MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ In this sepulcher of a stadium, where the
fans sit in nightly tomblike quiet, the Rangers got a glimpse of
their own tenuous well-beings last night.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose this thing, if they are unable to overtake the
Anaheim Angels, the Rangers can look back to nights like this.
</P>
<P>
   To nights when 7 2/3 robust innings by starting pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre were wasted.
</P>
<P>
   To nights when they failed _ without fail _ to deliver a hit in
the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   To nights, alas, when they lost to those expansion tunas, the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   This is how you begin a critical, two-town, five-game road trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated right now,'' said Stottlemyre, who deserved a
happier fate. ``I couldn't care less about personal results.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's getting to be the back half of September. Every loss
is like you can multiply it.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the math is really quite simple. With 16 games to go,
the Rangers coughed up a golden opportunity to leap to one full
game behind the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loss at this point in time is going to seem a little
bigger,'' admitted left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Rangers dressed quietly last night and tried not to
dwell on the obvious. Pennant contenders are supposed to steamroll
88-game losers like the Devil Rays _ not get handcuffed by them.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's pitching line was both an affirmation and an
indictment. He left with one out remaining in the eighth, having
surrendered only five hits and three runs. Rangers starting
pitching thus continued its dazzling two-week run.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all for naught because the team can't seem to find
and maintain a consistent higher gear. If the Rangers have a
pennant pulse, we amateur nurses are having trouble locating it.
</P>
<P>
   Their performance fit the environs last night. Tropicana Field _
a Vitamin-C name for a Grade-A concrete eyesore _ does not inspire
operalike heroics. The first-year Rays are touchy about the place,
and I can understand. I like my garage, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays' lineup has not helped. Tampa Bay is the
lowest-scoring team in the major leagues (3.8 runs per game).
Before last night, it was last in the American League in homers.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing crowd _ the Rays average 30,788 per game _ sits in
nightly air-conditioned repose, waiting for something big to
happen. Like Fred McGriff's elusive 74th RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, since this is St. Pete, they're waiting for the Prozac
to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre grudgingly gave them two moments to cheer last
night, Bobby Smith's sixth-inning opposite-field homer and Rich
Butler's game-deciding seventh-inning triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said,
correctly, ``pitching like that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't and it didn't, and you wonder when and if the
Rangers are going to downshift and pass the joy-riding Angels in
the right lane.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, at last, gives them hope.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman noticed two weeks ago that
the newly acquired Stottlemyre appeared to have lost confidence in
his curveball and changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought after the Chicago game, I made a lot of progress,''
the former Cardinal said. ``I fed off that. These last three times,
I've pitched real close to the way I pitched in the first half of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In that 21-inning span, Stottlemyre has allowed only 19 hits and
an earned run average of 3.86.
</P>
<P>
   But he has nothing but two losses and a no-decision to show for
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers may end up looking back on nights like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one wasn't any tougher to take, because any loss at this
stage of the season is tough,'' first baseman Will Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game,'' Oates added, ``because there are only 16
left. That's one less game that we've got to make up ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But the treadmill continues. The Rangers can't seem to generate
a consistent, convincing pulse.
</P>
<P>
   It's no way to start a September road trip.

L.A.-AREA RESIDENTS SPLIT OVER STARR REPORT'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the black-on-white words alleging President
Clinton's sexual transgressions filled the computer screen before
him Friday, Corey Lenoil shook his his head, unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time,'' he said, staring at Kenneth Starr's
exhaustive report, fetched from the Internet. ``A lot of
politicians have affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a few feet away in the cramped computer lab at Los
Angeles Pierce College, Kirby Pringle wasn't quite so forgiving.
Just a few months ago, he noted, Clinton denied having the sexual
relationship with a former White House intern spelled out in such
stunning detail in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied,'' the political science major said. ``I saw it on TV.
He lied to my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's Internet-accessible report landed on computers, radios
and televisions throughout the Los Angeles area Friday like a bad
bit of dirty gossip _ embarrassing and compelling and very hard to
ignore. Some of those who heard or read the more lurid details of
the report reacted with disgust and anger, others with sadness and
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Many wished the issue had never been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad, sad day,'' said Barbara Fish of Malibu. ``Even
if steps aren't taken toward impeachment, it's hurt our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Fish was trying to print the report in a computer lab
she supervises at Pierce, located in the L.A. suburb of Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history, and I think we need to be aware of it while it's
happening,'' she said, as the document's table of contents rolled
off the printer.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't surprised by the report's revelations, she said. All
along she had figured Clinton was lying when he denied having an
affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky. Still, Clinton's recent
admission of his ``inappropriate'' relationship with Lewinsky after
months of insisting otherwise left her disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're caught, at least be honorable enough to be honest,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, she said, should resign and let the government
get back to business. ``That would be the cleanest, quickest
resolution for the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued Friday that Clinton already had done exactly what
he needed to do _ say he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't step aside,'' said barber Leon Green in Encino,
an L.A. suburb. ``He apologized for it. He didn't commit a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Green voted for Clinton during the last election and would vote
for him again. What matters, he said, is that Clinton has protected
Social Security and Medicare, not that he had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about nothing,'' he said. ``He hurt his wife and
family, he didn't hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his customers, Kanan Kadjar, said the scandal diverts
government attention from more important issues, among them
economic turmoil engulfing Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the president to concentrate on the ruble, not this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the barbershop, however, was not unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want my opinion, they ought to hang him,'' said barber
Andy Morlett, his hands smeared with hair coloring. ``He lied. He
blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the constant din of radio talk shows and television news
bulletins Friday, some L.A. residents tried to ignore the entire
mess. Seated at a computer in a library in suburban West Hills,
Robert Rouge said he had no interest in perusing the Starr report
online. The former television sound technician was more concerned
about rewriting his resume and finding a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard enough,'' he said. ``I don't want to see a D.C.
hanging.'' &QL;

REDS KEEP PARTYING AT D-BACKS' EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Friday was the New Year's hangover, the wrapping
paper strewn under the Christmas tree, the ticker tape and confetti
piled on the ground, but the parade long since passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark McGwire Feelgood Tour moved on and the Diamondbacks
moved in, meaning it was back to regular baseball for the
Cincinnati Reds. On the brighter side, suspended Reds owner Marge
Schott and her dog, Schottzie (2) were nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   After being urged by Schott to pet the dog and then rub his hand
on his chest, McGwire failed to hit one out and took his 62 home
runs to Houston. Apparently, a bunch of fans went with him. There
were, as they say, plenty of good seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for the home folks, because they missed not only a rare
Reds victory, but a rare, resounding, 13-1 Reds victory. After a
pair of sellout crowds exceeding 50,000 came to shower McGwire with
affection, 16,579 showed up at Cinergy Field to see a team tied for
last place in the National League Central (the Reds) play the
last-place team in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was fitting that absent McGwire, the star void was
filled by a couple of professional wrestlers in town for a match
down the street at The Crown. Actually, to some of the players
gaping at large fellows identified as Goldberg and Diamond Dallas
Page, who were permitted to take batting practice, this might have
been bigger than McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse before the game, the Reds marveled at
Goldberg's championship belt as if it were the World Series trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Scottsdale's Paul Konerko explained.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Diamondbacks, several Reds were ``the man.'' Brett
Tomko beat Arizona for the second time this season, pitching seven
strong innings. After giving up Tony Batista's 17th home run and a
double to Devon White in the third, Tomko retired 13 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce and Sean Casey each hit three-run homers and
Damian Jackson and Dmitri Young had three hits for the Reds, who
pounded Diamondbacks starter Clint Sodowsky (pitching with a bone
chip in his right ankle) and assorted relievers. For Casey, it was
his third home run in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty,'' Arizona Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had lost eight of their past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell, the Diamondbacks shortstop all year and for virtually
his entire career, started at second base with Batista at short.
The last time Bell played second was in the 1993 All-Star Game. The
only other occasions were his first two major league games with
Cleveland in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who is 32 and whose 18 errors are two fewer than his total
for the past ``two'' seasons combined, has been taking ground balls
at second since the All-Star break. Showalter said this wasn't a
one-time thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance to make us a better ballclub,'' he said.
``We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Batista, whose best position probably is shortstop,
fielded flawlessly. Bell handled five grounders and had a put-out
on a force play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's kind of enjoyable (playing second base). It's a
nice, little, short throw. The older I get, the more appealing it
is.'' &QL;

COYOTES REJECT OFFER; TKACHUK BEGINS HOLDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McManaman  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Saying the latest offers he received were
``outlandish and offensive,'' Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith
quickly rejected two contract extension proposals from the agent
for Keith Tkachuk. That left the team's captain and leading scorer
to contemplate the holdout everyone is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it will start today, even though Tkachuk did not
report Friday night for the team's mandatory first meeting of
training camp. Smith said the NHL has informed him that Tkachuk
will be considered a holdout if he fails to arrive in Scottsdale
today for medical and fitness tests. And that is a virtual
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be there tomorrow, either,'' Tkachuk said Friday from
his summer home near Boston. ``I'm very, very, very disappointed
with the way Bobby Smith decided to handle this. Unfortunately, he
doesn't want me on his team, so what am I going to do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, a two-time All Star who has scored the third-most goals
in the NHL the past five seasons (205), has two options. He can
bite the bullet and report to camp without a contract extension and
honor the final two years of his deal, worth $2.8 million this
season and $3 million the next. Or, he can refuse to play entirely,
possibly deciding to sit out the upcoming 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I definitely won't be there (today),'' Tkachuk
said. ``Beyond that, I'm just going to take things one day at a
time. . . . Sunday? . . . I'll tell you then.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful Tkachuk will be here any time soon. After
rejecting both proposals sent to him Thursday by Tkachuk's agent,
Bob Murray, and then refusing to consider any counterproposals or
further discussion, Smith said all negotiations are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have much basis for negotiations at this
point,'' Smith said. ``They're off right now. Their proposals were
unacceptable. They were only marginally less than the five-year
proposal (of $40 million) we saw from them last May. And I mean
``marginally'' less, a hair's breadth less.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no recognition of the fact this guy has two years
left on his contract. When I asked Bob Murray to send me a new
proposal two days ago, I expected this offer to be tempting. . . .
But it was a decision I could make in one second.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smith nor Murray would divulge any details of the two
new proposals. Murray, however, maintains each contained
``realistic concessions'' by Tkachuk, 26, who sat out all of the
preseason games last year until Smith agreed to try to get a new
deal signed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what we wanted a year ago, and he asked Keith to come
back and play the season and work hard with the promise he'd give
Keith a contract that pays him the market rate for a player of his
caliber,'' Murray said. ``Well, Keith fulfilled that obligation to
the tee. But it seems to me Bob Smith has never had any intention
of trying to sign Keith.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said he doesn't see any point agreeing to report to camp
in hopes negotiations will continue during the preseason, as Smith
now has announced talks are through for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be there,'' Tkachuk said. ``I want to start playing
with my teammates again. Bobby Smith made a promise he'd get me
there, but he can't get it done. I don't know. It's frustrating to
have a rookie GM, but what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith reiterated he has no plans or intentions of trying to
trade Tkachuk. Reportedly, he's turned down at least two offers
within the past six months for the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't allow guys to make unfounded salary demands and
then, when they aren't met, trade him to a team he thinks will pay
him what he's worth,'' Smith said. ``I'd have to trade half the
team if we started making a practice of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith did say, however, that eventually Tkachuk's captaincy may
have to be addressed. He is not willing to strip him of the ``C''
at this point, indicating there is no NHL rule stating a team must
designate any one player with the letter. Instead, Smith said it's
likely that three players will wear an ``A'' on their jerseys as
assistant captains. &QL;

ASU TURNS FOCUS TO BYU  
 SNYDER ON GUARD FOR COUGARS' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah _ The goal seems as unreachable as the peaks that
grace the central Utah terrain, but Arizona State Coach Bruce
Snyder has not allowed his team to let go of its original dream:
Reaching the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think a team could play in (the Fiesta Bowl at Sun
Devil Stadium) on Jan. 4 with one loss,'' he said. ``I don't know
if it's us, but I think one could.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder spent the week trying to get his players to shake off
their season-opening loss to Washington, but it didn't happen until
Wednesday's practice, he said. The No. 14 Sun Devils will learn
today if that was soon enough when they meet Brigham Young at
Cougar Stadium. Kickoff is 6 p.m. Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to win 11 in a row,'' free safety Mitchell Freedman
said. ``Anything can still happen. Washington still has to play
UCLA. Everybody has to play each other. Our goal is to just take it
one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder reminds his team often about the Bruins, who started the
1997 season 0-2, won the next 10 and finished ranked fifth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He also tells his players that although the defense has been
questioned since the 42-38 loss to the Huskies, perception is not
always reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finished with more yards than Washington,'' he said.
``Certainly, there are areas we had to address, but I believe the
problems are correctable. My thinking is we're better than the
(perception). I still think we have a chance to be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the Cougars, who opened with a 38-31 loss to
Alabama. BYU loves to throw the ball _ that's nothing new _ but
Snyder doesn't believe the Cougars will let the talents of speedy
tailback Ronney Jenkins go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, the Sun Devils proved vulnerable to passes
underneath and struggled in nickel and dime packages. Although ASU
lost on a deep pass late, the short game was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for them to do the same things as Washington
did,'' Freedman said. ``They watch film. They'll try to hit the
inexperienced players. Our job is to get all the youngsters ready,
get their minds ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has good reason not to overlook BYU's rushing attack. He
believes the Cougars would have won their opener if Jenkins had not
been sidelined because of leg cramps much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore comes with some pretty impressive credentials. He
set a national record by running for 619 yards (and seven
touchdowns) as a senior at Hueneme (Calif.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart, evasive runner,'' Cougars Coach LaVell Edwards
said. ``He makes our offense more balanced. I still don't believe
we've seen what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snyder, ``I really believe they're going to try to run.
They have a big offensive line, and I think they could be a real
good offensive running team if they're stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU, which has lost four of its past five games, knows ASU is a
good running team. The Sun Devils managed 465 yards of total
offense against Washington, with 254 all-purpose yards coming from
tailback J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   ASU easily should surpass the 10 points it scored when these
teams met last season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Redmond's feat, quarterback Ryan Kealy looked
strong against the Huskies and proved he has no shortage of
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to seven. Creig Spann led the way with four catches
for 71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really a close group,'' Spann said. ``We work together
and feed off each other. If someone does well, we say, `Good job.'
Any time Lenzie (Jackson) or Tariq (McDonald) or any of those guys
does something, I'm proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although BYU gave up 38 points to Alabama, Snyder is concerned
about its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team this, and not just to pump them up: I think
their defense played as well against Alabama as Washington played
against us, if not better,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``BYU is legitimate. We've got to prove ourselves. Because we
haven't yet.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, the American people have been mere
bystanders as the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the release of Kenneth Starr's report, they have
assumed a central and conceivably decisive role in the case. The
report is in the hands of Congress, to dispose of as Congress sees
fit. A political process has begun, and in political processes, as
the Founding Fathers foresaw, the people have the ultimate power.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear how they will use it, or what the result
will be. One prominent Democratic political consultant told his
clients this week that he expected Clinton to be out of the White
House within weeks. Only one president in the last 50 years, it is
true, has been in trouble this deep, and that one, Richard Nixon,
was of course forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   But many clear-eyed people still think that Clinton will hold
on.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Washington is lost. There is no precedent for the
present bizarre spectacle _ lurid tales of sexual hijinks in and
near the Oval Office, poker-faced lawyers in serious suits debating
the constitutional implications thereof, and rowdy legislators
trying to behave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a movie, or a pulp novel, or an adolescent dream about
life in the capital? No, it is real life. Or the closest
approximation that the Clinton years _ the Harding era restaged for
television _ can produce.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Whitewater investigation began, and continuing
through the revelations about Ms. Lewinsky, the voters have been
telling pollsters that they approve of Clinton's performance as
president, however they feel about his behavior or character. Three
new polls, conducted over the last two weeks by CBS News, Gallup
and the Pew Research Center, found no significant change in that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were taken before the report was released, of course,
and it is possible that Starr's enumeration of 11 possible grounds
for impeachment may change many people's minds. The explicit
details of the president's repeated sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky _ and especially the fact that some took place in the
sanctum sanctorum of American government, near the Oval Office,
several while he was on the phone with a member of Congress _ may
have an adverse impact as well.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how ephemeral and imperfect the polls may be, they
suggest that if an election were held tomorrow, and Clinton were
legally eligible to run, he would stand a reasonable chance of
winning another term.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a very leading question: Why would the politicians
who sit in the Senate and the House of Representatives want to vote
to remove from office a president, twice elected by the people of
the United States, whose official conduct has met with such
consistent approval from the voters?
</P>
<P>
   They might do so if they felt the political winds shifting
enough that doing otherwise could put their own careers in peril.
While it is true that legislators can and often do rise above petty
partisanship on great questions of state like war or peace and
impeachment, and they may do so at this time, it is also true that
they are as subject to the instinct of self-preservation as any
other human beings.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that many Democrats' sensitive noses are
already picking up the scent of such climatic change. Many senators
and representatives who face close races are publicly denouncing
the president, and others have made it clear they would be just as
happy if he did not campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Democrats who are considered custodians of
the traditions and values of the Senate _ elders like Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Byrd of West Virginia _
have been among the most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the independent analyst Charles E. Cook Jr.,
who probably follows congressional politics more closely than
anyone, said that this fall's election was most likely to produce
only modest changes, if any, in the makeup of the two houses. In a
new survey distributed Friday, he said the ``mid-range scenario''
would show Democratic losses of six to 10 seats in the House and
two to four in the Senate, with much larger losses clearly
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators might also turn against the president if they
hear from the voters, either directly or indirectly, that they want
him called to account. Public backing for the president might be
quickly eroded not only by the Starr report but also the faltering
economy; one reason many voters have given over the past few years
for sticking with Clinton has been a strong stock market and full
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls, faxes and e-mails in the next days will count for a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Every president is weak at the stage Clinton has reached, with
only two years left of his second term. The reformer's zeal is
spent, and as political attention slowly turns to the question of a
successor, the incumbent's power on Capitol Hill wanes. For
Clinton, the problem is intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 rather than
face an impeachment trial, Clinton lacks roots in Congress. He
never served there, and he has spent little time cultivating the
Democrats upon whom his survival may well depend. Some members are
last-ditch loyalists; every single member of the Black Caucus, for
example, voted Friday to give the president a chance to study the
Starr report before it was released to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, who
could be a pivotal figure, is much less locked in. When he was
campaigning four years ago for his present post, he promised to put
his colleagues' interests ahead of the president's, and he
reiterated that viewpoint on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as an advocate of the president per se,''
he told The Wall Street Journal. ``I see myself as ensuring that
the president gets a fair hearing. I draw a very big distinction
between the two roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-page rebuttal issued by Clinton's lawyers construed the
constitutional language about impeachment as narrowly as possible.
That will clearly form one element of his defense. But there is
precedent for a broader interpretation as well. During his days in
the House, Former President Gerald Ford said that an impeachable
offense is ``whatever a majority of the House of Representatives
considers it to be at a given moment of history.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a close parallel, no doubt intentional,
between one of the offenses of which the House Judiciary Committee
found Nixon guilty _ failure to ``take care that the laws be
faithfully executed'' _ and one of Starr's charges _ conduct
``inconsistent with the president's constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the laws'' of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The other main element of the president's defense is contrition.
Almost every public statement in recent days has included a plea
for forgiveness. But he has lied and dissembled so often in the
past, one of his friends in the Senate said, ``that you have to ask
yourself which Clinton to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, as The Economist said this week, ``First apologies are
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it should be emphasized, need not maintain the support
of a majority of the House and Senate to survive. In the Senate, a
two-thirds majority is required to convict, so he would need only
the backing of 34 senators to hang on. In the House, a simple
majority would technically suffice to force a Senate trial, but a
225-210 vote or anything like it seems an insubstantial, unlikely
foundation on which to build a presidential trial.
</P>
<P>
   Developments now unforeseen could, of course, make things worse
for the president _ additional revelations about his conduct or
indictments of close aides in the Lewinsky matter, for example. A
more heavily Republican Senate could easily be in place for any
final vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Future developments could save him, too _ a foreign-policy
crisis, perhaps, or a major terrorist attack at home. His lawyers
refused Friday to rule out the possibility of a deal with Congress
that would lead to an early censure and head off any more
protracted proceeding. Otherwise, the process that began Friday
could last for months, and that is a very long time indeed in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As he weighs his options, again and again, Clinton will have to
ask himself: Survive on what terms, and to what end? He will still
have Air Force One and the Marine Band, still meet with
congressional and foreign leaders, still have his political allies,
unless he is impeached or resigns. But his moral leadership, that
intangible legitimacy that makes a president a force in the
country, has been shattered, and reconstituting it, after all that
has happened, will be even harder than getting 34 votes in the
Senate.

METCALF: SEAHAWKS NOT SPECIAL  
 BUT RECEIVER BUYS 69 SEATS FOR FAMILY, FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Eric Metcalf claims his return to hometown
Seattle on Sunday for the Cardinals' game against the Seahawks is
no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   His wallet, however, might refute that statement. It is
considerably lighter after Metcalf purchased 69 tickets to host
family and friends at the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I'm not playing this game for free,'' said Metcalf, a
wide receiver and kickoff and punt returner. ``It's a lot of
tickets. But on the other hand, I'll only be there once this year.
I try to give friends and family who otherwise don't have an
opportunity to see me play in person the opportunity to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf is a big name in Seattle. Not only was he reared there,
so was his father, Terry Metcalf, a former All-Pro running back
with the Cardinals who coaches at Seattle's Franklin High School,
his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's visit, Eric Metcalf said, will mark his sixth NFL
return to his hometown. (Mercy. At 69 tickets a game, that's 414
tickets.)
</P>
<P>
   `Really, it's no big deal to me,'' Metcalf said. ``I'm happy to
get the opportunity to play in front of a lot of people I know. At
the same time, I try not to go in there thinking it's a special
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do think about trying to impress my family, it's
something that can bug you and lead to mistakes. So I try to
downplay it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while growing up in Seattle, Metcalf was never a fan of the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL team that had his heart resided farther south in San
Diego _ the very team that dealt him to the Cardinals, along with
linebacker Patrick Sapp and a first-round draft pick next year. The
blockbuster deal gave the Chargers the second pick in the draft,
which they used to select franchise quarterback Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up a Chargers fan,'' he said. ``There was something
about them I liked. Especially when (Coach Don) Coryell was there.
They scored a lot of points, and I considered myself a person who
could score a lot of points. I liked their style.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, too, would like for him to score a lot of points.
Now, for instance, would be a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's Cardinals debut, like that of the rest of the offense,
was less than spectacular in the opener at Dallas. In his
all-purpose role, he caught one pass for seven yards, returned
three kickoffs for 41 yards, a 13.7 average, and four punts for 19
yards, a 4.8 average.
</P>
<P>
   The combined 60 yards in kick returns did enable the 10-year
veteran to hit the six-mile mark in combined return average with
7,042 yards in his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're the only player in NFL history to return 11 or
more punts and kickoffs for touchdowns, those Dallas figures fall
short of expectations, as did one pass reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our offense did as a whole last week was a big
aberration,'' Metcalf said. ``We have so many weapons on this team,
and the system gives everybody an opportunity to make plays.
Unfortunately, we didn't do it. It looked like we were a terrible
offense. In reality, we're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit of everybody breaking down. Our third-down
production was terrible. We didn't convert any. You don't keep
drives alive if you don't convert on third down, and that's where
the problem was. It's a collective thing and no single person's
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can three practices enable ``the collective''
to turn it around in time to meet an excellent Seahawks defense
that shut out Philadelphia, 38-0, last Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming for that,'' Metcalf said. ``I can't imagine
anyone wanting to go out and play like we did again. Everybody
wants to prove _ not to outsiders, but to ourselves _ that we can
make plays.'' &QL;

SUN DEVILS ALREADY FACE CRISIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah - Camp started with a ceremonial ritual. A football
team huddling around a bonfire on a pitch-black night, tossing
magazines and newspapers into the burning pit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a symbolic gesture meant to discredit the hype, dispose
of other people's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sun Devils now realize, nothing works better than a bad
loss.
</P>
<P>
   One week into the proceedings and all hopes of a national
championship have been flushed. The exhilaration is gone, replaced
by suspicion. Disappointment has dampened the air, the Fiesta over
before it got started.
</P>
<P>
   One week into a new season, the Sun Devils are already on the
brink, facing a crisis game, a must-win scenario if any significant
bowl is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll become the hunter rather than the hunted,'' ASU
coach Bruce Snyder said. ``And maybe we'll play better.'' &QL; 
Quiet week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been a strange week for Snyder, a week when the silence
has been deafening. The ASU faithful were stunned by a 42-38 loss
to Washington. They likened it to the Rose Bowl of 1997, only
worse. Because this game didn't end a great season. Instead, it may
have prevented one.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe _ and this is the really hard part _ the Sun Devils
were terribly overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys that didn't earn the reputation we
have,'' Snyder said. ``They weren't here. They didn't do it. This
team has to learn that it's not just given to them now that they
have Sun Devil uniforms. They have to go out and prove it
themselves. But I still think we have a chance to be very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they? There was much to chew on after the debacle against the
Huskies. Why was there no pass rush? Why couldn't the linebackers
tackle? Is the secondary really that bad? And why did such a
celebrated coaching staff fail to make adjustments at halftime?
</P>
<P>
   A staff that was inexplicably playing bump-and-run on a
4th-and-17 with under 30 seconds remaining, allowing a receiver to
get behind coverage and score the game-winning touchdown?
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away that last play, and we out-passed them,'' Snyder
said. ``But people don't have that perception. We weren't
particularly good against some things, but I think they're
correctable, and that we'll get better. So my thinking is we may be
better (defensively) than some people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the loss of linebacker Larry Johnson, running
back Marlon Farlow and wide receiver Ricky Boyer became official.
Johnson was supposed to make a difference on defense. Farlow
would've given Snyder the depth to use J.R. Redmond in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   All three are academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes BYU on the road, a team that lost, 38-31, to Alabama
last week, a team that plays before one of the most rabid
followings in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I felt they out-hit us,'' Snyder said. ``I felt
they out-hit Alabama at Alabama. So they're a great hitting team.
They're physical, they're older, they're more mature. You know,
they don't go out on a Friday or Saturday night. They're with their
families. They're tough to beat.'' &QL; 
Much to be learned &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You will learn much about this football team tonight. Whether
they're capable of big things. Or whether they're too young, too
short on defense, too far removed from the big boys. A team
destined for the Jeep Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's still early, and if the Sun Devils run the table, they can
recover much prestige and ranking. A win over an unbeaten Notre
Dame outfit might give them a boost. Road victories over BYU and
USC won't hurt. And this might be a year when no one in the Pac-10
goes unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to bet, I wouldn't say the winner is going to be
undefeated,'' Snyder said. ``Somewhere along the line, every school
is going to get their comeuppance, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's certain: The Sun Devils have already gotten theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope someday we can play great as the guy out in front, but
I don't know,'' Snyder said. ``It's a tough thing to do.'' &QL;

CARDS SIGN EX-BEARS LINEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 and TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals officials had one question for former
Chicago Bears defensive lineman  &UR; Carl Simpson before signing him
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Can you play this week?' '' Simpson said. ``I told
them I could play this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson won't play Sunday at Seattle but was added because the
team is so thin on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   They have just six healthy players there, including first-round
draft pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, who has had only three practices since
signing last week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest injury on the defensive line is to  &UR; Jerry Drake, who
has a bulging disc in his back. Drake started ahead of Wadsworth at
left defensive end in the season-opening loss at Dallas and will be
out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know more for a couple of weeks,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin
said of Drake's injury. ``We're going to treat it with medication
and hope it calms it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, a 6-foot-2, 292-pound sixth-year pro, started all 16
games for the Bears each of the past two seasons. He was released
by the Bears in training camp last month, a move he almost
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was one of their best linemen, but I felt I (might
get cut), the way I was getting handled,'' said Simpson, who had 61
tackles and 4{ sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   He has played both tackle and end and will be used at both
positions with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year pro  &UR; Rashod Swinger will back up starting ends
Wadsworth and  &UR; Simeon Rice against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Simpson, the Cardinals released backup
offensive lineman  &UR; Jon Clark. &QL; 
Running on empty &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals center  &UR; Aaron Graham thinks he knows why the team ran
so poorly in the season opener. The Cardinals gained 45 yards, the
second fewest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like our (earlier preseason) game against Seattle,''
Graham said. ``One time, the back didn't make a good read, but the
offensive line picked up things pretty well. On the next play, the
back makes good reads, but the line didn't do the job. It's like a
combination of factors each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on being more in touch with the backs. We're
doing the little things now. Adrian (running back  &UR; Adrian
Murrell) &UR; and the backs now are watching film with us so we know
more about each other. Once a week, he'll come in and watch film.
It's something he and I talked about, and think it's a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running the ball is about attitude. I got excited watching on
the sideline when the Cowboys started running the ball. They were
really pounding it and coming off the rock. We've got to come off
the rock. We've got the ability, the work ethic and the attitude,
but when it comes to games, we have to transfer it into action.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last time Murrell played against Seattle, he ran for 131
yards for the New York Jets in last year's season opener at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Graham suffered a minor calf injury in practice Friday but is
expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Tony McCombs (clavicle), offensive guard
 &UR; Jerome Daniels (knee), Drake and Simpson will be inactive for
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks starting middle linebacker  &UR; Dean Wells (strained calf)
won't start. He will be replaced by rookie  &UR; DeShone
 &UR; Myles. &QL;

KONERKO NOT WORRIED ABOUT EARLY STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When we last checked in with  &UR; Paul Konerko in July,
the Scottsdale Chaparral High School graduate had just been traded
from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Cincinnati Reds and helped beat
the Diamondbacks with a two-run homer at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But Konerko's career went in a different direction after that _
west, to Indianapolis, specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko struggled with the Reds, batting .182 in 55 at-bats
before being sent to the Reds Triple-A team. He was there for more
than a month as Indianapolis fought for a playoff berth that it
missed by a half-game, batting .327 with eight home runs and 39
RBIs in 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Konerko, who was recalled Wednesday, always has hit well in
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can say you've done well after you've
already done well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Konerko wasn't making too much of his struggles with
the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a bad two weeks,'' he said. ``Hitting goes in
cycles. The way I see it, I missed my cycle. I'm going to hit bad
occasionally. It's a matter of whether they stick with you. In my
case, the answer was no. . . . I'm not a .200 hitter. Things even
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Konerko showed flashes of his hitting potential with a three-run
double in an 8-7 loss to St. Louis on Thursday. He pinch-hit in the
Reds' 13-1 victory over the Diamondbacks on Friday and flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily a first baseman, Konerko also can play third base and
has dabbled with left field. The Reds seem to be set at those
positions, but Konerko doesn't seem concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to play somewhere in the big leagues,'' he
said. &QL; 
The eyes have it &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As expected, outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey will undergo laser
surgery to improve his eyesight. Gilkey will leave Monday for
Calgary and have the operation Wednesday. He is expected to return
to the Valley later that day and might be available to play in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help my vision a little bit,'' he said. ``It can't
hurt it.'' &QL; 
Welcome to the bigs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A pair of pitchers made their major league debuts for the
Diamondbacks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Neil Weber pitched a scoreless fifth inning, and  &UR; Vladimir
Nunez followed him to the mound in the sixth, with the same result.
But Nunez ran into trouble in the seventh and ended up yielding two
runs when  &UR; Alan Embree gave up a three-run homer to  &UR; Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-5, 215-pound left-hander, Weber allowed one hit and
struck out pitcher  &UR; Brett Tomko and  &UR; Sean Casey. &UR; Nunez, a 6-foot-4,
235-pound righty, struck out  &UR; Aaron Boone and gave up two hits and
two runs in 1 innings. &QL;

NAU SEEKS 2ND WIN, 2ND SHUTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Northern Arizona is known for offensive
fireworks, but it might be the defense that propels the Lumberjacks
this season.
</P>
<P>
   After a season-opening defensive gem on the road _ a 9-0 win
over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo _ the Lumberjacks will try to make it
two straight when they host Southwest Texas State tonight at Walkup
Skydome.
</P>
<P>
   NAU hasn't recorded back-to-back shutouts since 1965. In the
only other meeting between the schools, the Lumberjacks won, 39-0,
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Texas scored all its points in a 10-minute span of the
fourth quarter to defeat Delta State (Miss.), 17-10, in its opener.
</P>
<P>
   Will defense be the dominant feature on this NAU team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to characterize us that way,'' Coach Jerome
Souers said. ``We're capable of a lot more offense. But the results
were good, and we'll take that any day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of breakaway success against Col Poly. I
credit their defense. But this team (Southwest Texas) is going to
pressure us more, and we need to be on our toes to protect our
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU linebacker Afa Faraimo had 11 tackles, including six for
losses, a fumble recovery, two sacks and a pass deflection against
Cal Poly. He was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well, but he'd be the first to tell you that his
defensive line in front of him helped to clean things up, and the
secondary kept a check on the passing game,'' Soures said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Goldstein, whose three field goals accounted for all the
scoring in the game, was chosen the Big Sky Special Teams Player of
the Week and the ESPN/``USA Today'' 1-AA Special Teams Player of
the Week.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably only a matter of time before NAU quarterback
Travis Brown puts things together in a big way. He goes into
tonight's game with almost 7,000 career passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's win, Brown completed 16 of 34 passes for 158
yards, and it was only the fourth time in 24 games that the junior
from Moon Valley High School failed to throw a touchdown pass. &QL;

NCAA CONTEMPLATING BAN ON CREATINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA is considering a proposal that would ban member
institutions from providing creatine to its student-athletes. The
decision, expected next year, will bring uniformity to how Pac-10
schools approach the controversial supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, it is up to each university. Arizona State recently
stopped making it available. Southern California does not provide
it. Washington leaves it up to each sport, but its use is closely
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of smoke that says some studies show overuse of
creatine might be harmful,'' said  &UR; Betsy Mosher, ASU's senior
associate athletic director for administration and compliance.
``Nobody has seen these studies, and that is our dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt creatine works to some extent. However, we are
basically in very much a holding mold. If it's in some way
detrimental to our student-athletes, we don't want to be involved
in that. We'll wait for the national scene to shift out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if schools don't distribute creatine, athletes can purchase
it on their own. If the NCAA decides to ban it, it faces this
problem: How do you test for it? Creatine is a natural substance
created within the body.
</P>
<P>
   The topic was raised at a June meeting of conference
institutions after a debate on the off-season use of nutritional
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more attention is focused on creatine, there has been an
increase of concern on the long-range effects,'' conference
Commissioner  &UR; Tom Hansen said. ``We'll adopt a conference position
when it comes up for review (with the NCAA).'' &QL; 
Speaking out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the conference's most colorful personalities is USC
junior
 &UR; Petros Papadakis, who is glib, well-rounded, and comfortable
expounding on most subjects. Here are some choice bits the backup
tailback laid on ``The Arizona Republi''c:
</P>
<P>
   On  &UR; President Clinton: ``He hasn't done anything worth
impeachment. For some reason, our society can't get enough of
reading stories about stains on dresses. . . . But the fact that
the leader of a free world country is dumb enough to get caught,
that's reason for him to go.''
</P>
<P>
   On USC replacing Coach  &UR; John Robinson with  &UR; Paul Hackett: ``I
don't miss him. Actually, it's just that change sometimes is the
best thing. It's the difference between night and day right now.
Everyone has such a better work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what Texas defensive end  &UR; Aaron
 &UR; Humphery was thinking. He recently was quoted in a Texas
publication as saying, ``Cade is a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA quarterback  &UR; Cade McNown threw five touchdown passes in a
63-point win over the Longhorns last season. The Bruins open their
season at home today against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Credit California's  &UR; Dameane Douglas with following instructions
to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   With his team trailing Houston, 10-7, with 3:25 remaining in the
game, Golden Bears Coach  &UR; Tom Holmoe found Douglas on the sideline
and said, ``You've got to win this game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback  &UR; Justin Vedder led a scoring drive from the Cougars'
49-yard-line and three key passes were caught by Douglas. &QL; 
Watch this &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska visits Berkeley, Calif., today. Bears defensive
coordinator
 &UR; Lyle Setencich shared his video of ASU's victory over the
Cornhuskers in 1996 with his fellow coaches. Setencich was the Sun
Devils' linebackers coach at the time.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, Setencich did not share the 1995 tape, when
Nebraska beat ASU, 77-28. &QL; 
On the rise &QL; 
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   How can you argue with a team that went into its season opener
as a 1{-point underdog and stunned Michigan State by 34 points?
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have scored at least 40 points in their past three
games. &QL;

ARIZONA WANTS TO LURK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ It was a hint. Or a hope. Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Arizona football Coach Dick Tomey left the
assembled media wondering whether he was talking about his own team
or some other Pac-10 entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are picking Arizona State and UCLA,'' Tomey said
last month at a Pac-10 news conference. ``I can't fault them for
that. Both are outstanding. But I still think some team is lurking
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's lurking division already appears to have one solid
contender out there. Or up there. It's still early, but Oregon's
stunning rout last week of Michigan State at Eugene, Ore., makes
the Ducks a lurking leader.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been an intriguing but uncertain possibility. Some
of that uncertainty is about to be eliminated. A victory today at
Stanford (12:30 p.m. kickoff on radio KGME-AM, 1360) wouldn't
exactly distinguish Arizona, but it would alert the rest of the
league to a team with a chance to do some serious lurking.
</P>
<P>
   The chances look good.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are favored by eight points to win their conference
opener over Stanford, which has three starters on defense and four
on offense _ all linemen _ back from last year's mediocre team.
</P>
<P>
   But favorites are an endangered species in mid-September, which
is really the second step in any team's shakedown stage before the
season moves into autumn and answers.
</P>
<P>
   Not much can probably be made of either Arizona's season-opening
win at Hawaii or Stanford's loss to San Jose State. Arizona did
what it was supposed to. Stanford did not.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusions?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never predict what a college team is going to do in
its opener,'' Tomey said. ``This is not like the NFL with
exhibition games. You have a few weeks, and boom, you're into the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerns me is that I'm convinced we didn't see the real
Stanford in that (35-23) loss to San Jose State.''
</P>
<P>
   A complication is the uncertainty Arizona's 27-6 victory at
Hawaii was hard to judge, but it did display the Wildcats'
predicted potential for big plays: Chris McAlister's touchdown on a
100-yard return of the opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's big-play possibilities loom as a powerful factor in
their favor. Stanford gave up the big play against San Jose State,
which broke loose for 23 yards or more on 10 different plays.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be at the trigger for Arizona? Quarterback Keith Smith
or Ortege Jenkins?
</P>
<P>
   Tomey isn't saying. The guess is that Smith will start. He came
on in relief of Jenkins last week and immediately proved to be more
effective. &QL;

ASU OUT COACHED AT HOME _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past two years, Arizona State Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder has
been justifiably lauded, and amply rewarded, for leading the Sun
Devils to the top of the Pac-10 and into national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils' past two home games proved that Snyder and
his staff can be badly outcoached.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Arizona whipped ASU, 28-16, largely because of new
offensive wrinkles that confused the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   That was somewhat forgivable because Arizona had closed
practices for two weeks and was particularly successful using trick
plays.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little excuse for what happened last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington confused the Sun Devils by using four- and
five-receiver sets. Quarterback  &UR; Brock Huard and friends shredded
ASU's perplexed pass defenders and won the game, 42-38.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder admitted the Sun Devils were surprised by the Huskies'
offensive formations. That admission in itself is surprising
because Washington's offensive changes were hardly a secret.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Seattle Times'' published a story last week about
Washington's offense and how the Huskies were moving away from a
power running game to a multi-receiver set, similar to what
Washington State uses.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an excerpt: ``It's pass first. Pass short. Pass often.
It's the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks and Washington State
Cougars all rolled into one.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only coaching mistake in the game. ASU tried to
run on fourth-and-inches with its best blocker, fullback  &UR; Jeff
Paulk, on the sideline. On the Hail Mary at the end of the game,
there were no receivers in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   You expect young players to make mistakes in season openers.
They make even more when they aren't properly prepared. &QL; 
Joe Pa goes for milestone &QL; 
It was 1966 and  &UR; Joe Paterno had just won his debut as Penn State's
coach, beating Maryland, 15-7. Afterward, Paterno couldn't find
Maryland Coach  &UR; Lou Saban to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember about that game is that, No. 1, it was
probably about as poorly a coached football team as you ever saw,''
said Paterno, who goes after his 300th victory today when the
Nittany Lions play Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno finally heard from Saban, who called him on the Monday
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saban) said, `I apologize for not coming over the
congratulate you, but we were both so lousy I didn't have the heart
to congratulate anybody.'' &QL; 
A bit of redemption &QL; 
Colorado Coach  &UR; Rick Neuheisel, a graduate of Tempe McClintock High
School, took some heat for his team's 5-6 record last season. The
Buffaloes were viewed as undisciplined underachievers, and there
was some speculation that Colorado now was the state's second best
program, dropping behind Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes showed last week that the talk of their demise
might be premature. They beat a good Colorado State team, 42-14,
although the game was closer than the score indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 280 days, we talked about character, we talked about a lot
of things,'' Neuheisel said. ``We checked under the mats, found the
dirt and swept it all away.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest addition is quarterback  &UR; Mike Moschetti, a junior
college transfer who completed 21 of 32 passes for 257 yards and
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If Colorado has improved, it should make the Big 12 race very
interesting. Kansas State and Nebraska were heavy favorites to
battle for the championship. But with Colorado's emergence, and if
Texas plays well today at UCLA, it might not be that simple. &QL; 
Officially out &QL; 
The past two times  &UR; Dave McCullough has visited Pullman, Wash.,
he's suffered broken bones, but he can't wait to go back.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, a Pac-10 umpire and Valley resident, is back home
after undergoing surgery last Saturday night as a result of
injuries suffered while working the Washington State-Illinois game.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, a college official for 20 years, was caught on both
sides by players, who rolled up on his legs. ``It was like a
sandwich, and I was the meat and the players were the bread,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, 59, underwent surgery that night to repair a broken
left hip and a damaged right knee.  &UR; Dr. Richard Donati,
Washington's team orthopedic surgeon, operated. McCullough remained
in a Pullman hospital until Thursday, and was visited daily by
Washington State athletic department officials. Coach  &UR; Mike Price
dropped by four times, McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors think McCullough will be fully recovered in six months,
and he expects to officiate next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against him. Two years ago, McCullough broke an ankle
in Pullman, but still walked through three airports making his way
home. The injury wasn't diagnosed until the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go back just to say thank you,'' McCullough said.
``Everything in Pullman is centered around family. Everyone around
me and everything I needed for my care has been first class.'' &QL; 
Seeing double &QL; 
There's a pretty good chance that  &UR; Ricky Williams, barring injury,
will lead the Big 12 in rushing this season. And also finish
second.
</P>
<P>
   Most college football fans know about Texas'  &UR; Ricky Williams,
who led the country in rushing and scoring last season. But not
nearly as many have heard of Texas Tech's  &UR; Ricky Williams, who
leads the nation in rushing after gaining 251 yards last week
against UTEP.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the name, they have little in common. Texas' Williams
is big (6-foot, 225 pounds) and a leading candidate for the Heisman
Trophy. Tech's Williams is small (5-7, 182 pounds) and labors in
relative obscurity in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guy is sort of used to being called the other Ricky
Williams,'' Texas Tech Coach  &UR; Spike Dykes said. ``But he doesn't
make much of it. He's so unselfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes thought his Williams looked a little out of shape last
week because the running back was breathing heavily. Dykes,
however, didn't realize Williams had carried the ball 41 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned something about conditioning and he said, `Yes,
sir. I'll run after practice.' That's the kind of kid he is.'' &QL;

IRL FANS WILL MISS STEWART  
 INDY PRODIGY IS HEADED TO NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By about this date next year at Phoenix International Raceway,
Tony Stewart fans could be experiencing painful withdrawal
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the Indy Racing League poster boy the past three
seasons, is leaving the circuit to pursue a NASCAR Winston Cup
career with car owner Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, Stewart is assuring his absence at next year's IRL
race at PIR. Stewart also may be a non-Copper World Classic entry
unless he lands a ride in the NASCAR Southwest Tour race.
</P>
<P>
   Should Stewart come up empty, his lone 1999 PIR appearance will
be reduced to next season's Nov. 7 Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the preliminary report is the only way I'd race is in
a Southwest Tour car,'' Stewart said Tuesday. ``I'd like to do
that. I've talked to Ken Schrader (in the past) about wanting to do
that. But I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be out there for sure, but I don't think I'll be
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart will be missed. He clearly is one of the sport's rising
stars, and even non-Stewart fans are reluctant to dismiss his many
talents inside a 200 mph race car.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart also is anxious to enter the next phase of his
driving career, a career that mostly involves stock cars, not Indy
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything we've wanted to do in the IRL, except
win the Indy 500,'' Stewart said. ``But I'm not going to give up on
that right now. Joe Gibbs' idea is to keep me going until I win
(the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy those cars, and it will be hard leaving (Team Menard).
I've got a good relationship. They're like family to me.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart already has developed a strong bond with Gibbs, who
knows a little bit about judging talent. Before Gibbs turned his
attention to the Winston Cup circuit, he coached three Washington
Redskins teams to Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Tony has a great future,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 27, refuses to think that far ahead, but few doubt he
one day will command a chapter in the sport's history book.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest hope is to try and make each race (next year),''
Stewart said. ``There's no way you can beat the experience you get
on the racetrack. That's why I want to try and make sure I'm not
going home on Saturday night instead of Sunday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs doesn't believe that will happen often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tony is the right mix for us,'' Gibbs said. ``We think
he has tremendous talent, and we think he will represent a company
in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a young guy, but we think he is somebody we can
build on. Hopefully, he's someone that will be very successful and
a star in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs also confirmed Stewart will be allowed to continue his
pursuit of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've agreed that Tony will run Indy,'' Gibbs said. ``We'll
fly him around that day, and he won't miss the (Winston Cup) race
(at Charlotte Motor Speedway). We feel like that's important for
him and his career, and that's something we talked about
originally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will continue to race in the Indianapolis 500. His other
racing we're going to curtail. He's going to do some IRL stuff, and
he's going to do Winston Cup. If he gets in something else, there
will be a fistfight.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so excited,'' he said. ``This is what I've
worked 19 years for. I've dedicated my whole life to auto racing. I
don't think I could pick a better situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, another driver labeled with star potential, is
looking forward to the Stewart addition. Gibbs hired the unproven
Labonte three years ago, and he's responded with his first seven
Winston Cup wins, two this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The added resources are going to be the first thing that
helps,'' said Labonte, fifth in the driver's standings behind
series leader Jeff Gordon. ``We're gong to gain on that because
newer stuff will come to the table. We'll have more ideas. More
heads are better than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as having a teammate at the track, the conversations
between the two drivers should help. As far as I'm concerned, it
needs to be that way. That's a benefit. Whether one's helping one
or one's helping the other, in most cases we're going to help each
other no matter what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart can hardly wait. &QL;

   One down. One to go.
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Chip Ganassi, who was facing the possible dilemma of
having to replace two drivers next season on the Championship Auto
Racing Teams circuit, took care of one party this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Ganassi, a former driver and now an owner for one of the most
successful teams in the series, re-signed Jimmy Vasser for three
more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is one of the most underrated drivers on the circuit,''
Ganassi said. ``His consistency record and his winning record speak
for themselves. I couldn't be happier to have Jimmy back on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the backbone of any team, and I'm delighted to have him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser was thought to be in consideration for the second seat on
the recently formed Formula One British American Racing team, whose
other driver is former CART champion Jacques Villeneuve. Vasser
admitted discussing the job with BAR officials, but in the end, he
chose to remain with Ganassi.
</P>
<P>
   It likely was a wise decision.
</P>
<P>
   With teammate Alex Zanardi, who clinched a second successive
CART championship last week, probably headed to the F-1 Williams
team, Vasser would unquestionably become ``numero uno'' on a team
favored to snatch a fourth straight CART crown in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnerships Chip has created with (sponsors) Target,
Honda and Firestone, and the people he has put together on this
team, made my decision pretty easy when I decided what was
important to me,'' said Vasser, the 1996 CART champion. ``Now that
I've made that decision, we have a task to try and finish one-two
this year and try to accomplish something next year which no team
has ever done, and that's win four championships in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   After three unspectacular seasons from through 1994, Vasser
signed with Ganassi in 1995 and finished eighth in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser won four races and the title the following season, then
finished third a year ago. With a strong showing over the remaining
four races this season, Vasser could finish as runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, 32, has won seven races in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi is expected to announce his decision within three weeks,
a team spokesman said Thursday. &QL;

GORDON, MARTIN CLEARED

   Tiregate is over. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Although NASCAR vice president of competition  &UR; Mike Helton on
Friday cleared Jeff Gordon's NASCAR Winston Cup team of tire
tampering, some drivers believe it remains a common practice along
pit road.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to  &UR; Geoff Bodine, who said before the independent test
results were announced that if Gordon's Hendrick Motorsports team
was soaking the tires with unauthorized chemicals, ``they wouldn't
be the only ones doing it. It's being done.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sterling Marlin agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from different people that (tire soaking) is going
on,'' Marlin said. ``We just don't know who.''
</P>
<P>
   But we at least know who isn't _ Gordon and  &UR; Mark Martin, whose
tires also were confiscated after a recent race at New Hampshire
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy boiled over at New Hampshire, when Gordon outran
Martin and other drivers late in the race after taking on only two
fresh tires while most most of his competition were fitted for four
during a late-race pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   Car owner  &UR; Jack Roush, whose five-car stable on the NASCAR
Winston Cup circuit includes Martin and  &UR; Jeff Burton, claimed
afterward Gordon may have been the recipient of chemically treated
tires, which when applied breaks down rubber and creates stronger
adhesion to the racing surface.
</P>
<P>
   So NASCAR officials, who maintain they already had planned to
impound tires belonging to Gordon and Martin because of growing
tire concerns, claimed the rubber and sent it to be analyzed by an
independent laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exhausted all known tests on the tires from the No. 24
(Gordon) and No. 6 (Martin) cars through an independent lab,''
Helton said. ``The tests have found nothing. This issue is
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush, however, likely won't be surprised by the results. He
said he's been told some tire softening substances are
undetectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received a signed letter with some tire softening material
from a reputable businessman that I have bought chemicals (camshaft
lubricants) from for the past 10 years,'' Roush said. ``The words
were my `competition is using this.' But it was not specific to
Jeff Gordon or any one competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been insinuations that I'm just a sore loser, that
I'm frustrated and that I'm just banging aimlessly out in space
with being defeated as many times as we have been,'' Roush said.
``And that hurts me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Freund, who is Goodyear Tire's lead engineer in the
stock-car division, said the confiscated tires were tested along
with other tires taken off the Goodyear truck at the New Hampshire
race.
</P>
<P>
   Again, ``nada.''
</P>
<P>
   Freund said any foreign agents added to the manufactured tires
would have been detected, and that if a tire softening agent was
present, it's unlikely it would last ``beyond a few laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon traveled 50 laps after taking on two tires at New
Hampshire. &QL; 
Motocross at BOB &QL; 
Bank One Ballpark will get its American Motorcyclist Association
Supercross Series baptism Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The popular stadium motocross series was staged the past two
seasons at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like there was always something going on at ASU,
whether it was basketball or a play or something else,'' supercross
series spokesman  &UR; Pat Schutte said. ``We think that affected our
walk-up crowd (last season).''
</P>
<P>
   Although last season's race at ASU attracted a hefty crowd of
50,225, it was down from 63,565 in 1997. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL;

NASCAR Winston Cup race Oct. 25 at Phoenix International Raceway.

HOFFMAN'S FUTURE UP IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Glenn Hoffman spoke to his new boss Kevin Malone on
Friday, but it will be some time before the current Los Angeles
Dodgers manager knows if he will keep his job or be reassigned to a
minor-league position.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, named executive vice president and general manager
during a news conference at Dodger Stadium, said he respects
Hoffman, who is 39-33 since taking over June 22 for fired manager
Bill Russell, but offered no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will in the next two weeks get a chance to spend some time
with Glenn, get to know him better, see what his managing talents
and abilities are,'' Malone said. ``I will gather information and
evaluate the situation and really look at where this organization
needs to go, what type of manager they need here and with the help
of everyone, we'll make the decision at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has received high marks from many in the organization,
most notably Tom Lasorda, who was bumped Friday from interim
general manager to senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn was brought into a tough situation and I think he has
brought dignity to job,'' Lasorda said. ``It could have gotten away
from him, but he had an idea what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, Hoffman is uncertain about the future.
Before Russell and general manager Fred Claire were fired, Hoffman
was the manager of Triple-A Albuquerque and minor-league field
coordinator under farm director Charlie Blaney.
</P>
<P>
   Malone might want to bring in his own guy. But if that happens,
Hoffman is expected to receive a position in the organization. He
likes the job he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 16 more games to play and I'll concentrate on that,''
Hoffman said. ``We've done some things here. But until the season
is over, there is no reason to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda update: Lasorda took the GM job on an interim basis
after Claire was fired. He made two big trades that brought
veterans for a chance to get back in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't, but Lasorda's pickups have performed well.
During the last home stand, Lasorda received a huge ovation, but
said Friday he knows it's time to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this job belongs to a younger man,'' said Lasorda, who
will stay on as a senior vice president. ``I'm handing the baton to
Kevin and wish him a great deal of success. I'll always be here if
he needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort throws: Right-hander Darren Dreifort, who skipped a
start due to a sore right shoulder, played catch for the first time
in several days and said his condition has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Charlie Hough, however, is not ready to put him
back in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he comes to me and says he's ready, I'd have to think about
it,'' Hough said. ``But I don't think he's close yet.''

ANGELS FALL TO ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Garret Anderson's leisurely trot to first base in
the third inning Friday night might have been acceptable in a beer
league softball game.
</P>
<P>
   But in a pennant race, Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins drew
the line.
</P>
<P>
   Collins yanked Anderson, one of his club's best hitters, from
the game one inning later, and the Angels went on to lose to the
Orioles 8-3 before 46,832 at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles right fielder Eric Davis homered and singled to drive in
five runs in support of starter Scott Erickson (15-11), who went
the distance to earn the victory over Angels starter Chuck Finley
(11-7).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels maintained a two-game lead in the
AL West because Texas also lost 3-2 to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Anderson's lack of hustle probably didn't cost the
Angels the game. But it obviously didn't sit well with Collins, who
is known for his intensity and expects the same from his players.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had already scored three runs in the third inning off
Erickson when Anderson came to the plate with runners on first and
second and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson bounced one back to Erickson, whose throw to first was
wild and pulled first baseman Rafael Palmeiro off the bag. But
because Anderson was loafing to first, Palmeiro had ample time to
go back and touch the base for the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't have to face Collins right away because the
inning was over and he took his spot in right field for the bottom
of the third. But in the fourth, Collins sent Orlando Palmeiro into
right field to take Anderson's place.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he was sending a message ``to everybody. (Anderson)
said he made a mistake, it won't happen again. I said I know it
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made no excuses and said he wasn't surprised about
being pulled from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he had to do, and that's what he did,'' Anderson
said. ``I told him I don't have an excuse, I messed up. One thing I
did do was cheat my team. I'm not going to sit here and cry about
it. I accept responsibility for my actions all the time on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley immediately surrendered the 3-0 lead after Anderson's
gaffe, as the Orioles scored four runs in the bottom of the third
on a three-run homer by Davis and a solo homer by Rafael Palmeiro.
Though Finley wouldn't blame Anderson for the sudden turn of
events, he did say the team got what it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got this far by hustling,'' said Finley, who gave up eight
runs and 10 hits in 52/3 innings. ``If you don't hustle, you pretty
much take what you get. We pride ourselves on that, grinding it out
and hustling. That's the character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he was surprised to see Anderson's lack of hustle,
especially in a pennant race, but Anderson will be in the lineup
today.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked good for the Angels early, as they put together
five consecutive hits with two outs in the third inning. Jim
Edmonds drove in two with a bases-loaded single, and Tim Salmon
beat out an infield roller to drive in a third run.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Anderson bounced one back to Erickson, ending the
inning and ending his night.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles opened the game up with four runs in the sixth
inning. All four runs were charged to Finley, but the final three
came in when reliever Mike Fetters allowed a two-run single to
Davis and an RBI single to Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Angels on this night was that the Rangers
lost, though that was little comfort to Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to allow myself to look over my shoulder,'' he
said. ``We should look out ahead of us. I don't care if they win
five or six games in a row. If we are worried about what Texas is
doing, we're not going to win. I hope nobody on this team is doing
that, because if you are, you've got your priorities in the wrong
direction.''

MALONE NAMED DODGERS GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Malone, who helped steal away Pedro Martinez
and Henry Rodriguez when he worked in Montreal, might have taken on
a bigger challenge Friday, when he was put in charge of bringing
the Los Angeles Dodgers back to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Already saddled with $53 million guaranteed to 12 players for
next season, Malone was named executive vice president and general
manager to reshape an organization rocked by the club's sale,
executive firings, big trades and general underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some definite work needed here, but I see a
championship not too far off,'' Malone said. ``I like our nucleus.
With a few additions and a few subtractions, I like our chances in
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, 41, has a background in scouting and player development
that began in the San San Fernando Valley in 1985 when he worked
with the Angels. He spent four years with Montreal (1991-95) when
the Expos acquired top Dodgers prospects Martinez and Rodriguez and
was Montreal GM for two seasons before working the past four years
as assistant GM in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   It was his experience with the Orioles that might help him most
in his new assignment. He watched GM Pat Gillick's team falter this
season despite a $71 million payroll. The Dodgers budget swelled to
$61 million with two blockbuster trades, including a seven-player
trade May 15 that sent franchise player Mike Piazza to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Baltimore the team lost sight of what was important _
winning,'' said Malone, who was given a four-year contract with a
club option for two more. ``People were not on the same page and
had their own agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like the team he has inherited in Los Angeles. The
Dodgers season was marked by power struggles in the front office
and power outages on the field. With 16 games to play entering
Friday's game with San Diego, the Dodgers were 75-72, trailing the
NL West-leading Padres by 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was selected over two other finalists, Cincinnati's GM
Jim Bowden, a favorite of interim GM Tom Lasorda, and former
Yankees GM Bob Watson, an African-American candidate being pushed
by National League president Leonard Coleman after winning a World
Series title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Florida GM Dave Dombrowski, the favorite of the Dodgers new
owners at Fox, removed himself from the search Tuesday night when
he agreed to a five-year, $5 million contract to remain with the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers were clearly pleased with the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, today is huge,'' said Dodgers shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, who played for Malone in Montreal. ``It just feels
like the start of a turnaround. Since I've been here we've needed
something to ignite the organization. This guy is great. Believe
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The year before Grudzielanek joined the Expos (1994), Malone
helped lead Montreal to the National League's best record (74-40),
six games ahead of Atlanta. But because of budget constraints, the
Expos had to let go of NL MVP Larry Walker and 1997 World Series
hero Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Several times during an afternoon news conference at Dodger
Stadium, Malone stressed the need to develop the Dodgers' farm
system. Rated fourth overall before the season by Baseball America,
several top prospects were traded, including Paul Konerko and
Dennis Reyes to Cincinnati and Wilton Guerrero and minor-leaguers
Peter Bergeron, Jon Tucker and Ted Lilly to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals were made by Lasorda, who was given the title of
senior vice president and will help Malone in an advisory capacity.
Lasorda received in return Grudzielanek, left-hander Carlos Perez
and closer Jeff Shaw. All have performed well, but the team has
not.
</P>
<P>
   There are several issues facing Malone when the season ends
Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   _A decision on the future of manager Glenn Hoffman, who took
over June 22 when Bill Russell was fired. Malone has received good
reports and the two share a background working in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   _Finding a way to keep Shaw, who saved his 42nd game Thursday
afternoon. Because Shaw was acquired during the middle of a
multi-year contract, he can demand a trade in the offseason. If it
is not granted a trade, he is eligible for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him a long time,'' said Malone, who signed Shaw in
Montreal in 1993. ``I know he likes living and playing in Ohio, but
I also know he wants to win, and I think his best chance is with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   _Finding a No. 1 starter to replace injured Ramon Martinez. The
leading free agents are San Diego's Kevin Brown and Houston's Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _What to do at shortstop. Jose Vizcaino, signed to a three-year,
$9.5 million contract before the season, has not played since June
21, when he severely sprained his left ankle. Grudzielanek has
played well, but is not as solid defensively as Vizcaino and is not
a natural No.2 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   _Deciding the future of Bobby Bonilla, who has two years and $12
million left on his contract. Bonilla was coming off two major
surgeries during the winter and did not play well.
</P>
<P>
   _Figuring who to put in right field _ Gary Sheffield, the team's
best player after coming over in the Piazza trade, or Raul Mondesi,
who has 30 homers but wants his old spot back after suffering wear
and tear in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an experienced baseball man, who has been a player, a
coach, a scout and a successful general manager,'' club president
Bob Graziano said. ``His knowledge of the game in addition to his
track record of building winning teams and strengthening his
scouting and minor-league departments will benefit our team for
many years to come.''

ANGELS GET JOHNSON FROM REDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Anaheim Angels added yet another new face to the
roster Friday, making a trade with the Cincinnati Reds for first
baseman Mark Johnson. The Reds will get a player to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played three seasons with the Pirates from 1995-97,
had just finished the season for Indianapolis, the Reds' Triple-A
team, when he learned of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was driving from Indianapolis to his home in Connecticut
with his wife, son and dog when his agent called him on his car
phone to tell him of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were 20 miles from Columbus, Ohio,'' said Johnson, who
joined the Angels in Baltimore on Friday. ``At least we were headed
in the right direction. It made the trip a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 30, hit .300 with 22 homers and 75 RBI for Indianapolis
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we didn't have ... with (Orlando) Palmeiro and
(Reggie) Williams we've got guys who get on base, but we didn't
have left-handed sock off the bench,'' manager Terry Collins said.
``And he's a pretty good first baseman, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Johnson is the fourth since the non-waiver
trading deadline passed on July 31. Since then the Angels have
obtained pitchers Jeff Juden and Mike Fetters, and outfielder/first
baseman Gregg Jefferies. The Angels announced that the player to be
announced in the Jefferies deal is pitcher Doug Nickle. Nickle went
a combined 11-8 for Single-A Lake Elsinore and Cedar Rapids this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill will pitch: Pitcher Ken Hill, who took a line drive off his
right (pitching) hand Wednesday night against the Twins, said he'll
make his next start Monday against Tampa Bay. Hill had to come out
of the game after Todd Walker's liner went toward Hill's head. Hill
reached up to protect himself and ended up bruising his thumb and
index and middle fingers when he deflected the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the ball coming back at you like that, it's scary,''
Hill said. ``A lot of balls have come through the box this year, a
lot of guys have got hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus sits: Third baseman Troy Glaus was not in the starting
lineup Friday for the second game in a row, only this time it
wasn't because his wrist was bothering him. Glaus felt a twinge in
his left wrist when swinging on Tuesday and sat out Wednesday's
game, but said Friday he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's doing what he thinks he has to do to help the team
win,'' Glaus said. ``I accept that. Granted, I'd rather be playing,
but that's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Shipley started in Glaus' place. Glaus has only one hit in
his past 18 at-bats, his average dipping to .219.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needed to step back and take a deep breath,'' Collins
said. ``We put a big load on him. And the last two games, Shipley
has really swung the bat good.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad progressing: First baseman Darin Erstad, out since Sept.
2 with a strained left hamstring, did some light running Friday and

SABERHAGEN HAS UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the most rewarding of times and the most frustrating
of times for Bret Saberhagen. He has made a successful comeback as
a starting pitcher for the Red Sox, but there is a feeling of
incompleteness.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his first full season back after shoulder
reconstruction, Saberhagen made his 28th start Friday night at
Fenway Park as the Red Sox took a 6-2 victory over Detroit. For the
28th time, he failed to finish. But he started effectively enough
to earn his 13th victory and give the Red Sox some confidence after
six losses in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to finish what I start,'' Saberhagen said. ``I don't
like leaving things for chance. When there are still six or seven
outs left, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much occurred after Saberhagen departed with a 6-0 lead
after six innings, though the Tigers doubled their hit total in the
final three innings and scored twice in the eighth. That might have
been enough to get on Saberhagen's nerves, but he seemed relieved
to have earned only his second victory since July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going back out for the seventh,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. ``But they made a couple of pitching changes and the time
frame changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen has pitched as many as seven innings only six times
this season and has not lasted that long since a 7-2 win at Anaheim
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to have the ball as long as possible,'' Saberhagen
said. ``But now is not the time to be changing things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give Jimy credit for the way he has used me. My
shoulder is feeling very good, knock on wood. It's feeling strong.
I wanted to go back out for the seventh and Jimy wanted me to go
back out. But then he told me, `We've worked this all year long and
kept you healthy. I'd rather you not go back out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that was all the arm-twisting Saberhagen needed to
take another early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Though Saberhagen has been consistently effective, this was only
his second no-run outing of the season and first since a 2-0
victory over Cleveland April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Is he seeking at least one shutout?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, yeah; teamwise, no,'' Saberhagen said. ``It would
have been great. But there is still the postseason, and it'll come.
Next year I'll be stronger. I've been babied at times this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are not certain. Nor is the health of Saberhagen's
shoulder. But he has found a way to recast himself as a short-stint
pitcher and he has found a team that needs him.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen set the tone Friday night, working efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I'd rather give up a hit than a walk,''
Saberhagen said. ``I've always been blessed with control. I don't
think you can teach it. But a big part of control is mechanics, and
mine are good right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm feeling good, I feel I can take control of a game. We
needed to win in the worst way because the team has been
struggling. But this is what I play for _ the postseason. I still
feel I can pitch competitively with the best guys in the league,
and tonight was a night to show I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go into the postseason on a good note. If we go 9-8
in our last 17 games, that means Toronto can only afford to lose
three games. I've got three games left, and Pedro (Martinez), Wake
(Tim Wakefield), and Ave (Steve Avery) feel like they are going to
win every time. I like our chances.''

DODGERS DON'T MAKE IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Malone was expected to spend his first day as
the Los Angeles Dodgers general manager flying back to Baltimore to
clean out his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he came to Qualcomm Stadium to inspect the mess at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, named to the position Friday afternoon in Los Angeles,
drove to his hometown and saw much more than a 1-0 loss to the San
Diego Padres in front of a crowd of 32,830.
</P>
<P>
   Malone witnessed hardluck left-hander Brian Bohanon fall behind
after the first two batters of the game and suffer his third loss
without a victory in his past five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon is a free agent at the end of the season and Malone will
have to decide if the team wants to offer a multi-year contract or
let him test a pitching-thin market.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also saw an offense that had no answer for Joey Hamilton,
who scattered six hits in eight innings before giving way to Trevor
Hoffman, who picked up his 48th save.
</P>
<P>
   Malone knew it was too late to ask Hoffman's brother, Glenn, the
Dodgers manager, to ask the kid to play nice. He also knows there
is a lot of work ahead in rebuilding the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I honestly see light at the end of this tunnel,'' said
Malone, who was the assistant GM with the Orioles before taking the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in the winter, but not now. The only light is at the end
of the season, which has 15 games to go. Then he can start to
decide the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the NL West-leading Padres, the future is now. The victory
was their 93rd this season, setting a franchise record. They set
another mark by winning their 51st game at home. All that adds up
to an 18-game lead over the Dodgers, who came in with three
consecutive victories and seven wins in their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance to tie the game in the ninth after
Hoffman struck out Raul Mondesi and Jim Eisenreich to open the
inning. Mark Grudzielanek singled, took second on a wild pitch and
stole third. But Charles Johnson popped to second to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today didn't really seem different to me,'' Mondesi said.
``(Malone) is not the guy who is going to turn it around. We have
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the way Hamilton pitched, it is hard to believe he lost six
consecutive starts from May 7 to June 8. One reason is the Padres
have scored three or fewer runs in 19 of his 31 starts. But during
that stretch, Hamilton gave up 25 earned runs in 382/3 innings. He
also had 26 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was 9-4 over his next nine starts, forcing the Padres
to pull him off the market when they were considering trading for
left-hander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a chance the Padres could meet Johnson, who is with
Houston, in the playoffs. The Astros have the league's best record
(95-53) followed by Atlanta (94-54).
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wasn't as sharp as Bohanon, who allowed just two
batters to reach third after the first inning. But Hamilton got
Eric Young to ground into an inning-ending double play in the
fourth after walking Bohanon to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Trenidad Hubbard reached on a drag bunt to second
but was thrown out attempting to steal. Hamilton then caught Eric
Karros looking at a third strike and retired Bobby Bonilla on a fly
ball to center before calling it a night.
</P>
<P>
   For Bohanon (6-10), it was his fifth start without a victory. He
was coming off his poorest outing of the season, but also had two
certain victories taken away when closer Jeff Shaw allowed
late-inning home runs.

   CLINTON-MOOD (Washington) _ A day as ominous as it was
extraordinary took a jagged tangent Friday as the House finished
its furiously partisan face-off on the question of impeaching
President Clinton. Instantly, the capital's focus, like the
nation's, shifted to a long salacious journey down the information
highway. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REPORT-ASSESS (Washington) _ This is a document with
attitude. It serves up a worst-case scenario: conversations that
some might find inconclusive, ambiguous, or at worst suggestive,

secretary, in the period surrounding Clinton's deposition in the

   CLINTON-ESSAY (Undated) _ It was a surreal and unnerving
spectacle sadly translated from the world of tabloid television to
the world of governance: the White House issuing a press release
Friday about the nature of President Clinton's sexual activities, a

Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VERNON (Washington) _ Friday's voluminous report makes
no assertions about whether Vernon Jordan is guilty of any criminal
wrongdoing. But it paints a portrait of him as a central player
swept up in the Lewinsky melodrama, serving as a go-between, a
one-man employment agency and an emotional bedrock for a distraught
young woman. By David Firestone.

   CLINTON-STREET (Chicago) _ Most Americans were at work Friday
afternoon when the graphic descriptions of President Clinton's
sexual relationship with a former White House intern began

talk in offices became a surreal mix of fraternity house jocularity
and serious discussion over whether an American president would be
forced to resign. By Dirk Johnson.

   ASIA-STOCK-CURBS (Hong Kong) _ When Hong Kong and Malaysia
placed curbs on their stock markets last week, the outcry from
foreign investors was immediate and indignant. The governments were
committing heresy, these critics said, by turning their backs on
the free market in the search for a quick economic fix. But Hong
Kong and Malaysia are not playing to an international audience.
They are struggling to ease the pain of a punishing economic

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Beijing) _ To halt the invasion of a
devastating insect pest, the United States said it would ban the
import of all Chinese goods shipped in raw wood packing material, a
move that is likely to strain China's economy _ as well as
U.S.-China relations. Officials said wooden crates and pallets used
to ship Chinese goods to North America sometimes harbor the comely
but voracious Asian longhorn beetle, which has killed trees in five
locations around New York and Chicago in the past year. The ban is
likely to result in delays or higher costs for a third to half of

   WASHINGTON _ In a scathing report released Friday, the
Whitewater independent counsel built a case for impeachment of
President Clinton on an avalanche of salacious details of an affair
with Monica Lewinsky and the Nixon-era concept of abuse of
presidential power in using aides to cover up the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, which the House of Representatives published to
the world, the counsel, Kenneth Starr, said the president violated
his oath of office with repeated acts of perjury and obstruction of
justice. He also described in intimate detail Ms. Lewinsky's
account of her many meetings with the president, including 10
sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The House must now judge whether Starr has presented a
compelling case for the impeachment of the president. There is so
much material in the report about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, and so much contradictory testimony from the president
and his defenders, that it will take weeks to gauge the power of
Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House angrily responded that the Starr report was a
lurid and politically motivated attempt ``intended to humiliate the
president and force him from office.'' Clinton's lawyers said that
Starr and his team of prosecutors had, after four years of intense
investigative labor, found ``personal, not impeachable'' misconduct
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Starr's relentlessly accusatory 445-page report
riveted Washington and permanently changed the terms of the debate
over Clinton's fitness for office. Friday, some members of Congress
reacted with outrage, and some with revulsion, at the report's
torrent of embarrassing details about Clinton's sexual relationship
with a woman less than half his age just outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which authorized the release of the report on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote Friday afternoon, will soon begin
deliberations that could lead to the second presidential
impeachment hearings of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counts of possible impeachable offenses against Clinton _
all of which arose from his liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and not from
Whitewater and other matters Starr has investigated _ echo two of
the articles of impeachment voted against President Richard M.
Nixon in 1974. Nixon was found by the House Judiciary Committee to
have obstructed justice and abused the power of his office in
trying to cover up the Watergate break-in and related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains allegations of crimes for which Clinton
could face criminal prosecution if he leaves office through
resignation or impeachment. Some prosecutors in Starr's office want
to keep the federal grand jury here in operation for another year
to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes in graphic detail several of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in areas around the Oval Office
and provides a narrative of Clinton's prolonged efforts to impede
the independent counsel's inquiry and to persuade others to assist
in a conspiracy to ``hinder, impede and deflect'' investigations by
a federal grand jury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides a seamy account of an illicit relationship
between the president of the United States and an unpaid
22-year-old intern and the lengths to which he went to conceal it
from his family, his staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a wealth of new details, from the origin of Clinton's
decision to try to thwart Starr's inquiry, in a discussion with his
political adviser, Dick Morris, to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's determination that a semen stain on a blue dress
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky came from the president. The odds of the
semen having come from someone other than Clinton, the FBI
reported, are 1 in nearly 8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserts that Clinton decided upon a strategy of
stonewalling the investigation the same day his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky was made public, Jan. 21. That evening Morris, who had
been dismissed from Clinton's campaign in 1996 for a sexual affair,
called the president and said, ``You poor son of a bitch. I've just
read what's going on.'' But that evening Morris also told Clinton
that an instant poll had shown that the American people would be
willing to forgive adultery, but not perjury or obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told the president, who that day had denied having a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, that confessing the full
details of the affair was therefore not an option. According to
Morris's grand jury testimony, the president replied, ``Well, we
just have to win, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a tearful confessional at a White House prayer
breakfast Friday, acknowledged that he had ``sinned'' in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and apologized for the first time to
her and her family. But he vowed a vigorous defense against Starr's
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in the first volley of its counterattack the
Starr report, issued a combative 78-page rebuttal Friday afternoon
even before officials had read the report.

</P>
<P>
   The response, written by David Kendall, the president's private
attorney, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff, said that the
independent counsel was trying to drive the president from office
for a sexual indiscretion for which he had already apologized. The
lawyers denied that Clinton had committed any of the other crimes
listed by the prosecutor and asserted that none of the president's
actions constituted impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said Starr had ``dangerously overreached
to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is
not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their response admitted that Clinton had given incomplete and
misleading answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit in
January and again before a federal grand jury in August. But they
denied that those statements constituted perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report's strongest sections describe the sexual
activity between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton and Clinton's repeated
misrepresentations about it under oath. The document's authors said
Clinton's evasiveness before the federal grand jury forced them to
include the salacious details about the sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
president's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report stated. ``The details associated
with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The president's
testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with
respect to those two grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted to some forms of sexual conduct with her, he specifically
denied other forms. Those statements are the basis of the
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, Clinton's lawyers said that answers to
ambiguous questions can never be perjury. And, they said, ``nobody
can be convicted of perjury based on only one other person's
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses the president and Ms. Lewinsky of agreeing to
concoct ``cover stories'' to keep their relationship a secret.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 29, 1997, sexual encounter with Ms. Lewinsky, the
president told her that ``he suspected that a foreign embassy (he
did not specify which one) was tapping his telephones, and he
proposed cover stories. If ever questioned, she should say that the
two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked about their
phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were being
monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on,''
according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied her account in his grand jury testimony.
The prosecutors wrote that Ms. Lewinsky's account was corroborated
by contemporaneous discussions she had with 11 people, including
eight friends, two psychological counselors and her mother, Marcia
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sections alleging abuse of power and witness tampering appear
less conclusive. The single accusation of witness tampering arose
from discussions Clinton had with his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, immediately after his deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Prosecutors believe that Clinton tried to influence her
testimony with a series of leading questions, but Mrs. Currie's
testimony on several key points was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also accused the president of abusing his
office by lying repeatedly to the public and in court proceedings.
The charge also includes the president's repeated refusal to
volunarily testify before the grand jury and his invocation of
executive privilege to block testimony by key aides. Clinton
ultimately testified after he was subpoenaed and the president's
privilege claims were denied by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers rejected that argument, saying, ``If
allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime, then any
number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office for
as long as they fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any
allegation about their activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report cited 11 specific possible grounds for
impeachment in four categories: Five counts of lying under oath,
four counts of obstruction of justice, one count of witness
tampering and one count of abuse of constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by several assistants in Starr's office, is
methodical and exhaustive. When confronted by conflicting accounts,
it tends to accept the version most damaging to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being subpoenaed in July,'' the report says in one
summary passage describing what it called a pattern of perjury by
Clinton, ``the president made false statements to the grand jury on
Aug. 17, 1998. That night, the president again made false
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his
answers in his civil deposition had been `legally accurate.' The
president then made an implicit plea for Congress to take no
action: `Our country has been distracted by this matter for too
long.'''
</P>
<P>
   The authors then place the blame squarely on the president for
the slow pace of the investigation. ``The president has pursued a
strategy of deceiving the American people and Congress in January
1998, delaying and impeding the criminal investigation for seven
months, and deceiving the American people and Congress again in
August 1998.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most damaging portion of the report, Starr's
prosecutors say that Clinton lied under oath five times, both in
the Paula Jones deposition and in his grand jury testimony last
month, when he denied that he had had ``a sexual affair, a sexual
relationship or sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the president's response to lying under
oath rests on his own narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' _
``namely, that it requires sexual intercourse, no matter how
extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the president,'' the report says, ``a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified in much detail about ``substantial sexual
activity'' that she said she engaged in with Clinton, on 10
separate days in hallways, bathrooms and the president's private
study, from Nov. 15, 1995, to Dec. 28, 1997. She said that Clinton
made direct contact with her breasts and genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   The report also related how in his grand jury testimony, Clinton
maintained that oral sex was not sex within the list of contacts
used in his deposition in the Jones case. ``If the deponent is the
person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is with
_ not with anything on that list, but with the lips of another
person. It seems to be self-evident that that's what it is. ... Let
me remind you, sir, I read this carefuly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report added, ``In the president's view, `any person,
reasonable person' wouild recognize that oral sex performed on the
deponent falls outside the definition.'' But Clinton refused to
answer whether Ms. Lewinsky had performed oral sex on him,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   To corroborate her statements, prosecutors point to her own
testimony, and statements she made to 11 people. They also quote a
draft letter, gleaned from Ms. Lewinsky's home computer, in which
Ms. Lewinsky describes an incident in her relationship with the
president where she refers to ``watching your mouth on my breast''
and refers imiplicity to direct contact with her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president's ``hands-off policy''
suggests some kind of ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the grand jury, Clinton was denied that he had sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky ``and said, in effect, that Monica
Lewinsky was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,'' he
testifed before the grand jury from the White House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked, ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, touching her genitalia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, in two separate documents, there was a dispute
between the White House and Starr about fundamental facts of the
relationship. In its 78-page rebuttal, the White House wrote that
the relationship began in early 1996 and in one incident in early
1997. But in the report, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky testified
that their intimate relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, during the
Government shutdown when they engaged in oral sex while the
president spoke on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive for the president to make a false statement about
the date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have
been that the president was unwilling to admit sexual activity with
a young 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office area.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also accuses Clinton of lying under oath when he testified
he could not recall instances when he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone
on numerous occasions with the president inside the Oval Office,
the president's private study, the private bathroom across from the
study and the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to the
private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's prosecutors have other witnesses who testified that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together, including Betty
Currie, the president's secretary, six Secret Service agents and a
White House steward, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice portion of the report, prosecutors
say that Clinton took an active role in trying to hide his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers and later
from Starr's investigators by concealing gifts they exchanged,
which had been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An effort to obstruct justice by withholding the truth from
the legal process _ whether by lying under oath, concealing
documents, or improperly influencing a witness's testimony _ is a
federal crime,'' prosecutors wrote. ``There is substantial and
credible information that Clinton engaged in such efforts to
prevent the truth of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from
being revealed in the Jones case.''
</P>
<P>
   The report charges Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky with devising
``cover stories'' to conceal their relationship. When Ms. Lewinsky
spoke about how to answer questions about why she was transferred
out of the White House, Clinton told her, ``You could always say
that the people in Legislative Affairs got it for you or helped you
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also accuses the president of taking a far more active role
in trying to persuade Ms. Lewinsky to deny she had a relationship
with him in a sworn affidavit to be filed in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said, ``I hoped that this
relationship would never become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Starr's prosecutors advance a motive for steps that the
president took to keep it quiet. They said that after the Supreme
Court's unanimous decision on May 27, 1997, to order the Jones case
to go forward, there was added risk to the president in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky being found out.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses Clinton of obstructing justice by suggesting
that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit denying that he had a
relationship so she would not be deposed by the Jones lawyers.

FOX EXEC'S ROSE-COLORED GLASSES ARE FOGGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes headline) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peter Chernin, right-hand man to Rupert Murdoch,
catches as many Los Angeles Dodgers games as he can, maybe three a
week when he and the team are in town. He sits not in the
ivory-tower owner's box but in the stands behind the dugout and he
hears what the customers are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin listens to sports-talk radio and reads the letters to
the sports editor. So he ought to know what Dodgers fans are
thinking as the first season under Fox Group ownership winds down,
down, down.
</P>
<P>
   Does he?
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans, you be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks you've been ``extremely supportive'' of the new
management.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks you realize the Dodgers would be wild-card playoff
contenders, if not actual championship contenders, but for the
impact of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks you believe the ``long term'' is what's important and
that the club is better fixed in that regard now than it was before
the turmoil of spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks replacing Dodger Stadium is a bitter pill we might
all have to swallow if a new ballpark with all the money-making
amenities would help the ``economically disadvantaged'' club afford
its ``primary obligation'' _ winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the place,'' he said on that last point, but his
reassurances are not reassuring. ``We're struggling a little bit
with some of the economic issues. Hopefully we can find a way to
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chernin is a smart man, a captain of the movie industry,
earnest and personable as he chats in the Stadium Club following
the introduction of Kevin Malone as the Dodgers' new general
manager Friday afternoon. He doesn't seem like the sort of
executive prone to self-deception.
</P>
<P>
   So it must be that he's afflicted with selective hearing loss
and his little Hollywood eyeglasses need cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chernin's account of what he hears and reads _ and maybe
he's speaking for Murdoch and left-hand man Chase Carey, too _
underestimates the challenge Fox faces in trying to repair public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are astride the .500 mark, as secure in their seat
as a rag doll on a bucking bronco, and I haven't met a fan who
thinks they're closer to championship caliber now than they were
when Fox took over in February, promising stability before
dispatching Mike Piazza, Paul Konerko, Bill Russell, Fred Claire
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a frustrating season,'' Chernin said. ``On the
other hand, we bought this for the long term. You can't assume
things are going to go right at the beginning. I think they (the
Dodgers front office) have tried really hard, and think more than
anything they've been affected by injuries. I feel pretty good
about most of the moves that were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope more than anything the fans feel like the team is
trying, that there was never a time when the organization wasn't
trying to move forward. And that's what I feel like, that we were
trying to make improvements and get new players and, though I don't
know if we would have won the division, I think we would have been
in contention for a wild card if we didn't have all those
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I actually feel that the fans _ and maybe this is
wishful thinking _ have been extremely supportive, that the
majority of the fans are supportive of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``I think the fans have been very supportive (during)
what's been a disappointing year for everybody, because they at
least recognize we've done everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Regrets? ``I regret we're 17 games out of first place today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe today it starts to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   The replacing of ``interim'' general manager Tom Lasorda with
Malone, the first Dodgers GM from outside the fold since Branch
Rickey in the 1940s, is an example of the new management machine
working well. Malone, 41, proved he's a franchise builder in the
same job with the Montreal Expos, and is a sharp talent evaluator
who honed his instincts as an Angels scout while living in the San
Fernando Valley in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wants to rebuild the Dodgers' tradition from the farm
level up, and expresses ``love'' for the old idea of Dodgers
``family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's still that way,'' Malone said. ``I guess
I'll find out in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, it isn't the O'Malley family anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At the June press conference to introduce Lasorda and manager
Glenn Hoffman, neither Chernin nor Carey attended and former owner
Peter O'Malley spoke as much as club president Bob Graziano.
O'Malley was there to provide benediction and soothe the
traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's press conference, Chernin sat alongside Malone,
Lasorda, Graziano, and O'Malley _ and everybody spoke except
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Fox family now without apology. Peter Chernin evidently
believes Fox's word is good enough for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is it?
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She called him ``Big Guy'' and smuggled presents
and notes to him in the Oval Office. He told her that she made him
feel young and that he loved her energy and smile.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship that Monica Lewinsky described to the grand
jury convened by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
began with furtive Oval Office kisses and sexual encounters but
deepened into something that, at least to her, was deeply
emotional. ``I never expected to fall in love with the president,''
she testified, ``I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told prosecutors a different story. He said a
relationship that began as a friendship became inappropriately
intimate. ``I never should have started it,'' he testified. He said
he was deeply torn about their dealings, to the point that in
describing one of their encounters, he said he ``was sick after it
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after a long narrative that depicts their relationship
in graphic detail, Starr's report to the House sheds little light
on the central mystery at the heart of the sex and perjury
investigation that has engulfed Clinton for the last eight months:
Why would the most powerful man in the world risk such a dangerous
liaison _ under the noses of Secret Service agents and staff
members _with a 21-year-old woman wearing the pink pass of a White
House intern around her neck?
</P>
<P>
   Often in her own words and with amazingly detailed recollections
for dates and atmospherics, Ms. Lewinsky emerges from these pages
as being aggressive, needy, besotted and demanding to the point of
becoming extortionate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Lewinsky initiated the relationship in the fall
of 1995, she said, during the shutdown of the federal government,
with ``intense flirting.'' She lifted her jacket to give him a
glimpse of her thong underwear. Within minutes they were kissing in
an area near the Oval Office, she testified, and she swiftly began
performing oral sex on him.
</P>
<P>
   By their third sexual rendezvous, she worried that he did not
remember her name. ``Is this just about sex?'' she asked him, ``or
do you have some interest in trying to get to know me as a
person?'' The president laughed, Ms. Lewinsky told investigators,
and said that ``he cherishes the time'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left that day, he ``recited both my home number
and my office number off the top of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   On another day, Ms. Lewinsky said, he suddenly kissed her.
``This was another one of those occasions when I was babbling on
about something, and he just kissed me, kind of to shut me up, I
think,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   But still, it was not until they had had some form of sex for
the sixth time, and she was counting, that the two of the them had
their first ``lengthy and personal conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her insecurities in those early days were seemingly offset by
the calculating way in which she would later play the president's
affection to her advantage, according to her testimony. Long after
their brief interludes began, she wrote the president a letter
threatening to disclose their relationship and pressed him hard for
help getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerges from the report in equally contradictory ways.
Ms. Lewinsky sensed early on that he felt it was wrong to be
involved with an intern. He broke off the relationship twice, only
to resume sexual relations with her. Until 1997, toward the end of
the relationship, he did not let her bring him to climax, telling
her, at one point, that he did not trust her enough. And, after
another encounter in which Ms. Lewinsky said the president soiled
her dress, he said he felt sick.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions given by Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky of their
relationship conflict in important ways. Ms. Lewinsky said it began
in November 1995 while she was an intern and included 10 sexual
encounters, eight of which occurred while she was working at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his testimony and in a 73-page rebuttal to Starr's
report released by the White House Friday, said the relationship
began later and was less extensive. The rebuttal emphasized that it
was Clinton who broke off their sporadic encounters in early 1997
``because he knew they were wrong.'' Another supporter of the
president, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, his pastor at Foundry United
Methodist Church in Washington, has also said that the president
broke off the relationship and began privately seeking forgiveness
before it became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the relationship in Starr's report is based
mostly on Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, given under a grant
of immunity from prosecution. It is also based on the testimony and
tapes of Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's former friend, in whom Ms.
Lewinsky confided many details about her encounters with the
president. Several friends of Ms. Lewinsky's and members of her
family testified before the grand jury, and their accounts of
conversations with her about the president also are excerpted in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people, including a therapist, about
her sexual encounters with the president ``as they occurred,'' the
report said. She also put together an 11-page chart for Starr's
team of prosecutors listing each encounter and phone call from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is also traced to other evidence, such as Ms.
Lewinsky's now infamous Gap dress which the report said is stained
with DNA material that matches the president, and with phone logs
that confirm some of Ms. Lewinsky's recollections.
</P>
<P>
   She and the president contradict each other over the degree of
intimacy they expressed toward each other, too. He did touch her
breasts and genitalia, she testified. Clinton steadfastly has
denied touching her; Starr's report insists that the president's
denials amount to lying under oath in the Paula Jones case.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that her physical relationship with the
president included oral sex but not sexual intercourse. According
to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the president; he never
performed oral sex on her.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Ms. Lewinsky grew emotionally attached to Clinton. At
times, she believed that he loved her too. They were physically
affectionate: ``A lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes,'' she
testified. ``He always used to push the hair out of my face.'' She
called him ``Handsome.'' On occasion, he called her ``Sweetie,''
``Baby,'' or sometimes ``Dear.'' He told her that he enjoyed
talking to her _ she recalled his saying that the two of them were
``emotive and full of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, their relationship remained oddly constrained,
frustrating Ms. Lewinsky after both she and the president had
stimulated each other to sexual climax. She wanted to have sexual
intercourse with him and sent him a note telling him so after
seeing the the movie, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky felt demeaned by some of their encounters, she
testified. Several times, the president talked on the phone to
congressmen and others while she performed oral sex on him. During
one of those calls, she said, the president exposed himself to
signal to her that he wanted sex.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the president seemed reluctant to reach a climax while
she was performing oral sex, sometimes pushing her away. On the day
that he stained her dress with his semen, he had interrupted her
and tried to stop her, Ms. Lewinsky testified that the president
hugged her and said ``he didn't want to get addicted to me, and he
didn't want me to get addicted to him.``
</P>
<P>
   In these descriptions, the relationship between the president
and Ms. Lewinsky seems to veer away from affectionate sexual romps
to the border of strangeness, including an incident where the
president used a cigar as a sexual aid.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the couple had 50 phone calls, and that on 10 to
15 occasions, they had phone sex. In one of the phone-sex
encounters, the president fell asleep during the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes the myriad ways the president and Ms.
Lewinsky tried to hide their relationship, by concocting ``cover
stories'' for her frequent visits to the Oval Office, and by having
their sexual encounters in the windowless hallway outside the
study. Ms. Lewinsky often pretended she was taking papers into the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that he suggested a cover story if their phone
conversations were intercepted. During one of their last encounters
in 1997, Ms. Lewinsky said the president told her ``that he
suspected a foreign embassy (he did not specify which one) was
tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories,'' the report
says Ms. Lewinsky testified. ``If ever questioned, she should say
that the two of them were just friends,'' the report continues.
``If anyone ever asked about their phone sex, she should say that
she knew their calls were being monitored all along, and the phone
sex was just a put-on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last months of their relationship, in 1997, Ms. Lewinsky
grew frustrated, desperate and angry. The report says that Secret
Service officers and agents testified that they saw Ms. Lewinsky
and the president alone in the Oval Office on several occasions.
One officer complained to Evelyn Lieberman, the deputy chief of
staff for operations about her being a nuisance. Ms. Lieberman
chided Ms. Lewinsky her being in the West Wing, and later testified
that she considered Ms. Lewinsky ``a clutch,'' that is, a person
who was ``always someplace she shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, White House officials arranged for Ms. Lewinsky
to get another job in the administration, the report says. Upon
hearing of her dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky ``burst into tears,'' the
report says, and asked to stay in the White House. ``She felt that
she was being transferred simply because of her relationship with
the president,'' the report says. ``I was never going to see the
president again,'' she said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 7, 1996, Easter Sunday, a week after the death of
Ron Brown, the secretary of commerce, the president called Ms.
Lewinsky at home, and they arranged for her to come to the White
House later that day.
</P>
<P>
   When she visited him, the president promised to bring Ms.
Lewinsky back to the White House if he won re-election that
November, the report says. They had sex following that
conversation, during which Clinton talked to his consultant, Dick
Morris, by phone.
</P>
<P>
   They were also interrupted by Harold Ickes, the deputy chief of
staff, who shouted `Mr. President' from outside the office, Ms.
Lewinsky testified. She was able to scurry away through the dining
room door.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, 1997, the president broke off the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky wept. She told prosecutors that the president told
her that he had had hundreds of affairs but since turning 40, he
had tried to be faithful to his wife. Most of his encounters with
Ms. Lewinsky took place when Hillary Rodham Clinton was out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lewinsky pressed to see the president and kept in
contact. She believed she had been promised her White House job
back after the 1996 elections, and said she was very upset when she
was not transferred back. On July 3, 1997, she wrote an angry
letter to the president asking for her old job and suggesting that
she would otherwise have to give some kind of explanation to her
parents. She told the grand jury that the letter was intended to
remind the president that she had ``left the White House like a
good girl in April of '96, not threatening disclosure in order to
retain the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Independence Day, the president angrily scolded
her, telling her ``it's illegal to threaten the president of the
United States,'' she testified. She began crying, saying the
president was not acting like a friend, and the two hugged. In a
kinder voice, he told her he wished he had more time for her, she
said. This fanned her fantasies that they would one day be
together. ``And he said, well, I don't know, I might be alone in
three years, And then I said something about ... us sort of being
together ... And he jokingly said, `Well, what are we going to do
when I'm 75 and I have to pee 25 times a day.' And ... I told him
that we'd deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also became jealous. She quizzed the president
after she learned of a press inquiry about the president's
relationship with a former White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey.
``The president responded that the harassment allegation was
ludicrous, because he would never approach a small-breasted
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Through Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, Ms. Lewinsky arranged
to bring him a birthday gift on Aug. 16. She tried to perform oral
sex on him, but the President rebuffed her. Ms. Lewinsky said he
told her, ``I'm trying not to do this and I'm trying to be good.''
There were no more sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jones case causing new problems, Ms. Lewinsky made
plans to find a job in New York in late 1997, and began pressuring
the president for help. At this point, he grew angry and worried
about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Blumenthal, a White House communications adviser who was
summoned before Starr's grand jury said the president had told him
that Ms. Lewinsky had ``threatened him. She said that she would
tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker
among her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or
said she had an affair then she wouldn't be a stalker any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky wrote a series of desperate notes to the president.
After pleading for a meeting and upset over her inability to get in
touch with him, she wrote: ``Please do not do this to me. I feel
disposable, used and insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   By December, Vernon Jordan had been enlisted to help Ms.
Lewinsky on her job search. On Dec. 11, Ms. Lewinsky told Jordan
that she sometimes got angry at Clinton when he did not call her or
see her enough. Jordan responded that she should take her
frustrations out on him, rather than the president, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan told her, ``You're in love,
that's what your problem is.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: A few people that I work with use the
company's e-mail to send all sorts of tasteless jokes to many of us
within the company. I mentioned this to our manager and he said he
would look into it, but nothing has changed. Is there anything that
can be done? F.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It sounds like all that your manager did was to
literally look into this problem. He looked in, saw what was going
on, and then looked the other way. This is a very short-sighted
approach to a potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that e-mail at work is the company's property and
responsibility. It is essential that a company's e-mail be used
only for business purposes. If there are offensive materials going
back and forth via e-mail, the company may actually have
potentially costly exposure.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of employers are implementing policies that
spell this out in no uncertain terms, formally advising employees
that they are subject to severe discipline, including termination,
for violations of the company's e-mail policy.
</P>
<P>
   The best step at this point is to recognize that this situation
is an opportunity for you. Tell your manager that you have found a
potentially costly problem associated with the company's e-mail.
You can even suggest a basic policy that prohibits the use of the
company's e-mail for anything but business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   If your manager continues to look away from this matter, it
would appear that this entire e-mail situation is sending you a
more important message about the company itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager claims that she has studied body language, and she
believes that mine keeps saying I am not happy with the job. That
is not true, and I have told her that, but she persists. How do I
deal with her? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like the only thing that is making you unhappy with
your job is your manager's obsession with body language. In a word,
it is ridiculous for her to be drawing any conclusions about your
attitude from body language, unless such behaviors are truly
blatant, such as constant frowns, shaking your fist, glaring at
co-workers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   When people start trying to interpret the more subtle body
movements, the interpretations rapidly become guesswork, often
couched in pseudo-scientific language. Interpreting body language
at work becomes even more questionable in this age of diversity,
where ethnic and cultural factors clearly influence physical
behavior. For example, looking a person in the eye has totally
different meanings in different cultures. For your manager, there
will be one knee-jerk interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   If your manager is truly interested in understanding your
feelings toward the job, she should talk to you about them, and,
importantly, look at your performance. When a manager starts to
rely on body language to assess employee attitudes, all you can do
is shake your head.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager was scheduled to accompany me to a sales meeting
with one of our customers. In the past, we have always used his
car. This time, he asked me if I would drive. I was glad to do it,
but my car was a total mess from the weekend with the kids, and I
did not have time to clean it up. I explained this to him, but he
is very meticulous, and I think his opinion of me has slipped. What
do you think I should do? A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Continue your drive toward sales success and do not look
back. Unless your manager got out of the car with a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich stuck to his pants and a melted candy bar on his
shirt, this is a situation that calls for no other attention.
</P>
<P>
   If you are doing well as a salesperson, and you are
satisfactorily handling the administrative side of the job, that is
where your manager's attention will be placed. In today's world of
work, with many parents trying to balance a work life and a home
life, it could just as easily be argued that your messy car is a
good sign. You are a working parent who obviously spends time with
your children. And, you let them mess up your car and have fun, and
this is not a bad sign either. The messy car also says something
positive about your priorities in life.
</P>
<P>
   This situation would be somewhat different if your work is a
mess, your reports are undecipherable and your office is a war
zone. However, it simply sounds like you had a fun time with your
children and did not have time to clean the car. If your manager
has a problem with this, he probably has all sorts of other
problems meticulously packed in the baggage he's carrying.

BREAKTHROUGH FINAL FOR PHILIPPOUSSIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Refiling to include photo advisory.)   (Eds: Will be updated after Sampras-Rafter match; See also
TEN-USOPEN-WOMEN.) 
(nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when it appeared that Mark Philippoussis'
new-found maturity was about to dissipate along with a slew of
break-point opportunities, the 21-year-old Australian relocated the
ability to punctuate his big game with an exclamation point, and
powered past Carlos Moya on Saturday into the men's final of the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In finally subduing the stubborn 10th-seeded Moya, the reigning
French Open champion, by 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, Philippoussis reached
his first Grand Slam final and became the fourth unseeded man to
proceed this far at the Open. Only Andre Agassi in 1994 went on to
win the title.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to Moya's steady baseline game and improving net
play, Philippoussis will be loading the cannon in Sunday
afternoon's final, in what promises to be a match of quick,
whiplash-inducing points against the winner of Saturday's Pete
Sampras-Patrick Rafter semifinal. Only Sampras, the top-seeded
American, stood in the way of the first Open final between
Australians since Ken Rosewall defeated Tony Roche in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, who spends most of his time in Florida, runs a
distant second to Rafter on the popularity charts in Australia, and
not just because Rafter won the Open a year ago. Philippoussis,
like Sampras, has balked at playing early-round Davis Cup matches,
not a wise idea in his country. As a result, he admitted that even
his relationship with Rafter has been cool.
</P>
<P>
   One of three players to have recorded a serve over 140 mph,
Philippoussis hit 21 aces Saturday at the National Tennis Center in
Queens, the first of which whistled past Moya at 132 mph. But the
more telling number was 67, as the 6-foot-4-inch, 200-pound
Philippoussis got 67 percent of his first serves in, and won 63 of
those 74 points.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first two sets, which he tore through in 51 minutes and
during which, he later admitted, he felt that ``no one can beat
me,'' Philippoussis faced just two break points _ both in the fifth
game of the first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``His serve was too good today,'' said Moya, who was the first
Spaniard to reach the Open semifinals since the tournament switched
surfaces from synthetic clay to hard court in 1978. ``The lowest
serve is 100 miles, even the second serve.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that second serve that cost Philippoussis the third set
and stripped away, however briefly, the mask of professional
resolve that he had worn so well in his fifth-set quarterfinal tie
breaker against Thomas Johansson on Thursday night. His coach,
Gavin Hopper, has worked with Philippoussis on maintaining
concentration, on not sulking when he cannot dominate with his
serve.
</P>
<P>
   In the third set, knowing he had to change tactics, Moya
demonstrated that he is more than the standard stay-on-the-baseline
Spaniard. He began to attack the net, with success. In the 10th
game, after Moya served his way into a 0-40 hole, he managed to
save four break points. Philippoussis was clearly upset with
himself, and, at 30-all on his serve, he double-faulted, going for
a second serve that was clocked at 117 mph. Then, on set point
against him, he went for another big second serve and
double-faulted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 21 years of age,'' he said later, somewhat
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   When Moya escaped from another triple-break-point hole in the
fifth game of the fourth set, the prospect of a fifth set under the
hot sun in Arthur Ashe Stadium suddenly loomed. Moya believed he
had found the vulnerability in Philippoussis' game; all he needed
was a way to take him to the limit. ``When you put pressure on him,
he's not playing that well,'' Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Moya, when he was unable to get his first
serve in, the hole in his game on a fast court like this one was
painfully apparent. His second serve was not much more than a
77-mph clay-court pancake. In the seventh game, Moya again fell
behind by 0-40, and scrambled back to 30-40, giving him a string of
10 break points saved. On the 11th, however, Philippoussis returned
a backhand off a second serve down the line, and Moya hit a lunging
forehand volley into the net. Philippoussis finished him off on his
third match point in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just relieved,'' he said, referring to Moya's
resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   While Moya acknowledged the Goran Ivanisevic-like wild-card
element to Philippoussis' game, he warned that both Sampras and
Rafter would present a completely different look, given their
special abilities to make the opponent beat them with the passing
shot. It is doubtful that Philippoussis will be able to use the
chip-and-charge tactic against the second serve, as he did so well
during the first two sets against Moya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working extremely hard with my all-around game,'' he
said. ``I don't like to rely on my serve, only.''
</P>
<P>
   He will need to have it working Sunday.

EDITORIAL: SEEKING JUSTICE IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for refinements throughout.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   With heavy hearts and churning emotions, Americans are taking
this weekend to digest Kenneth Starr's allegations of misconduct
and abuse of power by President Clinton. The official judgment of
Clinton's fitness to serve will be rendered by the Congress, which
is as it should be. Wrangling over the role and rights of the
independent counsel can now give way to procedures and powers
established indisputably by the Constitution, and that is a healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
   But it places a heavy burden on the House of Representatives,
which will first consider the case and whether to hold impeachment
hearings. Without an exact precedent from Watergate of receiving
such detailed accusations from a special prosecutor, the House must
invent new procedures as it goes along. So far, Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Henry Hyde, the Judiciary Committee chairman, have
been true to their promise of a bipartisan approach.
</P>
<P>
   The House's primary obligation is to handle the case in a fair,
nonpartisan way. That means that Clinton and his lawyers should be
given every opportunity to see all the evidence, including evidence
that has not yet been made public. When the Judiciary Committee
meets on Monday, it should reconsider its decision not to let
Clinton's lawyers immediately review the 2,000 pages of backup
material that accompanied the Starr report. The committee should
also give Clinton access to the additional 17 boxes of what Starr
calls ``other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the White House is disputing the facts and
interpretations contained in Starr's report, the House Judiciary
Committee must transform itself into a kind of fact-finding body.
The House needs to make sure that defenders of Clinton on the
panel, in cooperation with the White House counsel, are able to
obtain any information or testimony that challenges Starr's
findings or legal analysis. There can be no room for unilateral
subpoena power by the Republican majority, with no ability of the
minority to exercise the same rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee should ask Starr if there is any
additional material related to the case that he did not consider
material, but which the defense may find exculpatory or otherwise
crucial in its effort to challenge the credibility of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Americans want this process to be concluded
swiftly, and there can be no doubt that the longer the uncertainty
surrounding Clinton lasts, the weaker he will be in exercising the
duties of his office. Even though elections are coming in November,
the House must move promptly to determine whether the case requires
impeachment proceedings. That decision ought to be reached before
the October recess. If the decision is affirmative, initial
hearings should commence after the election, as the country cannot
afford to drift through a crisis of leadership until a new Congress
is seated.
</P>
<P>
   During Watergate, when the House examined the evidence against
Richard Nixon, Democrats and Republicans set aside their political
interests and weighed the facts with care. If the Clinton case
comes to that, the House can achieve such a standard again. It has
no more solemn obligation. It must act in the spirit of the
Constitution to insure that history will see its actions as fair
and considered and standing the test of time.

ALASKA DELEGATION PUSHES AGENDA OF DEVELOPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., N.Y., Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rarely has a small delegation from a single state
been as well placed as the three Republicans who represent Alaska
in Congress to influence the development of their state's _ and the
whole nation's _ natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   And few congressional delegations have been as united, focused
and tenacious in espousing development as Sens. Ted Stevens and
Frank Murkowski and Rep. Don Young _ or in the eyes of their
detractors, as devious and downright ornery in their disregard of
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In their commitment to drawing upon the state's resources, in
their outspoken contempt for national environmental organizations
and in their use of powerful committee posts, the three veteran
Alaskan lawmakers exemplify the use of national power for local
interest and the ways in which local attitudes can color national
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski and Young, both 65, are chairmen of the Senate and
House committees, respectively, that have jurisdiction over matters
at the core of the Alaskan economy and environment: timber, fish,
minerals, oil and other natural resources, especially those on
federal lands. And Stevens, 75, is chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, giving him special power to influence
policy through the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   They have left their marks in spending bills that are now before
Congress, with dozens of their provisions sprinkled through several
bills drafted by Stevens' committee. They are flexing their muscles
during Senate consideration of the bill to finance the Interior
Department, after having added several provisions, including a
number that directly affect Alaska. Debate on that bill is expected
to continue on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment to the Interior bill would set the amount of
logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest at a level of timber
sales far higher than the U.S. Forest Service has offered this
year. Another would prohibit new regulations by the National Park
Service, gradually eliminating commercial and subsistence fishing
in the waters of Glacier Bay National Park, the largest protected
marine ecosystem on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonder isn't that there are the amendments you're talking
about,'' Stevens said in an interview shortly after his committee
drafted the bill. ``The wonder is that there aren't hundreds
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., has proposed stripping from the bill a
number of the Alaska delegation's amendments, along with others
that he considers bad for the environment. Baucus' move could touch
off one of the Senate's most contentious environmental fights of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such policy measures would be enacted by Congress in
free-standing bills that would move through Young's and Murkowski's
committees. But that approach is difficult when the administration
has already threatened to veto spending bills that include what
President Clinton calls anti-environmental provisions, thus
requiring two-thirds votes in both houses to overturn.
</P>
<P>
   Even if not all their provisions get through, some might.
Earlier this year, they got a provision authorizing a new access
road in Denali National Park, which the administration opposed,
into a huge highway bill that President Clinton signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told my enemies as well as my friends, I'm going to
outlive you and outlast you,'' Young said. ``I will win these wars.
Maybe you won't realize what I am doing, but slowly but surely I
will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of their ideas are of particular interest to Alaska, like a
provision being pushed by Murkowski that would let the trustees who
invest the money from the settlement of the Exxon Valdez oil spill
seek higher rates of return, but restrict their purchases of
conservation land.
</P>
<P>
   Others are of national or even global significance, like
Murkowski's proposal to encourage the Export Import Bank to finance
certain development projects abroad, even though they violate the
bank's environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Even without drafting bills, they can exert pressure on federal
agencies through oversight hearings before the committees they run.
This summer, after hearings into carrying out the Endangered
Species Act, Young has sent a chill through environmental
organizations by writing letters to the Forest Service and Justice
Department demanding to know which of their employees previously
worked for advocacy groups bringing suits under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaskans are not bothered by the howls of protest coming
from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are communists,'' Young said. ``They believe in the
communal ownership of all natural resources, including the land.
And they believe that every community that lives off the land
should also be owned by the government. That is their ultimate
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has a reputation for intemperance on the genteel floor of
the House. A few weeks ago, he had to apologize to Rep. Maurice
Hinchey, D-N.Y., after calling Hinchey's amendment opposing a road
across fragile lands in Alaska ``mischievous,'' ``evil,''
``immoral'' and ``corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's denunciation of the amendment, which was defeated,
illustrated something else about the delegation: their deep
distrust of outsiders' environmental objectives in their state,
which consists largely of federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just blows my mind,'' Young said, ``that someone from New
York state, that has never been there, has never seen this area,
never talked to the people, can in fact promote something that has
been given to him by one of the wilderness associations that
promotes its ill will in this capital every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said in an interview: ``Everything in Alaska becomes a
cause for the environmental groups, to raise money and create
membership, because it is so far away that people can't see it for
themselves. We have 60-some-odd environmental groups in Anchorage,
with offices. Young attorneys come up and do their missionary work,
having a new degree in environmental law or something, and they
need to have a cause. The cause is membership; the cause is
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, their foes speak just as bluntly about them.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen McGinty, the White House's top environmental aide,
called the renewed efforts to attach anti-environmental provisions
to spending bills ``absolute blackmail'' and said that the
provisions were headed toward a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a persistent sacrificing of the common interest and the
public interest for a few special interests,'' she said of the
Alaskans' work. ``It is a persistent disrespect of the legislative
process. And when you are operating for just a few special
interests, you operate behind closed doors and you try to sneak
things through.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The three Alaskans have deep roots in the state. Stevens, who
has been in the Senate since 1968, has influenced the federal
relationship with Alaska since before its statehood, serving as an
aide to the interior secretary in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski, first elected in 1980, comes from a banking
background and has long held financial interests in Ketchikan, a
town that for decades has been at the center of battles over Alaska
logging. Young, who arrived in the House in 1973, is a former
boatsman and licensed trapper whose office walls resemble a
taxidermist's showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who lost his committee
chairmanship to Young when the Republicans took over Congress and
who frequently jousts with the Alaskan, says that to fight one
member of the delegation is to fight them all.
</P>
<P>
   Late one night in July, debating Young over logging roads in the
Tongass, Miller acknowledged that his real opponent was Stevens and
his amendments in the other chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like the results, but I have got to admire the
talent,'' said Miller, who was later chastised by the presiding
member of the House for mentioning a senator by name, a violation
of House rules. ``He tried to change the forest plans. He tried to
go back to the old plans. He tried to increase the cuts. He tried
to increase the roads. He tried to bail the industries out of
problems. Bang-di-di-bang-di-di-bang _ this guy has never slept.''
</P>
<P>
   Young agreed: ``The good senator, bless his heart, never does
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say if this was the World Wrestling Federation,
this tag team from Alaska would be the world's champions,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Alaskans forge compromises that set national
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, for instance, worked closely with Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, a liberal Democrat, in crafting a revision of the
national fisheries law that enjoyed wide support. And Young
negotiated with the Clinton administration and conservation groups
to come up with a new law governing the operations of wildlife
refuges.
</P>
<P>
   But Murkowski said he was tired of compromise and retreat.
``Every time we give, we lose, and we have given so much that the
answer is no,'' he said. ``There are no prisoners associated with
this discussion.''

<P>
   HILLSBORO, Ore. _ In his first extended remarks about the
scandal enveloping President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore made a
strong statement of support for him Saturday, saying the
independent council report issued on Friday provided insufficient
grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe this report serves as the basis for
overturning the judgment of the American people in 1992 and again
in 1996 that Bill Clinton should be their president,'' Gore told
reporters after he gave a speech here, celebrating the extension of
a light-rail line from downtown Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a certain presidential candidate in 2000, also praised
Clinton for his apologies of recent days in which the president, he
said, ``has accepted responsibility for his actions and he said
that what he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the first stop of a two-day campaign trip through the
Pacific Northwest that will take him to the Seattle area on Sunday,
Gore declined to answer any questions about the scandal, leaving a
swirl of unknowns hanging in the air, including whether he thought
the charges against the president would cost Democrats in the
November election or whether the charges would lead to impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr
released his report Friday, Democrats were expected to make only
moderate gains in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a 445-page document charging Clinton with perjury,
obstruction of justice and other criminal acts adding to the
season's campaign fodder, political analysts are predicting that
Democrats could lose as many as 20 seats in the House and five or
more in the Senate, which would give Republicans a filibuster-proof
majority, not to mention an easier path to the two-thirds vote
needed to impeach a president.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gore stood with several members of Oregon's
congressional delegation who are facing re-election, boosting the
accomplishments of the administration and saying nothing of
President Clinton's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, that appears to be one way Gore is slowly crafting
an image for himself apart from his wounded boss _ ignore the
scandal and speak of only their progress together, which shows the
country in a positive light and projects his sense of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters here, even those willing to overlook Clinton's
personal problems, said they appreciated the fine line Gore was
walking and urged him to continue defining himself as a political
force separate and apart from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should he distance himself? That's a hard thing to ask him,''
Scott Tausch, 38, a truck driver, who had come to the rally with
his young son. ``I respect his loyalty, and it's hard to say he
should bite the hand that's fed him the last six years. But I'd
like to see him move more up front with his own beliefs.''

RAIN FROM TROPICAL STORM PUTS NEW ORLEANS IN FLOOD EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ With more rain in the forecast, Mayor Marc Morial
on Friday urged businesses and nonessential government agencies to
send workers home early after as much as 10 inches of rain from
tropical storm Frances fell here in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Morial asked residents to take advantage of a lull in the storm
to pick up school children _ some had been stranded at schools _
and take flood prevention measures at home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Friday, Morial declared a state of emergency, as much
of the city remained underwater. Some residents paddled canoes up
flooded historic St. Charles Avenue. Stranded workers in the
central business district watched garbage cans float by their
windows. Manhole covers blew off from water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter and Audubon Park were among the areas hardest
hit, recording more than 10 inches of rain in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Morial said, ``We expect the rain will become severe in just a
few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they feared ``catastrophic'' flooding at high
tide at 3 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for the
parishes, or counties, of Jefferson, St. Bernard and Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson Parish president, Tim Coulon, ordered the
evacuation of Jean Lafitte, a town of 2,700 people. Yellow school
buses raced to the coastal community to help families comply with
the mandatory evacuation order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little problem because many people don't want to
leave,'' said Walter Maestri, director of emergency management
services for the parish.
</P>
<P>
   All of New Orleans' 22 pumping stations were running at capacity
but some streets were covered by 4 feet of water or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cars disabled by flooding were stranded throughout the city.
Other motorists parked their cars on the relative high ground of
the St. Charles Avenue streetcar tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Interstate 10, a major artery in the city, was a virtual
parking lot for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel Lagarde, a spokesman for the Entergy utility company,
which serves most of the city, said repair crews had been slowed by
the flooded streets. He said crews would be working through the
night to try to restore power to 1,000 customers who lost it in the
storm.

MAN KILLED AND THREE ARE WOUNDED BY SHOTS INTO BROOKLYN CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GLENN COLLINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unidentified gunman fired into a crowd early
Saturday in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, killing a 33-year-old
man and wounding three other people, one of them critically, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no arrests in the 2:05 a.m. shooting at Coney Island
Avenue near Avenue M. Police were withholding the names of the
victims pending the notification of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Walter Burnes, a Police Department spokesman, said
that the shooting occurred after a dispute between two groups of
people on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Burnes said the investigation had not yet determined a motive
for the incident in the normally tranquil, traditionally Jewish
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the gunman was a white man and the victims were
Hispanic, Asian and black, but that there was no indication that
the shooting had been racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for 10 years in this store, and this is the
first time something like this has happened,'' said the manager of
Island Check Cashing Corp. at 1640 Coney Island Ave., who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Everyone in the neighborhood is
talking about it, but nobody knows what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the street was virtually deserted and most of the
stores were closed for the Jewish Sabbath, and the few residents
who were outdoors said they knew little about the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents, including the bartender at Dixie's, at 1636
Coney Island Ave., said the dispute began after a traffic accident.
The bartender would not give her name.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, yellow crime-scene tape had been torn down in front
of a store called Coney Island Monuments at 1640 Coney Island Ave.;
an empty bus stop with a kiosk was next to the sidewalk. Across the
street was a funeral parlor, the Midwood Memorial Chapel, and a
block away was the Mestiva Yeshiva.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the dead man, who was Hispanic, had been
shot in the chest. He died at Coney Island Hospital at 3:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wounded was a 30-year-old Asian man, who was shot in
the chest and remained in critical but stable condition Saturday at
Kings County Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old Hispanic woman was also taken to Kings County
Hospital Center after being shot in one leg; she was reported in
stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   The third victim was a 20-year-old black man, who was shot in
the left leg and was in stable condition at Coney Island Hospital.

CAPITAL TRIAL TO BEGIN FOR MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING FOR JEWELRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In May 1996, Brooklyn prosecutors say, Marvin
McIntosh was standing in front of a girlfriend's home in East New
York when two men and a teen-ager demanded his gold chain and
large, eye-catching pendant, shaped like a bulldog's head.
</P>
<P>
   When McIntosh refused, the prosecutors say, a struggle broke
out, and two of the robbers shot him _ with some bullets fired as
he lay on the ground already wounded. The chain and pendant, for
which he had paid $1,000, were torn from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in state Supreme Court in Brooklyn, opening arguments
are scheduled in the second death penalty trial in New York City
since capital punishment was revived in the state three years ago.
The defendant, Jermaine Page, 24, is accused of being one of the
gunmen who killed McIntosh, 28, who worked for a private mail
delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   The state's first capital murder trial under the 1995 law also
took place in Brooklyn, where District Attorney Charles Hynes has
brought more death penalty cases than any other prosecutor in the
state. In that trial, a former city jail guard, Darrel Harris, was
sentenced to death in June for killing three people in a robbery at
a social club.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes has brought five death penalty cases despite his avowed
opposition to capital punishment. In fact, in his campaign for
governor in Tuesday's Democratic primary, Hynes has said that if
elected he will work to repeal the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But he has held that while the law is on the books he is
duty-bound to seek the death penalty in appropriate cases.
</P>
<P>
   Page's trial comes as the pace of death penalty trials has
picked up statewide. In Buffalo last week, testimony began in the
trial of Jonathan Parker, who is charged with killing a police
officer. And juries are being selected in three other capital
trials across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a Poughkeepsie jury convicted Dalkeith McIntosh of
murdering his estranged wife and her daughter but sentenced him to
life in prison instead of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes has refused to say why he deemed Page an appropriate
candidate for execution other than stating _ as he always does when
announcing such decisions _ that he made his determination after
reviewing the ``aggravating and mitigating factors'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating factors under the law _ like the intentional killing
of a robbery victim, the situation charged in Page's case _ are
what make a case eligible for the death penalty in the first place.
Mitigating factors would include conditions like a defendant's
having been mentally or emotionally disturbed or under the
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   When Hynes announced in December 1996 that he would seek the
death penalty for Page rather than life in prison without
possibility of parole, a lawyer for the defendant, Steven Chaikin,
maintained that the case was ``wholly inappropriate for
consideration as a death penalty case.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while intentional murders during robberies are among
the types of killings eligible for the death penalty, prosecutors
in the state generally have not sought execution for such killings,
said lawyers not involved in the Page case.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as jury selection was completed for Page's trial,
defense and prosecution lawyers were focusing not on the past
decisions that brought them to this capital case, but on how they
would argue the case to the jury of seven women and five men, who
include two schoolteachers, three transit system employees and a
city tax auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Chaikin declined to discuss the case he and his co-counsel, Gary
S. Villanueva, would present, saying only that his client, a man of
medium build with a goatee who sat with a Bible at the defense
table, was not guilty of the charges. Justice Priscilla Hall has
directed the defense lawyers and the prosecutors _ Barry Schreiber,
Kyle Reeves, Joseph Alexis and Jacqueline Linares _ to limit their
comments to reporters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to police and court records, Page had been paroled
from prison just six weeks before McIntosh was killed. He had been
serving a sentence of one and a half to four and a half years for
attempted assault in the 1993 shooting of a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McIntosh fell to the ground and the pendant and necklace
were torn from his neck,'' Hynes said in announcing that he would
pursue the death penalty. ``Page stepped backward and fired several
more shots into McIntosh, mortally wounding him.''
</P>
<P>
   But in one pretrial motion, the prosecutors seemed to present a
different version, saying that after McIntosh was sent to the
ground by bullets fired by Page, the teen-ager charged in the case,
Darryl Gillmore, ``shot McIntosh several times as he lay on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillmore, 15 at the time McIntosh was killed and 17 now, is not
eligible for the death penalty because he was under 18 when the
killing occurred. He is awaiting trial on second-degree murder
charges, punishable by up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The third suspect, Franchon Jemmott, 22, is awaiting trial on a
second-degree murder charge that accuses him of ``acting in
concert'' with the others. Gillmore and Jemmott have pleaded not
guilty.

 &HT;    BEHIND THE NOTEBOOK: AN EYEWITNESS TO UNREALITY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Roasting beneath the klieg lights in the cramped
White House briefing room where so much of the nation's history
unfolds, President Clinton's long-suffering spokesman leaned
somberly against the wooden podium that stood between him and a
couple of hundred journalists and slogged through questions about
the president and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months of parrying inquiries with a mix of dodging,
derision and denial, Michael McCurry confessed that he had depleted
the deep reservoir of wit, creativity and sarcasm he had relied
upon as the front man in a White House stonewalling campaign that
had finally collapsed beneath the weight of disturbing truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't anticipate anything,'' McCurry sighed Tuesday, in
response to yet another question about what would happen in the
Lewinsky scandal. ''I just show up for work and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the frosty morning of Jan. 21, when the Washington Post
broke the news to the world that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
was investigating allegations that Clinton had had an affair with
the former White House intern and coached her to lie about it under
oath, most of the reporters who cover the White House have been
doing much the same _ showing up for work and trying to figure out
what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Like any institution with much to hide, Clinton's White House
has made this task as difficult as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry himself, who is paid $125,000 a year by taxpayers to be
their official window into the White House, has made it his job to
know as little as possible about the Lewinsky matter. In this way,
he was able to answer with authority and a clear conscience ''I
don't know'' to just about any query imaginable about the subject.
McCurry's personal strategy, reflecting that of his boss, has been
to talk instead, and talk and talk some more, about anything but
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people here, the truth be told, try their best to
avoid this other matter,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Starr delivered his report to Congress late
Wednesday, it was no longer possible to avoid the scandal as some
''other matter,'' though the White House continued to try,
sometimes in ways that lent an unreal air to much of what the press
was allowed to witness.
</P>
<P>
   Here were Democrats, first House members Wednesday, then from
the Senate the next day, mournfully trudging out of meetings with
Clinton to tell reporters how badly they felt for the president,
how deeply he was hurting, how very sorry he was for the whole
sordid mess.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, they said, it was time to heal, not to talk about the
looming impeachment proceedings or, worse, the possibility that
Clinton might consider stepping aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all forgave the president,'' House Minority Whip David
Bonior, D-Mich., told about 100 reporters and photographers who
clustered around the spot on the black paved driveway where White
House correspondents are allowed to stake out presidential guests
as they exit the West Wing. ''Nobody mentioned the word
'resignation.' Nobody mentioned the word 'impeachment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neither word was whispered, either, when Democratic senators
visited.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't talk about any of the options or any of the
scenarios,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``I
accept the president's apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent were any of the Democrats who had publicly
criticized Clinton in recent days, such as Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., who took to the Senate floor to denounce Clinton's
behavior as ''disgraceful,'' or Rep. James Moran, D-Va., who went
on national television to say he thought impeachment proceedings
were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the kind of talk the president wanted to hear from
the asphalt platform of the stakeout zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was to that same spot that four cabinet members sojourned
last January to tell the press, and the world, that they absolutely
believed the president's denials of an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Education Secretary
Richard Riley, Commerce Secretary William Daley and Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala lashed their own credibility
to the listing mast of the president's word and wagged their
fingers at reporters for deigning to focus on such peculiar and
picayune affairs as Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of those officials returned to the stakeout area
Thursday, after Clinton called his cabinet for their first meeting
since that sad January day to tell them this time that he was sorry
for using them in a campaign of deception that endured until Aug.
17, when he admitted to the world that his denials were lies.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, in the ornate East Room, an embattled Clinton
supplicated himself before the nation, declaring ''I have sinned,''
in what is certain to be one of the four or five quotes journalists
will turn to when it's time to write of this president's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   For the president who promised to bring Washington hope has left
it laden with shame, and the reporters charged with chronicling his
journey must simply keep showing up for work to see what happens
next.

 &HT;    DETAILS OF CLINTON AFFAIR SHOCK, PERPLEX AND WORRY THE WORLD
PRESS
 &HT;    By ANDREW ALEXANDER
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The intimate details of President Clinton's sexual
relations with Monica Lewinsky dominated front pages around the
world Saturday, and some newspaper editorials urged him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Several worried editorially that the president's political
problems would diminish his standing as a world leader and further
destabilize an already wobbly world economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When strong (U.S.) leadership is needed, political paralysis
may be the only thing on offer, said an editorial in Australia's
Sydney Morning Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president must resign,'' read an editorial in the Bangkok
Post. The Thai newspaper said the world looks to the United States
for leadership in times of economic trouble and ``it cannot take
its proper role with Clinton at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the Rupert Murdock-owned Sun tabloid said
editorially that ``the lying fornicator must go'' because he is
``unfit to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But that view was not universal. In some countries preoccupied
with their own political and economic crises, notably Russia,
newspaper stories about Friday's release of the Starr report were
played on inside pages.
</P>
<P>
   South of the U.S. border, where the crisis is often referred to
as ``El Escandalo,'' Latin American newspapers were abuzz with
jokes. But many felt that Clinton's troubles paled in comparison
with scandals that have rocked their own presidents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper El Tiempo in Bogota, Colombia,
``Clinton seems to have confused Oval Office with Oral Office.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's editorial said that Clinton is ``guilty, but not
condemnable.'' It went on to say ``Forgive, and forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian newspapers appeared awestruck at the amount of time
and energy devoted to the Clinton scandal. In Brazil, an
anti-feminist businessmen's association had voted Clinton ``Macho
Man of the Year'' a few months ago, and even delivered the award to
the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Granma, the daily Communist newspaper in Cuba, did little but
outline the facts of the case in an inside story. Cuban President
Fidel Castro was one of the first leaders to come to Clinton's
defense earlier this year, blaming Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., for
fomenting the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is a serious matter,'' editorialized the Standard
in Hong Kong. ``Those are charged with (considering it) must think
not only of President Clinton's conduct but what it could do to the
office of presidency and to the United States as the major world
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's tabloids had a field day with the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun managed to get ``sex'' on its front page in oversized
type three times: ``Cigar Sex, Phone Sex, Pizza Sex.'' A
subheadline read ``Monica reveals shocking truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Express, which included an eight-page pull-out with the full
text of the Starr report, blared ``Sex &AMP; Lies'' in huge type with
the subhead, ``Clinton's sex games disgust America.'' Inside, the
paper ran a story about first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton under the
headline: ``I'm with you all the way. . .you vile creep.''
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers long ago labeled the scandal ``Zippergate,''
and the Daily Mail on Saturday notched the affair up to
``Porngate'' in its screaming front page headline. Inside, facing a
story about a 26-year-old dog named Fred, purportedly the oldest
dog in Britain, the Daily Mail detailed the story under the
headline ``Monica called him Handsome and he called her Sweetie.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the broadsheets were more prudent, reserving the
sex for the inside pages while using the front pages to talk about
the president's legal and political perils.
</P>
<P>
   There was much lamenting about Clinton's emotional immaturity,
and pondering whether this was a good thing in a man with a finger
on the nuclear button. ``If Clinton's judgment was so wildly flawed
that he imagined he wouldn't get caught, he is perhaps not the best
man to run a superpower,'' wrote Decca Aitkenhead, a columnist for
The Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian offered tough love. ``Stupid, infantile, pathetic,
caddish, laddish: he wins no respect for his sexual mores or the
maturity of his personal judgments. But what Clinton has done
deserves neither comparison with the willful abuse of public power
by Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon nor the removal from office under
the American Constitution's impeachment procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, the press reacted with an explosion of
no-holds-barred coverage of sexual details.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican media found a local angle, too: a brief meeting
described in the Starr report that took place between Lewinsky and
Clinton before a White House state dinner for Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Such coverage is something that would never swirl around a
Mexican president. In Mexico, laws prohibit making fun of a sitting
president. And quizzing politicians about their sex lives is
considered trivial compared to questions about financial and
political corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton on Display'' was the front-page headline the Reforma
newspaper gave its Mexico City readers.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's La Jornada newspaper's headline was sarcastic:
``See you later, friend?'' with the Spanish word ``amigo'' spelled
``amigou,'' as if it were pronounced with a strong American accent.
</P>
<P>
   On another sarcastic note, La Jornada's Washington reporters
said they would investigate whether a cigar allegedly used as a sex
prop was Cuban, and if Clinton had purchased it in violation of
U.S. embargo against Cuban goods and therefore committed an
impeachable act.
</P>
<P>
   For many commentators, the sexual details in the Starr report
seemed more devastating to Clinton than the allegations that he
committed perjury and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered if he'll survive the embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we might have to get used to pronouncing 'Al
Gore, Al Gore,' `` said Mexico City radio personality Jose
Gutierrez Vivo.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A RECORD BEYOND ANY PLAYER'S REACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer on Sunday,
Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The attention of American sports fans has been centered on the
breaking of Roger Maris' home run record. But there is another
record in the world of sports that is being broken by much greater
margins than Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa can hope to achieve. That
is the record price for a sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the peak price was $311 million, paid earlier
this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers by a company controlled by
Rupert Murdoch. Then Alfred Lerner, who became rich through credit
cards, paid $530 million for the Cleveland Browns expansion
football team. The very next day, a company controlled by Murdoch
offered $1 billion for the Manchester United soccer team in
England.
</P>
<P>
   That team is the most popular in Britain, and it even has a
following in Asia. The fate of Manchester United ``is not a matter
or life or death,'' commented one British newspaper. ``It is much
more important.'' A newspaper poll found 96 percent of the soccer
team's fans in Manchester opposed to the deal, but the opinion that
counts is that of the current owners of the team. Murdoch is paying
more than four times what the team was worth less than two years
ago, and they think that is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch values sports teams as reliable sources of television
programming. He now has exclusive rights to televise England's top
soccer league, but regulators have been challenging that on
antitrust grounds, arguing that each team should be free to sell
its own TV rights. If the regulators win that fight, Murdoch will
be able to sell Manchester United rights to himself. Despite
assurances to the contrary from aides to Murdoch, fans fear that he
might put some or all Manchester United games on pay-per-view
television. As it is, they are available only to those with cable
or satellite service.
</P>
<P>
   At least Murdoch does not seem to expect taxpayers to put up the
money for his teams' stadiums. Both Manchester United and the
Dodgers own their stadiums. That spirit is not, however, widely
shared by his fellow owners. The bidding terms for the new Browns
franchise specified that the winner would pay $54 million toward
the cost of a new $280 million stadium, while Cleveland taxpayers
pick up most of the cost. The rest of the money paid by Lerner will
go to owners of other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The popular theory now is that sports teams are valuable for
media companies because fans will watch the station that broadcasts
their games, even if they have to pay for satellite or cable
television, and will then watch other programs as well.
</P>
<P>
   If so, who will buy the teams the media magnates do not, or
cannot, buy? Lerner, who became a billionaire as the boss of a
company that is a leading issuer of Mastercard and Visa cards, fits
the old pattern of a wealthy businessman who wants to have a sports
team of his very own. But there are not many such people with a few
hundred million to throw at a business that generates little in the
way of profit after paying huge player salaries. Unable to get
taxpayers to pay for a new stadium, Wayne Huizenga decided that the
World Series championship he bought for the Florida Marlins was not
worth the money it cost him and is trying to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up to Lerner in the bidding for the Browns was a
partnership that included a media magnate who is a partner with
Murdoch in controlling local broadcasting rights for the New York
Yankees and the New York Mets. In fact, Murdoch's companies control
both the national television rights for baseball, through the Fox
network, and the local rights for 22 of the teams through local
station and cable operations.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, people scoffed when Ted Turner treated his
Atlanta Braves as a part of his television station, scheduling game
times based on when the station needed programming. Now such things
are taken for granted. The real purpose of big-time sports teams,
it appears, is to bring in television viewers.

DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR AT A GLANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democratic voters will choose a candidate to face
Gov. George Pataki from among four contenders: Charles Hynes, James
Larocca, Betsy McCaughey Ross and Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   All four favor abortion rights, more money for early-childhood
education and day care, and drug treatment as an alternative to
prison. They all also agree that the state should reduce its debt,
ban anti-gay discrimination and help guarantee health insurance for
the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' resumes are diverse, but they have one thing in
common: For each, this is a leap at something far beyond what their
careers have held so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, the lieutenant governor, who a year ago
switched from Republican to Democrat, had been a college professor
and a writer for a consulting group before Pataki chose her as his
running mate in 1994. This is her first run for office on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council, was a
politically active lawyer, then a Council member for the last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes, like Vallone, has never been elected to any office but
the one he holds now _ district attorney for Brooklyn _ though he
had a long string of appointive posts in government.
</P>
<P>
   And Larocca has never run for elective office. Like Hynes, he
held a series of appointive posts, but he left government 13 years
ago for private business and a law practice.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan stood at the Fifth
Avenue starting line of a Labor Day parade in Manhattan on
Saturday, wrapped an arm around City Council Speaker Peter Vallone
and tried to drum up support for Vallone in Tuesday's New York
Democratic primary for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters swooped in, and the two men were asked repeatedly and
exclusively about Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, one of Vallone's rivals in the
primary, faced a similar barrage of questions, as did Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   None of the politicians had much to say. Their responses were
bland, noncommittal and interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone professed ``great disappointment'' in the president's
behavior. Pataki, when asked if Clinton should resign, said, ``I
think that's for the president and his advisers and Congress to
consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking off the record, some of the candidates and their aides
expressed mounting frustration that, at a time when they would like
all eyes on their races, they were being swamped by the news from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is particularly acute for the Democrats running for
governor, a race that has drawn less interest than the Senate
contest, and for attorney general, an office that is usually
little-noticed and even less understood.
</P>
<P>
   Among prominent politicians in the region, the closest thing to
a clear opinion on the president's troubles came from New Jersey
Gov. Christie Whitman, who was traveling in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disgraceful,'' Whitman said, ``what we have to put up
with,'' a view that seemed to encompass both Clinton and the Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   Of the report, she said, ``We do not need to know the prurient
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton should resign, she said, ``If the Congress
starts impeachment proceedings, I think he needs to truly,
seriously reassess what is in the best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Geraldine Ferraro, a Democratic candidate for the Senate,
skirted the more serious questions raised by the report, saying,
``If he's just had an affair, shame on him, but he's done a good
job on issues important to working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican who is running for
re-election, declined to comment on the substance of the report,
but said one consequence of it was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not focusing in on any of the races,'' he said.
``It does obscure and make it more difficult for candidates to get
their message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland said Clinton ``should have come
clean earlier,'' but he, too, declined to take a position on the
accusations, or on whether the President should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross, a Republican-turned-Democrat, simply disregarded
questions about the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said that New Yorkers ``want the best possible
health care when they're facing a serious illness, excellent
schools to prepare their children for the future, and job
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion, of course, was that Clinton's travails were not
foremost in voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who is not up for re-election, gamely tried to swing
attention back around to the race for governor of New York.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed on the question of impeachment, he noted that if it
was tried, the Senate would cast the ultimate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could come about that I would be a juror,'' he said. ``So
this is no time for me to comment _ except to say, Peter Vallone is
a great speaker and he'd be even a greater governor.''

CLIFFORD GROBSTEIN, 82, BIOLOGIST WHO APPLIED ETHICS TO RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Clifford Grobstein, a scientist, university administrator
and leading framer of the ethical questions raised by advances in
developmental biology, died Sept. 6 in La Jolla, Calif. He was 82
and lived in Rancho Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, according to the University of
California at San Diego, where Grobstein was a professor emeritus
of biological science and public policy. He had served as professor
and administrator since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   As a researcher, Grobstein made important contributions to the
study of cancer and of developmental biology _ the study of how a
simple one-celled egg gives rise to the extraordinarily complex
organisms of humans and animals. But he was also widely respected
by fellow scientists for his ability to analyze the human
implications of medical research and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``From Chance to Purpose _ An Appraisal of External
Human Fertilization'' (Addison-Wesley, 1981), Grobstein considered
the impact of research that had recently resulted in the births of
the first children conceived through in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter discussing what defines a person and when life
begins, Grobstein also suggested that cloning might ultimately
overshadow other techniques for producing new life.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote several other books, including ``The Strategy of
Life,'' ``The Double Image of the Double Helix'' and ``Science and
the Unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   He became chairman of the biology department at the University
of California at San Diego in 1965, after leaving Stanford
University, where he had been a professor and the head of the
biology department. A year later, he became dean of the newly
formed school of medicine at San Diego, which under his leadership
became a highly regarded teaching and research institution.
</P>
<P>
   Grobstein was born in New York City and received a bachelor's
degree in biology from the City College of New York in 1936. He
received his master's degree and doctorate in zoology from the
University of California at Los Angeles, and worked for 10 years
for the National Cancer Institute of the U.S. Public Health
Service. He was elected to the National Academy of Science in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ruth, a radiation oncologist; a son;
a daughter; three stepdaughters and 10 grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE TROUBLED SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   As naturalist Carl Safina observes in this month's Scientific
American, it has always been hard to believe that humans might
learn how to catch fish faster than the fish can reproduce _ that
there are, in fact, finite limits to the bounty of a seemingly
infinite sea. But that is what has happened. Highly mechanized
fleets, huge government subsidies and the food needs of a growing
world population have combined to put many of the world's fish
stocks at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Mankind has, of course, insulted the oceans in other ways.
Industrial and agricultural pollution, commercial development and
the destruction of wetlands and estuaries have taken their toll on
fragile marine ecosystems. But the gravest danger is poorly
regulated fishing, which not only debases the marine environment
but, over the long haul, will almost surely threaten the food
security of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   After years of dire warnings and declining catches, which led to
the near-collapse of the fishing industry in New England, the
world's governments are beginning to wake up. In 1995, the United
Nations approved the first international treaty to regulate fishing
on the high seas. The treaty covered only 20 percent of the ocean's
fish stocks _ so-called ``straddling fish'' that migrate from
coastal waters to the high seas _ and it still awaits final
ratification. Even so, it was a huge step forward for an
organization that for years had been the world's biggest booster of
industrial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1997, a Republican Congress that has not generally been
hospitable to environmental legislation reauthorized the Magnuson
Act of 1976 and unexpectedly handed President Clinton a powerful
weapon with which to rebuild U.S. fish stocks, more than half of
which are in trouble. The original act gave the United States
jurisdiction over fishing grounds within 200 miles of the U.S.
coastline. That put an end to rampant over-fishing by foreign
fleets but did not, unfortunately, prevent U.S. fleets from filling
the void. More often than not, the eight regional councils created
to regulate domestic fishing _ all dominated by fishing interests _
put short-term financial goals ahead of the long-term goal of
preserving fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The revised act was much tougher. It gave the regional councils
two years to devise new and detailed strategies to rebuild fish
populations _ including strict quotas where necessary _ and to
minimize ``bycatch,'' the collateral destruction of fish species
that fishermen do not really want. These plans will be submitted to
the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the Commerce
Department, next month. If they are inadequate, as many
environmentalists fear, the Commerce Secretary can demand
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   This will be an important test of Clinton's promise last June to
put responsible stewardship of the oceans at the top of his
environmental agenda. An early indication of the administration's
resolve on this matter may come later this month when it issues its
long-awaited plan on saving Atlantic swordfish stocks, which are in
terrible shape.
</P>
<P>
   The task of rescuing the seas is far from hopeless, given their
amazing resilience. State and local efforts to restore the health
of large estuaries like Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay are
moving forward. Washington has begun to focus on the problem of
agricultural runoff of poisonous wastes, and has embarked on an
ambitious project to clean up the Mississippi River and help
prevent the ``dead zones'' that periodically afflict the Gulf of
Mexico. But none of these efforts confront the larger menace of
overfishing. That is a global problem, on which Washington can and
must take the lead.

   MONTREAL _ On the surface, the Mets' Armando Reynoso has little
in common with Houston's Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Both are 32, but Johnson is an intimidating 6-foot-10-inch
presence whose fastball nears 100 mph, while Reynoso is a 6-footer
whose fastball barely gets to 85 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson led the American League in strikeouts four times while
he was with Seattle, including a career high of 308 in 1993.
Reynoso has struck out only 329 batters in his eight-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fastball,'' Reynoso said. ``No striking hitters out. I'm
not tall like him. And I definitely don't have the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the Mets' pitching coach, Bob Apodaca, put it, ``Except
that they're both winning machines, that's where it ends.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Mets are concerned, though, the only comparison
that counts is that Reynoso has been as big a midseason addition to
the Mets as Johnson has been to the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers have gone 7-1 in their first eight decisions since
joining their respective clubs in midsummer, giving their teams a
significant boost to their playoff aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for someone who is 13-4 in his two seasons with the Mets,
Reynoso _ who missed a little over a year because of arm troubles _
might be the least-known winning pitcher in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are 18-6 in games that Reynoso has started the last two
seasons. And, as Apodaca said, ``There's no telling where we'd be
without him this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a little strange because until Reynoso made his season
debut with eight shutout innings in a 5-0 victory over the Cubs on
July 24, he had been all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different now,'' said Reynoso, who has a 2.59 ERA in his
eight starts this season. ``Now, I feel like I'm part of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso had not pitched in the major leagues since July 16,
1997. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on both his right elbow and
shoulder last August and then felt tightness in his elbow at the
end of spring training, when he was something of a long shot
battling for the fifth spot in the Mets' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   If any one thing has held back Reynoso's career, it has been
injuries. He was the Colorado Rockies' starter on opening day in
1994, but his season was cut short after nine starts because of
elbow surgery. He said it took two years for him to fully heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like I'm a patient man,'' said Reynoso, the
youngest of 10 children, who grew up on a small ranch in Lagos de
Moreno, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the majors, at least, that trait has paid off. Reynoso went
20-3 in 1990 for Saltillo of the Mexican League before the Atlanta
Braves purchased his contract. But the Braves were loaded with
pitchers. And Reynoso never really got a shot, pitching in only
nine games for Atlanta in two seasons before he was taken by the
Rockies in the 1992 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   In four years with Colorado, Reynoso was 30-31. But in the
mile-high atmosphere of Denver, it is sometimes hard to gauge just
how good a pitcher is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me after the surgery,'' Reynoso said. ``In
'95, I didn't feel 100 percent. I was better in '96, but I still
didn't really feel 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies traded Reynoso to the Mets on Nov. 27, 1996, for
reliever Jerry DiPoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was because I was arbitration eligible,'' said
Reynoso, who signed a two-year, $2.25 million deal with the Mets
after the trade. ``Or maybe the Rockies thought I couldn't win many
games for them.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been a problem with the Mets. Instead, the question
continues to be Reynoso's health. He credited Dave Wallace, who is
essentially the Mets' pitching coordinator, with putting together
the rehabilitation program that got him back to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave kept saying, `He'll be ready for the second half of the
season, and we might need him,''' Apodaca said. ``And boy, he was
never more right. It's not just the games Armando has won for us.
It was the ability he gave us to be in a six-man rotation. And he
has not only fulfilled that spot in the rotation, he has made us
even stronger. You wouldn't think that one person would make that
much difference.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Especially one as unassuming as Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I've showed that when I'm healthy, I can win,''
Reynoso said. ``I can pitch in the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   He does so with a varied arsenal. Reynoso's best pitch is his
cut fastball. He also throws a sinking fastball, a curve, a slider
and a changeup. And his pickoff move is one of the best among
right-handers in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitches back and forth,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``Some guys pitch in and out. But Armando changes the timing of the
hitter. He controls the head of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Apodaca added: ``He knows how to make an uncomfortable at-bat
for you. He knows how to get guys out without throwing the ball
past you. And he's figured out how to do that without having great
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Reynoso is no Randy Johnson. But what he has
been for the Mets thus far has been just fine.

Kenneth Starr's report reached the House on Thursday, it marked
quite a transformation when Gingrich sternly lectured members about

at the Fifth Avenue starting line of a Labor Day parade in
Manhattan on Saturday, wrapped an arm around City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone and tried to drum up support for Vallone in Tuesday's
New York Democratic primary for governor. Reporters swooped in, and
the two men were asked repeatedly and exclusively about Kenneth
Starr's report on President Clinton. Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross,
one of Vallone's rivals in the primary, faced a similar barrage of

   CLINTON-SCHOLARS (Washington) _ Experts on constitutional law
said Saturday that some of the scathing allegations in report by
the Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could
appropriately be defined as impeachable offenses within the meaning
of the Constitution. But in interviews after they had read the
report, several of them said that because impeachment is defined as
a political process by the Constitution, the question of whether
Clinton's actions merited removal from office depends not on legal
analysis but on the public reaction to the details of 445-page
report. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STRATEGY (Washington) _ President Clinton's closest
advisers waited nervously Saturday to see if the most audacious
political gamble of his career _ declaring last month that he told
the truth when he swore he did not have a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky _ would cause the public to turn on his inquisitors
rather than on him.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ As President Clinton starts down a
fateful road with many forks, he will want to walk as slowly as he
can. It would be surprising if he made definitive decisions
quickly. Public opinion coalesces only slowly, and public opinion
will ultimately prove sovereign. It will guide Congress in its
deliberations, as well as the president, but its shape may not be
completely clear for a week or more. By R.W. Apple Jr. (EDS: Note

 &HT;    IN NEW REBUTTAL, CLINTON LAWYERS DECRY STARR'S FOCUS ON SEX
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the American people and members of Congress
absorbed Kenneth Starr's graphic report on President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's lawyers offered a
point-by-point rebuttal Saturday of its legal conclusions and
portrayed the independent counsel as a sex-obsessed prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Starr's lengthy report is public, ``it is plain that
'sex' is precisely what this four-and-a-half-year investigation has
boiled down to,'' Clinton's lawyers said in a 41-page brief
released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address from the White House,
acknowledged that it had been ``an exhausting and difficult week in
the capital _ not only for me, but for many others.'' He said,
however, that he would remain ``focused on the issues the American
people sent us here to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The first polls taken after the report's release offered signs
that public interest was limited in Clinton's affair with the
25-year-old former White House intern. A Gallup poll found 72
percent of Americans agreeing that it was unnecessary for Starr to
include the nitty-gritty details of Clinton's 10 sexual encounters
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, back home in
Atlanta, said such details were unfortunate, although necessary to
support charges of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's point-by-point response to Starr's 11 charges of
impeachable offenses was issued after Clinton's personal lawyer and
White House counsel had actually been able to read the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one denies that the relationship was wrong or that the
president was responsible,'' David Kendall and Charles Ruff said in
their brief. But Starr's report is ``part of a hit-and-run smear
campaign'' that lacks legal merit, much less a reason for
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   They said Starr's report is ``so loaded with irrelevant and
unnecessary graphic and salacious allegations that only one
conclusion is possible: its principal purpose is to damage the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr, in his report, insisted that the details of
Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky were ``crucial to an
informed evaluation'' of her testimony, Clinton's lawyers said the
prosecutor's ``pious defense of its pornographic specificity'' was
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Whitewater, the failed Arkansas land development
venture that was the original subject of Starr's investigation, is
mentioned only twice in the report. ``By contrast, the issue of sex
is mentioned more than 500 times, in the most graphic, salacious
and gratuitous manner,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rebuttal tracked the legal team's ``preliminary''
brief, issued even before the Starr report was distributed to the
public. It said:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The president relied on a narrow definition of ``sexual
relations'' and, therefore, did not commit perjury in denying a
sexual relation with Lewinsky in testimony before a grand jury and
in a deposition in Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against
him.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The president discussed ``the possibility'' of Lewinsky
testifying in the Jones lawsuit, but did so in ``a joking
conversation'' before Lewinsky's name appeared as a possible
witness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The arrangements for Lewinsky to return the president's gifts
were initiated by Lewinsky and involved the president's Oval Office
secretary, Betty Currie, and not the president.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The president's discussions with Currie about Lewinsky could
not have be considered ``witness tampering'' because Currie was not
a witness in any legal proceeding at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers ridiculed Starr's suggestion that the cover
story the president and Lewinsky concocted to conceal their
relationship constitutes obstruction of justice. Such cover stories
are ``hardly a remarkable proposition,'' the said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, they dismissed the notion that the president's refusal
to testify for seven months after the Lewinsky affair became public
is an impeachable offense. ``The president had no legal obligation
to appear before the grand jury absent compulsion and every reason
not to do so, given (Starr's) tactics, illegal leaking and manifest
intent to cause him damage,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lawyerly tone and legal hair-splitting of the brief,
the president's lawyers repeatedly echoed the contrite comments the
president made to a White House prayer breakfast Friday in their
references to the relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having such a relationship is wrong. Trying to keep such a
relationship private, while understandable, is wrong,'' they said.
``But such acts do not even approach the Constitutional test of
impeachment _ 'treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.''

   CLINTON-NY-POLS (New York) _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan stood
at the Fifth Avenue starting line of a Labor Day parade in
Manhattan on Saturday, wrapped an arm around City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone and tried to drum up support for Vallone in Tuesday's
New York Democratic primary for governor. Reporters swooped in, and
the two men were asked repeatedly and exclusively about Kenneth
Starr's report on President Clinton. Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross,
one of Vallone's rivals in the primary, faced a similar barrage of
questions, as did Gov. George Pataki. None of the politicians had
much to say. By Richard Perez-Pena.

   CLINTON-SCHOLARS (Washington) _ Experts on constitutional law
said Saturday that some of the scathing allegations in report by
the Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr could
appropriately be defined as impeachable offenses within the meaning
of the Constitution. But in interviews after they had read the
report, several of them said that because impeachment is defined as
a political process by the Constitution, the question of whether
Clinton's actions merited removal from office depends not on legal
analysis but on the public reaction to the details of 445-page

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of a response by President
Clinton's lawyers to the report submitted by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, to the House of Representatives.
The references to ``narrative at'' a given number are to specific
points in Starr's report.:
</P>
<P>
   INITIAL RESPONSE
</P>
<P>
   to Referral of Office of Independent Counsel
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, 1998, the spokesman for Independent Counsel Kenneth
W. Starr declared that the Office's Monica Lewinsky investigation
``is not about sex. This case is about perjury, subornation of
perjury, witness tampering, obstruction of justice. That is what
this case is about.'' (1) Now that the 450-page Referral to the
United States House of Representatives Pursuant to Title 28, United
States Code 595(c) (the ``Referral'') is public, it is plain that
``sex'' is precisely what this four-and-a-half year investigation
has boiled down to. The Referral is so loaded with irrelevant and
unnecessary graphic and salacious allegations that only one
conclusion is possible: its principal purpose is to damage the
President.
</P>
<P>
   The President has acknowledged and apologized for an
inappropriate sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, so there is no
need to describe that relationship in ugly detail. No one denies
that the relationship was wrong or that the President was
responsible. The Referral's pious defense of its pornographic
specificity is that, in the Independent Counsel's view: ``the
details are crucial to an informed evaluation of the testimony, the
credibility of witnesses, and the reliability of other evidence.
Many of the details reveal highly personal information; many are
sexually explicit. This is unfortunate, but it is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Narrative at 20. This statement is patently false. Any fair
reader of the Referral will easily discern that many of the lurid
allegations, which need not be recounted here, have no
justification at all, even in terms of any OIC legal theory. They
plainly do not relate, even arguably, to activities which may be
within the definition of ``sexual relations'' in the President's
Jones deposition, which is the excuse advanced by the OIC. They are
simply part of a hit-and-run smear campaign, and their inclusion
says volumes about the OIC's tactics and objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Review of a prosecutor's case necessarily starts with an
analysis of the charges, and that is what we offer here. This is
necessarily a very preliminary response, offered on the basis of
less than a day's analysis and without any access to the factual
materials cited in the Referral.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacularly absent from the Referral is any discussion of
contradictory or exculpatory evidence or any evidence that would
cast doubt on the credibility of the testimony the OIC cites (but
does not explicitly quote). This is a failure of fundamental
fairness which is highly prejudicial to the President and it is
reason alone to withhold judgment on the Referral's allegations
until all the prosecutors' evidence can be scrutinized _ and then
challenged, as necessary, by evidence from the President.
</P>
<P>
   The real critique can occur only with access to the materials on
which the prosecutors have ostensibly relied. Only at that time can
contradictory evidence be identified and the context and
consistency (or lack thereof) of the cited evidence be ascertained.
Since we have not been given access to the transcripts and other
materials compiled by the OIC, our inquiry is therefore necessarily
limited. But even with this limited access, our preliminary review
reaffirms how little this highly intrusive and disruptive
investigation has in fact yielded. In instance after instance, the
OIC's allegations fail to withstand scrutiny either as a factual
matter, or a legal matter, or both. The Referral quickly emerges as
a portrait of biased recounting, skewed analysis, and
unconscionable overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   In our Preliminary Memorandum, filed yesterday, at pages 3-12,
we set forth at some length the various ways in which impeachable
``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' have been defined. Nothing in the
Referral even approximates such conduct. In the English practice
from which the Framers borrowed the phrase, ``High Crimes and
Misdemeanors'' denoted political offenses, the critical element of
which was injury to the state. Impeachment was intended to redress
public offenses committed by public officials in violation of the
public trust and duties. Because presidential impeachment
invalidates the will of the American people, it was designed to be
justified for the gravest wrongs _ offenses against the
Constitution itself. In short, only ``serious assaults on the
integrity of the processes of government,'' (2) and ``such crimes
as would so stain a president as to make his continuance in office
dangerous to the public order,'' (3)constitute impeachable
offenses. The eleven supposed ``grounds for impeachment'' set forth
in the section of the Referral called ``Acts That May Constitute
Grounds for an Impeachment'' (``Acts'') fall far short of that high
standard, and their very allegation demeans the constitutional
process. The document is at bottom the overreaching and extravagant
effort to find a case where there is none.

<P>
   ALLEGATION I
</P>
<P>
   Perjury in January 17, 1998,
</P>
<P>
   Deposition
</P>
<P>
   We begin our response to the OIC's charge that the President
committed perjury in his January 17 deposition in the Jones case
with these simple facts: the President's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky was wrong; he admitted it was wrong; and he has asked for
the forgiveness of his family and the American people. The perjury
charges in the Referral in reality serve one principal purpose for
the OIC _ to provide an opportunity to lay out in a public forum as
much salacious, gratuitous detail as possible with the goal of
damaging the President and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The OIC begins its catalogue of ``acts that may constitute
grounds for impeachment'' with the allegation that ``((t))here is
substantial and credible information that President Clinton lied
under oath as a defendant in Jones v. Clinton regarding his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.'' Acts at 5. The OIC contends
that, for legal reasons, it must discuss its allegations of sexual
activity in detail and then goes out of its way to supply lurid
detail after lurid detail that are completely irrelevant to any
legal claim, obviously hoping that the shock value of its footnotes
will overcome the absence of legal foundation for the perjury
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching any fair judgment as to the merits of the OIC's
claim that the President's testimony establishes a basis for
impeachment, it is important to understand a few additional points.
First, the OIC barely acknowledges the elements of perjury,
including, in particular, the substantial burden that must be met
to show that the alleged false statements were made ``knowingly,''
Preliminary Memorandum at 52, or that they were material to the
Jones proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the OIC ignores the careful standards that the courts
have mandated to prevent the misuse of perjury allegations. As was
set out in detail in our Preliminary Memorandum, pages 51-64,
literally true statements cannot be the basis for a perjury
prosecution, even if a witness intends to mislead the questioner.
Likewise, answers to inherently ambiguous questions cannot
constitute perjury. And, normally, a perjury prosecution may not
rest on the testimony of a single witness.
</P>
<P>
   Third, by selectively presenting the facts and failing to set
out the full context of the answers that it claims may have been
perjurious, the OIC has presented a wholly misleading picture. This
tactic is most pronounced in the OIC's astonishing failure to set
out the initial definition of ``sexual relations'' presented by the
Jones lawyers at President Clinton's deposition, two parts of which
were eliminated by Judge Wright as being ``too broad.'' (4) The OIC
also fails to mention that the Jones lawyers were fully able, and
indeed were invited by President Clinton's counsel, to ask the
President specific questions about his sexual encounters, but they
chose not do so. See Preliminary Memorandum at 65.
</P>
<P>
   These surprising and substantial gaps in the Referral, and the
OIC's purposefully incomplete presentation reflect the extreme
weakness of the OIC's contention that the President's deposition
testimony about ``sexual relations'' may constitute perjury.
</P>
<P>
   As any fair prosecutor would acknowledge, what the OIC dismisses
as a mere ``semantical defense'' is, in fact, reflective of the
great care the courts have taken to ensure that a witness is not
charged with perjury except when the government can demonstrate a
clear intent to provide false testimony. Thus, in any ordinary
prosecutor's office, and surely in the chambers of the House
Judiciary Committee, the definitions of such terms as ``sexual
affair,'' ``sexual relations,'' and ``sexual relationship'' would
be seen as vital to a determination whether some violation of law
had occurred. (5)The burden that must be met by the OIC extends
beyond showing that the President was wrong on the semantics, it
must also show that, because perjury is a specific intent crime, he
knew he was wrong and intended to lie _ something that the OIC
could not begin to demonstrate. In fact, all the OIC has is a
witness who has narrow answers to ambiguous questions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers' arguments, however well taken, should not obscure the
President's admission that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was
wrong and his acceptance of responsibility for his conduct. But one
example will suffice to demonstrate the inherent weakness of the
OIC's claim. The OIC argues that oral sex falls within the
definition of sexual relations and that the President therefore
lied when he said he denied having sexual relations. It is,
however, the President's good faith and reasonable interpretation
that oral sex was outside the special definition of sexual
relations provided to him. The OIC simply asserts that it disagrees
with the President's ``linguistic parsing,'' and that reasonable
people would not have agreed with him. Acts at 30. This simply is
not the stuff of which criminal prosecutions _ and surely
impeachment proceedings _ are made.
</P>
<P>
   What is left, then is a disagreement about the very specific
details of certain encounters that the President has acknowledged
were improper _ the very ``oath against oath'' that the law and
experience reject as a basis for a prosecution, because a perjury
conviction cannot rest on simple inconsistencies and memory
disparities between only two witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acknowledging the well-settled legal limits on
perjury cases, or grappling with the important limitations on
perjury prosecutions, the OIC has chosen to fill its report with
unnecessary and salacious sex _ details that cause pain and damage
for absolutely no legitimate reason.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION II
</P>
<P>
   Perjury in August 17, 1998, Grand Jury Testimony
</P>
<P>
   In its second allegation, the OIC contends that ``((t))here is
substantial and credible information that President Clinton lied
under oath to the grand jury about his sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.'' Acts at 40. In particular, the OIC alleges that
the President committed perjury three times: (1) when he testified
that he believed oral sex was not covered by any of the terms and
definitions for sexual activity used at the Jones deposition; (2)
when he contradicted Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony on the
question whether the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or
genitalia during their sexual activity, since ``((t))here can be no
contention that one of them has a lack of memory or is mistaken,''
id.; and (3) when he testified to a purportedly false date on which
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky commenced. None of these
``allegations'' makes out a prima facie case of perjury, and none
can possibly constitute a ``ground'' for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   1. The OIC first claims that the President testified falsely
that he did not believe oral sex to be covered by any of the terms
and definitions for sexual activity used at the Jones deposition.
As noted in response to the first allegation, supra, the terms
``sexual affair'' and ``sexual relationship'' are inherently
ambiguous and, when used without definition, cannot possibly amount
to perjury. The President testified to the grand jury about what he
believed those terms mean. Not content to accept his explanation,
the OIC makes the extraordinary (and factually unsupported) claim
that the President committed perjury before the grand jury by lying
not about some fact but about his belief about the meaning of
certain words. The OIC then compounds this error by claiming as
perjury the President's explanation of his understanding of the
contorted definition of ``sexual relations'' in the Jones suit, as
modified by the court.
</P>
<P>
   This claim is quite stunning. The OIC charges the President with
perjury, saying it is ``not credible'' that the President believed
oral sex fell outside the definition he was given, even though it
plainly did, and even though many commentators and journalists have
stated that they believe that the definition of sexual relations in
the Jones deposition did not include oral sex (performed on the
President). See, e.g., Internight, August 12, 1998 (Cynthia Alksne)
(``when the definition finally was put before the president, it did
not include the receipt of oral sex.''); ``DeLay Urges a Wait For
Starr's Report,'' The Washington Times, August 31, 1998 (``The
definition of sexual relations, used by lawyers for Paula Jones
when they questioned the president, was loosely worded and may not
have included oral sex.''); ``Legally Accurate,'' The National Law
Journal, August 31, 1998 (``Given the narrowness of the
court-approved definition in ((the Jones)) case, Mr. Clinton indeed
may not have perjured himself back then if, say, he received oral
sex but did not reciprocate sexually.''). Despite the fact that
several reasonable commentators agree with the President's
interpretation, the OIC acts as though the President's
interpretation of the definition in the Jones case is both unique
and untenable. It is in fact the OIC's theory that is untenable.
</P>
<P>
   It is beyond debate that false testimony provided as a result of
confusion or mistake cannot as a matter of law constitute perjury.
See United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993); Department
of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement, at 9-69.214. Moreover, if there
is any doubt as to the falsity of testimony, the issue must be
resolved against the government. See United States v. Chaplin, 25
F.3d 1373, 1380 (7th Cir. 1994) (the government must prove falsity
by direct evidence, and not inferences). The definitions on which
the President relies are shared both by dictionaries, see
discussion of Allegation I, supra, and by commentators. The OIC's
very allegation that the President committed perjury by
re-explaining his belief and interpretation to the grand jury is
yet another indication of the extent of the OIC's overreaching in
this Referral. (6)
</P>
<P>
   2. The OIC's next charge _ that the President testified falsely
when he contradicted Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony on the
question whether the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or
genitalia during their sexual activity, is substantially identical
to the allegation contained in Allegation I, supra, and cannot
constitute perjury for the same reason. The critical issue here is
not whether the testimony of the President's and Ms. Lewinsky
differ but whether there is any evidence that the President
knowingly and intentionally gave false testimony. It is worthwhile
to note, however, the inaccuracy of the OIC's assertion that
``((t))here can be no contention that one of them has a lack of
memory or is mistaken'' about the details of their physical
relationship. Acts at 40.
</P>
<P>
   3. The OIC's final allegation here is that the President made a
false statement to the grand jury regarding the timing of the
beginning of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Whereas the
Referral indicates that the President remembers the improper
relationship beginning early in 1996, Ms. Lewinsky has apparently
testified that it began November 15, 1995. As a legal allegation
this claim is frivolous, because the statement by the President
regarding the timing of the relationship (mid-November 1995 as
opposed to January 1996) was utterly immaterial to the grand jury's
investigation. The United States Supreme Court has held that
``there is no doubt that materiality is an element of perjury.''
Johnson v. United States, _ U.S. _, 117 S. Ct. 1544, 1548 (1997).
The test for materiality is whether the statement in question had
``a natural tendency to influence, or ((be)) capable of
influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it
was addressed.'' United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995).
There is no conceivable way in which any statement by the President
with regard to the date (within a few weeks) of the commencement of
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky could possibly have influenced
the grand jury, and the OIC has of course not identified how the
grand jury was ``influenced'' by this testimony. The President
acknowledged to the grand jury his improper relationship, beginning
early in 1996, with Ms.Lewinsky , and his testimony regarding the
date that the relationship began cannot possibly have influenced
the grand jury in any decision-making function. The mere fact that
the OIC would allege perjury as a result of an utterly immaterial
statement speaks volumes about the overreaching in the Referral.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION III
</P>
<P>
   Meetings with Ms. Lewinsky and Gifts
</P>
<P>
   In its third allegation, the OIC makes various claims of perjury
based on President Clinton's statements in the Jones deposition
regarding whether he had been alone with Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval
Office and in an adjacent hallway and whether he and Ms. Lewinsky
had exchanged gifts. Like the other perjury allegations, the OIC
fails to offer a credible case.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, President Clinton did not deny meeting alone
with Ms. Lewinsky at the White House nor deny that they exchanged
gifts. In essence, the OIC's complaint is that President Clinton
was not more forthcoming (plainly not a ground for perjury), rather
than that he knowingly lied under oath. This is perhaps most
clearly seen in the OIC's heading for this allegation, which sets
forth the accusation that President Clinton ``minimized the number
of gifts they had exchanged,'' Acts at 45, which of course concedes
that he acknowledged that gifts were exchanged. There is not much
that is safe from a perjury prosecution if mere ``minimization''
qualifies for the offense. The transcript makes it clear that, when
asked about particular gifts, the President honestly stated his
recollection of the particular item.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can President Clinton's testimony regarding whether he was
alone with Ms. Lewinsky at various times and places constitute
perjury. The Jones lawyers often failed to follow up on incomplete
or unresponsive answers. Read as a whole, the deposition makes
clear that the President acknowledged being alone with Ms. Lewinsky
on some occasions. The Referral unfortunately mischaracterizes the
testimony to suggest an absolute denial, for example, transforming
a question about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval Office
(where the President did not recall engaging in improper contact)
into being alone at all (``The President lied when he said ``I
don't recall'' in response to the question whether he had ever been
alone with Ms. Lewinsky.'' Acts at 51.) And, surprisingly since the
Jones lawyers had been briefed by Ms. Tripp, the Jones lawyers
never asked the President whether he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky in
the study, where some of the alleged activity took place. They were
free to ask specific follow-up questions about the nature and
locale of any physical contact, and they did not do so. The OIC
cannot now hold the President to blame for their failure.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION IV
</P>
<P>
   Discussions with Ms. Lewinsky About Potential Testimony
</P>
<P>
   The Referral claims that in the following exchange in President
Clinton's January 17 deposition in the Jones case he committed
perjury:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you ever talked to Ms. Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this lawsuit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure and let me tell you why I'm not sure. It seems
to me the ... I want to be as accurate as I can here. Seems to me
the last time she was there to see Betty before Christmas we were
joking about how you-all, with the help of the Rutherford
Institute, were going to call every woman I'd ever talked to and
... ask them that, and so I said you would qualify, or something
like that. I don't, I don't think we ever had more of a
conversation than that about it, because when I saw how long the
witness list was, or I heard about it, before I saw, but actually
by the time I saw her name was on it, but I think that was after
all this happened. I might have said something like that, so I
don't want to say for sure I didn't because I might have said
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, if anything, did Monica Lewinsky say in response?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing, that I remember. Whatever she said, I don't
remember. Probably just some predictable thing.
</P>
<P>
   This answer was literally accurate. The President described a
joking conversation that he had with many women about the
possibility that they might be subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. He
made clear that the recollection of the conversation with Ms.
Lewinsky preceded the appearance of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the
witness list (on December 5), saying: ``by the time I saw ((the
witness list on December 6)) her name was on it, but I think that
was after all this had happened.'' The President also stated three
different times in that one answer that he was not certain as to
his recollection, saying, ``I'm not sure,'' ``I don't think,'' and
``I might have said something like that.'' In his grand jury
testimony, additional details of a December 28 conversation with
Ms. Lewinsky were provided by the President. The testimony that the
Referral cites is not inconsistent _ his first answer indicating he
was referring to a conversation that occurred before she had been
named a witness, and his August 17 testimony describing a
conversation after she had been subpoenaed in mid-December. The
fact that Ms. Lewinsky recalls additional conversations on the
subject, all occurring after she had been named on the witness
list, does not establish that the President's answer was
inaccurate. This answer cannot possibly support a perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION V
</P>
<P>
   Concealing Gifts and an Intimate Note
</P>
<P>
   In its fifth allegation, the OIC contends that President Clinton
obstructed justice by concealing gifts he had given to Ms.
Lewinsky. This claim is wholly unfounded and simply absurd. On her
December 28, 1998 visit, the President gave Ms. Lewinsky several
holiday and going-away gifts. Ms. Lewinsky apparently testified
that, during the visit, she raised a question about the Jones
subpoena and suggested ``put((ting)) the gifts away outside of my
house or somewhere or giv((ing)) them to someone, maybe Betty.''
Acts at 74-75. To this suggestion, the President, according to Ms.
Lewinsky's reported testimony, responded with something like, ``I
don't know'' or ``Hmmm'' or ``there really was no response.''
(7)President Clinton contradicts this testimony. But even if one
accepts Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, ``I don't know, ``Hmmm'' and
silence do not constitute obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is contradicted by Ms. Currie
who testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky, not the President, who
asked her to come get the gifts and keep them. The OIC tries to
impugn Ms. Currie's memory in the quoted passage, yet her
recollection is consistent with the testimony of one of the two
other parties to the events. Indeed, the OIC's effort to shore up
its case by trying to discount Ms. Currie's testimony on this point
is a prime example of the dangers of relying on the OIC's
development and presentation of the evidence. When confronted with
testimony not to its liking from Ms. Currie, the OIC responded by
questioning her in a manner clearly designed to encourage Ms.
Currie to restate her recollection in a manner consistent with the
OIC's theory of the case. Acts at 77. (8)
</P>
<P>
   The OIC's theory of concealment also is belied by Ms. Lewinsky's
decision to turn over some, but not all, of the gifts she had
received from the President to Ms. Currie; if the purpose of the
exercise was to avoid having gifts in her possession at the time of
the deposition (which of course would not have been proper),
retaining some gifts made no sense. But the OIC is forced to
acknowledge that only one of the several gifts the President gave
to Ms. Lewinsky on December 28, 1998, was included in the box she
gave to Ms. Currie for safekeeping. The theory makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the only theory that does make sense is the truth,
as testified to by the President and Ms. Currie and as supported by
the fact that the President acknowledged giving Ms. Lewinsky gifts
as early as his January 17, 1998 deposition. The President was
unconcerned about the gifts he had given to Ms. Lewinsky because he
frequently exchanges gifts with friends. That's why he gave her
additional gifts on December 28 even though, according to her
testimony, he knew the Jones lawyers were interested in them. Thus,
when she raised a question, he told Ms. Lewinsky she had to turn
over what she had; they were of no concern to him. Nonetheless, in
response to Ms. Lewinsky's subsequent request, Ms. Currie drove to
Ms. Lewinsky's apartment and picked up a box of gifts from Ms.
Lewinsky and held them for safekeeping. The President did not
direct or encourage Ms. Currie's activities regarding the gifts. He
likewise did not obstruct justice by concealing their existence.
</P>
<P>
   The OIC also argues that the President obstructed justice in the
Jones case by destroying an intimate note that Ms. Lewinsky
included in a book she left for him on January 4, 1998. (9) The OIC
states in its Referral that the President was served with a
document request from the Jones lawyers on December 16, 1997, that
required him to produce this note to the Jones lawyers. The
disingenuousness of this allegation is apparent on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   As a preliminary matter, the President testified that he
recalled receiving a book from Ms. Lewinsky, that he believed he
had received it in December, and that he did not recall receiving
an accompanying note. Deposition of the President, August 17, 1998.
Contrary to the one-sided presentation of the purported facts in
the OIC's referral, the President may not even have received that
note.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the OIC asserts, without basis, that the President
purposefully destroyed Ms. Lewinsky's note because he did not want
to have to turn it over to the Jones lawyers. The OIC has
absolutely no basis for assuming that the President was aware of
the document request at the time he received the book. Thus, even
assuming the President had received and discarded the note, his
acts would not constitute obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, setting aside whether the President actually received
Ms. Lewinsky's note, or knew whether it was subject to a document
request, at bottom the OIC is transforming a civil discovery issue
into yet another flimsy criminal charge, accusing the President
with obstruction of justice on the basis of his alleged failure to
produce this note to the Jones lawyers. As the OIC clearly knows,
the obstruction of justice statute does not apply to a party's
concealing or withholding of discoverable documents in civil
litigation. See, e.g., Richmark v. Timber Falling Consultants, 730
F. Supp. 1525, 1532 (D. Or. 1990) (``((t))he parties have not cited
and the court has not found any case in which a person was charged
with obstruction of justice for concealing or withholding discovery
in a civil case''). Demonstrable non-compliance with the rules is
sanctioned civilly as an abuse of the discovery process. See Rule
37, Fed. R. Civ. P. (``Failure to Make Disclosure or Cooperate in
Discovery: Sanctions''). Therefore, even if, as the OIC alleges,
the President received and discarded the note in the wake of an
outstanding request _ which the President testified he did not
_those actions would not constitute obstruction of justice. The
OIC's allegation is missing both the facts and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION VI
</P>
<P>
   Concealment of the Relationship
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth allegation, the OIC contends that there is
substantial and credible information that:
</P>
<P>
   (i) President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an understanding that
they would lie under oath in the Jones case about their
relationship; and
</P>
<P>
   (ii) President Clinton endeavored to obstruct justice by
suggesting that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit so that she would
not be deposed, she would not contradict his testimony, and he
could attempt to avoid questions about Ms. Lewinsky at his
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the OIC's argument is that because the President
and Ms. Lewinsky attempted to conceal the improper nature of their
relationship while it was going on, and because the President
failed affirmatively to assure that each statement contained in the
affidavit filed by Ms. Lewinsky was true, that he obstructed
justice. The Referral fails even to allege facts that, if true,
would constitute obstruction of justice under the law as set out in
our Preliminary Memorandum at pp. 21-25.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Referral alleges that during the course of their
admittedly improper relationship, the President and Ms. Lewinsky
concealed the nature of their relationship from others. This is
hardly a remarkable proposition. The use of ``cover stories'' to
conceal such a relationship, apart from any proceeding, of course
is not unusual and not an obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Referral alleges only one specific statement that Ms.
Lewinsky claims the President made to her regarding the substance
of her testimony. Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President told
her, ``You know, you can always say you were coming to see Betty or
that you were bringing me letters.'' Act at 98. As an initial
matter, the President testified that he did not recall saying
anything like that in connection with Ms. Lewinsky's testimony in
the Jones case. But even if he did, neither of those two ambiguous
statements would be false. And most importantly, as even the OIC
concedes, Narrative at 29, the President never nstructed her to
lie.
</P>
<P>
   The Referral also alleges that the President somehow obstructed
justice by suggesting to Ms. Lewinsky that she could sign an
affidavit in the Jones case. But the Referral again fails to
establish how this might constitute obstruction. The OIC makes no
contention that the President ever told Ms. Lewinsky to file a
false affidavit. A suggestion to submit written testimony under
oath in a judicial proceeding, if he made it, is hardly improper _
let alone an obstruction of justice. The President was aware that
other potential deponents in the Jones case had filed affidavits in
an attempt to avoid the expense, burden, and humiliation of
testifying in the Jones case, and that there was a chance doing so
might enable Ms. Lewinsky to avoid testifying. According to the
Referral, Ms. Lewinsky ``understood the President's advice to mean
that she might be able to execute an affidavit that would not
disclose the true nature of their relationship.'' Acts at 90.
Moreover, even if the affidavit did not ``disclose the true nature
of their relationship,'' since the Jones case concerned allegations
of nonconsensual sexual solicitation, a truthful albeit limited
affidavit might have allowed her to have avoided giving a Jones
deposition. But the President never told Ms. Lewinsky what to say
in the affidavit, knew that Ms. Lewinsky had her own lawyer to
protect her interests, and expressly declined the opportunity to
review the content of the affidavit, according to Ms. Lewinsky.
Narrative at 203. The OIC's position appears to be that this is
somehow obstruction of justice _ that the President had an
affirmative duty to assure that Ms. Lewinsky volunteered in her
affidavit all information in which the Jones lawyers might possibly
have an interest. There simply is no such duty under the law, nor
does the OIC cite any basis for such a duty. Civil litigation is
based upon an adversarial process of determining truth, and a party
is under no affirmative obligation to assist an opponent in every
way it can.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the OIC suggests that the President was ``knowingly
responsible'' for a misstatement of fact to a federal judge because
he failed to correct a statement made by his lawyer to the court in
the Jones deposition. The President testified to the grand jury
that the lawyers' argument at the start of the deposition ``passed
((him)) by;'' he also remarked that the statement of his law might
be literally true. The OIC distorts this response to suggest the
President testified that he did not correct the statement at the
January deposition because it might have been true. We do not
believe the testimony would support that claim.
</P>
<P>
   There is of course no legal obligation imposed on a client to
listen to every word his attorney says, and the OIC has no evidence
that the President even focused on or absorbed his attorney's
remark. Without any evidence whatsoever, the OIC asserts that the
President knew what was said, knew he was somehow responsible for
it, and ignored a duty to correct it. Yet, again, the OIC has made
a wholly-unsupportable allegation of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION VII
</P>
<P>
   Job Search for Ms. Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   In its seventh allegation, the Referral contends that certain
actions taken on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky in her job efforts amounted
to obstruction of justice. The Referral acknowledges that the case
for obstruction based on the job search is wholly circumstantial
and that there is absolutely ``no evidence'' of any ``arrangement
... explicitly spelled out.'' Acts at 113 n.361. Noting that the
critical issue centers on the intent of the party providing the
assistance, the Referral asks that ``inferences be drawn'' from the
circumstantial evidence set forth in the Referral chronology. Id.
at 113.
</P>
<P>
   But that chronology presents precious little in the way of
Presidential involvement and nothing that supports an inference of
any intent to obstruct justice by helping Ms. Lewinsky (to the
limited extent he did) in her job efforts. It may be the OIC's view
that the President should have cast Ms. Lewinsky off and refused to
assist her in any way, simply because the Jones case was filed.
Fortunately the law requires no such callous absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   The Referral states that the President agreed to help Ms.
Lewinsky look for a job, Acts at 105; that he said he would take
care of finding her a reference from someone in the White House,
Id. at 105; and that after Ms. Lewinsky obtained a job, the
President asked Erskine Bowles ``could we see if ((John Hilley))
could recommend her, if asked,'' Id. at 111-12. There is no
suggestion that he ever ordered or directed anyone to assist Ms.
Lewinsky or asked anyone to give her special advantages or
disadvantages because of their relationship or that he ever linked
his relatively insubstantial assistance to a requirement that she
act _ or testify _ in a certain way. The kinds of actions that are
alleged simply do not constitute obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, upon close reading, the Referral itself acknowledges the
following facts, which , if taken as true, are all at odds with the
notion that the President acted with corrupt intent:
</P>
<P>
   _ that it was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated discussions about a job
in New York, Acts at 104, Narrative at 117;
</P>
<P>
   _ that the subject of a job in New York was raised on July 3,
1997 _ more than three months before the President was served with
interrogatories in the Jones case, and more than five months before
Ms. Lewinsky's name appeared on a witness list. Acts at 104;
</P>
<P>
   _ that it was Ms. Lewinsky who broached the subject of receiving
the President's help in obtaining a job in New York; Acts at
104-05;
</P>
<P>
   _ that Ms. Lewinsky presented the President with a list of jobs
in which she was interested; Acts at 105;
</P>
<P>
   _ that Ms. Lewinsky suggested that a White House job reference
would be useful, Acts at 105;
</P>
<P>
   _ that Ms. Lewinsky suggested that Vernon Jordan might be able
to help her, Acts at 105; and
</P>
<P>
   _ that, notwithstanding the Referral's insinuations to the
contrary, the President and Ambassador Bill Richardson testified
that they never discussed Ms. Lewinsky with each other, Narrative
at 145.
</P>
<P>
   This account fails to allege facts supporting a case of
obstruction of justice under the only statute that could
conceivably apply here, 18 U.S.C. 1503. Under that provision, the
government must prove obstruction of justice by establishing that
there was a pending judicial proceeding, that the defendant knew of
the proceeding, and that the defendant acted ``corruptly'' with the
specific intent to obstruct or interfere with the proceeding or due
administration of justice. See, e.g., United States v. Buicey, 876
F.2d 1297, 1314 (7th Cir. 1989); United States v. Smith, 729 F.
Supp. 1380 (D.C.C. 1990). Four federal courts of appeals have held
that the ``act corruptly'' element of the crime requires that the
defendant have acted with the specific intent to obstruct justice.
See, e.g., United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1219, 1236 (2d
Cir.1983); United States v. Bashaw, 982 F.2d 168, 170 (6th Cir.
1992); United States v. Rasheed, 663 F.2d 843, 847 (9th Cir. 1981).
It is simply not enough that the effects of a person's actions may
have had the effect of somehow impeding justice if that was not the
intent of the person accused. And here it is not even clear how the
President's limited assistance was meant to or did obstruct
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION VIII
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Mr. Jordan
</P>
<P>
   The OIC asserts in its eighth allegation that the President was
``asked during his civil deposition whether he had talked to Mr.
Jordan about Ms. Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones case'' and
that he ``stated that he did not recall whether Mr. Jordan had
talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the Jones case.''
Acts at 115. This account of the question and answer is simply
false. The President was not asked that question, and he did not
give that answer.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster this extraordinary claim, the OIC misrepresents
certain of the President's deposition responses. First, the OIC
quotes one question and answer _
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did anyone other than your attorneys ever tell you that
Monica Lewinsky had been served with a subpoena in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so. (emphasis added in Referral)
</P>
<P>
   _ but omits the next question and answer, even though it is
apparent from the text, and the OIC was told by the President, that
the next question and answer were a continuation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever talk with Monica Lewinsky about the possibility
that she might be asked to testify in this case?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bruce Lindsey, I think Bruce Lindsey told me that she was, I
think maybe that's the first person told me she was. I want to be
as accurate as I can.
</P>
<P>
   This unresponsive answer reflects the President's effort to
recall, in response to the prior question, where he had first
learned about the subpoena, but the word ``first'' implies there
were other people (perhaps Mr. Jordan) who told him. The Jones
lawyers simply did not pursue this by asking the logical follow-up
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the remaining two passages state what the OIC claims. The
next passage asked whether, in the past two weeks (before January
17) anyone had reported to the President that they had had a
conversation with Ms. Lewinsky about the lawsuit, to which the
President replied he did not believe so. This response of course
does not rule out all conversations with Mr. Jordan about Ms.
Lewinsky's involvement in the case, as the OIC would suggest, but
only in the two-week period and only accounts of conversations with
Ms. Lewinsky, not conversations simply about her involvement in the
case. Moreover, the OIC's 252-page Narrative does not identify
reports to the President about conversations that Mr. Jordan had
with Ms. Lewinsky in that time period _ instead, it recounts only
that, 10 days before the deposition, Mr. Jordan left word for the
President that the affidavit was signed. The last passage on which
the OIC relies simply asked whether the President had heard that
Mr. Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky met to discuss the case; the President
recounted his belief that the two had met to discuss the job search
_ about which the President readily acknowledged an awareness.
Again, he simply did not testify that ``he did not recall whether
Mr. Jordan had talked to Ms. Lewinsky about her involvement in the
Jones case.'' This allegation is a fabrication by the OIC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION IX
</P>
<P>
   ``Witness Tampering''
</P>
<P>
   In its ninth allegation the OIC charges that President Clinton
obstructed justice and improperly influenced a witness when he
spoke with Ms. Currie the day after his deposition in the Jones
case. The OIC's claims are wrong and, again, the product of
extraordinary overreaching and pejorative conjecture _ a
transparent attempt to draw the most negative inference possible
about lawful conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The President's actions could not as a matter of law give rise
to either charge because Ms. Currie was not a witness in any
proceeding at the time he spoke with her: Her name had not appeared
on any of the Jones witness lists; she had not been named as a
witness in the Jones case; there were just two weeks of discovery
left in the case; and there was no reason to suspect she would play
any role in that case. The President had no reason to suspect that
the OIC had embarked on a wholly new phase of its four-year
investigation one in which Ms. Currie would elater be called by the
OIC as a witness. To obstruct a proceeding or tamper with a
witness, there must be both a witness and a proceeding. Here, there
was neither. Despite the OIC's far-fetched suggestion to the
contrary, there was no reason the President should not have spoken
with Ms. Currie about Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is hardly surprising that the President would have
reached out to Ms. Currie after the deposition. Ms. Currie was Ms.
Lewinsky's friend. The President had just faced unexpected and
hostile questioning by his fierce political opponents in the Jones
case about Ms. Lewinsky. He was obviously puzzled at being asked
such detailed (and in some cases such bizarrely inaccurate)
questions about a past secret relationship. He had no one to whom
he could talk freely about the relationship, but he nonetheless had
a desire to find out what might have transpired with Ms. Lewinsky
and to test his recall, since he had not anticipated such detailed
questions or prepared for them. It was his belief that Ms. Currie
was unaware that he had engaged in improper activity with Ms.
Lewinsky. He wanted to reassure himself that that was so. He also
recalled that in 1997, after the improper relationship ended, he
had asked Ms. Currie to try always to be present when Ms. Lewinsky
visited. He wanted to inquire whether that also was so Ms. Currie's
recollection. The President's actions were hardly surprising since
he had just undergone hostile and unexpected questioning in a
bitterly contested civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his reasons, however, one simple fact remains. At the
time he discussed Ms. Lewinsky with Ms. Currie, Ms. Currie was not
expected to be, nor was she, a witness. Again, the OIC has wholly
overreached to make baseless allegations of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION X
</P>
<P>
   Refusal to Testify
</P>
<P>
   The tenth allegation is premised on a falsehood. Its assertion
that ``((the President)) simultaneously lied to potential grand
jury witnesses,'' ``((w))hile refusing to testify for seven
months'' is a gross distortion of the Referral's own citations.
</P>
<P>
   The statements to Presidential aides cited by the Referral were
made either on the day the Lewinsky story broke (January 21, 1998)
or within a few days of that date. Those statements were concurrent
in time with the President's repeated public statements to the
country denying sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. And they were
virtually identical in substance. Having announced to the whole
country on live television that he was not having sexual relations
with Ms. Lewinsky, it is simply absurd to believe that he was
somehow attempting to corruptly influence the testimony of aides
when he told them virtually the same thing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   And in any event, the mere repetition of a public denial to
these aides could not have affected the grand jury process. The
elicited testimony was hearsay. The aides were not witnesses to any
sexual activity, and they had no first-hand knowledge pertinent to
the denials. Their testimony as to what they heard from the
President was truthful _ the President in no conceivable way sought
to alter any other perceptions or information they might have had.
Their testimony thus was merely cumulative, given the President's
own nationally broadcast statements. The suggestion that the
President violated section 1503's prohibition on ``influenc((ing)),
obstruct((ing)), or imped((ing)) the due administration of
justice'' is groundless. There is and could be no evidence that the
President had a specific intent to obstruct justice by his aides'
repetition of his own denials.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is their evidence that the President's statements
constituted ``witness tampering'' in violation of section 1512. To
make out such a violation, the government must show that the
behavior knowingly occurred through one of the specific means set
forth in the statute: _ intimidation, physical force, threats,
misleading conduct or corrupt persuasion _ with intent to influence
testimony in a legal proceeding. A defendant must be aware of the
legal proceeding's existence, and his efforts must be aimed
specifically at obstructing that proceeding. See United States v.
Wilson, 565 F. Supp. 1416, 1431 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). In fact, the
President simply repeated to aides substantially the same statement
he made to the whole country. There was no action here intended
specifically to influence the grand jury through the testimony of
Presidential aides. Under the OIC's theory, it could have
subpoenaed to the grand jury any citizen who heard the President's
denial and thus create a new violation of law.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the President's statements to his aides cannot obstruct
justice as a matter of law. Their legal duty was to answer the
prosecutor's questions and to tell the truth honestly as they knew
it, and the President's comments in no conceivable way affected
that duty.
</P>
<P>
   The OIC suggests that the President's delay in acknowledging a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky somehow contributed to an
obstruction of justice because it affected how the prosecutors
would conduct the investigation. This claim is unfounded, as a
matter of law. The President had no legal obligation to appear
before the grand jury absent compulsion and every reason not to do
so, given the OIC's tactics, illegal leaking, and manifest intent
to cause him damage.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ALLEGATION XI
</P>
<P>
   Abuse of Power
</P>
<P>
   As the Office of Independent Counsel itself acknowledges (Acts
at 148), from the very beginning, its investigation was focused on
the prospect that the information it was gathering would be
transmitted to the Congress. It is in this context, with the threat
of impeachment on the horizon, that the OIC's last allegation of an
abuse of power must be judged.
</P>
<P>
   The OIC begins with the charge that the President's false denial
that he had an improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky _ something
that he has now admitted and apologized for _ was itself an abuse
of power because it served to deceive the American people. Implicit
in this charge is the notion that any official, in any branch of
the government, who makes a public statement about his own conduct,
or indeed any other matter, that is not true may be removed from
office. It would follow, therefore, that no official could mount a
defense to impeachment, or to ethics charges, or to a criminal
investigation while remaining in office, for anything other than an
immediate admission of guilt will necessarily be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described abuse of
power as the ``corrupt use of the office for personal gain or some
other improper purpose.'' President Nixon's false statements to the
public and to the courts, which were part of a scheme to obstruct
justice through the perjury of his senior staff, through payoffs to
criminal defendants, and through use of the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) to thwart an FBI investigation into crimes in which he
was involved, fit squarely within that definition. Merely to
describe that conduct makes clear how different it is from that of
President Clinton and how far the OIC has been willing to go to
synthesize its charges of impeachable conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The manifest intent to create improprieties where none exist and
to transform personal misconduct into impeachable official
malfeasance is evident also in the OIC's claim that the President's
assertion of executive privilege was somehow unlawful. Oddly
enough, the OIC finds abuse of power both in the assertion of the
privilege and its withdrawal _ surely evidence of an overwrought
imagination or of a conceit that any legal position other than the
OIC's is presumptively obstructive. In truth, the OIC's decision to
invade the confidential relationship between the President and his
most senior advisors and lawyers was unprecedented. It reflects a
patent abuse of authority by the OIC and a wholesale abandonment of
any prosecutorial judgment in a campaign to prevent the President
from consulting meaningfully with his advisors. At bottom, the
Independent Counsel seems to believe that, merely because he
chooses to seek confidential information from the Office of the
President, the President may not contest that demand without
risking a charge that he is abusing his power.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the OIC's Referral, one would never know which party to
the executive party litigation was right and which was wrong on the
basic question whether the privilege applied to the communications
the OIC was seeking to obtain. In the District Court, the OIC took
the position that executive privilege was simply inapplicable in
the face of its grand jury subpoena because the communications at
issue related to the President's private conduct, but Chief Judge
Johnson rejected that claim out of hand. In re Grand Jury
Proceedings, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7736 (D.D.C. 1998).
Astoundingly, however, the OIC simply repeats that claim in the
Referral (Acts at 155), with no acknowledgement that the court
agreed with the White House that the privilege had been properly
asserted. (10)
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the OIC's abuse-of power allegation must
necessarily rest on the assumption that the President initiated the
executive privilege claim with intent to impede the OIC's
investigation. Yet, the record is clear that it was only after
extensive negotiations in which the White House offered to make
available to the OIC factual information concerning the President's
conduct and had its offer rejected out of hand, that the White
House Counsel notified the President of the OIC's demands,
explained the failed accommodation effort, and recommended that he
invoke the privilege because Counsel believed it important to
protect the constitutional interests of the presidency. Thus, the
President's decision to claim privilege was not the result of his
own initiative, much less of any intent to obstruct the grand jury
investigation, but rather was the result of his Counsel's advice.
(11)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more egregiously misleading is the claim that the
President abused his power by ``acquiescing'' in the efforts of the
Secret Service to assert a protective function privilege. First,
the OIC characterizes that assertion as frivolous even though it
reflected the judgment of the law enforcement professionals charged
with protecting this and future presidents and was supported by
President Bush. (12) Further, the OIC charges the President with
abusing his power despite the fact that the OIC knew that he had
nothing to do with the decision to assert the privilege or to
pursue the appeal from Judge Johnson's decision. Indeed, the OIC
itself had argued (in contesting the claim of the Secret Service in
the district court) that the failure of the President to involve
himself in the matter was itself a reason for the court to reject
the Service's claim. The OIC cannot have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last, the OIC charges that it was an abuse of power for the
President, at a time when both his personal and official interests
were in the balance, not to testify before the grand jury until
August _ surely a claim that must astound lawyers and laymen alike.
Could the OIC truly be taking the position that any government
official who is the subject of a criminal investigation must
immediately come forward and testify at a prosecutor's whim or risk
impeachment? To state the question is to answer it.

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton tried in his Saturday
radio address to turn the natin's focus back onto issues, but his
White House was busy preparing a detailed rebuttal to Independent
Counsel Ken Starr's report. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PANEL _ WASHINGTON _ In a Capitol largely empty of
lawmakers, members and staff of the House Judiciary Committee
worked Saturday at sorting through the boxes of evidence supporting
the Starr report. A peek at the process. (Carr, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-NOTEBOOK _ WASHINGTON _ Covering the White House this
week was like a journey through the Looking Glass. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-WORLD-REAX _ The intimate details of President Clinton's
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky were on front pages around
the world, while newspaper editorials in Europe and Asia called on
him to resign. A newspaper in Botoga, Colombia, said Clinton
``seems to have confused the Oval Office with the Oral Office.''
(Alexander, with feeds from the Cox foreign staff).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ARKANSAS _ The talk of Arkansas. (Williams, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-DUKE _ Reaction from Duke Law School. The last president
to go through this kind of process was a Duke grad. Now, the man
who may bring down another president is a Duke grad. (Burritt,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BANDWIDTH _ There must be 50 ways to post the Starr
report. Just how did they did all those hundreds of pages on to
Internet sites all over the world. Who sat up all night typing all
the tedious html coding. Who has hard copy, who has disks, who the
codes. How much bandwidth is needed to prevent a total meltdown.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PIPELINE _ In Atlanta a train wreck was wreaking havoc
on Net traffic by breaking a critical fiber optic pipeline run by
WorldCom, which carries service for virtually of Atlanta's Internet
service providers including BellSouth.dot net and Mindspring.
(Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PARODY _ What will come up when the unsuspecting
Internet users searches the words ''Starr Report?'' If history is
an indicator everything from fringe political sites to crude,
pornographic parodies. The posting of the reports plays right into
some of the Net's most sensitive weaknesses. How are unsuspecting
users supposed to know what's real? (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-FAY _ Profile of Atlanta-based judge on panel that

<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-DEADLOCKED-1STLEDE-$ADV13 _ (Corrects reported number of
Palestinian deaths since the Oslo Accords.) ITZHAR, West Bank _
Amid the olive orchards and goat herds fields on this hillside,
Arabs and Jews are filling the void caused by stalled peace talks
with aggressive moves aimed at getting an edge for an uncertain
future. Two Jewish settlers were killed here recently in an ambush
laid, presumably, by Palestinians. Already worried that they will
literally lose ground in future concessions, the settlers responded
with 15 new homes in the occupied territory, just the kind of move
that American diplomats and Palestinians warn will destroy what is
left of the peace process. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   MEXICO-CORRUPTION-$ADV13 _ MORELOS, Mexico _ In some cases,
entire families have been kidnapped and held for ransom during
Mexico's recent crime plague. Almost everyone has a tale to tell
about being robbed or assaulted. But it's high-level corruption
among law officials and political figures _ as much as common
criminals _ who many blame for Mexico's struggle with injustice
these days. Corruption is spotlighted in news reports that are more
aggressive than they once were, and popular citizens' movements
have had some success in driving allegedly corrupt political
figures out of office _ achievements once unheard of in Mexico. But
every day, it seems, there are new reports of suspected acts of
corruption that are testing public patience. Police are arrested
for rape and kidnapping; a former Mexico City transportation
director is arrested for misuse of funds; bankers are reviled for
helping themselves to bad loans and then expecting the public
treasury to bail them out. Is corruption getting worse, or it
simply being exposed more? (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   JAMAICA-BIRDWATCHING-$ADV12 _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sure,
Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies _ Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   MOUNT-VERNON _ MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George
Washington died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation
overlooking the Potomac River, his house is getting
air-conditioning. That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer
visitors have sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home
of the nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to
keep guides from fainting in the stifling heat. But a few

 WASHINGTON: answer it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   It has come down to this.
</P>
<P>
   After four years, scores of FBI agents, hundreds of subpoenas,
thousands of documents, and tens of millions of dollars. After
hiring lawyers, accountants, IRS agents, outside consultants, law
professors, personal counsel, ethics advisers, and a professional
public relations expert. After impaneling grand juries and leasing
office space in three jurisdictions, and investigating virtually
every aspect of the President's business, financial, political,
official and, ultimately, personal life, the Office of Independent
Counsel has presented to the House a Referral that no prosecutor
would present to any jury.
</P>
<P>
   The President has admitted he had an improper relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky. He has apologized. The wrongfulness of that
relationship is not in dispute. And yet that relationship is the
relentless focus of virtually every page of the OIC's Referral.
</P>
<P>
   In 445 pages, the Referral mentions Whitewater, the failed land
deal which originated its investigation, twice. It never once
mentions other issues it has been investigating for years _ matters
concerning the firing of employees of the White House travel office
and the controversy surrounding the FBI files. By contrast, the
issue of sex is mentioned more than 500 times, in the most graphic,
salacious and gratuitous manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Independent Counsel is asking the House of
Representatives to undertake its most solemn and consequential
process short of declaring war; to remove a duly, freely and fairly
elected President of the United States because he had _ as he has
admitted _ an improper, illicit relationship outside of his
marriage. Having such a relationship is wrong. Trying to keep such
a relationship private, while understandable, is wrong. But such
acts do not even approach the Constitutional test of impeachment _
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The founders were wise to set such a high standard, and were
wise to vest this awesome authority in the hands of the most
democratic and accountable branch of our Government, and not in the
hands of unaccountable prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   We have sought in this Initial Response to begin the process of
rebutting the OIC's charges against the President _ charges legal
experts have said would not even be brought against a private
citizen. The President did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct
justice. He did not tamper with witnesses. And he did not abuse the
power of the office of the Presidency.

   1 CNN Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer (May 31, 1998). Other
commentators and journalists have made similar assertions. See,
e.g., The Washington Times (March 19, 1998); The New York Times

Times (July 29, 1998).

<P>
   4 The President was presented with the following definition, as
we understood the court to have amended:
</P>
<P>
   Definition of Sexual Relations
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
``sexual relations'' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
_
</P>
<P>
   (1) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person;
</P>
<P>
   (2) contact between any part of the person's body or an object
and the genitals and anus of another person; or
</P>
<P>
   (3) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and any
part of another person's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' means intentional touching, either directly or
through clothing.
</P>
<P>
   5 For example, dictionary definitions of ``sexual relations''
expressly support the President's interpretation. See, e.g.,
Webster's Third International Dictionary (defining ``sexual
relations'' as ``coitus''). Yet, apparently, the OIC did not bother
to check a dictionary before leveling its accusations.
</P>
<P>
   6 This overreaching is compounded by the complete lack of legal
citation and analysis in the Referral. Perjury is a specific intent
crime, and is an area of the law in which stringent safeguards have
been erected to make perjury prosecutions exceedingly difficult.
Rather than explain how, notwithstanding these safeguards, it has
made out a valid perjury charge, the OIC has elected simply to
forego discussing the law entirely.
</P>
<P>
   7 The ambiguity and indeterminacy of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
here, as quoted by the OIC, dramatically illustrates the need to
review carefully all the materials which the OIC cryptically cites
in the Referral.
</P>
<P>
   8 The lengths to which the OIC is willing to go to force
evidence into the picture it wants to draw is further revealed by
its citation to the fact that Ms. Currie drove to Ms. Lewinsky's
apartment to pick up the gifts as evidence that Ms. Lewinsky's
story, rather than Ms. Currie's, is the correct one. According to
the OIC, ``the person making the extra effort (in this case, Ms.
Currie) is ordinarily the person requesting the favor.'' Acts at
83. There is no basis in logic or experience for this position.
</P>
<P>
   9 The United States Secret Service WAVE records do not reflect a
clearance request or an entry into the White House complex by Ms.
Lewinsky on this date (or any other date in 1998).
</P>
<P>
   10 Judge Johnson then asked the OIC to make a showing of its
need for the information and found that that showing was sufficient
to overcome the privilege. At that point, the White House elected
not to pursue the issue as to the non-lawyer advisors, and they
testified at length before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   11 Similarly, the OIC misleads the Congress and the public by
blaming the President for pursuing an appeal from rulings of the
District Court involving executive privilege claims by lawyers in
the White House Counsel's Office. It does so without acknowledging
the fact that White House Counsel had informed Independent Counsel
Starr, in a letter dated September 4, that those appeals had been
taken only to preserve an issue raised for the first time by the
Court of Appeals in a recent opinion dealing with the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   12 The OIC also argues that Chief Justice Rehnquist's decision
to deny a stay reflects a judgment that the Service's claim was
frivolous, but fails to disclose that the Chief Justice
specifically left open the prospect that the Court would decide to
hear an appeal on the merits.

GETTING WIRED FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to gain a competitive advantage, some residential
builders across the state are constructing homes with what they say
is the amenity of the future _ a high-tech wiring system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that technology in the house is getting to
be a big thing, particularly among baby boomers who are driving
this market, and it will increase tremendously in the next
decade,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the
National Homebuilders Association in Washington. As more developers
begin offering houses equipped with such technology, he said,
others will be left with no choice but to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently a second phone line and a cable television hookup
used to be just about all that was needed in most homes. Today,
however, many families are requiring an increasing amount of wiring
for everything from faxes and computers to electronic security and
lighting systems.
</P>
<P>
   To respond to these home buyers _ whom some in the building
industry have dubbed ``TAFs,'' for ``technologically advanced
families'' _ developers are installing high-tech wiring systems.
Generally, they integrate multiple communication and electronic
services and deliver them throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   All the wires tie into a central panel, which has video and
telecommunication distribution modules that allow homeowners to
direct which features they want in what room.
</P>
<P>
   The system permits the homeowner to have stereo as well as cable
and satellite TV in every room, to deliver high-speed Internet
service, to support computer networking and to provide lighting and
energy control.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows homeowners to add a video camera so they can view
visitors at the front door from a television screen, or to set up a
complete home office, a possibility that underscores the trend of
more people working from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most developers in New Jersey are providing basic systems as
either a standard feature or an option in their new homes. The
systems vary in cost from $700 to $2,700 depending on the size of
the house as well as the number of outlets and modules. But just
like personal computers, they can be upgraded. Such wiring can be
added by homeowners after the house is built. But the work is more
costly because it involves knocking down parts of walls and
rebuilding them.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer demand for such systems, while not booming, is gaining
ground. In its 1998 Consumer Survey on Housing, Professional
Builder magazine in Des Plaines, Ill., reported that out of 598 new
home buyers surveyed, 31.7 percent ranked prewiring as a
``must-have feature'' and that they were willing to spend $963 to
$1,106 on average for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building industry has a history of slowly accepting new
technology,'' said Dan McLeister, a senior editor at the magazine.
It is ``a chicken-and-egg thing,'' McLeister said, adding that
builders remain hesitant because they are uncertain consumers want
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common response from managers is that no one is requesting
it, that it's not widespread,'' said Kira McCarron, vice president
of marketing at Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., a major
developer of high-end homes.
</P>
<P>
   So far the company has ``managed successfully'' by taking a
custom approach with buyers of its homes in the $600,000 and over
price range, Ms. McCarron said, adding that ``at some point in the
future, if the demand is there we will put in a system.''
</P>
<P>
   McLeister said developers were also unsure about the quality of
the product, though more and larger companies are introducing
systems. Among them are Bell Atlantic, Honeywell, Lucent Technology
and AMP Building Systems, a division of AMP Inc. of Harrisburg,
Pa., a manufacturer of electronic devices. But, said McLeister, in
the current healthy housing market most builders feel no need to
offer new amenities.
</P>
<P>
   McLeister said developers offering the upgraded wiring were
doing so on the premise that buyers ``can future-proof their homes
and help increase the resale value of their homes because if they
can't use the wiring, people five years from now probably will.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the thinking of Roseland Property Co. of Roseland, N.J.,
which is installing an advanced wiring system as a standard feature
at the six projects it is now developing, including Hunting Ridge,
a 208-unit town house development along Route 46 and Beverwyck Road
in Parsippany. Prices for the 1,700- to 2,400-square-foot homes
range from $208,000 to $265,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this kind of system will be absolutely standard in
the short term,'' said Carl Goldberg, a company principal, noting
that it ``has real practical uses'' for the technologically
oriented family. ``But like cellular phones and CD players there is
a certain inertia at first. Then everyone has to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The system costs from $700 to $1,000, which is ``quite
manageable,'' Goldberg said, adding that ``it will give us a
competitive advantage and at the same time add to the appreciation
of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with that assessment is Deborah Bertino, director of
sales and marketing at Pinnacle Communities Ltd. of Millburn, which
has built more than 1,000 town houses and detached houses in the
last five years. Her company designed its own wiring system and
will begin offering it as a standard feature at its newest
community, called Beacon Hill, which is about to rise along Allen
Road in Basking Ridge. It will be made up of 15 homes, ranging in
size from 3,800 to 4,700 square feet and in price from $609,990 to
$739,990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding that more and more of our buyers are going in
the direction of home theaters and home offices so we are trying to
incorporate them in different layouts,'' said Ms. Bertino. This
system gives buyers the necessary technology, she added. The basic
system costs $500 to $1,000 to install, depending on the size of
the house, and buyers can choose optional upgrades that could bring
the cost to $4,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some developers are offering systems as options _ to give buyers
more flexibility, they say. That is the case for Pulte Home Corp.,
based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., with offices in Basking Ridge. In
June the company made a high-tech wiring system available at a cost
of $1,500 at two single-family home projects in Somerset County.
One, called Hearthstone at the Top of the World, is in Greenwood
Township and contains 100 homes, ranging in size from 3,200 to
3,700 square feet and in price from $475,000 to $520,000. The
other, Lafayette Watch, is in Basking Ridge and consists of 70
homes with 2,600 to 3,300 square feet and priced from $430,000 to
$495,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded to our buyers,'' said Gary Stefanoni, director of
sales and marketing for Pulte. ``The area we are in has large
pharmaceutical and telecommunication firms, so our buyers are
corporate executives who want this technology.'' K. Hovnanian
Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest developer, is also
offering a home wiring system as an option. ``We find requests for
these systems are most common where a high percentage of home
buyers work in technology-based industries such as computer,
financial services and telecommunications,'' said Ara Hovnanian,
president of the company. ``If people benefit from it at work, they
want it at home _ in part because for many of us, our homes are an
extension of our offices.''
</P>
<P>
   One such community is Jacob's Ferry, the company's 258-unit
waterfront town-house community in West New York, N.J., which
Hovnanian said has drawn many executives from Manhattan's financial
district. The 1,250- to 2,895-square-foot homes are priced from
$264,950 to more than $1 million. At Jacob's Ferry the company is
offering a system that includes security management, for $2,500 to
$2,700.
</P>
<P>
   And Trafalgar House Residential, based in Ewing, plans to
introduce a system as an option ranging in price from $895 to
$1,345, at three developments starting next month, including Forest
Hill at Delran in Burlington County. The community, now under way,
contains 104 homes, with 1,850 to 2,550 square feet, priced from
$174,900 to $211,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering the system because that is where technology is
headed,'' said Robert Wheeler, vice president of sales and
marketing for the company. And when the market cools, he added,
``it will help maintain our customer base.''

REAL ESTATE: COMPOSTING FOR MUSHROOMS MOVES INDOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js) 
 By MAUREEN MILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAOLIN, Pa. _ Having grown up in mushroom country, Charles
Raskob Robinson remembers days when the stench wafting from nearby
composting operations would take his breath away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken manure has a real kick,'' Robinson said, referring to
the fermentation of a mixture of chicken and horse manure,
corncobs, hay and straw that create the prime growing medium for
mushrooms. The odors were little more than an occasional olfactory
nuisance until Robinson, the grandson of John Jacob Raskob _ the
financier who built the Empire State Building _ decided to develop
his family's 460-acre estate in southeastern Pennsylvania in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically lessened the value'' of most of his land, said
Robinson, a Manhattan artist.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, the mushroom growers near his Colonial
Farms estate agreed, recognizing that community opposition was only
going to increase as new home developments edged closer to the
farms.
</P>
<P>
   The four major landowners nearby _ Robinson, two prominent
mushroom farmers and a developer _ met to create a master plan that
would allow for orderly development of their lands along Route 41
south of Kennett Square. Their combined properties, roughly 30
miles southwest of Philadelphia, total about 2,000 acres. And they
were unanimous in their opinion that something had to be done about
the composting operation.
</P>
<P>
   The result was construction of the country's first indoor
composting operation. Kaolin Mushroom Farms Inc. of Kennett Square,
Pa., the largest mushroom operation in Chester County and among the
biggest in the country, is finishing work on a $3 million building
that should control 90 percent of the odors.
</P>
<P>
   When the building is completed in November, Kaolin Mushroom will
be one of a handful of mushroom growers in the world to be entirely
indoors. Not only is the operation expected to be more efficient,
cutting the compost curing time by 65 percent, but it also promises
to free more than 200 acres of prime property for commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
   The new building will allow Kaolin Mushroom to reduce the amount
of land needed for the mushroom growing medium, or substrate, to 2
acres from 14 acres. Currently, huge outdoor mounds of organic
matter are watered and blended for about 21 days until the microbes
have had a chance to break down the ingredients. During the
fermentation process, temperatures reach up to 175 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the compost smell should be mild. It is only when
the piles become starved of oxygen that noxious anaerobic activity
begins. This should be held under control in the new building.
</P>
<P>
   Michael L. Pia, president of the privately held Kaolin Mushroom
Farms, said he was already getting interest from real estate
developers for the 170 acres owned by his family. Robinson is also
a partner in another 40 acres of contiguous land.
</P>
<P>
   The master plan drawn up by the four landowners calls for a town
center that could accommodate up to 700,000 square feet of retail
and office development. The property owners have also agreed to a
town hall, post office, church and retirement community, Robinson
said. The development concept has received the blessing of New
Garden Township officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Pias and Robinson, the two other major
landowners in the area are the Ciarrochis, mushroom growers who own
Modern Mushroom Farms Inc., and Bellevue Holding Co., a real-estate
development firm based in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   All this has led to intense interest among mushroom growers
across the country. If the indoor composting operation is
successful, it could be a solution to the mounting conflict between
mushroom farmers and residents of new bedroom communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban encroachment is one of the biggest challenges facing the
industry today,'' said Laura Phelps, president of the American
Mushroom Institute in Washington. ``Complaints about odors just
make it more difficult to do business.''

</P>
<P>
   While mushrooms are grown throughout the country, a majority of
the nation's 165 growers of Agaricus bisporus _ the common button
mushroom _ are in Pennsylvania. But whether as a result of
development or consolidation, the number of Pennsylvania mushroom
farmers has declined by 80 percent since 1980, according to Paul
Wuest, a plant pathologist at Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Some farms go the way of the bulldozer for new home
developments, and other farms are sold to mushroom growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these beautiful farms of 100 to 200 acres that have
been in the family for a couple generations and they're selling
off,'' said John Swayne III, president of J.B. Swayne Spawn Co. in
Kennett Square, whose grandfather started the nation's mushroom
business. ``You're torn because maybe that's going to be their
savings to enjoy retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation of smaller mushroom operations with larger
growers has only worsened the odor problem, because the composting
operations, while fewer, are much larger. Kaolin Mushroom, for
example, uses about 20 million pounds of poultry manure a year to
make compost.
</P>
<P>
   Chester County's 85 mushroom growers, who represent about half
the nation's growers of white mushrooms, weren't always considered
bad neighbors. For more than 100 years, the area was proud of its
status as the mushroom capital of the world. A little more than a
decade ago, complaints were few, Pia said. But by the '80s,
newcomers who commuted to jobs in places like King of Prussia and
Philadelphia began to arrive. They were attracted by the rural
landscape but had not bargained for the smells, Pia said.
</P>
<P>
   They like the cows and the horses, but not the odors or dust and
truck traffic of the farms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers cared little that the nation's mushroom industry
was born here in 1880, when the son of a Quaker carnation grower in
Kennett Square settled on a way to use his father's greenhouses
during the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms _ a delicacy that had been reserved for royal tables
in ancient times _ had been cultivated in Europe since the 18th
century. For his first crop, J.B. Swayne traveled to England to
order the mushroom spawn. Spawn, or mycelium, is the vegetative
part of the fungus that regenerates itself. It is the spawn that is
spread on the cured compost after it has been pasteurized to kill
any harmful organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, mushrooms do not have to be grown in
the dark. But since mushrooms don't need light to grow, and absorb
food from decaying organic matter, farmers simply dispensed with
windows when building their mushroom houses.
</P>
<P>
   Swayne built his first commercial mushroom houses in 1900 in
Kennett Square, followed by a spawn plant. A processing factory
opened in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Pias bought the Swayne operation in 1982, they were
mainly suppliers of compost. Today, their Kaolin Mushroom Farms
harvests 670,000 pounds of white button mushrooms in an average
week. Most are sold as fresh produce.
</P>
<P>
   Indoor composting began in Europe, also as a result of
complaints about odors, said Pia, who makes regular trips overseas
to keep abreast of the latest growing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot building erected by Kaolin Mushroom Farms allowed the
company to cut composting time from 24 days to as few as nine.
While far from an architectural statement, the new building _
basically long stalls separated by concrete walls _ should go a
long way toward helping Robinson and Bellevue Holding sell luxury
homes nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The two are partners in the development of homes priced up to
$700,000 near the Hartefeld National Golf Club, where there is an
18-hole golf course with $105 greens fees that was carved out of
part of the Robinson estate. The family's home, which was named
Hartefeld after Raskob's home on Maryland's Eastern Shore, is now
the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The composting operation in Kaolin was always our biggest
liability, and our biggest asset,'' Robinson said. ``Although it
was zoned for strip development, that never happened because of the
odor.''

REAL ESTATE: COPING WITH HOUSEHOLD FLOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 65 years in the business of drying out wet
houses, Max Gersh remembers one job more clearly than the rest. He
calls it ``The Cube of Mold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A water pipe broke in the house while the owners were away,''
said Gersh, the founder of Maxons Restorations in Manhattan.
``There were 5 feet of water in the basement. It was summer, and
the water would evaporate and rise to the upper floors during the
day, and then rain back down into the basement at night. It was so
humid in there we had to pry open the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, Gersh saw something that surprised even him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was mold on everything,'' he said. ``Every chair, every
bed, every carpet and every wall was covered with mold. Even the
felt hammers in the piano were moldy. The house was a cube of
mold.''
</P>
<P>
   The immensity of the damage, Gersh explained, was attributable
to the fact that the condition had existed for several weeks before
it was discovered. Nevertheless, he said, any flooding in a house _
whether caused by a broken pipe, a clogged sewer line or a bashing
by Mother Nature _ can cause serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to deal with water when it's where it doesn't
belong, and things to avoid while doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you don't do is touch anything electric when
you're standing on a wet floor,'' said Jerome Konsker, owner of
Konsker Electric in Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   While that may seem obvious, Konsker said, it is not uncommon
for people who have a flood in their basement to wade through the
water to turn on lights or turn off appliances. In fact, he said,
even with just a few inches of water _ enough, for example, to
saturate live electrical outlets near the floor _ it is dangerous
to be there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't play with your radio while you're sitting in the
bathtub,'' Konsker said. ``Well, when you're wading around in
ankle-deep water, the whole basement's a bathtub.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, the best thing to do when water has soaked
anything connected to an electrical circuit _ including furnace
motors, washers and dryers and wall outlets _ is to call in an
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know what you're doing,'' Konsker said, ``don't
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   William A. Farley, district service supervisor for Public
Service Electric &AMP; Gas Co. in Newark, N.J., said that homeowners
with gas-powered appliances _ hot water heaters, furnaces and
clothes dryers _ should be particularly careful after a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the gas controls of the equipment have been submerged in
water, I wouldn't recommend turning it back on,'' Farley said. He
explained that while most appliances had safety mechanisms that
prevent gas from escaping, it is possible that water in the vents
and ducts of those appliances could prevent the machine from
igniting properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be setting yourself up for a delayed ignition,''
Farley said, using the industry's term for what is more commonly
known as an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Fisher, a manager in gas engineering at Consolidated
Edison of New York City, said that gas clothes dryers in particular
might exhibit rather unusual _ and dangerous _ behavior in a flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They float,'' Fisher said. ``And when a clothes dryer floats,
the flexible hose that connects it to the gas supply is stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, Con Edison recommends that homeowners with
flood-prone basements leave the door of their dryer open so it will
fill with water instead of becoming buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Gersh, Max's son and president of Maxons, said that after
standing water has been pumped out of a house, there then remains
the more difficult job of drying out everything that got wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have a water damage in a house, you basically
have a 72-hour window of opportunity to reverse it,'' Gersh said.
</P>
<P>
   This is because unlike fire damage _ which is unlikely to worsen
after the fire is out _ water can continue to cause problems long
after the flood has receded. Residual dampness in walls and under
carpets can cause as much damage as the initial submersion. In
addition to permanently weakening carpet fibers and softening
sheetrock walls, imbedded dampness can warp wood floors, shrink
drapes and even curl pictures in rooms that were not involved in
the original flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get in there early enough and get the drying process
started, we can usually save most things in a house,'' Gersh. ``But
the most important thing to worry about, from the point of view of
people living in the house, is mold and mildew.'' He noted that
mold and mildew spores _ which are present in the atmosphere _ need
only warmth, darkness and moisture to get a foothold and flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Gersh said, the first thing that must be done after
standing water has been removed is to prevent mold and mildew from
forming by treating all damp surfaces with a mildew inhibitor and
then thoroughly drying everything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your basement is flooded, you can have a humidity reading
of over 90 percent,'' Gersh said. ``So what you have to do is get
the humid air out and get dry air in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One way to do that is by opening windows and doors and using
floor-level fans to create cross ventilation. Another way to
accelerate drying is through the judicious application of heating
and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people immediately turn up the thermostat following water
damage in the mistaken belief that they are drying things out,''
Gersh said, adding that using heat alone will only result in
increasing the humidity. And that, in turn, will transport moisture
throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just cranking up the thermostat, he said, what a
homeowner should do first is turn on the air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Set the thermostat at the coolest level possible,'' he said.
Then, after the house has been thoroughly chilled, the
air-conditioning should be turned off, the heat should be turned on
and the windows and doors should be shut tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the cool air warms it will act as a sponge,'' Gersh said.
After the temperature has risen considerably _ even to the point of
discomfort _ the heat should be turned off, the windows and doors
should be opened, and the moisture-laden air should be evacuated
with fans and cross-ventilation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cycle should be repeated until adequate drying has
occurred,'' Gersh said, pointing out that in most cases, when a
house has carpeting, disaster recovery experts will also remove any
soaked padding from beneath the carpet and treat the floor and the
underside of the carpet with a mildew inhibitor such as Pine Sol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just vacuuming water out of a carpet usually isn't enough,''
he said. ``Because the padding traps water and prevents the carpet
from ever really drying out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Gersh said, the most effective way to protect valuable
items from water damage is to keep them in a safe place to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, people seem to keep things like photo albums,
wedding dresses, yearbooks and old love letters in boxes in the
basement,'' he said. ``And it's only after a disaster hits that
they realize how valuable those things are.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE ARE THE RAGING HORDES OF YESTERYEAR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally, this year's U.S. Open had a bit of bustle.
All it took was a return of Super Saturday, with two men's
semifinals sandwiched around an American woman winning the American
tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the main stadium was filled, and a few of the
shrimp-stuffed guests in the luxury boxes even moved their eyes and
clapped their hands, a bigger upset than Lindsay Davenport's 6-3,
7-5 victory over Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered for Davenport because she was the underdog,
because she is American, and also because some of the fans know of
Davenport's major upgrading of her physique and her tennis game, at
the same time her parents' marriage was dissolving.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport showed more than power Saturday, moving Hingis around
the court and finishing her off with a cross-court backhand near
the net, a site Davenport had sworn, only the other day, she would
rarely frequent.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Saturday drew the fans into the upscale but
often-yawning chasm of Arthur Ashe Stadium. On the other hand,
where else was there to go? They have a problem at the National
Tennis Center, which became even more apparent in the second year
of its rebirth. The gigantic stadium, named after the American
hero, has often become a court of last refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls from people, `Why aren't there more people in the
stadium when Pete Sampras is playing?''' admitted Harry A. Marmion,
the civilized president of the United States Tennis Association.
``The answer is, the fans are hither, thither and yon. We've got to
manage the space better.''
</P>
<P>
   Where is everybody? One sometimes feels like screaming this, at
the risk of startling the players, plus the few assembled ushers,
court officials and the handful of fans dozing in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a squirrel loose in the stadium during the
women's semifinals on Friday, darting from section to section,
under people's feet. The squirrel had gotten used to having the run
of the main joint during the first 11 days, and had copped an
attitude of, ``Fine, now you come around.''
</P>
<P>
   The lassitude can be traced to the lower half of the main
stadium _ that is to say, where one can actually see the players
without the use of telescopes _ having been sold out to the
corporations. In the last two weeks, during the Clinton-Lewinsky
stock market freefall, it was easy to picture these captains of
industry fretting over the latest ghastly quotations from Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The becalmed atmosphere is accentuated by the dead space at
midlevel, known as the luxury boxes, a Potemkin Village often
decorated with department-store mannequins dressed in expensive
outfits. The luxury boxes are not about to be torn out to make room
for the proletariat any time soon, Marmion said. The 93 suites
bring in $100,000 each for the two weeks of the Open, a $9.3
million infusion that almost, but does not quite, ``pay for our
debt service, which is $1.2 million a month,'' Marmion said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the only excitement in the main stadium often comes
from loyal bands of Spaniards or Australians in the upper deck,
their chants reaching courtside like some ghostly echo. Meanwhile,
the old main stadium, now known as Stadium 2, has been shaved down
to a comfortable 10,000 seats, most of them available on a
first-come, first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   Once for a match between Andre Agassi and Karol Kucera, and
several times for the Williams sisters, the announcer warned that
there were no more seats in Stadium 2. People were cheering the
subtleties of strokes and the facial tics of the players, whom they
could see with their own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the USTA has brought this upon itself by
redesigning the National Tennis Center into one of the most
handsome and comfortable public spaces in the city. While there are
legitimate questions about the use of parkland for something as
relatively elite as a two-week tennis tournament, the fact is that
the center is delightful, with its broad plaza, the vista with
bubbling fountains in the park, and the lights and shadows on a
late-summer evening.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like sacrilege, but the Open is actually more
pleasant than Wimbledon, where thousands of eager tourists pay for
the privilege of standing up, squeezed tightly together in the
narrow lanes on some distant court. Wimbledon also charges a
separate admission for its second court, a practice Marmion wants
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thinking of ways to let the fans in the upper sections
of Stadium 1 have access to Stadium 2,'' Marmion said. ``We're also
looking at the schedule to see how we can get more people into
Stadium 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that people still have the blues from the end
of the Chris-Martina-Jimbo-McObstreperous era. People can remember
the excitement, particularly at night, when people in shirts and
ties acted with all the gutter impulsiveness of a New York taxi
driver swerving across four lanes. Players mugged chair umpires.
Fans mugged fans. The wind and the night lights mugged Bjorn Borg.
What a New York kind of hoot. Nowadays, the luxury boxes mug the
Open, at least until a new American champ emerges on Super
Saturday. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ When people complain about Audrey _ and,
incredibly, they do complain _ Lupe Canales closes her eyes, takes
a deep breath, and reminds herself that there will always be people
out there with perfectly good eyes who just cannot see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' the head librarian at the Van Nuys
branch library will say to them. ``Instead of using your hands on
the computer today, let me give you a stick to put in your mouth
with your house key attached to the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, use that key to type, and try finishing up what you need
to do on that computer in half an hour. That's why I give her extra
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Canales says, that's all it takes for the
pushy person waiting to use one of the library's computers to
finally see they're being jerks.
</P>
<P>
   See that the 41-year-old woman in the wheelchair with arms and
legs that never worked needs a little extra time every day on the
public's computer because she can't afford one of her own _ not
living solely on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So, every afternoon, she makes the 20-minute trip by wheelchair
down Victory Boulevard from her apartment to the Van Nuys Civic
Center library and waits her turn to get back online.
</P>
<P>
   To reach out from a World Wide Web site called Safeplace that
she has created on this library computer the past few months to
talk to people like herself across the country.
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities, people who have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Safeplace,'' Audrey's site begins. ``I, like many
of you who have disabilities, have suffered many indignations from
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I searched for answers, and many came, the one underlying
answer was `I'm not to blame.' Nor, are you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of this Web page is designed to give those of you
who have been abused by your families information and support ...
to help you through the maze of conflicting emotions you may be
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still under construction, but come back, as I'll update
(the Web page) often.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey checked her ``guest list'' to see if anyone has tried to
reach her on the Web site Thursday. It was empty.
</P>
<P>
   She's had a few hits already, a few people telling her that
what's she's doing in Safeplace is wonderful. But, so far, no one
with a disability has come forward asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're out there looking at it,'' says Audrey. ``They
just haven't signed the guest book yet. They're not ready to come
out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people with disabilies tend to think society has a
stigma against them anyway, so why bother?'' she says. ``But they
have to bother because this (family violence) is an issue that
needs to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm trying to reach them,'' says Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   One of the librarians puts a small plastic box that Audrey has
purchased to rest the computer's mouse on, raising it a few inches
off the table. She leans her head down and moves the mouse around
with her chin.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey spends the rest of her hour on the public's computer
visiting other Web sites, on the lookout for new research material
pertaining to disabilities, or any new laws that may be moving
through the halls of government dealing with disability issues.
</P>
<P>
   When her time is up, she thanks Canales and her staff for
helping her out, for sticking up for her again when some jerk
waiting in line thinks it's not fair that she's getting a little
extra computer time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let it bother me,'' says Audrey says, preparing to
make her 20-minute trip home by wheelchair Thursday afternoon. ``I
just go about my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out over the public's computer. Trying to bring people
who have been where she has out of the closet, and into a safe
place.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to message Audrey, her e-mail address is

<P>
   Experts on constitutional law said Saturday that some of the
scathing accusations in the report by the Whitewater independent
counsel could, if proved, be appropriately defined as impeachable
offenses within the meaning of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews after they had read the report, several of
them said that because impeachment is defined as a political
process by the Constitution, the question of whether Clinton's
actions merited removal from office depends not on legal analysis
but on the public reaction to the details of the 445-page report.
</P>
<P>
   The legal experts based their conclusions on the history of
impeachments and the vagueness of the Constitution's statement that
a president can be removed for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is, given the very fuzzy boundaries of `high crimes
and misdemeanors,' sure, this is a case for impeachment,'' said
Richard Parker, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law
School. ``But that doesn't tell me whether impeachment or
impeachment hearings are best for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the report by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is certain to be at the center of an intense debate in the
coming weeks, with Starr's critics decrying it as a purely
political assault, and critics of the president praising it as a
powerful justification for removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In their initial responses after studying the document, the
constitutional experts said it appeared to have elements both of
well-reasoned and stridently political arguments. The experts
described the report as a unique amalgam of well-reasoned legal
points and blistering oratory that they said appeared likely to
weaken the influence of the document as the debate unfolds in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, yes, if what's alleged is true, it makes out an
impeachable offense,'' said Susan Low Bloch, a professor of
constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center. ``But I
think it's going to depend on what the public thinks. Impeachment
is a political process.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legal experts, drawn from a range of political views and
geographic regions, generally said the report appeared to present a
threshold argument that Clinton's conduct warranted at least an
impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Several of them said, though, that the report did not fully
rebut the White House's central legal assertion that Starr outlined
offenses that were merely ``personal, not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pildes, a constitutional law expert at the University of
Michigan Law School, said he had read the report and reflected on
it overnight. He concluded, he said, that it soberly raised what he
called very serious issues concerning accusations of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Pildes also said the report often went beyond standard legal
arguments. ``There are some aspects of it,'' he said, ``that make
it read like the almost fanatical zeal of a Medieval inquisitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pildes noted accusations, for example, that he said included
moralistic evaluations of the function of the presidency and
details of Clinton's telling falsehoods to members of his staff who
then repeated those assertions. Pildes said those passages did not
help Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the constitutional authorities were plainly
uncomfortable analyzing the report in legal terms. ``It reads to me
like a brief filed by one side, a prosecutor's brief,'' said Erwin
Chemerinsky, a constitutional law specialist at the University of
Southern California Law School. ``But in many places,'' Chemerinsky
added, ``it reads more like a political argument than a legal
brief.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the experts said they concluded that Starr's argument
made out at least a threshold claim of impeachable offenses because
the framers of the Constitution left the description of impeachable
offenses vague precisely so that political views could be
incorporated into that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Choper, a professor of constitutional law at the Boalt
Hall Law School of the University of California at Berkeley, said
there could be no definitive answer to whether the accusations of
the independent counsel constituted ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations in the report that President Clinton
lied under oath, that he sought to obstruct justice,'' Choper said.
``All of those things are crimes; felonies. If they are true, it is
not beyond the pale to believe that one can be impeached for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the legal experts said that the most damaging assertions
included accusations that Clinton committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But several said the assertion that Clinton misled the public
and abused the powers of his office could be most damaging. While
Congress could well decide that untruths to cover up an
embarrassing relationship might not warrant removal from office,
several of the experts said, it would be difficult for the White
House to assert that Congress should not even consider such
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can impeach a president who lies to the American
people,'' said Stephen Saltzburg, a professor at George Washington
University Law School. ``I think that's one of the most serious
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the experts appeared in wide agreement that the report
provided enough grounds to justify the opening of impeachment
proceedings, several said Congress should move cautiously in
reviewing the assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal scholars have been noting in recent months that
constitutional history suggests that ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' refers to governmental offenses, not personal
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebuttal to the Starr report released by Clinton's
lawyers on Friday, it was evident that the White House planned to
use that argument as a central pillar of its strategy in fighting
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, many of the legal experts said that approach
had substantial merit because it could be harmful to the
constitutional system to subject future presidents to the risk of
impeachment for personal misbehavior, no matter how extreme.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the House were to vote to impeach Clinton and the Senate were
to remove him from office based on the information in the Starr
report, that might expand the definition of impeachable offenses
too broadly, said Eric Freedman, an expert on impeachment law at
Hofstra Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Removal from office by members of Congress under the current
circumstances, Freedman said, ``would be inconsistent with the
historical record that they have been willing to declare
impeachable offenses only those acts that have involved some kind
of abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts said they believed there were legal problems
in the Starr investigation and in some of his conclusions. Several
said they thought it was implausible, for example, for the report
to assert that Clinton abused the power of his office by making a
viable legal argument that executive privilege permitted the White
House to shield the president and some presidential aides from
having to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the experts said they were offended by Starr's
suggestion that raising legal arguments that were considered valid
by many legal experts could possibly be grounds for removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloch of Georgetown University said she thought the
independent counsel law unconstitutionally delegated too much
authority to Starr to draw conclusions the Constitution left to
Congress about what constitutes an impeachable offense. She
acknowledged that it would now be impossible to unravel that
process.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Block said, Congress should more deliberately evaluate
the report because it may have uncovered impeachable offenses
through unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal authorities say that a decision of Congress on the
impeachment of a president would not be reviewed by the courts.
Therefore, several of the experts said Saturday, their views of
whether Starr had outlined impeachable offenses were truly
academic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision of Congress is final,'' said E. Joshua
Rosenkranz, a constitutional law expert who is executive director
of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law
School. ``It's `impeachable,''' Rosenkranz said, ``if Congress says
it is.''

STARR REPORT DOMINATES INTERNATIONAL MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for additions and reorganization.)  (lh) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Starr report on President Clinton dominated news
reports in Europe on Friday night and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton affair creates a climate of crisis in the world,''
wrote Le Monde in its issue Saturday, linking the crisis in Russia,
the collapse of Latin American stock markets and the Presidential
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a close friend of Clinton's,
repeated his earlier fear that the world situation was too
complicated and dangerous for the presidency to be paralyzed over a
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present it is of the utmost importance that the only world
power can fully live up to its duties,'' he said in an interview
with the newspaper Bild am Sonntag, to be published on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia, Africa, India, there are problems everywhere,'' Kohl
said, according to a text of the interview the newspaper released
Saturday. ``I can only hope that the turbulence in Washington can
be put at rest as quickly as possible so that the president is
fully capable of performing his tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons, no innocents when it comes to sexual scandals in
political life, found the accounts in the report and what it might
mean for President Clinton dominating the front pages of their
newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In editorials, some major newspaper urged Clinton to resign or
to step aside temporarily so that the United States' world
leadership is not held hostage by his problems. The Daily Telegraph
said, ``The fact that Clinton, who has been so reluctant to face or
admit the truth, is ready to fight on nevertheless is the strongest
piece of evidence so far that he has no understanding of what he
had done.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids were blunter and harsher, calling Clinton a
``liar'' who had shamed his country and his office. The mass
circulation Sun and its competitor The Mirror, said that Clinton
was ``a man whose frantic and perverse philandering borders on the
demented'' and ``an insatiable and indiscriminate predator whose
many relationships with women are tantamount to sexual abuse.'' The
president ``must go,'' The Sun concluded.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls from several members of Parliament for Prime
Minister Tony Blair to distance himself from Clinton, with whom he
has had a close relationship. A spokesman for Blair turned aside
the advice.
</P>
<P>
   France's daily Liberation offered the full text in English, with
excerpts in French, on its Internet site. French radio and
television also gave the report full coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The lead editorial of Liberation, a left-leaning daily, said
Clinton had only himself to blame for his crisis. ``It is because
he agreed to answer _ but with lies _ the unacceptable questions of
Kenneth Starr that the president of the United States, threatened
by impeachment and seized by political paralysis, now struggles in
vain against ridicule, offering repentance from dawn to sad dusk,''
the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper reflected the widespread if not universal French view
that Clinton's affair should have been left private, as was the
relationship of President Francois Mitterrand with his mistress
until the late president disclosed that he had a daughter by her.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Le Figaro also published excerpts from the
Starr report on its front page under the headline, ``The document
revealing Clinton's secrets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton to Capt. E.J. Smith on the Titanic, Figaro
concluded that continued public support might keep Congress from
impeaching him, but that it might come too late, like the liner
Carpathia on the dawn of April 15, 1912.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial ringing with French stupefaction at the scandal,
the leading French daily Le Monde described the Starr report as a
monster ``worthy of the reports of the Inquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde accused Starr of trying to impose ``a terrifying moral
order where sex is never far from sin, where even sexual relations
between consenting adults is always something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian reaction to the Starr report was a mixture of solemn
worry over the plight of an important ally and bemused astonishment
at the whole spectacle. For example, The Globe and Mail, Canada's
most influential paper, had a Page 1 article with the headline,
``Starr's Lurid Report Deepens Clinton Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   A lead editorial in The Chronicle-Herald of Halifax, Nova
Scotia, was entitled ``Prodigal Bill'' and concluded that
``Friday's Starr report clearly shifts the balance somewhat to the
Bill-must-go-side.''

INSTRUMENTS MAY HAVE GIVEN PILOTS FALSE DATA BEFORE CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Investigators hoping to unravel the
mystery of what brought down Swissair 111 in a thunderous crash
that killed all 229 people aboard believe the frantic pilots
received false information from their instruments just before the
huge jet slammed into the Atlantic Ocean on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data used by the aircraft and by the flight crew to operate
the aircraft was progressively becoming unreliable in the last
minute before the flight data recorder stopped,'' said John
Maxwell, director of air investigations for the Transportation
Safety Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   What is not yet clear, Maxwell said, is whether the problems
that appear on the flight data recorder at the time the pilot first
reported trouble were caused by the jet's subsystems or by other
problems that affected those systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure which are the causes and which are the
symptoms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell made his comments in Ottawa Saturday at a news
conference in which he announced that the second ``black box'' from
Flight 111, which was recovered by Navy divers on Friday night, was
undamaged and contained the full 30 minutes of cockpit conversation
that can be recorded on the closed loop of tape.
</P>
<P>
   The first box, recovered Sept. 6, contains technical information
about conditions on the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell would not say whether the second recorder was running
during the final six minutes of the flight, during which time the
first failed to operate. Both boxes were found near the tail of the
plane, far from the cockpit, which filled with smoke and showed
evidence of what investigators called ``heat stress.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape of conversations in the cockpit could contain valuable
information about how the pilots assessed their situation in the
final minutes of the flight, but Maxwell said it could take weeks
for engineers to distinguish the different sounds on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say at this time is that we have good voices on the
recorder, and there's a lot of sound and conversation taking
place,'' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, where edited cockpit transcripts
are routinely released, Canadian law prohibits the contents of the
tape from being made public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Canadian investigators have also completed an initial review of
Swissair maintenance records, presumably including the work done on
a part of the jet's electrical system that the airline acknowledges
had malfunctioned on another Swissair jet.
</P>
<P>
   The part, called the direct-current tie bus sensing relay,
connects electricity throughout the plane. After the relay
malfunctioned during routine maintenance on a Swissair jet in
Bangkok, Thailand, on Aug. 3, the airline replaced the part in all
the jets in its fleet, said Mari Hope, a Swissair spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But the mechanic who replaced the relays on the jet involved in
the crash here installed the new part improperly and caused a short
circuit while the plane was on the ground, Ms. Hope said. The relay
was then reinstalled correctly, and tests showed that it functioned
properly, according to Swissair.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigators pored over the cockpit flight recorder in
Ottawa, teams of pathologists working at the makeshift morgue
inside Hangar B at the Shearwater Air Base in Dartmouth, across the
harbor from Halifax, identified another victim of the crash, while
making tentative identifications on two others.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the remains of only four of the 229 passengers and
crew who died in the crash have been identified, said Kim
Blanchette, spokesperson for Nova Scotia Medical Examiner's Office.
Two were done through dental records, one through fingerprints and
one other through identification by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The search for other victims and the bulk of the mangled
fuselage of the jet continues in the waters off the east coast of
Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of Sea King helicopters has been scouring the ocean
around Peggy's Cove, the picturesque fishing village near where the
Swissair MD-11 came down with enough force to register on
instruments that detect earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Recovered bits of wreckage are brought back to Hangar A at the
Shearwater base where they are laid out on half a dozen tables for
closer examination. Canadian officials say that only one to two
percent of the huge jet had been recovered, and the fragments found
so far have mostly consisted of small pieces of cardboard, plywood
and light insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Erin O'Toole said the search area had now been extended to
cover the area from Lawrencetown Beach, 45 minutes north of
Halifax, down to the historic town of Lunenberg. He said that
blankets from the downed Swissair jet had been found at
Lawrencetown's public beach.
</P>
<P>
   Larger pieces will be lifted by the USS Grapple, one of the
Navy's heavy rescue and salvage ship, which anchored above the main
area of debris on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John Oliviera, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy Atlantic Fleet,
said that a small remotely operated submarine about the size of a
pair of refrigerators on end has started mapping the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Before the heavy lifting can begin, the Grapple must be safely
and steadily moored. The Canadian Coast Guard ship, the Earl Grey,
set down two large concrete mooring blocks Saturday and will
install another two tomorrow to provide the stability that the
Grapple needs to use its powerful lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Grapple is ready, it will be up to Canadian authorities
to decide when to begin the recovery, Oliviera said. Under normal
conditions, human remains are removed before the wreckage is
raised.

REINVENTING THE OPEN-WHEEL: SUGGESTIONS FOR THE IRL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by a tight points chase and a tinge of controversy, the
Indy Racing League is chugging toward the conclusion of its third
season.
</P>
<P>
   That's three years longer than some detractors gave the series
when its formation was announced by Tony George, president of the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With the Speedway and the Indy 500 as its cornerstone, the IRL
was founded with a noble agenda:
</P>
<P>
   Preserve the traditions of single-seat, open-wheeled, oval-track
racing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rein in escalating costs, while maintaining the highest levels
of safety and parity.
</P>
<P>
   Create a series that will give aspiring American drivers _ as
well as teams, sponsors, suppliers and promoters _ the opportunity
to enter the sport at a high level and race in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Establish and maintain a governing structure representing all
parties fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Take Indianapolis-style racing to new markets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL has survived through 22 events since the inaugural race
on Jan. 27, 1996. But has it thrived?
</P>
<P>
   What should concern George and Leo Mehl, the league's affable
executive directors, the most? Empty grandstands at most venues?
The quality of fields, top to bottom? Whispers of cheating? TV
ratings?
</P>
<P>
   Who's got the aspirin?
</P>
<P>
   With the series returning to Texas Motor Speedway for the Lone
Star 500K on Saturday night, here are some suggestions to clear up
the headaches paining the IRL:
</P>
<P>
   Grow and tweak the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven races at 10 venues will determine the 1998 IRL champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 15 races, at our stage of growth, is good,'' said
Billy Boat, who won the second True Value 500K on June 6 at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you add a race, you add expense. If you run a lot
of races you defeat some of the cost effectiveness of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL recently ended its association with Bob Bahre and his
New Hampshire International Speedway after last June's race drew
fewer than 25,000 fans _ a logical move for all parties.
</P>
<P>
   What venue should the IRL consider adding?
</P>
<P>
   The 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway, home to NASCAR's
famed Daytona 500, would add to the series' prestige and be a major
magnet for sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Book more Saturday night races.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has given the IRL more of an identity than superspeedway
events under the lights, a prime-time ``tradition'' launched at TMS
in 1997. The drivers and cars like the cooler temperatures, and
passing at 220 mph is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   It also gets the IRL away from Sunday afternoon TV conflicts
with NASCAR Winston Cup, rival Championship Auto Racing Teams
events, and occasional live National Hot Rod Association telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   If the IRL cuts a deal to race at Daytona, perhaps in 2000, it
should be run at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't put those lights up at Daytona for one race a
year,'' said IRL driver Greg Ray of Plano.
</P>
<P>
   Add an engine constructor or two.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the heyday of the Chevrolet Indy V-8 in the early 1990s,
the manufacturer plastered billboards outside of the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway with the message that rightly proclaimed: ``You
can't win without one.''
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true in today's IRL with the Oldsmobile Aurora
V-8.
</P>
<P>
   The normally aspirated, production-based unit has won every IRL
pole and race run to date. That's a nice return on investment for
Olds, although the victories have become predictable as Nissan
Motor Corp., USA, has struggled with development of its 4.0-liter
(244 cubic-inch) Infiniti Indy V-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the IRL wants to get some more people involved with
engines, and there has been talk that in 1999 or 2000 there will be
one or two more,'' said Davey Hamilton, who drives an Olds-powered
car owned by Bob Nienhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors that BMW _ whose racing background includes Formula
One _ was close to joining the series recently have quieted down.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's engine specs are valid through the 1999 season, when
they will be re-evaluated. There seems to be a need to upgrade to
prevent such occurrences as Tony Stewart blowing his engine while
leading the True Value 500K at TMS in June with approximately 20
laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Get CART teams back into the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   CART teams are free to enter next May's 83rd Indy 500 _ but with
IRL specification engines and chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 listed cost of $360,000 per car _ $280,000 for a G
Force, Dallara or Riley &AMP; Scott chassis and $80,000 for an Olds or
Nissan V-8 engine _ is a considerable investment.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to reuniting for Indy is the different
chassis and engine formulas in use. CART's V-8s are turbocharged
and the IRL's are normally aspirated _ they have carburetors.
</P>
<P>
   Boat said the idea of devising a formula to equalize those
powerplants so they could race against each other at Indy is ``not
even an option.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proven we have a superior engine formula, when you
look at reliability and ownership and cost _ the biggest thing
being cost,'' Boat said. ``How can you compare an $85,000
Oldsmobile you can buy and own to a $2 million a year engine lease
in CART, and you can't even do anything to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a huge mistake (for George) to give in on that
principle. It's a fantastic formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reports about behind-the-scenes reconciliatory
talks involving George, CART's Penske, active driver Al Unser Jr.
and the retired Mario Andretti, the best hope is for a compromise
leading into May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the next two to six years you'll see the rules
change to be closer to one another,'' Ray said, ``so at some point
they can have two series and kind of a showdown at Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Attract high-dollar sponsorship for its teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has gotten so much negative publicity off of
people's personal grudges against Tony George and what he's done,''
said Buzz Calkins, co-champion of the IRL's inaugural 1996 season.
``The perception of what people have on it is, `Oh yeah, that's the
inferior series, that doesn't have anybody worth watching and it's
propped up by the Indy 500.' It's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the negative publicity out of the way, and then the
sponsors will start coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   A primary sponsor can race with a competitive IRL team for a
season from $4 million to $6 million _ a bargain when compared to
the cost of slapping decals onto a Winston Cup car for upward of
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recognizable new IRL sponsors is Reebok, the
athletic shoe giant that is sponsoring Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok brought credibility to our team,'' said Hamilton, who
trails series leader Kenny Brack by 23 points in the driver's
championship. ``We were fortunate to get them on the car at Indy,
and we hope it continues for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Promote, promote, promote.
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials say their star drivers have as much name
recognition as CART's marquee guys. True, IRL regulars Arie
Luyendyk, Scott Goodyear, Eddie Cheever, Scott Sharp and Robbie
Buhl are in the news on a race weekend as much as CART's Alex
Zanardi, Jimmy Vasser, Michael Andretti and Bobby Rahal.
</P>
<P>
   But there are any number of TV commercials featuring CART
drivers Zanardi, Vasser, Andretti _ even backmarkers P.J. Jones and
Max Papis _ out there. Some are pretty clever, and give the fans a
different look at the drivers (helmet off). In order to compete
with CART, IRL must create some public name recognition for its top
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   CART engine rivals Honda and Mercedes-Benz zealously promote
their drivers, and the series, in glossy print ads appearing in
major racing publications.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL, MCI and ``On Track'' magazine have begun a contest to
pick the IRL's most popular driver, who will be announced during
the season finale at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. But little ongoing
national media presence has been generated for the league's big
hitters since owner/driver Cheever's Indy 500 victory in May.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, has anyone seen Eddie munching on a Rachel's
potato chip?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical you promote the faces in the IRL,'' Boat said,
``because fans relate to the drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The league might also consider following other racing series by
implementing a weekly magazine-style TV show like ``NHRA Today'' or
``Inside Winston Cup'' and also develop story angles that will get
drivers into non-racing publications.
</P>
<P>
   Continue cracking down on rule violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of cheating have crept into the garage area _ a sure sign
this is a competitive series _ with the well-funded teams fielded
by Houston's A.J. Foyt and John Menard at the center of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Menard accused Foyt of circumventing the engine rules at New
Hampshire International Speedway, specifically with the
Dallara/Olds driven by Boat. Menard held No. 2 driver Robbie Buhl
out of the next two races.
</P>
<P>
   One of the league's key selling points is team ownership of
engines. This allows teams to perform repairs and rebuilds, have
access to parts and sell the engines as desired. But it also opens
the door to the ``gray area'' of rules interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Any perception the big boys are getting away with something
needs to be nixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the IRL is doing a good job of policing'' the rules,
Cheever said. ``There's maybe three or five people trying to set up
rules and 50 to 100 trying to push them to the limit. That is the
nature of motor racing. And I don't believe anybody is cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the IRL did not hesitate after finding a
violation on the rear wings of Team Menard's cars at Pikes Peak
International Raceway. Team Menard was fined $25,000 and 15 points
were deducted from each entrant point total. And drivers Tony
Stewart and Buhl had 15 points deducted from their season totals.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, the series definitely is following NASCAR's
notion of the elusive level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being compared to NASCAR in any form or measure,'' Cheever
said, ``is a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Move the season finale to Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Bruton Smith and Speedway Motorsports Inc. would love to play
host to the IRL season ender at TMS _ where nothing is just another
race.
</P>
<P>
   The two night IRL races in Fort Worth drew an estimated 128,000
and 100,000 fans _ top crowds for the series outside of the Indy
500.
</P>
<P>
   SMI already prides itself on providing the promotional drama
surrounding the NAPA 500, the season-ending Winston Cup race at
Atlanta Motor Speedway in November.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's IRL season-ending night event at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway was poorly attended and poorly promoted. That won't happen
at TMS, where if all else fails, general manager Eddie Gossage can
trot out one of mentor Humpy Wheeler's favorite promotional story
lines: ``Man vs. Shark, One Must Die!''

 &HT;    CNN's Holliman dies in car crash
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Holliman Jr., one of CNN's ``Boys of Baghdad'' who reported
the dramatic opening blows of the Gulf War from a hotel room in the
Iraqi capital, died Saturday in a car crash in Gwinnett County,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman, 49, tried to pass a car on a curve and collided
head-on with a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't wearing a seatbelt, but it might not have made a
difference in this accident,'' Gwinnett police Sgt. Jeff Sligar
said. Richard Henry Wesner, 39, of Snellville and his 10-year-old
son Eric were both wearing seatbelts in their Ford pickup. Wesner
was treated for minor injuries at Eastside Medical Center and
released. His son was admitted to the hospital for treatment of
broken bones, Sligar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Holliman was one of a kind _ a CNN original,'' said Tom
Johnson, chairman of CNN News Group. ``He passionately loved his
family, his friends and his job. . . . John was also a terrific
journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 8:15 a.m. where Mink Livsey Road
dead-ends into Centerville Rosebud Road _ a no-passing zone, Sligar
said. There were no skid marks at the scene, indicating the two
drivers did not see each other until just before the impact between
Holliman's Saturn and Wesner's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman lived in Snellville with his wife, Diane, and their
son, John. His wife, who came to the accident scene, told
investigators that Holliman had gone out for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman was a national reporter for the network. He joined CNN
in 1980 as the first corrrespondent hired for the Washington
bureau. In the summer of 1989 he covered the student demonstrations
in China and the bloody government crackdown that followed. That
fall, he was the network's lead reporter on Hurricane Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman, Peter Arnett and Bernard Shaw were the only
journalists reporting from Baghdad on July 16, 1991, the evening
the allies launched the air attack against Iraq. The network won
numerous awards for their work, including a National Headliner
Award, a Peabody award and a Golden Microphone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Holliman was CNN's lead reporter for the Pathfinder
mission to Mars, and was scheduled to co-anchor, with Walter
Cronkite, the network's coverage of Sen. John Glenn's return to
space this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was so enthusiastic about'' that assignment, Johnson
said. ``I expect he'll be up there watching the mission from the
heavens, probably shouting, 'Holy cow, what a sight!' ``
</P>
<P>
   Holliman grew up in Thomaston and held a bachelor's degree from
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral will be at 1 p.m. Wednesday at Peachtreee
Presbyterian Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, Holliman is survived by his
brother, Max Tolbert Holliman of Atlanta, and his mother, Arva
Tolbert Holliman of Thomaston.

 &HT;    Arkansas still divided
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little Rock, Ark. _ Lucille Robinson gets so mad when you ask
her about Bill Clinton's problems she looks like she could grill
one of her famous steaks without using a stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody in Washington, D.C., that can
say a thing about what he's done because they're all living in
glass houses,'' said Robinson, her face twisting with a frown as
she watched the last of the lunch crowd at Doe's Eat Place filter
out the door. ``If you spent $40 million investigating everybody
else up there, you'd find a whole lot of stuff going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is hardly an objective source on Bill Clinton _ she
cooked for him when he was a Doe's regular as Arkansas' governor
and when he got elected president, she attended his inauguration
ball in a fancy gown, even posing for an Annie Liebowitz portrait
that now graces Doe's wall.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of Arkansans share her outrage and exhaustion over
what they see as the never-ending persecution of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of others, though - even some who frequent Doe's and
other Little Rock locales favored by Clinton - are just as outraged
at Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an embarrassment to Arkansas and the United States,''
said Tom Hamm, 38, a salesman who enjoys the down-home atmosphere
and heaping servings at Doe's just like the president. ``What he
did in the Oval Office is disgusting. You've got a guy like Ronald
Reagan who wouldn't even go in there without a coat and tie and now
this guy uses it for this. It shows a real lack of class. Everybody
thinks if you're from Arkansas you're barefoot and pregnant. He
sure hasn't helped any.''
</P>
<P>
   This bustling capital city was Clinton's home for nearly 20
years before he was elected president in 1992. People here have
gone through the pride of seeing a local hero make it to the
political pinnacle, the scrutiny of legions of reporters trooping
through town wanting to know everything about him, the long-running
drama of the Ken Starr investigation of the Whitewater affair, and
now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people here are jaded,'' said Theresa Ertle, Doe's
manager. ``The basic tone here is that people are just really tired
of it. Sure, it's a serious issue, but look at JFK. This kind of
thing has been going on with politicians forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at Juanita's, a Mexican restaurant where Clinton
favored chicken enchiladas, manager Cheryl Walker had a similar
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of them wasting my tax dollars on this,'' she said.
``If Hillary doesn't have a problem with it, neither do I. I don't
understand what kind of president people want. Do they expect him
and all his family to be perfect? Jesus couldn't even be president
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came back to Juanita's a few years ago when the
University of Arkansas Razorbacks won the NCAA National
Championship in basketball. The place has a big color photograph of
the president jogging in a Juanita's T-shirt. There are no plans to
take the photo down.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Little Rock _ at least many of them _ have been
genuinely proud of Bill Clinton. Their city may have grown from a
sleepy southern capital into a metro area of nearly a million
residents, but in many ways it's still a small town tucked in the
comfortable American hinterland. People here aren't quick to judge,
and tend to be forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was born 100 miles away in the tiny town of Hope, and
grew up in Hot Springs, a resort about an hour west of Little Rock.
He went off to Georgetown and Yale Law School, won a Rhodes
scholarship, then came home and worked his way up through the
political ranks, serving 12 years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he's put Arkansas and Little Rock on the national
map, helping to soften what had been a less than favorable image.
Before Clinton, many people thought of Arkansas as the home to
hillbillies and racial turmoil, with the image of National Guard
troops protecting black students from taunting whites during the
integration of Central High School in the 1950s perhaps the state's
most enduring and embarrassing image.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had at least partially replaced that image with one of
sophistication and achievement: a politician known for
intelligence, energy and an uncanny ability to connect with people.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for his adopted hometown to rally to him _ and to
bristle when asked if Clinton might now bring new embarrassment to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, plenty of Little Rock residents never liked him and
take some satisfaction in seeing him squirm now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he deserves everything he gets,'' said Deborah Geiger,
another Doe's waitress. ``I'd say 95 percent of my friends don't
care for him. My husband is the worst. I won't even go out with him
if I think they're going to talk politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the governor's mansion at the McDonald's where
Clinton used to stop on his daily jog for an infusion of Egg
McMuffins, opinion is also divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't be impeached for his personal life,'' said Mark
Gee, who works the burger assembly line. ``I think Monica Lewinsky
was just waiting for an opportunity. I bet they're offering her
book deals and movie contracts now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eunjolie Williams, who works the drive-thru window, thinks
Clinton should resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied,'' she said. ``And if he hadn't gotten caught, he
would've kept on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Which wouldn't surprise _ or bother _ Cynthia Mason, a clerk at
a nearby convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's human, he's a man, and all men do this stuff,'' she said.
``And as far as that woman _ I think she's a plant. What woman
keeps a dress with semen on it? I love Denzel Washington, but
honey, I wouldn't keep a dress with his semen on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Doe's, people remember when then-Gov. Clinton used to
come in for lunch, saunter back to the french-fry cooker, grab a
sample, and ask Lucille Robinson how she was doing. Now the lunch
crowd listens with half an ear as a television hanging over the bar
blares the latest on his embarrassing affair and pundits debate
whether his presidency will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, he'll come back to Arkansas,'' Robinson
predicted. ``People here don't care about all this stuff.''

 &HT;    Fay's integrity gives weight to findings
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In contrast to the high-profile independent counsel
investigation of President Clinton with its lascivious accusations
that ignited a furor in Congress, a three-judge panel overseeing
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's probe continues to labor in
relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity of this panel, which oversees all the nation's
independent counsels, has been questioned since Starr's appointment
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But one member of the three-judge panel, Judge Peter Fay of the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, hardly seems the
type to legitimize anti-Clinton conspiracy theories. A
law-and-order Republican to be sure, Fay, 69, of Miami, also is
described by colleagues and those who practice before him as a
straight arrow, a judge seasoned with the right blend of experience
from his days as a successful trial lawyer, and a piercing
intellect that makes him one of the nation's most respected
jurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wonderful mind and an unmatched ability to grasp
complex legal issues,'' said Miami criminal defense lawyer Neil
Sonnett. ``He was a hallmark of professionalism as a lawyer and
continues to be that as a judge. He is someone who not only talks a
good game of professionalism, but lives it.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for his poetry and graceful athleticism, Fay took ``senior
status'' _ a sort of semi-retirement _ from his 11th Circuit duties
in 1994, the same year Chief Justice William Rehnquist placed him
on the panel overseeing the nation's independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The other panel members are the presiding judge, David Sentelle,
55, of the the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington; and John
Butzner Jr., 80, senior judge for the 4th Circuit in Richmond. They
all serve two-year terms, but can be reappointed
</P>
<P>
   During the past four years, Fay has labored in relative
obscurity as a member of the panel. He began his service shortly
after Starr was named to succeed Robert Fiske as the special
Whitewater prosecutor. Fay, who over the past week has been on
vacation and in sittings as a member of the special panel, could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, through court rulings and in speeches, Fay has
challenged the nation's attorneys to adhere to the strictest
ethical standards. One such opinion, issued in 1993 against Suzuki
Motor Corp., was criticized strongly by Starr when he represented
the automaker as a senior partner at the Chicago-based law firm
Kirkland &AMP; Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Fay leveled severe sanctions against Suzuki because the
automaker's lawyers allegedly hid court-ordered testing information
about the Suzuki Samurai.
</P>
<P>
   Fay affirmed a decision by a lower-court judge to fine the
lawyers and to sanction Suzuki for its attorneys' conduct, allowing
the case to skip over the question of whether Suzuki was liable for
an accident that left a Riverdale police officer brain-damaged.
Instead, Fay's order would have allowed the case to go directly to
a jury to determine just how much in damages Suzuki should pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many attorneys, like defense counsel in this case, have
allowed the objectives of the client to override their ancient
duties as officers of the court,'' Fay wrote. ``In short, they have
sold out to the client. We must return to the original principle
that ... attorneys are servants of the law rather than servants of
the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who headed Suzuki's appeal, petitioned the Supreme Court
to overturn the ruling. Decisions by Fay and the lower-court judge,
Starr wrote in his appeal, were ``profoundly and demonstrably
wrong. ... They are representative of a growing pathology in the
judicial process _ 'the sanctions tort.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Suzuki later
settled.
</P>
<P>
   One judge's ties questioned
</P>
<P>
   The special panel, authorized to select independent counsels and
approve changes in their mandates, has not been immune from
controversy. Shortly before Starr was appointed, Sentelle had lunch
in Washington with North Carolina's two Republican senators, Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth, strong opponents of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Those events, combined with Sentelle's close ties to Starr and
Starr's ties to conservative causes, spawned attacks on the panel's
integrity. Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested the judges were part of
a ``right-wing conspiracy'' behind the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fay has said politics never touches the process. ``The
judges have made a concerted effort to avoid it,'' he told The
Washington Post last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fay made at least two critical decisions with regard to Starr's
investigation. In January, when Linda Tripp approached Starr with
tapes implicating Clinton in an affair with Monica Lewinsky,
Starr's prosecutors petitioned the three-judge panel to take their
investigation in a new direction. Armed with approval from the
panel as well as the Justice Department, Starr's team ``wired''
Tripp for a meeting with Lewinsky at an Arlington, Va., hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, The New York Times has reported, the three-judge
panel gave Starr's office the authority to turn over to the House
grand jury testimony and other evidence of the special prosecutor's
investigation of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky and his
alleged efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's grand jury investigation of Clinton is continuing, so
the panel probably will be faced with more decisions. When he ends
his probe, Starr must send a final report to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Fay's role on the special panel caps a distinguished career.
During prior Republican administrations, the judge was a candidate
to head the FBI and on short lists to be a Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He sandwiched a stint in the Air Force between Rollins College
in Florida, where he attended on football and basketball
scholarships, and the University of Florida Law School, where he
graduated first in his class.
</P>
<P>
   Fay became one of the brightest stars of the Florida plaintiff's
bar in the 1960s. He was paired with the late Bill Frates, a lawyer
nationally reknowned for his courtroom prowess, and the two
comprised a formidable legal team that was unrivaled in legal
skills, former adversaries say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made up the best team of trial lawyers Florida
ever had,'' said Florida State University President Sandy
D'Alemberte, a former state bar president. ``Bill could charge up a
jury and provide strong cross-examinations. Peter provided the
intellectual firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearless and independent
</P>
<P>
   Fay, a former neighbor of the late Nixon confidant Bebe Rebozo,
once headed Democrats for Richard Nixon. Two years after being
elected president, Nixon appointed Fay to serve on the district
court bench in Miami. In 1976, President Ford elevated Fay to the
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has probably been our most efficient judge, both in terms
of getting out his opinions and getting to the heart of the
issue,'' Circuit Judge Lanier Anderson of Macon, who has served on
the appeals court since 1979, said of Fay. ``He has had no agenda.
He follows the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he was once a trial lawyer, a trial judge and then
appeals court judge, Fay knows the court system intimately from
almost every angle, said Circuit Judge Gerald Tjoflat. ``He
understands how the sausage is made, let's put it that way. He can
pierce through the smoke and the haze and see things in their
simplest light. That's a tremendous advantage when you're sitting
on appellate review.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjoflat still marvels at Fay's athletic ability, which earned
him a place in the Rollins College sports hall of fame. ``He was an
excellent tennis player and is about a good a golfer as he wants to
be,'' Tjoflat said, sounding like someone who had come up a few
strokes short during an occasional round. ``If he decided he wanted
to play two or three times a week, he could have his handicap down
to single digits.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarterback in a touch-football league among South Florida law
firms, Fay dominated. ``Our only problem was that he couldn't catch
his own passes,'' former law partner Gerald Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   His love for sports led him to become a minority investor in the
Miami Dolphins and a member of the prestigious Orange Bowl
Committee. On the 11th Circuit, he also is well-known for the
poetic ditties he reads at a judge's retirement or other landmark
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Fay has presided over ticklish legal situations before. In 1985,
he ruled that membership of two federal judges on President
Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime violated the constitutional
separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   The judges just happened to be a fellow appeals court judge,
Irving Kaufman of New York, and retired Supreme Court Justice
Potter Stewart, who still sat as a visiting judge on various
appellate courts.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, Fay and Judge Frank Johnson wrote that
Kaufman's and Stewart's roles on the commission were
unconstitutional, because a judge ``charged with assisting and
improving enforcement efforts against organized crime must adopt a
pro-government perspective which is ill-suited to his obligation to
be neutral in the courtroom.''

STORIES AND TEARS FLOW FOR PATERNO'S 300TH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ He had dodged the questions about the
milestone all week. He ducked one cooler full of water as time
ticked down, but not a second cooler. Still, Joe Paterno did not
really get wet until after more than 96,000 people reverently
chanted his name. Until his wife, Sue, his five children and three
grandchildren swarmed him at the 50-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was presented with a portrait, and his players thrust
their white helmets into the air to coax the fans in Beaver Stadium
to roar again in one voice for him.
</P>
<P>
   He took the microphone, and in a shaky voice began: ``I'm so
overwhelmed. I can't tell you how filled up with people, memories,
all the years.'' Then the 71-year-old coach broke down and cried.
</P>
<P>
   He has led Penn State football teams for 33 years, and Saturday,
central Pennsylvania was not going to let him leave until the
community of blue and white could savor 300 career victories with
the man they call JoePa. ``I have loved every moment,'' he said
haltingly. ``I have savored every effort of all my teams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most moving conclusion to a 48-3 rout. In walloping
Bowling Green, a young Nittany Lions team helped Paterno reach a
select group of 300 game-winners _ a feat he achieved faster than
the others. At 300-77-3 with a .793 winning percentage, Paterno
joins Bear Bryant (323), Pop Warner (319) and Amos Alonzo Stagg
(314) in Division I-A, Eddie Robinson (408) in Division I-AA, and
John Gagliardi (343 and still coaching) in Division III, as record
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the sold-out crowd of 96,291 minded, but Paterno's
victory was ready for the record books just over a minute into the
game. On the Nittany Lions' first play, Cordell Mitchell took a
handoff around the left end and did not stop until 77 yards later
when he was in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of three consecutive single-play touchdown
strikes that catapulted Penn State to a 21-0 first-quarter lead.
Bruce Branch, a redshirt freshman, returned a punt 73 yards for a
touchdown. Then the sophomore linebacker LaVar Arrington stepped in
front of a pass by Falcons quarterback Bob Niemet and took it 16
yards for another score.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the countdown to coaching history was delayed until
Penn State was through punishing an overmatched Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   His team's sterling performance was appreciated by Paterno, who
is fond of this squad, which has only six seniors and came into the
season with modest expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of real good things that happened out there
today,'' said Paterno, whose team outgained the Falcons 432 yards
to 239. ``We've got a chance to be a real tough football team,
though we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, his team was moved by the emotion their coach showed
after the game. More than a few had tears in their eyes as they
listened to Paterno address the crowd. ``It's amazing he's won that
many,'' Arrington said. ``Plus, Joe is special. He's allowed to get
emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has been voted coach of the year by his colleagues an
unprecedented four times, and has won two national titles. He has
watched more than 200 of his Nittany Lions go to the National
Football League. But before the game, members of Penn State's 1973
team _ which went 12-0 and featured Heisman Trophy winner John
Cappelletti, but still was one of four Paterno teams to go
undefeated and not win a national title _ wanted to talk about the
man.
</P>
<P>
   They shared beers and tales of their old coach and told how he
became an institution in a way that transcended the wing of Penn
State's library that is named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe always says you have to be a little kooky to be a coach,
and he is,'' said Greg Buttle, the all-American linebacker and
former New York Jet. ``But what other coach can give you a
dissertation about opera or mathematics, tell you about marriage
and agents, or even take the time to want to talk to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never said you have to win the game. He just told us to
play hard and have fun. He's an anomaly. He's a living legend who
doesn't portray himself as one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the afternoon, Paterno indeed looked very human. Red-eyed,
with his 16-month-old grandson, Matthew, on his lap and the
portrait of him and Sue to his left, he confessed that he felt the
emotion of the day wash over him on a walk earlier in the morning
when he began remembering games that had been long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think this was that big a deal,'' he said. ``I
didn't think it would mean so much. But, gee, after the game it was
tremendous,'' he said, his voice cracking again.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered a story he told to his team about the late
columnist H.L. Mencken.
</P>
<P>
   In Mencken's view, Paterno said, there were two types of tales:
``One is the wonder of it and one is the shame of it. I want us to
be the wonder of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday, Paterno, the Nittany Lions and all of Happy Valley
were.

 &HT;    Lessons coming to life in classrooms
 &HT;    By Rick Badie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As Congress debated how to handle Kenneth Starr's
445-page report on the Clinton presidency, Roswell High School
history class students talked about retribution, betrayal and shame
in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 29 students in a morning history class Friday, 16 said
they favor impeachment, seven said Clinton deserves censure, and
none wanted his resignation _ pretty disparate views for students
who live in what teacher Steve Terry jokingly calls ``a bedrock
community of Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bail out, you're a wuss,'' said Adam Hebbard, a junior
in Terry's college-level American History course. ``You'd be even
more of a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Such commentary offers a snapshot of the kind of classroom
debate the Clinton-Lewinsky affair is providing metro Atlanta
students and teachers. Pundits, reporters and spin doctors aren't
the only ones feasting on Clinton's dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the political crisis makes for a grand civics
lesson, one diced with sex, lies and intrigue. Most teachers,
though, try to downplay or skirt the sex details when engaging
students in lessons on democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible situation, but a perfect opportunity to teach
the methods of the Constitution and how the power of the most
powerful person in the world is being checked,'' said Terry, who
has a doctorate in social science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my students they are watching the Constitution at work,
and it's working to see whether one branch of government has been
abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``Watergate Baby,'' Terry said he also
discusses the historical perspective of impeachment. Students who
wrongly think Richard Nixon was impeached learn that it only
happened to one U.S. president _ Andrew Johnson. He was not removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta teachers say it's virtually impossible to discuss
Clinton without mentioning lurid details. And even though the
sensational issues now sit on the periphery of other concerns _
whether Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice, tampered
with witnesses and abused the power of his office _ ``it's still
extraordinarily difficult,'' said Mike Nance, teacher and social
studies chairman at DeKalb's Druid Hills High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have open and frank discussions of the ethical variety,''
he said, adding that the Clinton crisis dominates weekly current
events discussions. ``We talk about the effect on the presidency,
the philosophy of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite admitting that most people are interested ``in juicy
details, not constitutional principle,'' historian Gilbert T.
Sewall applauds approaches taken by Nance and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good social studies teachers and students should be talking
about the Second Article of the Constitution, the impeachment
clause and government's checks and balances,'' said Sewall,
director of the American Textbook Council in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And given the steaminess of the issue, Sewall suggested that
classroom discussion be relegated to eighth through 12th grades, if
it takes place at all. ``It's a delicate issue that should be
discussed with nuance and subtlety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Terry's class Friday, students wondered aloud about the
country's leadership, and admonished Clinton for having sexual
trysts in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is owned by us, the citizens,'' said Anne
Lovatt, 16, who wondered if an impeached Clinton would have
bodyguard protection as a private citizen. ``So it was our house he
was doing this in.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all attempts at classroom discussion generate the kind
of questions and opinions teachers enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had one Clinton article'' brought in by a student
for current events discussions, said Keena Ryals-Jenkins, a
10th-grade social studies teacher at Fairburn's Creekside High.
``They are more concerned about the embassy bombings and local
issues like violence on the home front.''
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Robinson, a social studies teacher at Trickum Middle
School in Gwinnett County, was greeted with blank stares last week
when she mentioned the delivery of the Starr report to her four
eighth-grade classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a funeral,'' she said, noting that talk of
single-season home-run king Mark McGwire would have garnered a
different reception.

SENDER DEUTSCH, 76, HASIDIC LEADER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi Sender Deutsch, a leader of one of the largest
Hasidic Jewish groups in the United States and the longtime chief
editor and publisher of Der Yid, a Yiddish-language weekly
newspaper, died on Sept. 2 at Maimonides Medical Center in
Brooklyn. He was 76 and a resident of the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn, where he had lived for about 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the liver, said Rabbi Hertz Frankel, a
spokesman for the Satmar Hasidic community.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Deutsch was vice president of the Brooklyn Satmar
group, one of the two leading international Hasidic communities.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch was also, at his death, the chief editor and publisher
of Der Yid, having held those posts since he founded the paper 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he was senior vice president of the World Council
of Orthodox Jewish Communities, which coordinates social and other
services for the Orthodox and Hasidic communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Council was a party to the recently settled class-action
lawsuit against leading Swiss banks, accusing them of improperly
retaining assets of victims of the Nazi era. In the settlement,
reached last month, the banks agreed to pay $1.25 billion to
claimants in the suit _ people who survived the Holocaust and the
heirs of those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch was himself a Holocaust survivor; he lost all the
closest members of his family except for a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Czechoslovakia, the son of a printer and publisher, he
was forced into slave labor in Hungary during World War II, was
freed by the advancing Soviet Army and came to the United States in
1949. He was later awarded the honorary title of rabbi because of
his leadership role in the Satmar community.
</P>
<P>
   During his decades with Der Yid, Deutsch wrote a weekly column
for the newspaper, under the pseudonym Eliezer Epstein. The column
appeared next to the editorials _ which in most cases he also
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Der Yid, which has a total circulation of about 50,000,
including newsstand sales and subscriptions, is sent to every part
of the world where there are Orthodox Jews, Frankel said. ``In the
Orthodox Jewish community, Yiddish is a living language,'' he said.
``In the rest of the world it is a museum language.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Deutsch was a close aide to the current Satmar
Grand Rabbi, Moses Teitelbaum, and to his predecessor and uncle,
Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Deutsch was prominent in the Satmar religious
education network, which Frankel said has an enrollment of more
than 18,000 students, making it the largest Jewish school system in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch was born in Brezno, in what is now Slovakia, graduated
from a religious secondary school there and went on to study at a
yeshiva, a Jewish school of higher learning. For a time after World
War II, he lived in a camp for displaced persons near Munich, in
the part of Germany that was occupied by American soldiers. At the
camp he met a cousin, Rachel Deutsch, and they married in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch was the founding editor and publisher of another
Yiddish-language newspaper, Yiddishe Zeitung. It ceased publication
after a few years, Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Deutsch is survived by three sons,
Aaron, Hersh and Yidel, all of Williamsburg, Brooklyn; three
daughters, Esther Blumenfeld, Zisel Mittelman and Rivka Lefkowitz,
all of Williamsburg; 38 grandchildren; 43 great-grandchildren, and
his sister, Yenti Rosenberg of the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn.

 &HT;    Duke students, staff remain skeptical
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ Some professors and students at one of Kenneth
Starr's alma maters, the Duke University School of Law, said
they're more troubled by the independent counsel law and the
four-year investigation of President Clinton than by the lurid
sexual details in Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Their skepticism of Starr's investigation joins the growing
national debate over whether the 52-year-old lawyer who graduated
from Duke Law School in 1973 was intent, as Clinton's lawyers
contend, on humiliating the president and forcing him from office
or simply doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation ``has been so long and so drawn out,'' said
Elizabeth Holt, 23, a Duke law student from Oak Ridge, Tenn. ``At
times it seemed more like a fishing expedition, as opposed to
having evidence beforehand and acting on that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a flaw in the independent counsel statute is that
investigations too often become witch hunts,'' said Christoper H.
Schroeder, a Duke law professor for 19 years. ``All the biases are
in favor of finding something ... or else face justifying all of
the public money you spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another professor, Sara Sun Beale, added that the federal
statute ``pretty much gives the prosecutor a blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   Most at the prestigious Durham, N.C., law school carefully
avoided stating opinions about Starr, a generous donor. His name is
listed on a wall plaque among benefactors of $5,000 or more in the
1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   A first-floor hallway is lined with class portraits dating from
1932, including Starr's class in front of the stately law school.
In the style of the early 1970s, Starr wears sideburns, striped
pants and a dark long-sleeve shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Class of 1937 picture includes Richard Nixon, the deceased
former president who resigned from office in 1974 rather than face
impeachment proceedings for his role in the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is an active alumnus who spoke at Duke Law School's 1995
commencement. Less than a year earlier, he had been appointed as
independent counsel to investigate Clinton's involvement in the
Whitewater real estate development in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation broadened, first to cover the White House
Travel Office firings and then allegations involving White House
files. In January, Starr's probe expanded to include issues from
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky's involvement with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, shortly after it became available on the
Internet, Starr's report was the talk of the law school. A portion
of the report circulated among students gathered for an activities
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Over soda and beer, students expressed amazement at the explicit
descriptions of the encounters between the president and Lewinsky.
Many were attuned as well to the legal and political ramifications
of what's ahead for Clinton as Congress acts on the findings of
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Lerman, 23, president of the Duke Law Republicans,
predicted that impeachment proceedings in the House of
Representatives will be ``incredibly political and partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she believes that the sexual revelations about Clinton
and Lewinsky are irrelevant except as they relate to whether the
president perjured himself or obstructed justice, as Starr charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are talking about impeachment, you are talking about
high crimes and misdemeanors,'' said Lerman, an intern this past
summer at Atlanta's King &AMP; Spalding law firm. ``I do not think oral
sex is what the founding fathers had in mind when they wrote the
Constitution. I think lying under oath, lying to the public,
abusing the resources at his disposal, such as government
attorneys, is what they had in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Wofford, 25, co-chairman of the Women's Law Students
Association, said many women's organizations are perplexed over
Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to have a president who has done such great things
for the country and great things for women, but on the personal
level has behaved in a manner that is not up to the same level,''
said Wofford, of Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Wofford said she believes it would be damaging for the country
if Clinton were impeached or forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, she added, ``has changed the presidency'' and
raised a big question: ``Are we as a country going to hold the
president to a higher personal standard, or draw a line between his
professional life and personal behavior?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we'd be better off if he resigned,'' said
Gary Eichelberger, 26, president of the law school's Christian
Legal Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important quality to the presidency of the United
States that carries moral leadership and moral responsibility, and
Clinton has failed beyond repair,'' said Eichelberger, of Ninety
Six, S.C. ``It is important for Christians and Americans to be able
to forgive him. But forgiveness does not mean that there are no
consequences for your actions.''

 &HT;    Gingrich, Coverdell hold their fire
 &HT;    By D.L. Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Saturday labeled
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's sexually explicit report on
President Clinton `` very troubling,'' but he stopped short of
saying it contained impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot render any judgment until you have given the
president a chance to respond and given the Judiciary Committee a
chance to do its job,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   His response was more measured than that of fellow Rep. Bob
Barr, one of the president's fiercest critics in Congress who said
Saturday that a decision by Clinton to resign would ``certainly be
appropriate'' and would ``save the country a lot of turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell stayed away from the topic entirely when
addressing a Gwinnett County Republican Party breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, speaking to a breakfast meeting with 6th District
Republicans in north Fulton County, said members of Congress should
let the legal process take its course now that Starr's report has
been handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot to be done,'' Gingrich said. ``The
president has every right to respond. There are 17 boxes of
evidence to be reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said if Clinton had told the truth from the beginning
the public wouldn't be reading the lurid details contained in
Starr's report. Still, he defended its release by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible that it's about this kind of topic, but it is a
good thing that the American people can fully participate by seeing
exactly the same information that their members of Congress are
seeing,'' Gingrich said. ``I suspect by this weekend this will be
the most widely disseminated government report in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, in urging Clinton's resignation, rejected the idea of
congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is absolutely meaningless. He would laugh at it,'' he
said. ``This is an administration that has shown no regard for the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr took the first steps toward impeaching Clinton in November
1997, two months before word surfaced publicly of the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Barr said he has received more
and more support from constituents in the last few months as
details about the relationship have trickled out. He said he
expects the move to impeach Clinton to gather even more steam now
that Starr's report has released a flood of lurid details along
with accusations that the president committed perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a phenomenal amount of phone calls. People are
constantly coming up and encouraging me ... to proceed with an
inquiry of impeachment,'' Barr said. ``If Americans are upset with
the details in (Starr's report), they ought to blame the president,
not Kenneth Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he did not know whether Clinton was sincere when he
told a National Prayer Breakfast at the White House and a national
television audience Friday that he had sinned and repented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never tell with this guy,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also apologized during a trip to Florida on
Wednesday, but Barr said Clinton should ``quit whining, quit
apologizing and do his job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't put him in office to go around the country on our
dime to apologize,'' he said. At a Gwinnett County Republican Party
breakfast with Coverdell, the party faithful, given a chance to
press the state's senior senator on the issues of the day, asked
only about IRS reform, census enumeration methodology and national
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who is running for re-election against Michael Coles,
millionaire founder of the Great American Cookie Co., made a brief
appearance at the breakfast in a day filled with other
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters later what he has heard from constituents
about the Starr report and President Clinton's situation, Coverdell
noted that he had just come from a breakfast at which the matter
was never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Seconding a recent suggestion by Gingrich that the media should
focus more attention on the process of government and less on
scandals, Coverdell said he attended a leadership meeting Thursday
at which ``what we talked about was appropriations, tax relief _
with only 19 days left in this Congress, there's an enormous amount
of business still to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own attention to the Starr investigation, Coverdell
said, ``There is a process to manage that. It's a process for the
House Judiciary Committee right now. All other (government)
processes must continue. People are still interested in their
paychecks.''

BOB DIXON, 87, BROADCASTER AND MURROW FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Dixon, a longtime broadcast announcer who had an unlikely
star turn as a Connecticut-bred television cowboy and an even less
likely run as Edward R. Murrow's best friend, died on Aug. 22 at a
nursing home in Bethel, Conn. He was 87 and lived in Gaylordsville,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   To the children who tuned into CBS from 1949 to 1951 to watch
the shoot-'em-up movie westerns that were the late afternoon rage
of the early television day, Sheriff Bob Dixon, as the show's host
styled himself, was cowboy personified: a tall, rangy man in
authentic Western gear and with a resonant twang that fairly
shouted Wyoming as he introduced the movies and schooled his young
audiences on the nuances of saddles, bridles and shooting irons.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he had been born in Stamford, Conn., grew up in New
Canaan, appeared in summer stock as a teen-ager, attended the
Virginia Military Institute, graduated from Springfield College and
spent two decades as a radio announcer in Massachusetts and New
York City?
</P>
<P>
   One of his grandfathers, as Dixon liked to point out, had raised
horses in Pound Ridge, N.Y., and driven a stagecoach between there
and the Stamford, Conn., train station.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his cowboy credentials, as the host of ``The Chuck
Wagon,'' on WCBS-TV in New York and later ``The Chuck Wagon
Playhouse'' on the CBS network, Dixon became almost as famous as
Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   Initially hired to introduce the movies, Dixon warmed to his
role and soon expanded it, introducing show-and-tell segments in
which he would display and discuss saddles, harnesses and other
cowboy gear.
</P>
<P>
   As he later recalled, the segments, which included guest
appearances by celebrities, were introduced as time-stretchers
after complaints from parents' groups concerned about the movies'
gratuitous violence led program executives to trim the films.
</P>
<P>
   The educational segments, as he took pains not to call them,
became so popular, Dixon later recalled, that ``the movies got
shorter and shorter and I got longer and longer.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the appeal of his demonstrations, it was a series
showing the correct use of guns that led Dixon to earn a footnote
to broadcast history by persuading a bird-hunting buddy to come on
his show and discuss shotgun safety.
</P>
<P>
   The buddy was Edward R. Murrow, and, as Dixon never tired of
recalling, the decidedly nervous demonstration by the broadcasting
giant was Murrow's very first appearance on television.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who shared an interest in guns, horses, the outdoor
life and little else, had formed an unlikely friendship in 1947
when Dixon got an assignment to do a commercial right after
Murrow's daily radio news program.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted by Murrow's biographers, Joseph P. Persico and
Alexander Kendrick, Dixon began coming to the studio early to
listen to the broadcast, and Murrow began playing to his new
admirer.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day in a gesture Dixon later likened to a 10-year-old
pulling the pigtail of the girl he liked, the notoriously shy
Murrow told Dixon that his commercial delivery had not been bad
``for a guy with a speech impediment,'' and Dixon promptly returned
the kidding insult.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, much to the amazement of his coterie of awed acolytes,
Murrow started asking Dixon into his office for a post-broadcast
Scotch and a full-fledged friendship was born, one that seemed
based on the fact that unlike almost everyone else Murrow knew
Dixon had absolutely no intellectual pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Dixon had become Murrow's announcer and later
worked on ``See It Now,'' and other Murrow television programs
before going on to a career that included a stint as host of the
CBS radio weekend ``Dimension'' series, acting appearances on more
than dozen prime-time programs and wide-ranging work as an
announcer and commercial spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon may have been an unlikely television cowboy, but as Murrow
sensed, he was authentic, which is why as Murrow lay dying from
brain cancer in New York Hospital in 1965 and determined to die at
his Connecticut home, Murrow summoned Dixon to his bedside and
asked him to get him out of the hospital even if Dixon had to carry
him out on his back.
</P>
<P>
   A more orderly exit was swiftly arranged, and Dixon helped nurse
Murrow through the final days of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who was married three times, is survived by two sons,
Roy, of Cobb, Calif., and Bruce, of Napierville, Ill.; two
daughters, Roberta Tyson of Cornwall, Conn., and Kristen Dixon of
Santa Cruz, Calif.; a sister, Helen Rustoe of Saratoga Springs,
N.Y.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Delivery of report flawless
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kenneth Starr's report to Congress was a massive
document that Web sites had to put up as quickly as possible in an
easy to access and readable format.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the sites posting the report accomplished their goal
with relative ease. They were able to do it because of the
Net-ready form it arrived in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a producer talking with people at the House of
Representatives, which is distributing the report,'' said
MSNBC.com's executive editor Michael Silberman. MSNBC.com expected
to receive the report in several forms. ``We are going to get a
disk, we may also get a hard copy, we are also going to get it
e-mailed to us from the House.'' Silberman also said that MSNBC.com
set up an internal FTP (file transfer protocol) site to have the
document transferred directly from computers at the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman says the worse case would have been to only have hard
copy to work with, but luckily that wasn't the case. There was also
a huge technology push to make the typically tough to access MSNBC
pages more accessible to news hungry visitors. Programming code was
stripped down, Web pages were made ``lighter'' or stripped of Web
applets, pictures and Microsoft's customized features to ease the
server load and help the pages load faster. The MSNBC home page was
broken down to a simple page of text linking users to the report or
other areas of the site.
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta, (http://www.accessatlanta.com), was in charge of
receiving, posting and distributing the report for its own site and
the 20 other city sites that make up Cox Interactive Media. ``We
had the bases covered in a number of different ways,'' said Access
Atlanta General Manager George deGolian. ``Our technology team sent
`spiders' out to the government's document sites. As soon as it
showed up we were going to download it,'' he says. ``We also had an
agreement with the Associated Press, which was going to get it
first from the House of Representatives and distribute it unedited
to Cox Interactive Media (CIM), CNN, Knight Ridder and several
other major media companies.'' AP planned to send the document to
Cox unedited via FTP so they'd have it before other news
organizations, who would receive an edited version.
</P>
<P>
   However, while CIM was watching the government sites and waiting
for the AP story, a colleague in Austin called and said they had
received the e-mail version of the document. (The House of
Representatives had also promised e-mail versions to various news
organizations.) ``So we got the e-mail document almost the same
time the AP got their copy,'' deGolian says. ``We had it online
within about two minutes of CNN, because the e-mail message was a
Web-ready hyperlinked document. The government really did its job
right,'' he says. Over the weekend, CIM will tinker with the report
to add more design elements that will give it the look and feel of
AccessAtlanta and the other Web sites across the network.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNews was another major media organization that received the
report simultaneously with the federal sites. The document was so
large, spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said ABCNews had ``people in
New York, Seattle and D.C. working on coding and posting the
document.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online created a special section linked directly off its
welcome screen devoted to the report, along with analysis and
commentary. The sheer size of AOL's network makes it possible for
its 13 million subscribers to access the report with almost no wait
time at all. However, unlike the Web sites, which are available for
viewing by anyone with Internet access, AOL is a controlled
community that adheres to a certain set of standards. Before
gaining access to the report, users were warned that the content
might not be suitable for children and directions were given on
setting AOL's parental controls to prevent school-age eyes from
reading the report. There is also a section on how to broach the
topic with children.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also packaged the report into various easy to read morsels,
including a list of highlights from the Associated Press, a
searchable copy of the Starr report, a downloadable version of the
report and a copy of the White House rebuttal.

 &HT;    World Wide Web searches turn up lots more than basic report
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There may be only one big story, but the searcher
must beware the myriad spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was the key carrier of that big story, as many
thousands of people were drawn by the compelling spectacle of the
report by prosecutor Kenneth Starr that claims the president is
guilty of adulterous sex and a criminal cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   That 445-page report was officially available on the Library of
Congress site known as Thomas (http://thomas.loc.gov/ICreport/).
The site logged 3,736,902 visits on Friday, compared with an
average of 236,409 daily visits in August.
</P>
<P>
   The stunningly quick access made the details of Starr's report
and news about the president's rebuttal available to anyone with
Internet access _ a technological contribution to democracy that
the Founding Fathers could never have envisioned. Before he was
president, Thomas Jefferson, for whom the Library of Congress site
is named, said he would prefer to have newspapers without a
government to having a government without newspapers. Faster than
any papers 220 years ago, the Internet makes it easy to bring a
stunning array of data to the people quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But it also leaves control in the hands of users, providing far
less structure than the papers and pamphlets that helped propel the
13 colonies into revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report sets the stage for hearings on the possible
impeachment of President Clinton. Its release on the Net set the
stage for politicking, ideological ax-grinding, satire,
merchandising, manipulation and exploitation _ as well as
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering data to the masses, because of the Net's
structure, a novice Net searcher could set out looking for Kenneth
Starr and find himself staring at pornography. Or a parody that
looks genuine.
</P>
<P>
   A common way to access the Net is to use a search engine like
Yahoo! or AltaVista. The user types in a few key words _ for
instance, ``Starr'' and ``report'' _ and hits the search button.
The engine churns for a moment and compiles a list of sites for the
user to click on.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the search makes it easy to get more than you
want. The engine looks for the key words listed by the owner of a
site. It doesn't matter whether the site's substance has anything
to do with what you want. So a clever Web master hoping for more
traffic might place ``Starr'' and ``report'' in the key words for a
porn site _ or an evangelical site, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the list appears on the screen, sometimes the user will see
what he or she wants immediately. Sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   A first pass at Yahoo! offered, among other things, a chance to
click on: a letter sent by former President George Bush that
defends Starr, a site billing itself as the Clinton Legal Expense
Trust, which features anti-Starr political cartoons and commentary,
a who's who of witnesses who testified before the grand jury, a
chat site devoted to the report, and a site devoted to describing
what it's like to be a White House intern _ really.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista had 231,350 matches, including some way off the track.
For instance, the STARR educational program is probably not part of
any Congressional hearings on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, searches turn up sites with an agenda. Look
for the Starr report and find Nation magazine to the left,
Conservative News Service to the right.
</P>
<P>
   A user who decides to detour around the search engines might try
typing StarrReport.com, but that produces a very unofficial site.
Extremely anti-Clinton, the Starr Report touts itself as ``The
naked truth about the Oval Office.'' On the site you have a chance
to buy books including Gennifer Flowers' story of her affair with
Clinton ($7.96, 20 percent off). There are also links to jokes,
conservative organizations and ``raunchy stuff.''

JOHN HOLLIMAN, 49, OF CNN; COVERED '91 BAGHDAD ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Holliman, a CNN correspondent who distinguished himself by
being one of only three journalists to broadcast live coverage of
the 1991 bombing of Baghdad, died Saturday morning. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman suffered internal injuries from a head-on car collision
with a pickup truck. The accident occurred near his home in
Snellville, Ga., as he tried to pass another car in a no-passing
lane, striking the oncoming truck, according to CNN and The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the quintessential journeyman reporter, always
enthusiastic and ready to cover anything,'' said CNN correspondent
Peter Arnett, who along with Holliman and CNN anchor Bernard Shaw
were the only three journalists to report live from Baghdad on the
air raids on Iraq's capital city during the Persian Gulf war.
Without Holliman's ``extensive knowledge of communications,''
Arnett said, CNN's historic broadcasts would never have been
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bombing started at 2:30 a.m., our communications went
down just like everyone else's. We presumed we had been bombed out
of existence,'' Arnett said in a telephone interview from his home
in Virginia. ``But John fiddled with the equipment and ultimately
replaced the battery so that we could go on to report 17 hours of
history.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Thomaston, Ga., Holliman graduated from the
University of Georgia, where he received a bachelor's degree in
journalism. In 1980, he joined CNN's original reporting team and
was the network's first Washington correspondent. He also covered
the student uprisings in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. From 1974 to
1980 Holliman wrote and filed radio dispatches for The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Holliman was one of a kind, a CNN original,'' said Tom
Johnson, CNN's News Group chairman. ``As one of the boys of
Baghdad, he showed great courage reporting as allied bombs fell all
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holliman received several honors for his work, including the
National Headliner Award, the George Peabody Award and a Golden
Microphone. This fall, he was scheduled to be co-anchor for CNN's
coverage of Sen. John Glenn's return to space.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman had dreamed of becoming the first reporter in space.
``I expect he'll be up there watching the mission from the heavens,
probably shouting, `Holy cow, what a sight!''' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman is survived by his wife, Diane; his son, John Emmett;
his mother, Arva Tolbert Holliman of Thomaston, Ga., and a brother,
Max Tolbert Holliman of Atlanta.

IN FLORIDA, VARIED EMOTIONS AND SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Some made an effort to ignore it, insisting it was none
of their business. Others found themselves drawn to every word,
unable to put down the newspaper or turn off the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the independent counsel Kenneth Starr on the
Monica Lewinsky affair did not seem to change many minds in
Florida, but its lurid details and its case for the impeachment of
President Clinton have raised partisan passions here.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that the president lost in 1992 but won in 1996,
where registered voters are nearly equally divided between
Democrats and Republicans, many are shocked, angered and ashamed.
They are wondering what is next for a country mired in the tawdry
goings-on between a married president and a woman not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry,'' said Roseanne Scheck, 37, a Democrat and a social
worker in Tallahassee who said that she considered Clinton's sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky to be his family's business.
``It's not anything we need to know about. It doesn't have to do
anything with this country's politics, educational system, social
service system. That report, it just might as well be in The
National Enquirer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Orlando area, Julie McLachlan, 29, a Republican with two
children who works as a court stenographer, directed her outrage at
Clinton, who she said could have saved the country expense and
embarrassment by owning up to his actions at the first opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned, this is the beginning of a global
and moral collapse of our young people because of the example he
has set,'' Ms. McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Released on Friday, the report and its salacious details spread
quickly among the public through the Internet, television reports,
radio chatter and parties. Saturday morning, newspapers like The
Gainesville Sun published the complete report in special sections,
while others like The Miami Herald, The Tallahassee Democrat and
The St. Petersburg Times ran several pages of excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   Floridians interviewed Saturday around the state applied words
like ``silly,'' ``titillating'' and ``gross'' to the report's
graphic descriptions of sexual encounters but said they were more
concerned about the big picture _ whether Americans had become the
world's laughing stock, whether the nation would be scarred
forever, whether anybody would ever again want to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm afraid public figures are going to have even less of a
private life,'' said Connie Tessmer, 31, a computer programmer and
a Democrat. ``Now people are going to be more apt and dig up dirt.
But, you know, maybe that will make government officials think
twice. Maybe it will work out good in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr cited 11 possible counts for impeachment on grounds of
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
authority, all revolving around Clinton's liaison with Ms.
Lewinsky. Among Floridians interviewed today who said the president
should resign or face impeachment, many said they were most
offended by the apparent with which Clinton lied _ to his wife, to
the country and even, some believe, under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been private business if he had admitted right
away that, yes, I had an affair,'' said Carl Bennett, 38, a
Tallahassee plumber and a Republican. ``Then you could have moved
on. But whenever you start the lying, the trying to cover it up,
that's when it became a public problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Powell, 51, a Web site designer for a Christian Internet
service in Fort Lauderdale, said she had read about 40 pages of the
report to weigh the facts for herself and concluded Clinton should
resign because, ``it's not just he-said, she-said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's she-said and here's the evidence that backs up what she
said,'' said Ms. Powell, who is registered as an independent voter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has the morals of an alley cat,'' she said. ``He
really has lost credibility among the people. We can't believe a
word he says. And even the things he's saying now _ I had an
improper relationship but it really wasn't sex. Come on, get
real.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Roberto Montes de Oca, 49, a social worker and a
Democrat, said it troubled him that Clinton did not seem to stop to
think of the consequences of lying about the affair to the American
people. But he and others interviewed who opposed impeachment said
it troubled them more that the country would forget the good
Clinton has done during his presidency and that ``a great
president'' could face removal from office for what amounts to
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a sex offender,'' Montes de Oca said. ``It has no
repercussions for the nation. It's a problem for him and his wife,
not me. Nobody would lose a job over something like that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was shocked someone dared to investigate this stuff and then
report about it,'' Montes de Oca said, adding that he worried about
the extent to which the president might have lost the respect of
Congress, Cabinet members and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's morbid,'' he said. ``The investigators give the
impression of being sexually repressed people feeding on the things
others do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some found the graphic descriptions of sexual encounters in the
report necessary because of Clinton's insistence that certain acts
were not, in fact, sex. But Starr's failure so far to produce
evidence against Clinton in the areas he originally set out to
investigate, such as the Whitewater land deal, has led many other
to question his motives and cast him as the villain in the public
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just out to get Clinton,'' said Ms. Scheck, the
Tallahassee social worker. ``Anything and everything that he can
possibly find, he scoops up. It's just annoying at this point. He
didn't find anything with Whitewater and now he just kept on with
it until he found something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector E. Fernandez, 26, a Miami optician, said: ``It's
embarrassing that Ken Starr has nothing better to do with our
money. If they were investigating everyone that had an extramarital
affair and had to lose their job there would be 1 million people
suddenly unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Hooper, 66, an artist and a Republican from
Orlando, said she supported Starr because ``he stood for what he
thought was right and didn't back down and run away because it was
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Montes de Oca, who supports Clinton, did not blame Starr,
either. ``It was his job,'' he said. ``People criticize but they
keep reading, and the media keeps fanning the issue as if this were
a soap opera. It shows total immaturity. It's like being in high
school.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ Maybe Rutgers, a Division I-A team,
should stick to playing Division I-AA schools.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Rutgers ended a 14-game losing streak by edging
Division I-AA Richmond, 7-6, in a game in which the Spiders
outplayed the Scarlet Knights in the second half. For Rutgers, it
was only its third victory in its last 21 games, and one of those
was over another Division I-AA team, Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Rutgers got back into its own league, the Big East,
against a Boston College team that had beaten Georgia Tech on the
road, 41-31, in its season opener.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring the game's first touchdown on its first
possession, Rutgers endured a three-touchdown onslaught by Boston
College within a span of seven minutes and saw the Eagles cruise to
a 41-14 victory before 38,287 in Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   An inept running game, which accounted for only 53 yards, and an
inability to cope with the Boston College ground game (268 yards)
were the most significant factors in the Rutgers defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get our running game going,'' Rutgers Coach Terry
Shea said. ``We're sputtering big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Thomas, the sophomore running back who scored a touchdown
against Richmond, led the Scarlet Knights with 41 yards in 15
carries.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mike Cloud, who ran for 200 yards in Boston
College's opener, rumbled 27 times for 156 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, Cloud _ who has rushed for more
than 100 yards 10 times in his career _ and BC quarterback Scott
Mutryn each scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn, a senior who had been a backup to Matt Hasselbeck the
last three years, completed 17 of 30 passes (with two
interceptions) for 218 yards, equaling the yardage of Rutgers'
sophomore quarterback, Mike McMahon, who connected on 13 of 30
passes.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 20-7 at halftime, Rutgers drew to within 20-14
in the third quarter when senior cornerback Reggie Stephens picked
off a Mutryn pass at the Eagles' 28-yard line and raced in for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That only served to inspire BC, as the Eagles responded with
three quick touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, on a 6-yard run by Cloud and a 22-yard scamper by
Mutryn, followed sustained drives, while the third, a 4-yard run by
halfback Quinton Lee, came after McMahon had been sacked twice, on
third and fourth down, inside the Scarlet Knights' 25-yard line
with less than two minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give Boston College credit for the way they
responded to our touchdown on the interception,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They are very balanced and their defense was much
tougher than our offense.''

IN SPEECH, JUSTICE THOMAS TALKS OF `BACKBONE' AND BELIEFS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alternately defiant and at times close to tears,
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas exhorted a group of
conservatives Saturday to remain true to their beliefs even if they
are subjected to personal attacks and unfair criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage you to stand up for what you believe in,'' Thomas
said at a luncheon sponsored by a conservative black magazine,
Headway. ``Life is not worth living without principles. It is not
worth living without backbone. If you don't have a backbone, you
slither.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Thomas expressed these sentiments, he was
overcome with emotion and struggled to retain his composure.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause of this rare display of emotion by a member
of the country's highest court was his recollection of two close
friends, Gilbert Hardy, who was his roommate at Yale Law School,
and Clarence Pendleton, the former chairman of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission. Both men died at relatively young ages, and
Thomas said both had been the subjects of attacks by his political
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these friends is my good friend Gil Hardy whose honor,
whose integrity, whose goodness was trashed in order to destroy
me,'' Thomas told the audience. ``That, my friends, is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke of his friend, Thomas, the high court's only black
member, stopped, stood silently for several minutes, asked for a
drink of water and dabbed his eyes with a napkin. He later
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, the audience of about 200 people, who had greeted
him enthusiastically, sat silently as Thomas fought to control his
emotions. After a few moments, someone yelled out ``We love you,
Clarence!'' and the audience erupted into applause.
</P>
<P>
   A former partner in a Washington law firm, Hardy in 1981 had
introduced Thomas to Anita Hill, who was an associate at the firm.
That same year, Hardy asked Thomas, who was then an official at the
Education Department, to hire Ms. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy died in a scuba-diving accident in 1989. When Ms. Hill
charged, at Thomas' confirmation hearings in 1991, that the nominee
had sexually harassed her, reporters began asking questions about
how the two had come to know each other. That brought a brief focus
on Hardy, but no accusations or suggestions of wrongdoing on
Hardy's part were made.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also expressed sadness over Pendleton, who died of a
heart attack in 1988 at 57. Without providing specifics, Thomas
said that at the time of his death, Pendleton's ``spirit was
broken, perhaps as a memorial of your right to think for
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's speech was the second time in the last six weeks that
Thomas had emphasized his right to think for himself. In July, at a
speech before the National Bar Association, a organization of black
lawyers, Thomas said he refused ``to have my ideas assigned to me
as though I was an intellectual slave because I'm black.''
</P>
<P>
   But while that speech was brimming with defiance, Saturday's
address bubbled over with a sense of martyrdom that he said he and
others had felt for being conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make some hard decisions,'' Thomas said, ``and one
of the decisions I have made, particularly after the death of my
grandparents in the early '80s, is that I would rather die than
give up.''

MARIS WAS A GOOD PLAYER ... BUT GREAT? 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random observations on Mark McGwire's record-breaking week in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's performance this year has finally allowed Roger Maris
to get his due as a player. People put him down 37 years ago
because he wasn't Mickey Mantle and he wasn't Babe Ruth, and
because he was a .269 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With the emotions of 1961 out of the way, most of the
retrospectives done on Maris have shown him for what he was: a very
good baseball player who could do more than hit and a very good
person who wasn't the rude brute depicted by a frustrated,
demanding media.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does not belong in the Hall of Fame, and any claims
he does go way too far in revising history. Maris had one terrific
season and two others that were very good. Other than that, his
statistics were mediocre at best. Injuries had something to do with
it, but that's never made a difference with anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' career was similar to Ruben Sierra, another terrific
player whose production dropped off well before one would expect.
And Rangers fans know better than anybody the only way Sierra is
getting to Cooperstown is by full-fare coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and Ivan Rodriguez are proving Latino players can be
extremely popular in America even if they don't have complete
command of the language. That might be the most far-reaching and
long-lasting benefit from the Great Home Run Chase, especially if
Ruben Mateo, Cesar King and others don't have to fight the cultural
barriers faced by Sierra and Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, as great as he was, had to
battle racially inspired innuendo all through his career and never
received his due until after his untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire also are proving not only do baseball fans
admire great performances, they also want to share in them. Nolan
Ryan also knew it, and that's why he was ceaselessly accommodating
to the fans, media, public officials and charitable causes. In
return, he became the most popular player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The standing ovations received by Sosa in St. Louis are proof
baseball players will be accepted by fans when they show they're
willing to make an effort.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cardinals fans are the best in baseball, which made it
interesting to see them boo commissioner Bud Selig when he was
introduced during Tuesday's postgame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Selig has been boasting that baseball is amid a remarkable
recovery, but that hasn't erased from people's minds the
devastating effects of the 1994-95 players' strike. Nor should it,
because Selig played a significant role in that strike and all his
wonderful eloquence about the grandeur of baseball cannot change
the fact his leadership almost brought about total ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Selig also must realize complete recovery will never be achieved
until fans are completely assured there will not be another work
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Oakland Athletics are taking heat for not
getting enough for Mark McGwire, who was traded to the Cardinals on
July 31, 1997. The Athletics got pitchers T.J. Mathews, Blake Stein
and Eric Ludwick in return, but only Stein has a chance of
amounting to anything in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think there were any options,'' team
president Sandy Alderson said. ``It had gotten to the point where
it was what Mark wanted to do. We had all come to the conclusion he
would not be back. That's become the nature of the game. Trades are
often not made in the interest of improving a team, but in the
interest of salvaging something.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson had some theories on why the people of St. Louis have
taken to McGwire in a way Oakland never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons St. Louis has embraced him so much is since
he has been there, they've seen nothing but the positive side,''
Alderson said. ``They haven't suffered through injuries.''
\Nrailhed:POP-UPS \Nsubheds:Wild wild-cards
\Nhelveticabody:The National League is going to be the ultimate
test this year on the true benefits of going to three divisions and
a wild card in each league.
</P>
<P>
   If fans can get excited about the wild-card race, then the
format will have merit. The Cubs did have 38,722 at Wrigley Field
on Thursday, but it's hard to say if that was because the team is
in contention or people just want to see Sammy Sosa hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the race has been terrific. The Mets and the Cubs went
into the weekend tied for the lead, with the San Francisco Giants
21/2 back. There have been 11 lead changes or ties since the
All-Star break, and the Mets and Cubs have gone 35 consecutive days
where they've been within one game of each other.
</P>
<P>
   If this was the old National League East Division, there would
be intense excitement in both cities that revived memories of 1969
when the underdog Mets overcame the Cubs in September. This race
has yet to generate that intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if this was the old format, you would have even a
better race in the Western Division between Houston (95-53 going
into the weekend), Atlanta (95-54) and San Diego (93-55.)
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how it all comes out, the NL playoffs are going to
be tremendous this year. \Nsubheds:Kerry concerns
\Nhelveticabody9.6:There is genuine concern in Chicago about Kerry
Wood's elbow, and the Cubs also are hinting that their star pitcher
needs to step up his off-season conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jim Riggleman said the Cubs need to ``re-educate'' Wood
about his off-season conditioning, meaning more arm exercises and
light weightlifting. They want him to spend the winter in Arizona
working with club conditioning coach Bruce Hammel and pitcher Steve
Trachsel, known for his intense work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy,'' Riggleman said of Wood. ``Down the road we
have to make sure he's doing more than the other guys in
conditioning.'' \Nsubheds:Bonds barrage
\Nhelveticabody:Giants outfielder Barry Bonds has grown tired of
people saying he's having an off-year and decided to set the record
straight last week for San Francisco reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had an off year,'' Bonds said. ``I've never had a
bad season since I was with the San Francisco Giants. I've been
doing it for years, consistently, every year. There isn't a person
in this locker room who can carry my jock strap. And I'm not saying
that to be derogatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anyone says. I can go down the list here.
I've done it consistently in the '90s, since I've been with the
Giants organization. But it's always something negative. If I don't
hit 50 homers, it's an off year. No one in here has hit more homers
than I have in any given year, except Matt \RWilliams\S in '94. He
had 43 homers. I still had 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one on this team has stolen more bases than me in one year.
Only a couple of times has someone had more RBI than I have, had a
better slugging percentage, a better on-base percentage. And there
haven't been too many people who have had a higher average than me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have had years off and been injured. \RMark McGwire\S was
injured for a few years. Ken Griffey has missed most of the season
before. \RSammy\S Sosa hasn't put it all together until this
season. I haven't been out of there for a long time. I haven't
taken a season off to give my body a break. I go until my body
breaks.'' \Nrailhed:BUZZ
\Nhelveticabody:Milwaukee general manager Sal Bando was ready to
bring back Phil Garner for 1999 until the Brewers lost three
consecutive games to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Now, Bando is saying
he'll reconsider the whole situation. ``That was more than anyone
could swallow,'' Bando told the ``Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel''. ...
Seattle manager Lou Piniella wants a leadoff hitter to be the
club's priority in the off-season, saying the Mariners have become
too dependent on the home run. ... Arizona will be the third
consecutive expansion team to draw 3 million. Tampa Bay will not.
...
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, going into the weekend, are 33-26 since the
All-Star break, the best record in the AL Central. The Indians are
30-29. But you can attribute that to Albert Belle getting hot way
too late and the Indians being complacent. ... Omar Vizquel went
524 at-bats without a home run, then hit two in seven at-bats. Said
Vizquel, ``Mark McGwire is in trouble now. If I get on a roll, he
better be careful.'' Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard is talking
like a man who will keep his job. On Tuesday, he suggested the
Rockies might go after Kevin Brown, who is a free agent in the
off-season and might survive in Coors Field with his hard sinker.
...
</P>
<P>
   Now that Don Smiley is out of the way, look for the Marlins to
be sold to John Henry, a South Florida commodities trader who is
offering $150 million and has the money to finance a new ballpark.
He also got general manager Dave Dombrowski to sign a new five-year
contract extension. Now Dombrowski will try to talk manager Jim
Leyland into staying. ... Anybody notice Pittsburgh's Kevin Young,
Philadelphia's Rico Brogna, Oakland's Matt Stairs and Milwaukee's
Jeromy Burnitz will all finish with more than 100 RBI? ...
</P>
<P>
   Cubs infielder Mickey Morandini on the promotion of J.D. Drew to
the St. Louis Cardinals: ``We're in the middle of a pennant race,
so we're not real worried about J.D. Drew. But over the long haul,
I think he'll be perceived as a kid who was a little bit greedy, a
guy that hadn't played an inning of major-league baseball and
wanted to be paid like a superstar.'' ... The Pirates are talking
about raising their payroll from $13 to $23 million next year,
which will give them a chance to sign some veteran free agents to
help out their considerably young talent. General manager Cam
Bonifay is hoping for between $5 million to $7 million to spend on
free agents. ... The Padres are concerned about All-Star pitcher
Andy Ashby, who has a 12.46 earned-run average in his past four
starts. Outfielder Tony Gwynn, first baseman Wally Joyner and
second baseman Quilvio Veras are banged up, too.

WHITE HOUSE ISSUES SCATHING REBUTTAL TO STARR REPORT?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McGRORY and ANN SCALES 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Putting pleas for forgiveness aside, the White
House issued a scathing and often contemptuous rebuttal Saturday to
the independent counsel's allegations of impeachable offenses,
accusing Kenneth W. Starr of taking part in a ``hit and run smear
campaign'' involving ``unconscionable overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal seizes on the copious, lurid detail in which the
Starr report portrays President Clinton's sexual trysts with Monica
S. Lewinsky as proof that prosecutors lacked credible evidence to
seek Clinton's impeachment on other, more criminally potent
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referral is so loaded with irrelevant and unnecessary
graphic and salacious allegations that only one conclusion is
possible: its principal purpose is to damage the president,'' the
White House report states.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal goes on to argue that impeachment was intended by
the drafters of the Constitution ``to redress public offenses
committed by public officials in violaton of the public trust and
duties'' _ a definition, according to the president's lawyers, that
would not include a sexual affair between a president and a
subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal concludes: ``Their very allegation demeans the
constitutional process. The document is at bottom overreaching in
an extravagant effort to find a case where there is none.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr remained out of public view Saturday and most
lawmakers journeyed home to their districts to began getting a
sense of public sentiment, Clinton Saturday welcomed several
congressmen and supporters into the Oval Office for his radio
address and urged the nation to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot lose sight of our primary mission, which is to work
for the American people, and especially for the future of our
children,'' he said in the address. ``The most important thing to
do now is to stay focused on the issues the American people sent us
here to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Capitol Hill, throughout Washington, and indeed, across
the nation, an uneasy silence reigned as the public and the
Congress digested the details and the meaning of the 445-page Starr
report _ a silence born out of shock over the alleged details of
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and a lack of clarity of whether the
charges amounted to an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Starr outlined 11 possible grounds for Clinton's
impeachment, beginning with perjury and including multiple counts
of obstructing justice, tampering with a potential witness _
presidential secretary Betty Currie _ and abuse of his
constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   Starr accused Clinton of lying under oath about the nature of
his sexual relationship with Lewinsky in the Paula C. Jones
deposition in January and again before the federal grand jury in
August. He charged that Clinton obstructed justice by creating a
scheme with Lewinsky to conceal their relationship, then by helping
Lewinsky obtain a job in New York at a time when she was under
subpoena as a witness in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also has accused Clinton of coaching Currie's testimony in
the event that she was summoned as a witness in the Jones case. He
obstructed justice again, according to Starr, by lying to aides and
the public and by invoking executive privilege for his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich Saturday called on members _
Democrats and Republicans alike _ to withhold judgment until
Clinton replies in detail to the report and the Congress begins the
process of deciphering the allegations and responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you cannot render ... any judgment until you have
given the president a chance to respond and given the Judiciary
Committee a chance to do its job,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed taken aback at the sexual details in the report,
with blame spreading between Clinton and Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the salacious material,'' said House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois. ``I think
one of the downsides or fallouts of this whole process has been
giving too much currency to salacious activities and talk. But
there's tremendous demand for the whole story to be put out on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a key Democrat and occasional
Clinton critic, dismissed the White House notion that the report
was based on a private affair between Clinton and Lewinsky, and he
also said it was obvious to him that Clinton had committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a consensual affair between a private-sector
citizen and a woman,'' Kerrey said on CNN Saturday. ``This is a
president of the United States with 1,300,000, 1,400,000 men and
women in the uniform of the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps
that have rules that are even higher standards than what we have to
serve under. They're putting themselves at risk. Yeah, I'm angry
about it. It's inexplicable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Early public opinion polls offered a mixed message on the
fallout for Clinton in the wake of the report. An ABC News poll
taken Friday night showed that 57 percent of the respondents
believe Clinton should be impeached if he encouraged Lewinsky to
lie about the relationship _ an increase of 14 points on the same
question since August. The same poll showed 59 percent think the
president broke the law, an increase of 17 points since Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a CNN/Gallup poll showed Clinton's job approval rating at
62 percent, down only slightly from August, and up from earlier
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-page point-for-point White House rebuttal, issued by
Clinton's private lawyers and White House counsel, betrayed an
uneasy sense of relief among Clinton's inner circle, where
strategists and lawyers say they now believe that Starr's report
contained no bombshell revelations. But those same aides and
lawyers remained wary of the evolving public and congressional
reaction to the unseemly details of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long, as we waited, this report was long anticipated
and much discussed and feared,'' said Ann Lewis, the White House
communications director. ``When it actually hit, what's interesting
is that it turns out, this really is a report about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart: ``After four years and
tens of millions of dollars, the word `Whitewater' appears twice in
Starr's report. But there are almost 550 references to sex, and
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Gingrich: ``I think that the nature of the president's
answers require that kind of graphicness, which I found very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton had a low-key day Saturday, in contrast to
Friday when he made several public appearances. He gave his weekly
radio address from the Oval Office, talked by phone for 30 minutes
with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin about that country's
political situation, and held forth on foreign policy with some of
his advisers before returning to the residence around 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton will put some distance between himself and
Washington, traveling Monday to New York for Democratic
fund-raisers and a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, and
on Thursday visiting Cincinnati and Boston for another round of
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior advisers Saturday said the president's strategy is to
allow his lawyers to handle the gritty rebuttals to Starr's report,
while he continues to make amends for lying about his relationship
with Lewinsky and to run the government.
</P>
<P>
   Within the White House, strategists said they have successfully
persuaded Clinton's lawyers to allow a stronger, more pointed, less
legalistic message to be delivered to voters. Lawyers and political
advisers met on Labor Day and developed a truce in their long
battle for authority, and by Saturday, the advisers spent long
meetings counseling the lawyers for a round of television
appearances on the network news shows today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, conceded one senior official, under the condition of
anonymity: ``We have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal, at times, seemed to hinge heavily on a semantic
argument that Clinton did not commit perjury when he essentially
denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in his deposition last
January in the Jones sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   It referred again to a dictionary definition of ``sexual
relations'' and said that Clinton remained within that definition
when he testified in the Jones deposition that he did not have
sexual relations with Lewinsky. In the Starr report, Lewinsky said
she had oral sex with Clinton 10 times and that he repeatedly
fondled her breasts and aroused her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers argued that Starr had not proven that the
president tried to obstruct justice by concocting ``cover stories''
with Lewinsky, by suggesting she file an affidavit in the Jones
civil case, or by failing to correct his lawyer, Robert Bennett,
when he said the president was aware of Lewinksy's affidavit and
did not dispute its assertion that they had not had sex of any
kind, during the president's deposition in Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the rebuttal said Clinton gave only ``limited
assistance'' to Lewinsky's job search and that it was not done to
get her to testify a certain way in the affidavit and obstruct
justice. It also denies that Clinton lied under oath in describing
his conversations with his friend, Washington power broker Vernon
Jordan, about Lewinsky's involvement in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House account also sought to knock down the allegation
of witness tampering, saying that when Clinton talked to Currie
about his recollection of Lewinsky, Currie was not a witness in any
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded the rebuttal: ``The president did not commit perjury.
He did not obstruct justice. He did not tamper with witnesses. And
he did not abuse the power of the office of the presidency.''

PUBLIC BEGINS DEBATE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, Md. _ The national jury began deliberating Saturday in
President Clinton's trial in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everywhere people gathered _ from a church barbecue in
Clinton's namesake town to a Labor Day parade in Manhattan to a
town hall meeting in coastal California _ they weighed the case of
the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, against that of the
president in the first stage of the mass deliberations that could
determine what price he pays, if any, beyond public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive him, impeach him, censure him, get Starr off his back:
Opinions swirled in the early winds of the stormy process of
forming a national consensus.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, public opinion is expected to influence how
the House acts on Starr's contention that Clinton committed 11
possibly impeachable offenses related to his affair with former
White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a president who needs to resign _ he sets a
bad example about what the truth is,'' said Phil Owen, a retired
school principal, near a kielbasa stand at a Greek Orthodox church
fair in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   A villain to many, Clinton was seen as a victim by many others,
a target of overzealous investigators who were more obsessed with
sex than fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Support remained strong for the president in the predominantly
black Washington suburb of Clinton, Md. Near the barbecue pits at
the annual picnic of the Ebenezer AME Church, a group of men sat
readying a message to Congress: Don't crucify the president, and
don't play God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he made his apology to the Lord, it is the Lord's to
judge,'' said John Foreman, a computer analyst with the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   For all the mercy in some places, there was revulsion elsewhere,
disgust over the detailed allegations of Clinton's sexual
encounters with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There also was anger over the lies that Clinton allegedly told
and charges that he encouraged aides to conceal his affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to impeach him,'' said Linda Millerick, a 55-year-old
retired postal worker, after a town hall meeting in Salinas,
Calif., with Representative Sam Farr, a third-term Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Millerick said she spent Friday writing to California's two
senators and a half-dozen House members, telling them it was
Clinton's lying, not the sex, that infuriated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person's sexual behavior is his own business, even if he's
the president, though the president should be held to a higher
standard,'' said Millerick, who voted for Bob Dole. ``Lying or
covering up is the point. He should be out of there. If he lied
about that, how can we trust him to run the country?''
</P>
<P>
   But little outrage was voiced in New York City as Representative
Charles E. Schumer campaigned for the Democratic Senate nomination.
Clinton is popular in New York, heavily populated by Democrats and
union members. And only one protester shouted any dissent Schumer's
way as he mingled in midtown Manhattan with thousands of workers
gathering for the city's annual Labor Day march down Fifth Avenue.
(New York labor unions celebrate the holiday one week later than
the rest of the nation.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Whaddaya gonna do about getting that pig out of office?''
asked Raymond Dowley, a masonry worker. Schumer, who may have been
out of earshot, did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,000 or so people who shook Schumer's hand, many had
something to ask or tell him about the mayor, the governor, the
transit system, Coors beer, or medical marijuana, but only four
mentioned Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two union marchers simply told him, ``Stick with Clinton.'' And
Margaret Warncke, a schoolteacher, said, ``I don't want this
president to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which will
conduct a preliminary impeachment inquiry of Clinton, replied to
all three with what he later said was his ``stock answer:'' ``I
don't think there should be any rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Others yearned for action, however. In Louisville,
Representative Anne M. Northup, a Republican finishing her first
term in the House, heard from some restless constituents as she
stood near a stand selling kielbasa and bratwurst at the church
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Clinton referred to Lewinsky as ``that
woman,'' many in Kentucky vented anger about ``that man'' _
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just disgusting, and I think the Republicans are backing
off too much,'' said Bettie Mattingly, a Republican and a retired
manager for a local utility company. ``I've never been so disgusted
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As she listened to such comments, Northup nodded
sympathetically. At times she seemed more of a therapist than a
member of Congress running for reelection; She barely had a chance
to say anything before voters said their piece and went off to
sample gyros and Ethiopian flat bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a national disgrace and anybody who put his wife
out there to lie for him _ it's shameful,'' said John Cowley, an
anesthesiologist who also did not vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here in east Louisville, in the heart of Kentucky's 3rd
Congressional District, such comments might not bode well for
Democrats. The district voted 53 percent for Clinton in the last
election. Northup, a conservative who opposes abortion, was the
only GOP freshman in Congress who won in a district where Clinton
carried the majority of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But for every two or three Clinton critics, someone else was
furious at Starr and his team. Jane Goodman, 67, who is retired
from a nursing program at the University of Louisiana, held
Northup's arm and said, ``Don't mess up my Social Security and
Medicare, please!'' Goodman, who voted for Clinton two times, said,
``I don't care about anybody's ... sex life as long as they don't
cheat with my tax money.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the talk Saturday in Salinas was almost exclusively
of issues closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Only a dozen or so people turned out for the town meeting, and
few of them stood to speak about the possibility of impeaching the
president. David Cayton, a 62-year-old agricultural engineer who
voted for Clinton's opponents both times, urged Farr to impeach,
saying that the United States had become ``the laughingstock of the
world. ... I'm asking you please, get him out of office, the sooner
the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Farr, however, said his experience at past, more crowded
meetings in recent months has shown that three of his constituents
support Clinton for every one who wants him impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the surprise of the Ken Starr report is: Is that
all?'' said Farr, noting that much of the content, if not all the
specifics, had been leaked before the report's release. ``Does this
tarnish the president so far that he has to resign? I don't think
it warrants impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sylvia Echeverri, a middle school principal, said if
Starr's accusations prove true, Clinton must go. Mostly, she added,
she is embarrassed for the president and hopes he will seek
treatment for sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no talk of laughingstocks in Clinton, which is
staying true to its namesake. The church picnickers also had a
message for Starr: Forget about impeachment, and learn the rules of
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have played with no rules, no time limit, no out of
bounds. It's time to stop,'' said Steve Young, a federal government
worker who votes as an Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the break of dawn, the men charged with organizing
everything from hundreds of cakes and pies to pounds of grilled
fish and meats had been debating Clinton's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans, like many of those gathered for the picnic,
have been among the president's most steadfast supporters. The
reason, they say, is rooted in the president's progressive dialogue
on race, as well as a deeply rooted sense that he is a spiritual
man, one of them, struggling to cope with human weakness,
victimized by external forces.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that African-Americans believe the president did no
wrong, said special education teacher Carrie Burks, echoing a point
frequently voiced at the picnic. The issue is fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consequences for breaking the law and sinning,''
Young said. ``But is impeachment the consequence of adultery? The
punishment just doesn't fit the crime.''

NORTHWEST'S PILOTS APPROVE PACT, ENDING 2-WEEK STRIKE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update and rewrite throughout)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striking pilots at Northwest Airlines approved a new four-year
contract with the carrier on Saturday, officially ending a bitter
two-week strike against the nation's fourth-largest carrier in an
action that has disrupted travel in much of the Midwest and the
South.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting all day at a hotel in Minneapolis, where Northwest
is based, the governing Master Executive Council of the Air Line
Pilots Association, which represents Northwest's 6,200 pilots,
ratified the tentative agreement that was reached on Thursday after
two days of marathon negotiations mediated by a top White House
aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're ready to return to work and are looking forward to
being back in the cockpit instead of on the picket lines,'' said
Steve Zoller, the council's chairman. He also thanked President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said that it planned to resume flying on Wednesday
with about a quarter of its schedule and would have all 1,700 of
its daily flights back in the air by the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very confident that we will be able to meet our
targets,'' said Donald J. Foley, a spokesman for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the agreement by the pilots ends the longest
strike against an airline since machinists walked out at Eastern
Airlines in 1989. The pilots and Northwest had been negotiating for
two years before the 6,200 pilots walked out on Aug. 29. The two
sides made virtually no progress toward a settlement until Bruce
Lindsey, one of Clinton's most trusted aides, joined the
negotiations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For many in Washington, it might have been surprising that
Lindsey would take a seat at the bargaining table in Minneapolis
when a growing political crisis was engulfing Clinton's Presidency.
But it seemed only fitting to officials at Northwest and the pilots
union because the White house had loomed large in the calculations
of both sides even before the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest had been lobbying hard for Clinton to order the union
back to work and appoint a special emergency board, as he did last
year minutes after the pilots walked out at American Airlines. The
Northwest pilots and their allies in Washington were pressing
equally hard for Clinton to stay out of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey used the power of the presidency to steer both sides to
a compromise. He asked Clinton to make a personal appeal to John H.
Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, and to J. Randolph Babbitt,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association. At the same time, he
made it clear to the pilots on Thursday that the president would
order them back to work if a deal was not reached by the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always important to bear in mind that this is an
industry that has a lot of government interaction,'' said Thomas S.
Schreier, an airline industry analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston in New York, who was vice president for finance at Northwest
from 1988 to 1996. ``Saying no to the president comes with some
very definable costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement, details of which were disclosed late
Friday, includes a 12 percent raise over four years, a lump sum of
$57 million to make up for lost wages, profit sharing and 2.5
million stock options for the pilots, and the phasing out of a
two-tier wage scale that paid pilots a lower salary in their first
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots had been seeking a 14 percent raise over three years
and a lump sum of $86 million. In its last offer before the strike,
Northwest offered a 9 percent increase over four years, a $57
million payment, less-generous profit sharing, no stock options and
a reduction of the two-tier wage scale to three years.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, hailed the settlement
as ``an incredible victory for the pilots union and for the
thousands of other Northwest workers who stood in solidarity with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rachleff, a labor historian at Macalester College in St.
Paul, said the strike, along with recent walkouts at United Parcel
Service, Bell Atlantic and General Motors, signaled that the labor
movement was entering a new period of aggressiveness after 20 years
on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are not so sure, pointing to the continuing
decline in union membership nationwide. They are even divided over
whether the Northwest strike will help the carrier's five other
unions, which are also trying to negotiate contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Schreier contends that the pain of the two-week strike, in which
Northwest laid off 30,000 employees, would dampen the enthusiasm
for another walkout. But Rachleff disagreed, saying: ``It was short
enough that nobody felt much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: Northwest is not likely to count on the
White House to order strikers back to work if the airline faces
another walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this strike went two weeks helps,'' an
administration official said, ``because at least the next airline
coming down the line won't expect to get a presidential emergency
board in 20 minutes the way that American did.''

ANALYSIS: PRESIDENT WALKS ALONE IN CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president, more than ever, is a man alone.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman felt alone when he decided to use the atomic bomb
in 1945. John Kennedy felt alone in dejection after the Bay of Pigs
fiasco in 1961. Lyndon Johnson felt alone as he reviewed bombing
targets and body counts late at night in the White House in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the loneliness of Bill Clinton is different, deeper, more
disconsolate. Abandoned by his onetime courtiers and sometime
supporters in Washington, alienated from congressional leaders in
his own party, appealing for forgiveness not only from his allies
but also from his wife and daughter, the president is alone in a
way no American president has been in this century.
</P>
<P>
   And so this most gregarious of presidents _ a man who, unlike
Richard Nixon, unlike Jimmy Carter, is no loner _ is walking alone
through the biggest political storm since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's handling this alone,'' said longtime friend Carolyn
Staley, a preacher's daughter who lived next door to the young Bill
Clinton in Hot Springs, Ark. ``This is a personal road. This is the
lonesome vale he has to walk, and he has to walk it by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's anguish, according to those who have spoken with
him, is deepened because of the public nature of his life.
``They're in the middle of a family crisis,'' David Leopoulos,
Clinton's closest friend from high school, said after talking with
the president for a half-hour, ``and they have to play it out in
front of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant asides in the Starr report is that in
which Clinton talks about the future and alludes to the possibility
of being ``alone'' in three years, when his term ends and when, he
suggests implicitly, his marriage might break up.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Clinton friends who have spoken with the president in
recent days, as the report of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
has been presented to Congress and then to the public, say the
president's loneliness isn't perilous to his mental health. But the
peculiar loneliness of Bill Clinton is immensely perilous to his
political health.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents need allies in good times, but they need them even
more in bad times. And in the past six years the political
alliances that Clinton made were so brittle and so ephemeral that
he now lacks a bedrock of support to fall back upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Clinton movement,'' said Robert Reich, the former
labor secretary who has been a friend of the president's since the
two were Rhodes scholars nearly three decades ago. ``He wasn't in
the lead in any significant parade. By not seeming to stand boldly,
he didn't have the kind of passionate support that he now needs.''
</P>
<P>
   All presidents encounter turbulence and all lose altitude. But
most presidents have a cushion of support to ease the fall, salve
the wounds, and help propel them back. As the Vietnam War and the
domestic rebellion deepened in the mid-1960s, Lyndon Johnson still
could draw on relationships made during a life in Congress,
permitting him to lean on important lawmakers such as Senator Henry
M. Jackson of Washington and Richard B. Russell of Georgia along
with House Speaker John W. McCormack of Massachusetts. Nixon, who
like Johnson had served in the House and Senate and had sealed
relationships during two vice presidential campaigns and three
presidential campaigns, also had a well of support in his months of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has none of that. A ferocious networker, Clinton picked
up acquaintances and not friends, and during his presidency many of
those who thought of themselves as his friends _ Lani Guinier and
Peter Edelman, whom the president abandoned after intending to
appoint them to important offices _ were stunned at Clinton's
callousness. Indeed, the Starr report released Friday suggests that
the man often regarded as Clinton's closest friend, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., himself was misled and dishonorably used by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nixon resigned the presidency in 1974, Dean Burch, one
of the grand men of Washington and the old GOP and a White House
aide at the end of the administration, said with his own sense of
resignation: ``He never told me the truth about the thing. He never
even told his own family.''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the president's current distress were sown in his
earlier success. He ran for president as an outsider, drawing his
appeal out of the very lack of close ties in the capital that now
makes him such a solitary figure. Then he ran for reelection with a
strategy developed by Dick Morris, the discredited consultant, that
emphasized his distance from the very congressional Democrats whose
help he now needs so desperately.
</P>
<P>
   For months this year the president resisted congressional
Democrats' entreaties for financial help for November's midterm
congressional elections, and though the White House reacted angrily
to suggestions that it was unwilling to help fellow Democrats,
lawmakers on the Hill seethed with resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Today the president can count on the support of few Capitol Hill
Democrats outside of retiring Senator Dale Bumpers, one of
Clinton's predecessors as governor of Arkansas. One of his most
prominent and visible supporters now easily tosses around the
phrase ``he lied to us,'' speaking derisively of the president, who
does not own a home, as a man with no place to go and no one to
take him in.
</P>
<P>
   The president, according to this lawmaker, cannot resign because
there is no place for the Marine helicopter to take him. ``What's
it going to do, hover for a couple of years?'' the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's unusual isolation is all the greater because,
after six years, he and the Democratic political establishment have
few shared experiences of battle. Many of his greatest successes _
the agreement to balance the budget, for example, or the plan to
overhaul welfare _ were issues emphasized by Republicans, not
Democrats, and the negotiations to win their approval were
conducted primarily with Republicans, not Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president, moreover, broke with party leaders and with the
leading Democratic constituency, organized labor, on the issue that
may have mattered most to them both: trade. He pushed through
approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement largely on the
basis of Republican support; 156 House Democrats voted against the
president's position. Then, against the advice of Democratic
leaders, Clinton tried to win fast-track authority to negotiate new
free-trade agreements. The effort failed and served to highlight
the distance between the president and his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of betrayal that many Democrats feel on political
matters extends to many of his personal friends on personal
matters. ``Some of his old friends are really mad at him and feel
lied to and used,'' said Staley, Clinton's onetime next-door
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are disappointed and shocked about things we never
wanted to believe,'' said Leopoulos. ``I don't know if he has any
real friends up there'' in Washington. ``He's been a friend of mine
_ a prince in some ways _ and he's a friend worth saving.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, in Washington, the president is alone.
</P>
<P>
   For years Clinton passed the hours on campaign planes and bus
trips by playing hearts. Now he is playing solitaire.

VERMONTERS SPLIT ON HOWC TO DEAL WITH CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERGENNES, Vt. _ Marie Ganson and Marion Strobridge ran the
white elephant sale Saturday outside the United Methodist Church,
using their octogenarians' know-how to fix values on toys with
missing pieces, an unwanted camera flash, and a giveaway ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   But neither could find much worth in a president left tottering
on the edge of history by the allegations of sex, lies, and
arrogance contained in the graphic report by the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be worth zero here,'' said Strobridge, 83, a halo of
silver curls framing a grandmotherly face. Offering a wish that
President Clinton would resign, she added, ``There's a lot of
things we didn't want to know, but now we know them, and he's the
wrong kind of person to be head of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Vergennes, a half-hour south of Burlington, is no pollster's
paradise. Though it proudly bills itself as ``The Smallest City in
the United States,'' at just one square mile, there is too little
racial diversity, too much poverty, and too much, well, Vermont, to
pretend it's a microcosm of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also something of a mecca for independent thinking, home to
the last 25 annual meetings of the Contrary Opinion Forum, a
national group of money managers and investors who shun pack
mentality as the province of sheep and the holders of passbook
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Vergennes remains as good a place as any to open a window
on the views of Americans confronted by a president whose supposed
sexual proclivities and alleged cover-up attempts are dominating
the national conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place of frank talk with the look of a 1950s picture
postcard. Its 2,735 residents largely missed the recent economic
boom. It is close enough to Lake Champlain to know tourists, but
not bow to them. It supported Clinton _ he won 549 votes here in
1996, to Bob Dole's 308 _ yet it is far enough from Washington
that, in Vergennes, a beltway is a line of loops around the top of
trousers, not the physical and psychological barrier that separates
the capital from the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the Park Restaurant Saturday morning on Main Street (the
locals call it ``Up Street'' because everything else is downhill),
George Merritt was holding court at the table by the window. Like
several others around the City Green, Merritt drew parallels to
Watergate and Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon at least had the character to resign,'' said Merritt,
who turns 73 today. A conservative who voted for Ross Perot in 1992
and Dole four years later, Merritt said Starr did nothing more than
the task he was assigned, and Clinton ``is a congenital liar who
wagged his finger at us and said there was no sexual relationship.
But now we know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats will take a real whack in the head. He
deluded them, but now the chickens will come home to roost,''
Merritt said.
</P>
<P>
   Others throughout the city offered hearty helpings of sympathy
and support for Clinton's wife and daughter, but not Merritt.
``Hillary is the real demonic force there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But over near the cash register came a different outlook from
William Howard Rose, 52, a hired farm hand who, despite voting for
Clinton twice, said he is chairman of the local Republican
Committee. ``Enough is enough. The country doesn't need this,''
said Rose, who opposes impeachment. ``How is it going to make this
country look in the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people hollering the loudest are the people who
did the same that he did,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote against impeachment came from Loren Smith, a Pepsi
truck driver from nearby Ferrisburg. ``It's nothing that John F.
Kennedy didn't do,'' said Smith, 56, who laughed when asked if he
had looked at the report on the Internet. ``I'm standing behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Harold Danyow, 69, a retired tractor repairman from
Monkton, spoke for straying spouses everywhere. ``Maybe he has a
little higher sex drive than he ought to, but, hey, we're all
guilty at some time or another of messing around a bit,'' Danyow
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that argument held no water down the street at the Saturday
morning farmers' market. To Florence Carnahan, 49, clutching a bag
of Lewis Lalumiere's home-grown tomatoes and zucchini, it is an
issue not of sex, but honesty. ``I don't think his apologies are
sincere,'' she said. ``I think he's sorry he got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Like more than a dozen others _ holding views across the
spectrum _ she urged a speedy resignation to save the country a
wrenching impeachment proceeding. She also spoke for others when
she took a shot at Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was no other way to get Clinton to admit what
he'd done, but he'' _ Starr _ ``always has a strange smile on his
face, like he's having too much fun doing this,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   John Diegel, 43, stood behind a table selling cookies, pies, and
breads from his Honeymoon Kitchens bakery and wished he could
believe the current crisis and fear of impeachment would change
Clinton. ``It's like with children. If the threat of a spanking is
sufficient, then you don't need to spank him,'' said Diegel.
</P>
<P>
   For Janet and Bruce Seaburg, a retired couple in their 60s,
salvation for the president could only begin with, in Janet's
words, an admission that, ``I'm sick and I need professional
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thiess, 81, a retired manager at a local factory that
makes airplane gauges, clutched a melon and spoke of the moral
compass that guided him from World War II onward. ``I just can't
believe he is ever going to change. This is about character. He's
lied so many times, you can't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Park Restaurant, Bill and Eleanor Lanning, both 47,
worried about the impact on the presidency. ``I don't think it was
an impeachable offense,'' said Bill Lanning, a technical writer.
``The question is what'll be left of respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Monica Lewinsky, Lanning offered a suggestion: ``She'll
be forever the butt of barroom jokes. I'd change my name and go
into the witness protection program.''

ROLE OF CLINTON'S SECRETARY UNDERGOES SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She is the very image of refinement and understated
elegance, the calm center of a constant whirlwind, a woman revered
by low-level White House aides and world leaders alike.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the report by the independent counsel, Kenneth
W. Starr, presidential secretary Betty Currie was also the
principal _ and unlikely _ facilitator and concealer in the
adulterous affair between President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky.
Currie was the trusted aide allegedly charged with the unseemly
duty of keeping the trysts a secret.
</P>
<P>
   By choice or by demand, Currie, 58, arranged many of the illicit
sexual encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky, stood watch outside
the door, hid proof of telephone calls between the two, and tried
to prevail on Secret Service agents to keep Lewinsky off their
entry logs, according to the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, Currie was summoned to work on weekends by Clinton
just to usher Lewinsky into the White House when she worked at the
Pentagon. And last December, she drove to Lewinsky's Watergate
apartment to retrieve gifts that Clinton had given to the young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   In the entirety of the Starr report, it is Currie's role as
Clinton's protector in the extramarital affair that has most
shocked her White House colleagues, some of whom will doubtless
blame Clinton for the compromising, undignified role in which he
put her.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, as much help as Currie may have been to Clinton
during the affair, she proved to be a devastating witness before
the federal grand jury, walking Starr's prosecutors point by point
through her involvement and supplying evidence that Clinton had
lied when he testified that he had no recollection of being alone
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And Currie is the personification of one of the most serious
charges in Starr's report: that Clinton tampered with a potential
witness _ Currie _ by trying to influence her version of events.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the relationship, Currie viewed Lewinsky as a ``pain
in the neck,'' according to her testimony in the report. She
suspected ``impropriety'' and ``had concerns'' about the regular
White House meetings between the president and the young charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spending a lot of time with a 24-year-old young lady,''
Currie said in her testimony. ``I know he has said that young
people keep him involved in what's happening in the world, so I
knew that was one reason, but there was a concern of mine that she
was spending more time than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Currie's first exposure to Lewinsky was in November 1995, when
the intern in the chief of staff's office delivered some pizza to
Clinton, was ushered into the Oval Office, and proceeded to have
oral sex with the president, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Currie found herself unwittingly in the midst of a
sexual relationship that now threatens the future of the Clinton
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At times, her role, according to the Starr report, seemed
demeaning. At one point, days after Currie's brother died, Clinton
was about to summon her to work on a Sunday once again just to
admit Lewinsky into the West Wing for sex, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said she replied to Clinton: ``Let Betty be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Currie helped keep the relationship secret,'' the Starr
report reads. ``When the President wanted to talk with Ms.
Lewinsky, Ms. Currie would dial the call herself rather than go
through White House operators, who keep logs of presidential calls
made through the switchboard. When Ms. Lewinsky phoned and Ms.
Currie put the President on the line, she did not log the call,
though the standard procedure was to note all calls, personal and
professional.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Currie led Lewinsky through a maze of hallways
in the West Wing to escort the young woman into the Oval Office
without being noticed by Clinton aides Nancy Hernreich and Stephen
Goodin, who were both suspicious of the relationship, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after a radio address on Feb. 28, 1997, Currie accompanied
Clinton and Lewinsky into the Oval Office, then waited in a private
pantry or kitchen as the couple repaired to the small study.
Afterward, Currie escorted Lewinsky out. It was in that encounter
that Clinton left a stain on Lewinsky's blue dress, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they had passed from the Oval Office toward the private
study, Ms. Currie said, `I'll be right back,' the report states.
She returned 15 or 20 minutes later to escort Lewinsky out because,
she said, ``I didn't want any perceptions, him being alone with
someone,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that appears most unlikely for Currie, a regular
church-goer who is regarded as a quiet but effective presence in
the West Wing, a maternal figure quick to comfort young staff
members while at the same time controlling access to the Oval
Office with a firm hand. Currie was the secretary for Clinton's
famed war room during the 1992 campaign, and signed on for Oval
Office duty at the start of the administration for $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Lewinsky began calling Currie constantly, crying
about her flagging efforts to land a new job in the White House
and, eventually, the private sector. Once, Lewinsky berated Currie
over the phone when, after being refused admittance to the White
House, she learned that Clinton was alone in the Oval Office with
Eleanor Mondale, the daughter of the former vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 18 of this year, a Sunday, Clinton summoned Currie to
the West Wing on the day after his testimony in the Jones case,
where he was first asked about Lewinsky. He appeared ``concerned,''
Currie said, and presented Currie with a series of seemingly
leading statements, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, the report said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always there when she was there, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never really alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see and hear everything, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Currie testified that, based on his demeanor and the way
he made the statements, the President wanted her to agree with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Currie paged Lewinsky four times, according to the
report, but received no response. She called or paged Lewinsky for
the president eight times the following morning, in a seemingly
frantic attempt to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, the day The Washington Post first published a story
highlighting Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky, Clinton summoned
Currie into the Oval Office again to review the details of her
knowledge, providing her with the same statements, according to the
report.

MASS. CONGRESSMAN GETS EARFUL FROM CONSTITUENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ Marie Sweeney took the hand of her congressman,
Martin T. Meehan, and pulled him close. ``I wouldn't want to be in
your position,'' she whispered.
</P>
<P>
   With a nod, Meehan accepted the sympathy of his former high
school English teacher. Like US Representatives Barney Frank of
Newton and William D. Delahunt of Quincy, Meehan serves on the
House Judiciary Committee, the next stop for the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal. Meehan and his colleagues are charged with weighing the
evidence and determining whether to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, of Lowell, was greeted here at the annual Democratic
Dahlia Ball at the Andover Marriott this weekend by a squad of
television crews, desperate to record his somber pronouncements on
the Lewinsky saga. Frank is campaigning for other Democrats in New
York and Vermont this weekend, but called into a New Bedford radio
station to discuss the news. Delahunt is spending the weekend
quietly at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read the report yet,'' Meehan said, calling
Clinton's behavior ``indefensible, inexcusable, and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the former prosecutor that he is, Meehan stuck to an
impartial tone. ``This is an inquiry to determine what the facts
are,'' he said, refusing to prejudge whether Clinton should resign,
face impeachment, or go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   In New Bedford Saturday, Frank called WSAR-AM. Compared to
Meehan, Frank is more opinionated, less cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Starr has not enough to get the president, so he's seeking
to discredit him,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Frank is exasperated with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lies by being technically accurate. I wish he would stop
it,'' he said emphatically. ``I wish he would have learned that `I
didn't inhale,' `No, I didn't do it by standing on one leg on
Thursday,' is just not worthy of him and everybody sees through it.
He's not 14 anymore trying to outsmart the principal.''
</P>
<P>
   However this is resolved, Frank said that Clinton will never
fully recover. ``He will be the president probably, but not
certainly,'' Frank said. ``But he will be a president who was
diminished some in his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in the Marriott ballroom, with bouquets of red,
white, and blue helium balloons decorating the tables, Meehan began
taking the temperature of the activist Democrats of the Merrimack
Valley. His job was made easier, though, by the fact that everyone
was already talking about Clinton's troubles before he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think of what's going on?'' Meehan asked Francis
X. ``Red'' McGovern, the uncle of Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Patricia McGovern and a longtime political activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' McGovern said, shaking his head. ``Such an
intelligent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, a Democratic candidate for governor, huddled
with Meehan, reporting that he told the mob of television crews
that Meehan would be fair. ``Good luck to you,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   As Meehan made his way through the room, his friends, neighbors,
and fellow Democrats asked him how he is doing. With a slight shrug
and a half smile, Meehan let them know that this is not a good
time. ``OK,'' he told one. ``Surviving,'' he told another. ``Tough
times,'' he said to a third.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rivera, who works for Lawrence Mayor Patricia Dowling, is
pessimistic about the coming days and weeks. ``It's going to be sad
to see how it turns out,'' he told Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy, and I don't think the process will
be good,'' Meehan replied. ``Not many hearings in Washington over
the years have been fair or competent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rivera had some advice for Meehan. ``You have to
ask the right questions so the Democrats don't seem soft,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who is also the chairman of the Greater Lowell Area
Democrats, told Meehan that she heard Clinton's plea for
forgiveness while getting her hair done that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came on and everyone got tears in their eyes,'' she said.
Sweeney said she knows that Meehan will do the right thing in his
role on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right thing is not impeachment,'' she said firmly. ``Get
the information out, accept the president's contrition, and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator James P. Jajuga had a different view of the
``right thing'' than Sweeney as he talked to Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel saddened and hopeful the president will see how it's
being perceived and hopefully do the right thing,'' Jajuga said.
The right thing? ``Resignation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Frishman did not wait for Meehan to inquire about his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening, it's incredible, it's
ridiculous,'' Frishman sputtered as he rushed up to Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream that every member'' of Congress ``had to stand
up and say whether they had sexual relations with someone other
than their spouse,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan soaked up the opinions, but remained resolute to consider
the evidence without partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to use every skill that I have as a lawyer, as a
prosecutor, to determine the facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Meehan is reacting to the sordid details the way much
of America is reacting: ``I imagine my nieces and nephews heading
into the Internet and reading this report.''

MANY OBJECT TO PRINTING OF STARR REPORT TEXT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than 200 phone calls from Boston Globe readers
yesterday reflected the split in Congress and in homes across the
nation, where the merits of public access to intimate details of
President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky are being
debated.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 215 callers complained that the Globe chose to
publish the entire report of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr,
and 30 said they planned to cancel their subscriptions because they
felt the content was too salacious for a daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Many others asked where they could buy a Globe containing the
report because their newsstand had sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe published its biggest Saturday paper, adding about
35,000 copies to its usual press run for a total of 515,000 papers.
Company spokesman Rick Gulla said yesterday that it was too early
to determine whether any papers would be left at vendor sites.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Matthew V. Storin said the decision to print Starr's
report was an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful, we never considered not printing it,'' Storin
said. ``We felt that such a historic document, regardless of the
explicit detail, would have to be published by any newspaper with
the resources to handle it because it details a government
prosecutor's allegations against the president of the United
States. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, The New York Times, the Providence
Journal-Bulletin, the Middlesex News, and the Worcester Telegram &AMP;
Gazette were among the papers that also published the document.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Times said yesterday that the paper had
received only a dozen calls regarding its publication of the
report, and 10 of the calls were from readers who were disappointed
in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's Web site, Boston.com, received about 1.3 million
page views.

THE BIG SURPRISE: ABSENCE OF SURPRISES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was all in there: The dress, the gifts, the
Valentine's Day poem, the messages left on the answering machine,
the terse discussion between Betty Currie and the president, and
Currie's mysterious retrieval of items from Monica S. Lewinsky's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise to many observers was that Kenneth Starr's report
contained so few surprises: Nearly every meaningful element in this
top-secret investigation had been leaked and disseminated in the
press long before the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson found preliminary
evidence in June that Starr's office had violated Justice
Department rules against leaking grand jury materials. Now the
release of Starr's report has led those familiar with federal
procedures to conclude that the office succeeded in keeping almost
no legally significant detail under wraps, save, perhaps, some of
the tawdrier details from Lewinsky's testimony and the FBI report
that President Clinton's DNA sample matched the one on Lewinsky's
dress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, some observers have noted that the White House
itself, in an effort to soften the blow of Starr's report, may have
leaked details on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the apparent confirmation of leaks in Starr's report
could assist the president in the impeachment battle to come, as
Clinton's attorney seeks to portray Starr as a political partisan
bent on destroying the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine a rational justification for anyone supportive
of the president to leak an entire universe of prejudicial
materials,'' said Martin Weinberg, a board member of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys. ``There's at least a ...
violation of grand jury secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorney, David E. Kendall, complained on Friday that
the report contained ``nothing of substance that had not already
been illegally leaked before the president and Congress had a
chance to review it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has acknowledged briefing some reporters on procedural
details of his investigation, but strongly denied that he or anyone
on his staff leaked confidential materials. He has said that all
the media reports could have come from sources outside his office,
primarily witnesses and their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office was unavailable for comment Saturday, its phone
message file full.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, dozens of Starr's prosecutors filed
affidavits denying that they leaked grand-jury material. But
Johnson, in her June ruling, suggested that Starr's team had
interpreted the rules against leaking ``too narrowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when Boston defense attorney Martin Murphy, a veteran of
numerous federal investigations, read Starr's report on Friday, he
declared that ``it was absolutely clear to me that there's been
leaking out of Starr's office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it sounded as if it was fairly familiar to me,''
Murphy said. ``I think I was about the only person who hadn't heard
the cigar story.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was referring to a lurid detail first revealed on the
Drudge Report, an Internet site that supplied details of Starr's
investigation about a week before the report's release. At that
time, Starr's office was under court order to provide information
to Congress only. And Congress had not yet received any
information.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, legal specialists said, the leak could have come only
from Starr's office, Lewinsky, or Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaks are a fact of life. ... The difference here is the key
information should be restricted to a very few people,'' said
Murphy, who said the sheer volume of leaks calls into question
Starr's assertion that his office was blameless.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce E. Yannett, former assistant to Iran-Contra independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, pointed to news stories on Wednesday and
Thursday reporting some of the conclusions in Starr's report. No
one else _ not Clinton, Lewinsky, or Congress _ could have leaked
that information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was leaked like crazy in the last 72 hours,'' said
Yannett. ``And no one had seen it other than the Starr people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if Johnson determined Starr's office leaked
information, it probably would help Clinton only in the court of
public opinion. Last month, an appeals court denied the president's
request to have his lawyers question Starr's team under oath. The
court reasoned that such a hearing would only spread around more
confidential material.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much been established that if the source of leaks
can be proven, they end up in contempt,'' said Weinberg. ``But
there is no meaningful remedy for the victim or target.''

   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Michigan's giant ``Go Big Blue'' banner was

   Syracuse (1-1) proved that by slapping the Wolverines silly,
dealing them a 38-28 loss before a record crowd at the newly
renovated Michigan Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 111,012 fans in attendance were the most ever assembled to
see a National Collegiate Athletic Association football game. They
were also the quietest 111,012 fans ever assembled at a college
football game.
</P>
<P>
   As thoroughly humiliating as this loss was for the co-national
champion Wolverines (0-2), it was just as reaffirming for Syracuse,
which has opened its season with two of the nation's most powerful
college football teams. Last week, Syracuse lost by a point (34-33)
to Tennessee on a last-second field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Orangemen smashed Michigan on the strength of
quarterback Donovan McNabb's three passing touchdowns and a 17-yard
rushing touchdown, and with a defense that smothered the Wolverine
offense much of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan became the first defending national champion team to
lose its first two games since Penn State started 0-3 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams get a breather next week as Syracuse plays Rutgers
and Michigan plays Eastern Michigan. The Wolverines will need it.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse showed no effects from its loss to Tennessee, but the
Wolverines played like their heads were still buzzing from being
head-slapped by Notre Dame in their opener. Michigan was confused
by Syracuse's array of offensive sets _ three wide receivers,
full-house backfield, the option _ and fell behind, 24-0.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse built a 38-7 lead in the third quarter before Michigan
scored three times in the last seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan offense was just as bad. It did not score until 46
seconds remained in the first half when quarterback Tom Brady hit
Tai Streets on a 4-yard pass.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson said Michigan's defense
couldn't stop the option. That was all Syracuse Coach Paul
Pasqualoni needed to hear, and he turned loose McNabb (21 of 27,
233 yards passing; 18 rushes for 62 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was right. The Wolverines cannot stop the option. On
this Saturday about the only thing that did stop Syracuse was
McNabb's inability to hold onto to the center snap. He fumbled the
snap three times, losing one.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse opened the game with a brilliant drive, going 78 yards
on 11 plays in 4 minutes 56 seconds to score a on a 6-yard run by
receiver Kevin Johnson. Johnson had lined up in a full-house
backfield and scored on an option pitch from McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   Brady had a pass intercepted by Syracuse cornerback David Byrd
at the Michigan 31, which helped set up the Orangemen's second
touchdown _ a 26-yard pass from McNabb to fullback Rob Konrad, who
had sneaked out of the Syracuse backfield and was standing all
alone on the left sideline waiting for the ball. That score helped
make it 14-0 and drained all the air out of crowd.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb did not throw his first incomplete pass until late in the
first quarter. It came on a third-and-6 at the Michigan 16 and
after he had gone 8 of 8 for 100 yards and a touchdown. It led to
Nate Trout's 33-yard field goal that made it 17-0 with 5:19 to play
in the quarter. Trout missed on a 35-yard attempt on the
Orangemen's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan got its first break early in the second quarter when
McNabb fumbled the snap at the Syracuse 23 and it was recovered by
the Wolverines linebacker Anthony Jordan. Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr
decided to replace Brady at quarterback with the freshman Drew
Henson to try to spark the offense. It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The offense still fizzled. On fourth-and-4 at the 16, Carr sent
out the field-goal unit and it looked as if Michigan was going to
try to put some points on the board. Instead, the Wolverine tried a
fake field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, the holder, threw to kicker Jay Feely. But Feely was
tackled by the Syracuse free safety Phil Nash after only a 2-yard
gain. The ball went over to Syracuse on downs.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen went up by 24-0 with 5:36 to play in the half on
one of the most breathtaking plays of the game: a mad scramble for
a 17-yard touchdown run by McNabb, in which he ran right, then up
the middle, then left, avoided several would-be tacklers and lost a
shoe on a near tackle 10 yards from the end zone before scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's touchdown near the end of half brought a huge cheer
from the crowd. It was the first time Saturday afternoon that the
crowd could joyously look at the replays on the big new television
screens at each end of the stadium. &QL;

IS MORALIZING ABOUT SEX AS BAD AS THE SEX ITSELF?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Bill Clinton put the focus on education in his
presidency, he probably did not think it would be sex education.
</P>
<P>
   With the release Friday of the Starr report and its graphic
detailing of lust in the White House, however, Americans have been
assigned a class few would willingly have attended _ and forced to
learn about practices of the most sordidly unpresidential sort.
</P>
<P>
   Has our capacity for shock finally caught up with our appetite
for titillation? Can an America transfixed by every new story of
John F. Kennedy's dalliances, a country that watched a Supreme
Court nominee get interrogated about pornographic movies, a nation
that smirked at broadcaster Marv Albert for his cross-dressing _
can this America be psychologically undone by what our president
has purportedly done?
</P>
<P>
   Or, to turn the question on its side and in a more personal
direction: Are we guilty of hypocrisy when it comes to moralizing
about Bill Clinton's behavior? Is what he did so awful _ never mind
imprudent or ruinous to his marriage _ that it falls outside the
bounds of what most of us talk about when we talk about sex?
</P>
<P>
   Many professionals who think and talk about sex for a living
feel that a line has indeed been crossed, even if it is too soon to
tell which walls will go up and which ones crash down as the report
gets discussed, or avoided, around the national dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this incident testing Americans on their limits and
values,'' said Judy Seifert, also known as ``Dr. Judy,'' a radio
talk-show host and president of the American Association of Sex
Educators, Counselors and Therapists. ``There's something in there
to upset everyone, from feminists to fundamentalists. Are we
capable of forgiving Clinton? Maybe. But it will be the sexually
liberated baby boomers who do it, not the born-agains or the AARP
crowd. Right now this is pushing everyone's buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly this is a benchmark in the sexual revolution, coming
as it does near the end of the century,'' said Howard Ruppel,
executive director of Seifert's organization and a practicing sex
therapist for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality is surrounded by paradox,'' Ruppel said. ``We say
one thing and we do other things. Masturbation and oral sex are
part of the palette of sexual behavior. You can find books about
fetishism in Barnes and Noble. Even bondage and discipline is now
seen as a form of safe sex, not necessarily deviant or abnormal
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of sexual frankness and experimentation,
said Ruppel, ``What this event may do for some Americans is suggest
that their president can be sexual. What John Kennedy and Marilyn
Monroe did seems like a movie to most of us. Many Americans still
think of their chief of state as asexual, despite the explosion of
media atention. I expect the majority will look at his behavior in
light of their own standards before making a judgment. But yes,
they will talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Friedman of South Burlington, Vt., sees the baring of
Clinton's libido in hopeful terms, as what he calls ``another
teachable moment for parents to talk to kids, and partners to
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who lectures college audiences on sex, love, and
dating, said, ``It may not be the way we wanted it to happen, but
there it is. This will be an interesting test for America. The
reality in most people's lives is, they experiment. And they're
forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiving, or maybe just uninterested. On more than 50 campus
visits since the Lewinsky story broke in January, Friedman said,
few students have broached questions about Clinton's sex life. He
suspects that is about to change, however. If nothing else,
Friedman notes, what constitutes ``sexual relations'' _ the
legalism which Clinton relied on to deny his affair with Lewinsky _
will be open to widespread debate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, and no doubt to his added embarrassment, Clinton
now stands in the public's mind alongside other celebrities whose
private lives have sparked public discourse about nonintercourse or
nonconsensual sex. The Clarence Thomas hearings flushed the issue
of sexual harassment into the open. In Pee Wee Herman's case, the
focus was on masturbation. Hugh Grant's arrest with a prostitute
again put oral sex on the media map. Eddie Murphy was linked with a
male transvestite. Where this episode of presidential philandering
fits in remains an unsolved riddle full of potentially
uncomfortable questions about kinky sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't know what to think,'' said Debra
Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and Education
Council in New York. ``It's one thing to know about the affair and
another to be confronted about the details. America is more
comfortable with vanilla sex. I think they'll be shocked at a
degree of detail nobody needs to know, frankly. Even the blandest
sexual acts can, if described in progressive detail, be made to
sound mildly pornographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffner's 13-year-old daughter once met the president yet now
voices her disgust with Clinton, Haffner said.
</P>
<P>
   To Haffer, the key message is that Clinton has not acted like a
sexually healthy adult. Sex is wonderful, she points out, but not
when it risks the loss of job or family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex therapists will tell you that healthy behavior meets five
criteria. It's consensual, it's nonexploitive, it's honest, it's
mutually pleasurable, and it's protected,'' Haffner said. ``From
what I know, Clinton and Lewinsky's relationship fails on four of
these.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it is worth, the affair has passed an altogether
different sort of test. Screw magazine publisher Al Goldstein plans
to publish an ``illustrated'' version of the Starr report next
week, complete with doctored photos of the president and intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 30 years in the business and 19 arrests, the mainstream
media are running stories that I got busted for,'' Goldstein said.
``This country loves being grossed out and titillated at the same
time. It's the American way. I absolutely love it.''

THE OLD GENERATION RETURNS TO POWER IN MOSCOW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin yesterday reassured an old
friend with domestic problems of his own that Russia had no plans
to abandon pro-market policies and its partnership with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, emerging from a week that left his image as Russia's
leader as battered as the ruble, told President Clinton in a
30-minute telephone conversation that Russia's new government
recognized ``the lack of any alternative to market-oriented
policies,'' the Kremlin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the call after Yeltsin, badly weakened by a
devastating economic crisis, was forced by the Communist-dominated
parliament to accept a government led by aging former Soviet party
apparatchiks like himself.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Yeltsin, 67, has made his career since
the 1991 Soviet collapse by proclaiming the need for market reforms
in Russia. That cannot be said for either Yevgeny Primakov, 68, the
new prime minister, Viktor Gerashchenko, 60, the new head of
Russia's Central Bank, and Yury Maslyukov, 60, who will oversee
economic policy in the new government.
</P>
<P>
   And Primakov himself, in a statement aimed at restoring market
confidence and easing the fears of Western creditors, said the new
government would not default on its foreign debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian and Western economists have expressed fear that the
Primakov government may resort to printing money as a way out of a
crisis that has left banks unable to service depositors, prices on
the rise, and store shelves half-depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Gaidar, who kicked off Russia's move away from a
centralized economy as the head of Yeltsin's government in 1992,
said the Primakov government probably would follow the Communists'
plan of massive subsidies to industry and nationalization of
privatized companies. Such a plan, Gaidar said, would lead to ``the
worst consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Russians, and most members of parliament and regional
governments, think this is the way to fix the mess the country
finds itself in after six years of Yeltsin-led reforms.
</P>
<P>
   All of Yeltsin's previous governments have vowed to fix Russia's
economy by cutting spending, increasing tax collection, closing
down or converting inefficient Soviet-era factories, and cracking
down on corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But despite billions of dollars in Western aid, none of these
goals has been achieved. Some $15 billion a year has fled Russia,
the profits of predatory capitalists and bribe-taking officials,
while production has declined to a fraction of pre-reform levels
and millions of Russian workers are owed an estimated $12 billion
in overdue wages.
</P>
<P>
   Most commentators agreed that by buckling under pressure from
lawmakers to appoint Primakov and Gerashchenko, and then letting
Communist legislators appoint Maslyukov to the job of economic
chief, the Russian president had finally given up his unofficial
title of sponsor of the country's economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the seven years that have passed since
Yeltsin climbed atop a tank and stared down the Soviet Old Guard's
last desperate effort to retain power, Russia has a government that
was not hand-picked by the president and his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In a lesser shakeup yesterday, Yeltsin fired his spokesman,
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who had sought to bring openness to the
Kremlin but often ended up explaining away the president's own
personal troubles, mysterious illnesses, and odd public behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of an Era,'' commented the respected business daily,
Kommersant. The paper said Russia was no longer a strictly
presidential republic, but a land where parliament would have a
larger say.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of Russia's post-Soviet transformation, that
would have seemed a bad thing, as the country's legislatures have
consistently been dominated by people who are suspicious, at best,
of the tight-spending policies Western lenders have prescribed for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the immense power Yeltsin enjoyed is seen as the primary
reason for Russia's worst crises of recent years: the 1993
bombardment of parliament, the war in Chechnya, and the current
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some commentators, such as Moscow political analyst Igor
Bunin, found a bitter irony in a new government of the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seven years of reform, when a young generation was in
power, now we have the return of the gerontocracy,'' Bunin said.

EUROPEANS VIEW EVENTS THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Describing himself as an Englishman and a gentleman,
Richard Dallat had a simple question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't he just resign?''
</P>
<P>
   But Pierre Cresson, a Parisian visiting London, had a different
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What,'' he asked, ``is the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   In between sips of ale at a White City pub, those two questions
capture the differing views of Europeans in particular, and the
outside world in general, in the wake of the release of the Starr
report.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed through different cultural lenses, President Clinton's
behavior in what the tabloids here call the ``Oral Office'' is
either a disgrace to the presidency or a disgrace that it took
Kenneth W. Starr so many years and so much money to find out that
Clinton had what many Europeans assume all powerful men have: a
mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke with
President Clinton on Friday, and has voiced his unequivocal
support, the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal has replaced Rupert
Murdoch's quest to buy the Manchester United soccer team as the
only story in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian, one of Britain's four broadsheet national
newspapers, ran a 12-page supplement on Starr's report and the
fallout.
</P>
<P>
   For the British tabloids, which never met a scandal they didn't
like, Clinton's difficulties are manna. The World Cup is over. The
Spice Girls are splitting up and having babies. And Labor Party
politicians are positively boring compared with their more randy
Conservative predecessors. Bill and Monica headlines sell papers.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, however, it was the British broadsheets _ the
Guardian, the Times, the Daily Telegraph, and the Independent _
that printed the more explicit excerpts of Starr's report,
ostensibly in the name of thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   But, true to form, the British tabloids have been gleeful in
their coverage. Displaying typical license, The Express printed a
story about Mrs. Clinton with the headline, ``I'm with you all the
way ... you vile creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's tabloid, The Sun, declared that Clinton was ``unfit to
be president,'' an ironic admonition coming from a newspaper that
made its name and its money by sprinkling pictures of naked women
through its pages.
</P>
<P>
   While Britons like Dallat suggest Clinton do the honorable thing
and resign _ politicians here have done just that when confronted
with newspaper stories about extramarital affairs _ there seem to
be just as many who share the benign view of the French. They,
after all, elected a president, Francois Mitterrand, despite
knowing he had a mistress and a child out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatches from Moscow and Toyko suggested people there were
more concerned about the impact of the instability created by the
scandal on the financial crises in Russia and Japan, rather than
engaging in moralizing or theorizing on whether Clinton's behavior
rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors that the framers
of the Constitution had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a country that is one of America's closest and most
important allies, there seems to be a split. Those who are
conservative and believe Britain was at its best when Margaret
Thatcher occupied 10 Downing St. and Ronald Reagan was, in their
view, her able servant, deride Clinton as a hillbilly.
</P>
<P>
   More liberal Britons consider Clinton a cad, but think the
obsession with his sex life and the absolutist morality of those
out to get him a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Hoggart, a columnist for the liberal Guardian, which among
the serious British newspapers has been the most critical of Starr
and the most forgiving of Clinton, said he was sickened by the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that the president behaved badly in many
different ways,'' said Hoggart. ``But to see him being pursued to
the end by this shower of self-righteous charlatans is one of the
most stomach-churning experiences the 1990s have had to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresson, the Frenchman, had some solace for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get rid of him,'' he said, ``tell him to come to
France.''

 &HT;    Next: Vaccine for humans?
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Now that immunocontraception has succeeded in more
than 90 species of animals, humans could be next to reap the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has funded an estimated $24
million in research since 1990 to develop contraceptive vaccines
that are effective for human use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunocontraception is very new and in theory very effective.
We are always looking for new methods that would be useful and
safe,'' said Dr. Diana Blithe of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, a branch of NIH.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be safe, effective and reversible. That is a big
order,'' said pathologist Dr. Kenneth Tung of the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   With 10 years and more than $1 million of NIH funding, Tung is
developing a contraceptive vaccine that may work in humans like the
zona pellucidavaccine works in elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like blindfolding the egg,'' said Tung, who has had some
bumps along the way. He stressed that in the past, vaccines _ like
those that target measles, for example _ were meant to be
permanent. Now the challenge is to find one that wears off, so
after a few years of prevention, couples can decide to have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Primakoff of the University of California at Davis is
working on a vaccine to control fertility by inactivating sperm in
the bodies of both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems associated with immunocontraception.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the vaccine needs to be synthetic because the zona
pellucida vaccines are made from pig ovaries and there aren't
enough pig
</P>
<P>
   ovaries to supply the human population with a contraceptive.
Secondly, scientists fear that repeated use of the vaccine may lead
to permanent infertility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to immunocontraception, the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development is investigating hormones and
other new contraceptive methods.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Catterall at the Center for Biomedical Research in New
York is working on a different approach for male contraception. By
suppressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a hormone in the brain
that controls much of our sexual activity, his vaccine can limit
the amount of sperm produced by the male. Tested in rats, the
vaccine so far appears reversible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are also interested in microbicides that kill and
prevent transmission of sexually transmitted diseases during
intercourse, and an alternative material for latex condoms, to
which some people are allergic.

 LEDE-COX &HT;    CNN's Holliman dies in car crash in suburban Atlanta
 &HT;    (EDS: Dateline added)
 &HT;    By Doug Payne
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Holliman Jr., one of CNN's ``Boys of Baghdad'' who reported
the dramatic opening blows of the Gulf War from a hotel room in the
Iraqi capital, died Saturday in a car crash in Gwinnett County,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman, 49, tried to pass a car on a curve and collided
head-on with a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't wearing a seatbelt, but it might not have made a
difference in this accident,'' Gwinnett County police Sgt. Jeff
Sligar said. Richard Henry Wesner, 39, of Snellville and his
10-year-old son Eric were both wearing seatbelts in their Ford
pickup. Wesner was treated for minor injuries at Eastside Medical
Center and released. His son was admitted to the hospital for
treatment of broken bones, Sligar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Holliman was one of a kind _ a CNN original,'' said Tom
Johnson, chairman of CNN News Group. ``He passionately loved his
family, his friends and his job. . . . John was also a terrific
journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 8:15 a.m. where Mink Livsey Road
dead-ends into Centerville Rosebud Road _ a no-passing zone, Sligar
said. There were no skid marks at the scene, indicating the two
drivers did not see each other until just before the impact between
Holliman's Saturn and Wesner's pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman lived in Snellville with his wife, Diane, and their
son, John. His wife, who came to the accident scene, told
investigators that Holliman had gone out for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman was a national reporter for the network. He joined CNN
in 1980 as the first corrrespondent hired for the Washington
bureau. In the summer of 1989 he covered the student demonstrations
in China and the bloody government crackdown that followed. That
fall, he was the network's lead reporter on Hurricane Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   Holliman, Peter Arnett and Bernard Shaw were the only
journalists reporting from Baghdad on July 16, 1991, the evening
the allies launched the air attack against Iraq. The network won
numerous awards for their work, including a National Headliner
Award, a Peabody award and a Golden Microphone.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Holliman was CNN's lead reporter for the Pathfinder
mission to Mars, and was scheduled to co-anchor, with Walter
Cronkite, the network's coverage of Sen. John Glenn's return to
space this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was so enthusiastic about'' that assignment, Johnson
said. ``I expect he'll be up there watching the mission from the

   Holliman grew up in Thomaston and held a bachelor's degree from
the University of Georgia.

<P>
   Pete Sampras' body thwarted him Saturday, as did the man fast
becoming the rival most people have wished for Sampras to have.
Hampered by an injury to his left upper leg, an immobile Sampras
succumbed to Patrick Rafter in a five-set match that had a greater
sense of inevitability to it than a grand sense of climax.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his quarterfinal of two years ago here, when he overcame
violent stomach spasms to outlast Alex Corretja, Sampras was
fighting a brave but losing battle this time. The injury ultimately
kept him from competing on balls to his left, and his opponent, the
U.S. Open's defending champion, was much too good to let an
opportunity like this slip by.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look really healthy at all,'' Rafter said. ``I
thought he might have been sick, but he was still hitting big
serves.''
</P>
<P>
   The serve was Sampras' only chance, but it wasn't enough to
prevent his first loss in six Open semifinal matches. In the final,
Rafter will face the hard-serving Mark Philippoussis, who ousted
Spain's Carlos Moya, 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. Thus, two Australians will
play in a U.S. Open final for the first time since Ken Rosewell
defeated Tony Roche in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   And it was an Australian who managed to safeguard Roy Emerson's
record of 12 Grand Slam titles from Sampras, at least until the
Australian Open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of Sampras' troubles came after he held serve in
the first game of the third set, the match even at a set apiece,
when he left the court for what was at first presumed to be a
bathroom timeout. But as the set continued, it became apparent that
Sampras was laboring, even as he was breaking Rafter in the fourth
game on a backhand return down the line off a first serve.
</P>
<P>
   His movement was more and more mechanical, and any sudden turn
left seemed to bring a grimace. After Sampras held serve for a 5-2
lead, he went off again, and this time didn't reappear until the
three-minute waiting period was counted off rather deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   While Rafter was sitting calmly in his chair, Sampras was
receiving frantic treatment from Doug Spreen, the ATP trainer.
Massage. Heat. A wrap. An Advil. It all helped him come back out
and break Rafter at 15, Sampras going for the bombs, the short
points, as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bothering him when he lands on that left leg and when he
pushes off,'' Spreen said.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the match went on, the worse it looked. Sampras lost
his serve in the first game of the fourth set, with Rafter sensing
that just getting the ball in play, keeping it low, was too much
for his ailing opponent to deal with. Rafter concentrated on
getting his first serves in, getting to the net, keeping his volley
angled, forcing Sampras to move, especially left.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras served well enough after the first break, he
didn't win a point against Rafter's serve until Rafter was serving
for the set. By that time, Rafter knew all he had to do was keep
his concentration to insure his second straight Open final.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth set, Rafter again reached break point, at 30-40,
with a backhand pass. Sampras then served out wide, and Rafter
sliced his backhand cross court. Not only was he slow covering the
net, Sampras did not even bother to step or bend in the direction
of a ball he desperately needed to return.
</P>
<P>
   So the Open final will go on on Sunday without its four-time
champion, with the two Australians whose relationship has thawed in
recent months after the two had feuded over Philippoussis'
reluctance to play early-round Davis Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been speaking, but, obviously, it wasn't as warm
as it was in the past,'' said Philippoussis, who is trying to
become the second unseeded player (after Andre Agassi in 1994) to
win the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it appeared that Philippoussis' new-found maturity was
about to dissipate along with a slew of break-point opportunities,
the 21-year-old Australian regained the ability to punctuate his
big game with an exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   One of three players to have recorded a serve over 140 miles an
hour, Philippoussis hit 21 aces Saturday, the first of which
whistled past Moya at 132 mph. But the more telling number was the
67 percent first-serve percentage that the 6-foot-4-inch, 200-pound
Philippoussis got in, winning 63 of those 74 points. He tore
through the first two sets in 51 minutes and later admitted he felt
like ``no one can beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His serve was too good today,'' said Moya, who was the first
Spaniard to reach the Open semifinals since the tournament switched
surfaces from synthetic clay to hard court in 1978. ``The lowest
serve is 100 miles, even the second serve.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third set, knowing he had to change tactics, Moya
demonstrated that he is more than the standard stay-on-the-baseline
Spaniard. He began to attack the net, with success. In the 10th
game, after Moya served his way into a 0-40 hole, he managed to
save four break points. Philippoussis was clearly upset with
himself, and, at 30-all on his serve, he double-faulted, going for
a second serve that was clocked at 117 mph. Then, on set point
against him, he went for another big second serve and
double-faulted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 21 years of age,'' he said later, somewhat
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   When Moya escaped from another triple break point hole in the
fifth game of the fourth set, the prospect of a fifth set under the
hot sun in Arthur Ashe Stadium suddenly loomed. Moya believed he
had found the vulnerability in Philippoussis' game; all he needed
was a way to take him to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put pressure on him, he's not playing that well,''
Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Moya, when he was unable to get his first
serve in, the hole in his game on a fast court like this one was
painfully apparent. His second serve isn't much more than a 77-mph
clay-court pancake. In the seventh game, Moya again fell behind,
0-40, and scrambled back to 30-40, giving him a string of 10 break
points saved. On the 11th, however, Philippoussis returned a
backhand off a second serve down the line, and Moya hit a lunging
forehand volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
   All that was left was the wait for Rafter to join him in the
final.

ORIOLES HOLD OFF ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ After their 3-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on
Saturday afternoon before 48,038 at Camden Yards, the Anaheim
Angels talked about resiliency and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   They had to.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have had to overcome many setbacks this season, so
one loss wasn't going to affect them. Or so they said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was no mistaking this was a tough one to take.
Starter Steve Sparks pitched 72/3 scoreless innings and the Angels
offense squeaked out two unearned runs against Orioles starter Mike
Mussina to take a 2-0 lead into the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy Percival, looking for his 40th save, gave up a two-run
home run to Mike Bordick and an RBI single to Eric Davis as the
Angels lost for the second time in two days here.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' lead over Texas in the AL West was two games heading
into Saturday's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson scored the winning run from second on Davis'
single to center. Anderson and Jim Edmonds' throw arrived home at
the same time, but Anderson collided with catcher Phil Nevin before
Nevin could grab hold of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me right when the ball got there,'' Nevin said. ``I'm
not even sure if it hit my glove. There's not much you can do but
hope it sticks in the leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad throw, it was too far up the line,'' Edmonds
said. ``I almost got Phil killed. If I throw the ball right, he's
out. Bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one in the Angels clubhouse blamed himself for
Saturday's loss more than Percival (2-6), who has blown five saves
in 44 opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just kicked the (stuffing) out of me,'' said Percival,
who was throwing between 95-98 mph. ``I was throwing well, but I
didn't throw many breaking balls, and they got too comfortable in
the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said he wasn't throwing his breaking ball because he
didn't have a good one warming up in the bullpen. Against Bordick,
Percival threw a total of 11 pitches _ all fastballs. Bordick
fouled off five pitches on a 3-2 count before turning on an inside
fastball and hitting it off the left-field foul pole for the
game-tying homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-and-two to the No. 9 hitter? I'm going to throw a
heater,'' Percival said. ``More power to him. I threw the pitch
inside where I wanted and he turned on it. I gave him a steady diet
of up, down, away.... He knew I was going to come right after him
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival stewed for a while after the game before talking with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is going to (tick) me off for quite awhile tonight,
but I'll get over it. You guys have seen me long enough to know
this isn't going to faze me. I've got to be ready for tomorrow,''
Percival said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've done it all year, we'd better be able to continue to
do it,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said of shaking off a tough
loss. ``We've got to be able to be resilient to the end and bounce
back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored a run in the second and fourth innings off
Mussina, the runs coming across on errors by second baseman Roberto
Alomar and third baseman Cal Ripken, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sparks had one of his best knuckleballs of the season
working. He gave up five hits, walked six and struck out six before
being removed with two on and two out in the eighth. Mike Holtz got
B.J. Surhoff to fly out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, though, Percival couldn't slam the door and the
Angels were hit with a tough loss when they can't afford many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't lose a whole lot of games in the bottom of the ninth,
so it's tough to take,'' Edmonds said. ``But we still have to go
on. There's no reason to worry about it or pout about it. If we
lose and come in second place by one game, I don't think this is a
game we'll look back at. There are a lot of other games we gave
away.''
</P>
<P>
   With Texas right behind, the Angels maintain the attitude that
they can't look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be like a good race car driver,'' pitcher Chuck
Finley said. ``Knock the glass out of the rear-view mirror. A good
race car driver doesn't win by looking in the rear view mirror.''

BRUINS: THREE HEADS BETTER THAN ONE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Longhorns fared no better against UCLA's
three-headed tailback than they did last year against Skip Hicks,
the one-man wrecking crew.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Lewis, Keith Brown and DeShaun Foster combined for a
very Hicks-ish 163 yards and three touchdowns in the Bruins' 49-31
victory Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They were good enough to make Texas respect the run, and that's
as good as they need to be.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Foster were especially impressive. Lewis, a sophomore
from Antelope Valley, gained 113 yards on 22 carries (a 5.1-yard
average) and scored twice. He was tougher, quicker and more
confident than last year, when his high game was 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little relief getting that first touchdown out of the
way,'' he said. ``Because I'm the (starter), I had to get in the
(end) zone. That first one was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, the freshman from Tustin, played in predetermined
situations. His first carry, in the second quarter, was a pitch
right that gained 6 yards. He finished with 44 yards and a
touchdown on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as nervous as I thought I'd be,'' he said with a
smile. ``I wasn't looking for a touchdown, but once we got so far
(ahead), I thought maybe I'd get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wet feet: As expected, four true freshmen played for UCLA.
Foster was the most productive. Receiver Jon Dubravac did not catch
a pass. Nose guard Ken Kocher played sparingly because of an
injured ankle, and linebacker Robert Thomas had one tackle and two
assists in limited time.
</P>
<P>
   No response needed: Asked if he said anything to Texas defensive
end Aaron Humphrey _ whose comment, ``Cade is a dead man,'' was
posted in the Bruins locker room _ UCLA quarterback Cade McNown
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see him. I didn't have to say anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The temperature, 84 degrees, wasn't as high as
expected, and neither was the crowd: only 73,070 attended. Although
that was 10,000 fewer than anticipated, it was the largest crowd
for a UCLA home opener in the Rose Bowl and the third-largest
opening-day crowd ever.
</P>
<P>
   Several top recruits attended the game, including Westlake tight
end Mike Seidman, Venice quarterback J.P. Losman and Los Alamitos
defensive end Bernard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Another stellar day for All-America kicker Chris Sailer: He
averaged 42 yards on four punts and boomed seven of his eight
kickoffs for touchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was balanced on offense and on defense. Inside linebacker
Ramogi Huma led the Bruins with eight tackles. Outside linebacker
Brendan Ayanbadejo had two sacks, forced one fumble and recovered
another.
</P>
<P>
   Starting left guard Oscar Cabrera sprained his right ankle and
will be evaluated today. He is tentatively listed as day-to-day.

THOMAS HAS HIS EYE ON A MARK, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As Derrick Thomas watched fellow Missourian Mark McGwire
circle the bases with his forearm thrust to the sky after hitting
No. 62 last week, a different number came into the mind of the
Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback-crushing linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas started thinking about number 22.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, in only his second season in the NFL, Thomas
assaulted that number, but unlike most of the quarterbacks he has
chased, it escaped him. Thomas's 20 sacks that season made him an
instant legend in Kansas City, but they left him two short of Mark
Gastineau, who established the NFL record for single-season sacks
in 1984 with 22. As great a pass rusher as Thomas has been ever
since, he has not approached that number.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Until now? One week into the season?
</P>
<P>
   That is indeed the case because last Sunday Thomas opened his
10th campaign with the Chiefs by running down poor Oakland Raider
quarterback Jeff George six times _ one off Thomas's NFL record for
a game set during that glorious 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   That gave him more than 25 percent of the sacks he needs to pass
Gastineau and put him on a pace to finish with 96 this season. That
would seem unlikely considering that only 15 players (including New
England's Andre Tippett at 100 and Thomas at 113.5) have made 100
sacks in their entire careers; but just as McGwire learned this
year that breaking a record is about the pace as well as the chase,
so too has Thomas, who started his chase by setting a withering
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think there's something I can't do,'' Thomas said when
asked about Gastineau's record. ``It's in the back of my mind.
McGwire got a longstanding record. I was on hand watching (on TV)
when he did that, so I thought, `Why not me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Well, for those uninitiated in the wonder of a
247-pound lightweight dominating a super heavyweight's game, it
might seem impossible to imagine Thomas crushing 22 quarterbacks
this season. But then, doesn't six in a game seem just as
impossible?
</P>
<P>
   For most NFL players it would be, but Thomas has never been most
NFL players. He has had six or more sacks in a game twice, while
only one other player ever got to six once. That should partly
explain why for nine straight years he has been to the Pro Bowl, a
string that included last year even though a triceps injury made
him ineffectual until the seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   Weakened from his injuries, Thomas had only 1.5 sacks after 10
games and was growing fearful that he might never be what he once
was. But, fittingly, he finished with a rush and ended up with 9.5
sacks, gaining the bulk of them the way he always has _ by beating
men 60 pounds his superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I wish I was 290 and I could go and just power rush
and move like Reggie White and all those guys, but that's not my
strong suit,'' Thomas explained. ``Everything I do comes from speed
rushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get off the ball, because my advantage is
quickness. I think it was a gift given to me long before I started
to play football. The ability to bend my hips and turn the corner.
That's something I really had nothing to do with. It's
hereditary.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Harlow, the Raiders' beleaguered left tackle, would have
been far happier had Thomas inherited Frank Sinatra's voice or Ben
Vereen's hip-bending ability.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time last Sunday, Thomas was by him like a shot,
smashing into George and then exhorting the crowd at Arrowhead
Stadium to pump up the volume. When they did, a man who needed no
more advantages had another one, according to Harlow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching it on TV, all you see is he's just kicking Harlow's
ass,'' Harlow said several days after the debacle. ``Part of that
was true, but a lot of it had to do with him being in that place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great pass rusher but he gets a lot of sacks there. I'm
looking at the ball and he's looking at the ball (because it's too
loud to hear the snap count). Who runs faster? I'm a slow 5.4 going
forward. He's got a great advantage in that place. All he does the
whole time is this (wave his arms).''
</P>
<P>
   That and pry himself off the quarterback's facemask. If he can
do that 16 more times in 15 games, Thomas will have his immortal
number and he will have achieved it just the way McGwire got his.
</P>
<P>
   By relentlessly hitting the home run.
</P>
<P>
   And, in his case, the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody I can't beat,'' said Thomas, who
Sunday faces one of the game's best young tackles, Jacksonville
All-Pro Tony Boselli. ``You have to be relentless because everybody
is going to get stopped. If you look at the ratio, you fail more
times than you're successful, so you have to be focused and strong
and know that no matter what happens you're ultimately going to be
successful at some point. You just have to continue to bring it
until you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says the five most difficult quarterbacks for him to sack
are  &UR; John Elway &LR; , &UR; Dan Marino &LR; , &UR; Warren Moon &LR; , &UR; Steve Young &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Mark Brunell &LR; . The choice of Marino might surprise you, but Thomas
has chased him in eight games and never once pulled down the
Dolphins' quarterback. ``Marino is the most difficult to sack
because he's going to get rid of the ball,'' Thomas said. ``Dan is
never going to keep the ball long enough for you to get him on the
ground.'' ... The Chiefs had 10 sacks last week against Oakland,
and here's one reason why: They blitzed 51 times. Honest ... New
Arizona defensive end  &UR; Andre Wadsworth  &LR; is the latest to put the
lie to the importance of training camp. The rookie held out all
summer, signed a deal two days before the first game, and was in
for 28 plays last Sunday after missing every practice. That was not
 &UR; Vince Tobin's  &LR; plan, but after  &UR; Eric Swann  &LR; was thrown out of the
game for fighting in the first quarter, the coach had no choice.
Now Wadsworth is slated to start Sunday with only a week of
practice behind him ... Redskins defensive tackle  &UR; Dana
Stubblefield  &LR; broke the bank in the offseason when he jumped from
the 49ers and now he's looking to break up opposing offenses
through his own work and that of fellow free agent millionaire  &UR; Dan
Wilkinson &LR; . So what does Stubblefield worry about? His teammates.
``We feel our defensive ends have to hold up the line because teams
are going to try (to run wide),'' Stubblefield said. ``If it's not
inside, they're going to go outside right away. They are not going
to hesitate. We'll be tested but we're more concerned with our
defensive ends holding up the outside.'' While some old hands in
the NFL feared Stubblefield might lose his fire after becoming one
of the highest-paid defensive players, he insisted that is not
true. ``I want my team to believe that every Sunday I'll be coming
to play,'' Stubblefield said. ``They don't have to worry about me.
They don't have to hook me up to some jumper cables and get me jump
started.'' ... Colts club president  &UR; Bill Polian  &LR; recently
described rookie quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning  &LR; with words near to
the heart of Boston sports fans. Here's his point of view on the
NFL's No. 1 draft pick: ``What Peyton was able to accomplish (at
Tennessee) reminded me of what  &UR; Larry Bird  &LR; did his senior year at
Indiana State,'' Polian said. ``He personally played the role of
taking his team where it went. I'm not saying in the least that
Peyton is the qualilty of champion that Larry Bird ended up as, but
Peyton's accomplishments as a collegian mirror those of Bird's. We
can only hope that Peyton goes on to enjoy the type of successes
that Larry Bird had in his chosen professional field. We hope the
people in the state of Indiana can witness football accomplishments
of that magnitude.'' Comparing a rookie quarterback to Larry Legend
is dangerous business, both here in New England and back home again
in Indiana, where Bird now coaches the Pacers when he's not
smelling the sycamores.

   Fuuummmbbbllleee!!! Because of a reporter's inability (mine) to
write down a list and keep it straight, this space said last Sunday
that when Arizona quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer  &LR; started Opening Day,
it would mark only the second time since 1988 that the Cardinals
had had the same Opening Day quarterback two years in a row. That
would have been interesting had it been accurate. Plummer was not
the Opening Day starter in 1997;  &UR; Kent Graham  &LR; was. Plummer came
off the bench when he, making his first NFL appearance, and led the
Cardinals on a 98-yard touchdown drive.  &UR; Steve Beuerlein  &LR; remains
the only Cardinal to be the Opening Day quarterback two years in a
row (1993-94) since '88 ... To say the Colts are starting over is
an understatement. Six of their nine offensive linemen have two
years experience or less, and tight end  &UR; Ken Dilger  &LR; is their
oldest skill-position player at 27. Although you may think he's
105, running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk  &LR; is only 25 ... Building new
stadiums seems a lot easier in towns other than Boston. Out in
Denver, three Colorado businessmen donated $100,000 each to help
finance a group pushing a ballot initiative for a new stadium for
the Broncos.  &UR; Bill Daniels  &LR; not only donated $100,000 to Citizens
for a New Stadium, a group asking voters to approve a 0.1 percent
sales tax extension that would finance 75 percent of the stadium,
but he did the same in 1990 to help rescue a campaign to institute
that 0.1 percent sales tax for the building of Coors Field. The
three men have accounted for almost three-quarters of the $440,000
raised to fight for the initiative, which is likely to pass. Plans
to build a new stadium for the 49ers have slowed, however, as cost
estimates shot up from $325 million to possibly $500 million. San
Francisco Mayor  &UR; Willie Brown  &LR; came out last week and said in a
California kind of way that the deal is in trouble. ``I would not
bet a cafe mocha with raspberry and sugar on this one,'' Brown
said. He and club president  &UR; Larry Thrailkill  &LR; will meet with NFL
commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue  &LR; Friday to discuss the stalled
initiative. One sign that did not bode well was that  &UR; Joe
Ellis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a fellow known well around the league, decided not to head
up the stadium development as planned and took a similar job in
Denver ... Speaking of Denver, the news blackout is over. Sort of.
With the intervention of the league and head coach  &UR; Mike
Shanahan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Broncos' offensive line now will have at least one
of its members speak to the media each Friday. Denver's linemen had
not spoken to the media in two years until January's Super Bowl.
That fine-inspired detente ended this summer, however. Word came
back to the Broncos that other lines were now threatening the same
and Shanahan, to his credit, stepped in.

   Talkative Denver tight end  &UR; Shannon Sharpe  &LR; has an opinion on
most things, including the recent free agency losses suffered by
the Cowboys: ``When you win three Super Bowls in four years, teams
are trying to raid the henhouse and steal the eggs before they
hatch.'' ... Hall of Fame running back  &UR; Walter Payton  &LR; was asked
about the possibility of  &UR; Barry Sanders  &LR; breaking his all-time
rushing record and conceded that it's likely, since Sanders trails
his 16,726 yards by only 2,878. But Payton was not bothered by it.
``He's just an electric runner and a class guy,'' Payton said.
``That's the key. When you have class and you display it like that,
nobody cares if you break their record. A guy like Barry, you can't
feel bad about it. When the record is eclipsed _ and eventually he
will surpass that _ I would like to be there to congratulate him
and shake his hand and turn over the torch to him and let him take
it a little farther than I took it. That's what the game of
football is all about.'' ... Fans in Chicago don't feel the same
way about their newest running back as they once did about the
beloved Payton. Although No. 1 pick  &UR; Curtis Enis  &LR; rushed for 77
yards in 12 carries against Jacksonville in his first game as a pro
after his long holdout, he was booed lustily most of the times he
touched the ball. After he sprinted wide on first and goal from the
4 late in the game and was knocked out of bounds, Enis had to come
out because he was tired. Two Enis-less plays later, Chicago kicked
a field goal to give itself a 6-point lead that lasted all of two
minutes; they lost the game by 1. ``He took himself out of the game
because he was exhausted,'' said coach  &UR; Dave Wannstedt &LR; . ``But I
think everybody should be excited. We just have to get him in
shape.'' Just what they wanted to hear in the City of the Big
Shoulders. Their No. 1 holdout and newest millionaire was too tired
to run with the game on the line. That's one reason they're still
booing him. ``I never gave the crowd any reason to cheer me,'' Enis
acknowledged. ``People want to boo me, they're going to boo me.
People want to cheer me, they're gong to cheer me. I'm here to run
the football.'' The sooner the better ... One guy who apparently
didn't pay Enis much attention was Chicago tackle  &UR; James  &LR; ``Big
Cat''  &UR; Williams &LR; . Asked about Enis's talent, Williams said, ``I
don't pay attention to running backs. They're always running up my
backside, so I don't care what they do.'' ... How bad are the
Bears? Well, their greatest runner,  &UR; Gale Sayers &LR; , &UR;  &LR; had this to say
recently: ``The Bears are three players away from being three
players away.'' ... If you think  &UR; Al Lerner  &LR; paid a lot by handing
over $530 million for the Cleveland expansion franchise, consider
that  &UR; Rupert Murdoch  &LR; just paid a billion dollars to buy the
British soccer club Manchester United.

   &UR; Jimmy Johnson's  &LR; promised shift of emphasis to the running game
held up for at least one week. In last Sunday's season opener,
Miami netted more yards rushing than passing (137-135) for the
first time since the second game of the 1991 season. ``As much as
anything else, there's a commitment there that we are going to be
persistent,'' Johnson said. ``We are going to run the ball. Our
offensive line has taken to it. I think our offensive personnel
understand it. A year ago, when we got behind in games, we ran the
ball 23 percent of the time, lowest in the league. San Francisco,
Green Bay, Denver, and Pittsburgh ran in the mid-40 percent when
they were behind.'' ... Hard-luck Miami wide receiver  &UR; Yatil
Green &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has had three knee operations in 13 months, got more
medical bad news when he was hospitalized for three days following
his latest knee surgery. Sources say Green had an infection that
caused the knee to swell but the Dolphins denied that ... How's
this for consistency? Dolphins wide receiver  &UR; O.J. McDuffie
 &LR; entered the season having touched the ball 279 times in his
career. Of that total, 200 had been converted into first downs (195
receptions, 5 runs) ...  &UR; John Kent Cooke  &LR; made it official
Wednesday: The Redskins are for sale. Problems with his late
father's estate have forced the sale, though Cooke is trying to get
together a group to keep the team. He has already hired the
investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to handle the deal the
way the NFL used Goldman Sachs to broker the Cleveland franchise.
Cooke already has an offer of $450 million but that does not
include his $161 million in stadium debt. Since the deal includes
the Redskins' new stadium as well as the team, it is expected that
the final price will well exceed that offer ... For all the talk of
running the ball, passing yardage was up an average of 35 yards a
game last weekend ... When New Orleans quarterback  &UR; Billy Joe
Hobert  &LR; went down for the season last weekend with an Achilles'
tendon injury, the Saints signed the best available Billy Joe:
 &UR; Billy Joe Tolliver &LR; .

WHITE HOUSE HITS BACK AT STARR REPORT'S FOCUS ON SEX
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN C. HENRY &QL; 
and NANCY MATHIS &QL; 
c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House launched a fiery counterattack
Saturday dismissing independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report as
``pornographic'' and a ``hit-and-run smear campaign'' lacking the
legal merit to warrant impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report to Congress ``is at bottom overreaching in an
extravagant effort to find a case where there is none,'' the
president's legal team argued Saturday as members of Congress and
the public absorbed the special prosecutor's graphic account of
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president's efforts to keep secret his trysts with a White
House intern half his age led him to commit 11 impeachable
offenses, Starr alleged in a report that Congress made public
Friday and posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a 42-page analysis distributed Saturday by the White House,
Clinton's lawyers provide a point-by-point rebuttal of each of the
grounds Starr cites as sufficient for Congress to remove the
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct
justice. He did not tamper with witnesses. And he did not abuse the
power of the presidency,'' the White House analysis says, referring
to the four broad charges under which the 11 allegations fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that `sex' is precisely what this four and a half
year investigation has boiled down to,'' the president's legal team
argued, alluding to how long Starr and his predecessor, Robert
Fiske, have been investigating Clinton, his Arkansas business
dealings and allegations of wrongdoing at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had no comment on the Clinton legal response Saturday.
``We've discharged our duty as required by statute,'' said
spokesman Charles Bakaly. ``Any further action now lies with
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of wrongdoing in the failed Arkansas land deal
called Whitewater, the dismissal of the White House travel staff,
and misuse of confidential FBI files were not mentioned in Starr's
report but are expected to be included in Starr's final report to
the three-judge panel that appointed him. In addition, the grand
jury investigation of the Lewinsky matter could yield indictments
and possibly more information for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing-in for the first time since Starr's report was made
public, Vice President Al Gore offered his support for Clinton on
Saturday, telling reporters in Portland, Oregon, that the charges
listed in the prosecutor's document did not provide grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe this report serves as the basis for
overturning the judgment of the American people ... that Bill
Clinton should be their president,'' Gore said, declining to answer
questions about the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   As some members of the House Judiciary Committee spent part of
Saturday reviewing documents in preparation for deciding whether to
initiate a formal impeachment investigation, Clinton tried to
project a business-as-usual image.
</P>
<P>
   During his weekly radio address, the president urged Congress to
``stay focused'' on issues facing the nation and did not directly
address the sex and perjury scandal. His only mention of the threat
to his presidency was in passing. ``It has been an exhausting and
difficult week in the capital, not only for me but for many
others,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting-in while Clinton delivered his radio address from
the White House, Rep. Elija Cummings, D-Md., and Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., met with reporters and offered the president some
measured support, contending Starr's report fell short of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said that in his congressional district in Baltimore
telephone calls were running 12 to 1 in Clinton's favor. ``People
said `come to Washington today and tell the president we're with
him','' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor ``took a situation of very poor judgment
by the president and pumped it into a nickel-and-dime, lurid sex
story. I think that's all he had. He had no choice. He fired his
best shot. It can't get worse than that, but it's not
impeachable,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this thing started off with a Whitewater
investigation, an FBI investigation,'' Rangel said. ``When you got
nothing else going for you, you go for the dirt and filth.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a sentiment that showed up in some overnight public
opinion polls, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., questioned the wisdom of
Republican House leaders who pushed to post Starr's report on the
Internet. ``All this detail, I must tell you that people I've
talked with in Nebraska would prefer not to know, prefer not to
hear,'' Kerrey said in a CNN interview. ``There is a sort of
pornographic value to this that people are recoiling against.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Georgia, House Speaker Newt Gingrich defended the
decision, saying the public had a right to know the details behind
Starr's allegations against the president. ``I think all of us
should be informed,'' the speaker said. ``I think every citizen
should be paying attention. These are very significant matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the lurid details of Starr's report would not have
been necessary had Clinton not misled the nation for seven months.
``I wish he (Clinton) had told us the truth in the beginning and we
would not be reading many things that have no place in public
literature,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican, a former history teacher, said Clinton
had brought shame on the Oval Office by failing to live up to the
dignity of his predecessors. ``The presidency was made honorable by
George Washington,'' Gingrich said. ``It was made noble by Abraham
Lincoln. Judge Starr's report is very troubling, particularly when
measured against that standard.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis of Starr's report by the Associated Press
found the word ``sex'' 164 times. The word ``sexual'' turns up 406
times, ``sexually'' nine times and ``sexy,'' ``sexier'' and
``sexuality'' once each. By contrast, the legal side of the case
takes up far less space. ``Obstruction,'' often of ``justice,''
appears 11 times; ``perjury'' 40 times and ``impeachment'' 15
times.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,600 pages of information that was not released Friday
is being reviewed by members of the Judiciary Committee which has a
Sept. 28 deadline for finishing the task. After that they can
decide whether to hold hearings, question witnesses, or let the
report die.

PATRIOTS TURN TO EDWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ He is not delusional. He knows the nation will be
focused on Peyton Manning when the Indianapolis Colts play the
Patriots Sunday night. In a way, he hopes he does fall through the
cracks _ as long as they are cracks in the Colt defense that the
Patriots' offensive line can exploit to spring him for major
yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night will mark the first professional start for top
draft choice Robert Edwards, the 18th overall pick in last spring's
draft and the Patriots' answer to losing Curtis Martin to the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   This is a huge chance for him to solidify a starting job, gain
some recognition from his hometown audience, and earn some respect
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank the offensive line every time they create something
for me,'' said Edwards. ``They're the ones to credit if I can find
some running room. I thought they blocked so well last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Edwards and Manning are obvious.
Manning, like Bledsoe in 1993 a No. 1 overall pick, has had to get
right to work as the leader of his team's offense, while Edwards
has been broken in slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's opener against Denver, Edwards relieved starter
Sedrick Shaw and carried 13 times for 50 yards, good enough to earn
Sunday night's start. While Patriots coach Pete Carroll says this
is not permanent, it's clear that the Patriots think their No. 1
pick will be one of the best runners in the league.
</P>
<P>
   A start against one of the league's worst teams isn't a bad
place to begin. But the Patriots will be careful. Edwards has been
fighting a groin pull that forced him to miss three weeks of the
preseason. The questions Sunday night will be how much can he run
and how often will he need a breather?
</P>
<P>
   Running backs coach Kirby Wilson feels Edwards is making up
ground in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real level-headed,'' said Wilson. ``He's one of those
guys who's never too high or never too low. He's one way _ steady.
That's rare for a kid that young in his career to be that
consistent and focus on the job at hand. It really is a plus when
you're trying to prepare him to play a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also very natural. That's one of the things we saw when
we were evaluating him. He's been very good as far as letting
things happen naturally. He's going out and making the right reads
and the right cuts and letting the flow come to him. He's very
aggressive and doing things with a lot of violence and urgency, and
those are things that please you as a coach. With that sense of
urgency, he'll get his assignments done. I'm impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting him to do things naturally is precisely the emphasis. In
the beginning, the Patriots wanted Edwards to protect the football,
hold it with two hands. Vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier noticed that Edwards was using two hands even beyond the
``danger zone,'' i.e. the linebacker area. But according to Wilson,
that has begun to correct itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started back in college with Robert, really in the early
stages at his position,'' said Wilson. ``He's been working on it.
He's learning the proper technique of carrying the football. He's
very conscious of it. He knows that it inhibits his style to a
certain point. But he's doing a good job with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has enjoyed working with three young runners: Edwards,
Sed-rick Shaw, and Harold Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a welcome challenge,'' said Wilson. ``To me it's a
great assignment. These guys are great to be around. They push each
other, help each other. It's really been fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it can't be much fun for Sed-rick Shaw right now. He had
all of seven carries for 25 yards in his first chance to start a
regular-season game. Sunday night, he will be the guy who comes in
to give Edwards the breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sedrick is a competitor,'' said Wilson. ``It's like anyone who
played in Pop Warner and high school and college and now the pros.
He doesn't want to sit. He has his pride. He wants to show he can
be the No. 1 guy. He has to keep his head up.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has been emphasizing all week that the Patriots should
not take the Colts lightly. He said Manning appears to be the real
deal, throwing for more than 300 yards against Miami last week; if
it weren't for interceptions, he probably would have upset the
Dolphins.

MANNING IS COLTS' SAVING GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The first day of the resurrection did not go as
The Savior had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning had lifted up no one but himself last Sunday,
dragging his body up from four sacks and countless hits that
followed many of his 37 pass attempts. In the Colts' 24-15 loss to
the Miami Dolphins, he had passed for 302 yards and a touchdown but
also had thrown three interceptions. The last was a most unwise one
that was returned for a touchdown, ending his team's hopes and
nearly bringing tears to the eyes of his father as he sat in the
stands at the RCA Dome watching the future and remembering the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 27 years ago, Archie Manning had been The Savior of a
different team. He was in New Orleans, not Indianapolis, trying to
save the Saints, not the Colts, but other than geography the job
was the same _ difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Saving a franchise from itself turned out to be the only thing
Archie Manning couldn't do with a football. He couldn't save the
Saints from bad coaching and worse management, and so when it was
over he had to be content in the knowledge that he was the greatest
quarterback in NFL history to never reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Manning's teams in New Orleans and Minnesota went
56-130-3 in his 14 years in pro football's purgatory, a record that
lies about just how skilled a quarterback he truly was. But the
numbers are in the record book, and nothing can erase them. That is
how it is in sports. There are no second acts once the curtain
comes down, although Archie Manning will come as close as one can
to getting one now that his blood is back in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It is Peyton's Time now, not Archie's. It is the beginning of
his attempt to do in Indianapolis what his father could not in New
Orleans. So on this first Sunday of The Second Coming of Manning,
the father of The Savior sat watching in the stands, knowing what
the son could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Manning said after his boy's first professional
football game. ``(Colts') Coach (Jim) Mora told me they didn't
curtail their game plan for him and that made me real proud, but he
had the interceptions so people will look and say `Rookie day.' So
it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Dolphins head coach) Jimmy Johnson told me Peyton carried
himself like a veteran most of the time. He's beyond his years in a
lot of ways, but this is a very hard game for the quarterback. But
don't you worry about Peyton. He'll be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A winning attitude
</P>
<P>
   The belief that Peyton Manning will be just fine is why he was
the first player taken in April's draft, picked ahead of the
raw-boned giant from the West, Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   It is why the Colts chose him to resurrect a team that has had
23 quarterbacks throw a pass since it moved to the Midwest from
Baltimore 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is why he became the starter the day he was drafted, the 17th
in a line of quarterbacks who have started at least one game for
the Colts in the past 14 years, years in which the team lost 11 or
more games nearly half the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Such frustrating numbers may have come as a shock to Manning,
whose teams had lost 11 games total in his eight years of
quarterbacking: He was a combined 73-11 at Isidore Newman High
School in New Orleans and the University of Tennessee. Yet, as
unfamiliar as he was to defeat, Manning was unbowed by the first
defeat of his professional career last weekend, walking into a
jammed interview room less than 15 minutes after throwing that
final, fatal interception and calmly answering every question
thrown at him, including one about whether he knew that Leaf's San
Diego Chargers had won earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hiding in the trainer's room. No surly refusals to
answer men who knew less about what he had just done than he did.
No making excuses for his mistakes, no pointing out that others had
made mistakes, too. There was only Peyton Manning doing what he
seems to have always done best _ standing tall in the pocket and
firing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we just missed hitting the home run,'' Manning said,
referring to the play before the final interception, on which
receiver Torrence Small dropped a ball in tight coverage. ``If I
got the ball a little higher ... But you can `what if' all you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   As Manning answered the questions, it became clear he was not a
``what if'' kind of quarterback. He had made that fact clear months
ago, in fact, on the day he probably became the Colts' Savior in
Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Manning had been flown to Miami on Jimmy Irsay's private plane
to have lunch with the Colts owner at the Surf Club because Irsay
wanted to look into the eyes of the two top-rated quarterbacks in
the upcoming draft before he committed millions of his family's
dollars to one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all the Irsays have been through with quarterbacks
over the years, it was a reasonable enough request. And when Irsay
took that look, Manning looked back and said flatly, ``I will win
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent a shiver down my spine,'' Irsay said later.
</P>
<P>
   It also sent him to the podium minutes into the draft to bet his
team's future on Peyton Manning. It is a $48 million bet that
included a record $11.6 million signing bonus and contract
incentives in which Manning bet on himself as well by tying some of
his money to playoff, AFC Championship, and Super Bowl victories.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared from the start
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Manning impressed his new boss with his
earnestness because he has been that way since he was 9 and first
began hanging around the Saints' training camp with his dad. He has
been betting on himself since the first time he tried football in
the seventh grade and he has collected most of the time, making
clear along the way that he would always be ready to win when the
time came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to do everything possible to be prepared,'' Manning
said. ``I've been told I'll struggle my rookie year, and I think
that statement has some merit. But I hope I'll struggle less
because I returned for my senior year.'' Manning remained at
Tennessee to play last season despite having graduated with a 3.6
grade-point average in communications in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think experience is the best teacher,'' he added. ``I got a
lot of it in college, but this is a different game. I have a lot to
learn, so the sooner I take the bumps and bruises, the better off
I'll be in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to learn on the job. I'll make some mistakes, no
question. But hopefully I won't make a bunch of 'em. The best way
to learn is to mess it up one time. You can be good on paper, on
the chalkboard, in the film room, but it's not the same as being
out there. The games are where you really learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, it might be nice to sit behind a (John) Elway
or a (Dan) Marino for a year, but I wonder how much you really can
learn on the sidelines. I'll get better from playing each week and
hope I don't slow the team down.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Manning is coming to a team that lost 13 games
last season, he'd need to have his right arm amputated to slow down
the Colts. Yet he knows much is expected of him at a time when
patience is a virtue not often exhibited in sports. Manning has
been paid those many millions of dollars not simply to play
quarterback better than the previous 23 guys in Indianapolis. He's
been paid to win and to win soon despite the circumstances that
mitigate against that.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback is arguably the hardest position to play in sports.
It is like playing point guard on the Mass. Turnpike. It is like
trying to make a putt for $5,000 with Mike Tyson in your foursome.
It is not only difficult and complicated work, it is also dangerous
because your mind must work like a computer while someone keeps
trying to pull the plug by hitting you in the back of the head with
a 2-by-4.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hard job, but Manning has always done what he could to
make it easier. That is how he has gotten this far, and it's how he
got the nickname ``Caveman.''
</P>
<P>
   It came not from possessing a Schwarzeneggerlike physique but
rather from the many hours he would spend locked in the film room
at Tennessee, studying his opponents, studying his own mechanics,
studying anything he could to make himself better. He was studying
when his many teammates, and opponents, were not.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same approach he has brought to Indianapolis, where
teammates say he is often seen still looking at film at 7 p.m. at
the training complex.
</P>
<P>
   When Manning learned he could not begin practicing right after
the draft because of some byzantine NCAA regulation, for example,
he came to Indianapolis and left with hours of videotape. He took
the tapes home to Knoxville and studied them as well as the Colts
playbook. By the time training camp opened in July, he knew his job
and everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he knew enough to relieve any anxiety his more
experienced teammates might have had about turning their football
futures over to someone for whom shaving would be a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I felt like the coaches or players have had to slow
up to let him catch up, and that has been a great surprise,''
center Jay Leeuwenburg said. ``He's always, `Let's keep moving
forward.' You'd think you'd kind of have to hold his hand, but
we've never had to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Demeanor of a pro
</P>
<P>
   Manning's preparedness was obvious last Sunday, in his first
exposure to a real NFL defense. The game was faster than anything
he had seen before, and the defenses far more complicated. Bodies
attacked him from odd places; defenders popped up in strange spots.
Yet only once did he seem rattled to the point of distraction.
</P>
<P>
   It was before the play that turned into the first of his
interceptions. One leg bounced up and down and his head swiveled
back and forth, back and forth, back and forth as he barked signals
at the line of scrimmage before finally taking the snap and
throwing the interception. You could see it coming. Certainly
Terrell Buckley saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Other times he may have misjudged situations or an opponent's
ability to recover quickly, but seldom did he seem baffled. Dan
Fouts, the great San Diego quarterback, once described his first
game in the NFL as analagous to putting your head inside a popcorn
maker. Things unseen keep going off in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Manning felt the same way, but you would not have
guessed it from his demeanor or his play or his reaction to it all.
Once the game was over, his reaction might be best described as no
reaction at all, beyond the expected one of disappointment in the
face of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Such preparedness and calm were what he had always shown at
Tennessee, where he went 39-6 as a four-year starter and set 33
school passing records. It was what Mora expected of him from the
first day the Colts drafted him, and it is what Manning has shown
the coach over and over in these first few months as The Savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some peaks and valleys and Peyton's going to
have those, like all rookie quarterbacks, but he always rebounds
with a good showing,'' Mora said. ``One reason why is he works
hard. He prepares. He lives in the film room. Football is important
to Peyton. Success is important to Peyton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look for excuses for why something didn't work. He
looks for reasons. He knows what everybody is supposed to do and
where everybody is supposed to be. He truly understands what we're
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning understands what the Colts are trying to do with the
offense Tom Moore has installed and he understands what Irsay was
trying to do when he installed him as the team's
quarterback/Savior.
</P>
<P>
   He understands the NFL is not Isidore Newman or Tennessee. It is
a league in which the game is about only one thing. It is not about
money, although a lot of the time it seems that way. It is not
about building character in young men or a sense of family in old
ones. It is not even about the linkage between himself and Leaf, a
joining neither had control over or can change.
</P>
<P>
   No, the NFL is about only one thing. It is about victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Indianapolis Colts, that's what Peyton
Manning has always been about, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan and I are not competing against one another,'' Manning
said when asked about Leaf. ``People will make comparisons. You
can't pretend it's not there. But we're not trying to out-do each
other. We're trying to help our teams get back on the winning
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure in this situation, but I'm used to pressure.
In high school, it was being a former quarterback's son. In
college, it was being a candidate for the Heisman. It changes now,
because you're being paid very generously to do a job, but it's the
same kind of pressure. Outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it doesn't matter what I think about things. Everyone
else will voice their opinion, so the best thing to do is just win.
I'm not being paid to set records or throw for touchdowns, although
I hope those things will come. I came to the Colts to win games.
I'm being paid to win games. The best way to earn my money is win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Savior hasn't won his first game yet, but everyone knows
it's coming. He knows and Archie knows and all those fans with No.
18 on the front and back of their new replica Colts jerseys know.
</P>
<P>
   The ressurection is coming in Indianapolis because The Savior is
here.

BIG DAY IN FORECAST FOR CLOUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The odds were pretty good that Boston College tailback Mike
Cloud would have a banner day against Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, three of his top nine performances have come against
the Scarlet Knights _ 122 yards in 1995, 104 yards and a touchdown
in 1996, and 166 yards and four touchdowns (three rushing) last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the Eagles' home and Big East opener, Cloud did it
again, rushing for 156 yards and two touchdowns in the 41-14 win as
BC opened 2-0 for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For those counting, that's 548 yards on 102 carries (5.4-yard
average) and seven touchdowns. Rutgers saw another side of Cloud,
too _ his receiving side. He grabbed three Scott Mutryn passes for
45 yards, each helping to fuel a touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, Cloud has carried the ball 61 times for 356 yards
and four touchdowns. Add four receptions for 54 yards and that's
410 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line opened up some huge holes,'' said Cloud.
``They were so much bigger than Rutgers's defensive line and just
blew them away and gave me a lot of room to run.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``much bigger'' BC offensive line includes tackles Darnell
Alford (323 pounds) and Paul Zukauskas (306), guards Doug
Brzezinski (305) and Dan Collins (287), and center Damien Woody
(312).
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights limited Cloud to 71 first-half yards _ 40 of
them on three carries _ before the 5-foot-11-inch, 201-pound senior
erupted in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rutgers came out and they did a pretty good job in the first
half,'' said Cloud. ``We made some adjustments at the half. I think
we were too relaxed. We were coming off the high from the Georgia
Tech win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we could see that they were tired in the second half. We
could see it in their eyes. That's when you stick it to them. It's
happened now in two straight games.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud was at his best late in the third quarter, following
Rutgers's second touchdown, which trimmed the BC lead to a
precarious 20-14. In the seven-play, 80-yard drive that took just
1:49 off the clock, he had rushes of 1, 25, and 23 yards before
bolting to paydirt from the 6. That gave BC some breathing room and
Cloud was used sparingly the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we rotated Quinton Lee (85 yards on 13 carries) in
there, Mike Cloud came out fresh and really ran hard in the third
and fourth quarters,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien. ``It's pretty
taxing to do what we're doing, running the football the way we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers coach Terry Shea had his defense go after Cloud
aggressively, but found it tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the ability to slide into a hole and come out of it
very quickly. He's a slasher-type runner. Those are sometimes the
toughest ones to bring down for negative yards. He's got tremendous
vision and knows how to cut back against the flow of the defense.
We came at him with a lot of stunting and he picked us apart
sometimes with his running.''
</P>
<P>
   And his pass catching, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rutgers was all over me and keyed on my running game all
day,'' said Cloud. ``They forgot that I had a pair of hands to
catch the ball. It's nice to be able to do both.''

DAVENPORT TOO POWERFUL IN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If she was going to beat defending champion and No. 1
seed Martina Hingis for the US Open title, Lindsay Davenport knew
she would have to overpower her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And she did.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport played big from the baseline, regrouped after looking
as though she would crumble, and soundly beat Hingis, 6-3, 7-5, to
win her first major title. The No. 2-seeded Davenport swept through
the tournament without losing a set, collected $700,000 for her
efforts, and to top things off, did it all on the birthday of her
mother, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davenport, 22, has an Olympic gold medal (she won in 1996)
and her first win in a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I don't care if I don't win another one _ I've
got these two and I'll cherish them forever,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   She was playing well coming into the tournament, played well
throughout it, and saw her chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up once in the middle of the night and it took me a
while to get back to sleep,'' Davenport said. ``I knew this was
going to be my time if I could play well. And I knew I was playing
well. I knew I needed to take advantage of this opportunity. You
don't know how many times you get to get back there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Davenport broke the serve of Hingis to go up,
4-2, and was serving for a commanding 5-2 lead when her troubles
began.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis broke Davenport's serve, held her own, and then broke
again. They took their changeover break, and Hingis served at 5-4
for the set.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport would have none of it. She went back to pounding her
groundstrokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the toughest thing about her,'' Hingis said.
``When you saw her before, you'd break her, just make a good point,
she would let herself go down. She would show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis hit one forehand long. Davenport pounced on a second
serve with a forehand winner. She hit a backhand down the line.
Hingis double faulted, was broken, and they were back on serve.
</P>
<P>
   She had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a great game,'' Hingis said. ``She kind of killed me
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said she let herself think about winning for a moment
and had her problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got broken and it was 4-all,'' she said. ``I thought, `My
gosh, I might win this.' Then you go off track so quickly. Luckily,
I was able to get it back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Davenport won her service game easily, and Hingis was up to
serve again. It was 30-30 when Davenport ended a long point with a
nice backhand winner down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Championship point. It was another long point and Hingis sliced
a backhand drop to try and end it. But the ball bounced too high
and Davenport was there to blast it past Hingis with a crosscourt
backhand for the championship. The final shot was a tribute to
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just sometimes play drop shots because you don't know what
else to do,'' Hingis said. ``You just kind of hope to make the
point shorter and maybe you're the lucky one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Lindsay had a lock on that this day.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, she has room to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't give me a shot a couple of years ago to win a
Grand Slam,'' she said. ``I think I've proved everybody wrong by
improving a lot in the last couple years. I don't think necessarily
I'm done.''

YEAR END BASH AT QUECHEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The New England Open returns to The Quechee Club in Quechee,
Vt., Tuesday for its annual three-day run. It's sort of the
unofficial clambake for the New England PGA, although defender
Geoff Sisk, who is on the Nike Tour trying to earn his PGA Tour
card, won't return. He's currently 47th on the Nike money list, and
he needs to break into the top 15 to make the exempt list.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fun week over the Highland and Lakeland courses, with
a projected $50,000 total purse and $9,000 going to the winner.
``It's our second-most-significant event after the NEPGA
Championship,'' says associate director Ed Carbone. ``It's probably
the best field in New England. We have our best professionals in
the section, but also some great players from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really fantastic site, and because of the time of year
and it's the end of the championships in New England with a $50,000
purse, it's going to be a really top field.''
</P>
<P>
   The race within the race is for the Wogan Award, which goes to
the section's top player. Paul Parajeckas of Woburn CC, who won
last year, is third on an intriguing point list. NEPGA champion
Mike Baker, who recently won at Ledegemont CC and Agawam Hunt Club,
is first with 66 points. Rhode Island Open champion Kirk Hanefeld
of Salem CC trails him with 63.5 points. Parajeckas has 61, John
Hickson of Bethel Inn 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in five or six years, there's a horse
race,'' says Carbone. ``I realize Baker shot to the top of the
list, but there's only 6 points separating the top four players. So
they're all in the running, and it's probably going to be
determined in Quechee.''
</P>
<P>
   The field for the Quechee clambake includes former champions
Paul Barkhouse (1975), Lee Daniel-ian (1980), Dan Diskin (1981),
Jim Becker (1982), Jeff Bailey (1988), and Rich Parker (1992). The
field also includes Chris Wollmann, who played at Ohio State and
won the US Amateur Public Links Championship in 1995 at Stow Acres.
There are 168 players entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough winter,'' says Quechee Club golf director Andy
Posowski, ``but the golf courses are in the best condition they've
ever been in.'' He credited course superintendent Ken Lalliel for
restoring it to championship condition.
</P>

<P>
   The Solheim Cup tends to get lost in the shuffle because of all
the ballyhooed attention riveted on the Ryder Cup, but the women's
competition between the United States and the Europeans beginning
Friday at Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, deserves attention.
This was the course  &UR; Jack Nicklaus  &LR; built in his hometown area,
where he established the Memorial as one of the PGA Tour's best
events and where he served as US Ryder Cup captain in 1987 when the
Europeans won for the first time on US soil.
</P>
<P>
   The US team is headed by  &UR; Donna Andrews &LR; , &UR; Brandie Burton &LR; , and
 &UR; Tammi Green &LR; . The Europeans are led by  &UR; Helen Alfredsson  &LR; and
 &UR; Annika Sorenstam  &LR; of Sweden, and England's  &UR; Laura Davies &LR; . &UR;  &LR; ``I
think it's been a big positive for the world of sports and golf as
well,'' said Burton recently. ``I think now that we're into the
Ryder Cup format it has made it that much more popular. I see
nothing but it getting bigger and bigger as we go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just the fact we're on a wonderful course and the
women get to play there, that's really pushing it to a higher
level,'' said Alfredsson. ``It's also how all the players are so
excited and trying so hard to get on the Solheim Cup team. It's
obviously the biggest competition in the world, and for us to play
together all year long, it's something very good for golf itself to
see the players compete on a match play basis and all the team
spirit that goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the normal competition, because most of Europe's top
players on the American Tour, but there is very little familiarity
with Muirfield Village. ``I've not played there but obviously seen
it on TV, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to play it,''
said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played nine holes there and I was in absolute awe,'' said
Alfredsson. ``I thought it was one of the toughest courses I'd ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk that the Solheim Cup should be between the
US and the rest of the world to enable players such as Australia's
 &UR; Karrie Webb  &LR; and LPGA/US Women's Open champion  &UR; Se Ri Pak  &LR; to
participate. The US has a 3-1 record since the competition began in
1990 at Lake Nona in Orlando, Fla.

   The NEPGA Seniors Championship leads off the week in Vermont
when the event sets up at Woodstock Monday for a two-day stay. The
starting times on Tuesday will be moved up as players exit to
Quechee for the New England Open. ``It's the first time it's been
there,'' says Carbone. ``There's a lot of past champions. It's a
great venue. It's a great end-of-the-year event for those guys.
We're looking forward to it. It's probably the shortest  &UR; Robert
Trent Jones  &LR; golf course, but it's a wonderful, wonderful test of
golf. You know the greens will be great. What we were hoping for
was a lot of the players would go on and play the New England Open,
and a few of them are going to do that. It's a good time of the
year, and our schedule is so full. The fall's a great time to do a
championship. It's the largest field we've had.'' The interesting
footnote is there are more former champions in the NEPGA Seniors
than in the New England Open. Starting with four-time winner  &UR; Joe
Carr  &LR; of Royal Bedrock (1989, 1992, 1994, and 1997) there's also
Woburn CC's Barkhouse (1991, 1995), Weston's  &UR; Tony Morosco  &LR; (1993),
former Pine Brook head pro (and present NEPGA tournament official)
 &UR; Bob Crowley  &LR; (1978, 1985),  &UR; Gerry Mackedon  &LR; (1986) of D.W. Field,
 &UR; Sal Ruggiero  &LR; (1985) of Stow Acres, and  &UR; Jay Dolan  &LR; (1990) of
Hillview. The first group tees it up  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  at 8 a.m. ...  &UR; Joe
Kelly &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the most noted raconteur in Brighton Center, who in 1948
once worked as a caddie for US Open champion  &UR; Julius Boros  &LR; at what
is presently known as Newton Commonwealth, will be honorary starter
for the 10th Corrib Pub and Restaurant Open at the course on Sept.
20 ...  &UR; Dana Quigley &LR; 's &UR;  &LR; win in The Emerald Coast Classic in
Milton, Fla., vaulted him to eighth on the Senior PGA Tour. He
hadn't missed a tournament all year, but his wife,
 &UR; Angie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; suggested he skip the weekend because they were in the
process of completing the purchase of a new house. ``You never know
when your time will come,'' Quigley told the Globe's  &UR; Jim McCabe &LR; .
The house is next to the 15th hole at Bear Lakes in West Palm
Beach, Fla. Quigley, who was the top player in the NEPGA section
more than a decade after he left the regular PGA Tour, beat  &UR; Hale
Irwin &LR; , &UR; Gil Morgan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Isao Aoki  &LR; for the win. ``When the golf
gods are on your team, it's great,'' said Quigley ... Alfredsson
was asked about the presence of Sweden's  &UR; Pia Nilsson  &LR; as European
captain of the Solheim Cup when it seems half of the team will be
from her homeland. ``I know the official language is English,''
Alfredsson said, ``but it's just the fact she has played
professional golf herself she's taking a great deal of time to know
each and every one ... and what we need to do to feel
comfortable.'' ...  &UR; Christy O'Connor Jr. &LR;  lost his 17-year-old son,
 &UR; Darren &LR; , &UR;  &LR; in a car accident a week ago Sunday in Ireland's County
Galway, where his father helped build and operate a golf course
that overlooks Galway Bay. Christy Jr. is remembered for beating
 &UR; Fred Couples  &LR; in the decisive match at the Ryder Cup at The Belfry
in 1989 ... The US lineup for the men's team for the World Amateur
Team Championship in Chile (Nov. 19-22) is headed by reigning US
Amateur champion  &UR; Hank Kuehne  &LR; and 1997 champion  &UR; Matt Kuchar &LR; , the
latter a popular presence at the Masters and US Open who opted to
return to Georgia Tech rather than turn pro.

OFFICIALLY SPEAKING, THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While millionaires battle millionaires over the way to
disperse millions, the NBA referees, arguably the most impacted,
voiceless group in this whole unseemly lockout mess, sit on the
sidelines and pray for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, they have no stance, no say, no position. They
technically are employees of the NBA, but dissidents in Iraq have
more freedom to speak. Their income could be directly affected if
games are lost, and few, if any, of the 58 referees have the
financial freedom of the players, not to mention the team owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people with mortgages to pay and monthly nuts to
crack,'' says Howard Pearl, the general counsel for the National
Basketball Referees Association. ``These people need the income.
This (the lockout) affects them profoundly, but they play no role
in it and have no position on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl and the NBRA executive board met last month in New York
with NBA officials and came back with promises that the officials
will receive their Oct. 1 paychecks. There is no ``lockout
language'' in the standard referee's contract. According to Pearl,
the baseball umpires had such language and received checks during
the play stoppage in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Most referees get paid every two weeks over the course of the
calendar year, with the new pay period starting on Oct. 1. Their
salaries range, according to Pearl, from a low of $80,000 to a high
of around $200,000. In other words, the highest-paid referee
receives less money than a minimum-wage player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no further news from New York regarding the
status of the Oct. 15 checks, although a league source indicated
that the referees were told they would not be cut off without
adequate notice. The league declined to comment on the issue,
saying it does not speak about salary matters regarding its
employees. Meanwhile, the referees have been sent two 50-question
tests to keep them mentally involved, but the opening of their
training camp, Sept. 25 in New Jersey, has been put on hold. They
anticipate they will be given two weeks to get in game shape once
the lockout ends, which is likely what the players will receive as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl, who has been general counsel for more than one year, said
he is satisfied with the way the NBA is handling the matter. ``I'm
impressed, beyond belief, with the NBA and its smarts, its
intelligence, and its willingness to do the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referees are entering the fourth year of a five-year deal with
the league. The last time their deal was up, they missed games
because of a labor impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl also is trying to get clemency and reinstatement for the
several referees who have run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service
for alleged income tax evasion, though he said, ``Like everything
else, that issue is on hold until the lockout ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials can only hope that their salaries don't get put on
hold as well, because it could mean a longer, colder winter than
any trip they might have to make to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the officials, most player contracts don't start until
November, which means that there is little incentive for anyone to
settle the lockout until then. If you're a player, why push the
envelope so you can have two-a-days and then have to play
exhibition games in Huntsville, Kalispell, or Flagstaff?
</P>
<P>
   The league and the union have finished their presentations _ six
days of testimony _ to arbitrator  &UR; John Feerick  &LR; over whether
players with guaranteed contracts should get paid during a lockout.
(You can pretty much figure out which side thinks they should.)
Both sides have until Friday to present additional briefs and then
Feerick has up to 30 days to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the league agree on one thing: Feerick will try to
make the decision in as short a time as possible. (Feerick's
reputation is to render a decision that should please everyone,
meaning he likely will rule that anything  &UR; Michael Jordan  &LR; says and
does is OK.) If he rules for the union, the league will go to court
and that could add even more down time. If he rules for the league,
the union will then double back and negotiations should renew.
However, the union has seen nothing from the league that doesn't
include a ``hard cap,'' and the players are not inclined to accept
that.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to keep in mind: When this does end, it will probably
take at least a month to get the games going. Teams and free agents
will likely be given a couple weeks to get deals done, and then
there should be a two-week training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is a small group of players, including the
Celtics'  &UR; Greg Minor &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who are still receiving paychecks for the
1997-98 season. Union attorney  &UR; Ron Klempner  &LR; said it is a ``small
percentage'' of the players who choose a 12-month payment schedule;
the others are on a November-April pay schedule. ``The vast
majority of the players don't get paid until Nov. 15,'' Klempner
said. As of now, around 30 players have not been paid for services
to be rendered for the upcoming season. They had clauses in their
contracts providing for lump sum payments prior to the start of the
season ... Tough summer for  &UR; Christian Laettner &LR; . First, he loses
an all-expense-paid trip to Monaco and Athens as a member of USA
Basketball's World Championship team when the NBA players elected
not to go after the league imposed the lockout. Then, he blew out
an Achilles' in a pickup game last week at Duke. Whatever plans he
had for this season are now on hold. Laettner had surgery at Duke
University Hospital and has returned to his Atlanta home to
convalesce. Luckily for him, he had paid the premiums on his
insurance and so the medical costs were covered. ``In a situation
like this (lockout), every player has the option to pick up the
premiums,'' said Laettner's agent,  &UR; Herb Rudoy &LR; . In this case, not
only is there a lockout, but Laettner also was a free agent. ``I
make sure all of my guys do and I'm certain everyone else does
too,'' said Rudoy. ``It makes sense.'' As for the operation, Rudoy
said Laettner would likely have had it in the same spot had it been
elective. ``He's very comfortable with the people at Duke, so,
given the fact that he is a free agent, that is where he probably
would have had it anyway.'' ... New Bucks coach  &UR; George Karl  &LR; said
he was very close to accepting a position with TNT for this season,
but the network insisted on having a no-coaching clause in the
deal. ``If I had signed it,'' he said recently in Milwaukee, ``they
would not have allowed me to coach this year.'' Karl found out
about the Bucks' interest during a recent trip to Hong Kong. He
said he got a phone call at 2:30 a.m. from owner  &UR; Herb Kohl's
 &LR; office, informing him that ``the Senator'' (as Kohl likes to be
called) would be calling in a half-hour. Karl's response: ``No
problem.'' Karl said he hopes to bring assistants  &UR; Tim Grgurich
 &LR; and  &UR; Terry Stotts  &LR; with him, but one individual who isn't planning
on making the move anytime soon is his wife,  &UR; Cathy &LR; . She's staying
back in Seattle for the time being with their 15-year-old son,
 &UR; Coby &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is on the golf team and is already in school ... The
Miami Heat are apparently re-thinking their decision regarding the
sale of season tickets. The Heat have traditionally avoided smaller
packages in favor of the whole enchilada. But last season, coming
off a year in which they were in the conference finals, Miami had
just 24 sellouts. Who can tell what attendance will be this season
without  &UR; Gary Grant  &LR; and  &UR; Willie Anderson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; both of whom decided
to take the overseas money and run? Grant landed a job in Greece
while Anderson found employment with Maccabi-Tel Aviv, which was
supposed to play the Heat in an exhibition, but the game was
canceled last week.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you're the plaintiff's lawyers, don't you think you might ask
for a change of venue? Then again, with Jordan as the defendant, is
there anywhere he isn't an instant celebrity? Incredibly, a jury
(not necessarily of his financial peers) will soon begin hearing
evidence in Chicago against Jordan, who is accused of breach of
contract by the makers of the movie ``Heaven is a Playground.''
Finding a jury might be the hardest task of all; the first day,
five hours of selection yielded only three jurors. The lawsuit,
filed five years ago, says Jordan signed on with the filmmakers in
1988 for $350,000 plus 5 percent of the profits. He was to play a
role in the film about a basketball player _ surprise! _ who is
trying to get his game back. Jordan returned a $50,000 up-front fee
he received and has filed a counterclaim saying he had been
deceived about the film's financing. He and his agent,  &UR; David
Falk &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who also is a defendant (the two are joined at the business
hip), also say the contract they did sign was not binding. The
lawsuit seeks as much as $20 million in damages, which is what the
filmmakers claim the movie, which starred  &UR; Bo Kimble  &LR; instead of
Jordan, would have made had Michael participated. Jordan plans to
be in court for the duration of the trial, which could take up to
three weeks, and has drawn laughs from prospective jurors when
asked by the judge to introduce himself. He has, however, been
accorded a privilege or two by being allowed to enter the courtroom
by way of a back elevator and through the judge's chambers.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was never a sense of panic on the Boston College sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Rutgers took the lead on a 56-yard strike from
quarterback Mike McMahon to wideout Bill Powell 1:12 into the game.
Nor when the Scarlet Knights scored their last touchdown, on a
serpentine 28-yard interception return by defensive back Reggie
Stephens, cutting BC's lead to 20-14 with 2:41 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The mood on BC's bench? Fairly casual. Something along the lines
of ``What, me worried? Fahgettaboutit!'' To a man, the Eagles never
had a single shred of doubt about the outcome of Saturday's 41-14
victory because they knew it was going to take more than a
touchdown _ or two _ to beat them, let alone rattle them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had in last week's 41-31 season-opening victory at
Georgia Tech, the Eagles responded to adversity with a balanced
offensive attack and a hard-nosed defensive effort to win _ going
away _ after scoring 21 unanswered points, including 14 in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's much better to play and win the way we did than
just blow them out and get the game over by the end of the first
quarter,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien, whose team improved to 2-0
overall and 1-0 in Big East before 38,287 at Alumni Stadium. ``It
makes you a better football team in the long run and it keeps their
attention and keeps us playing. We responded to adversity and we
kept playing, and that's a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he added, ``we were able to make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, quarterback Scott Mutryn and
tailback Mike Cloud, who remained tied for the team scoring lead
(24 points apiece), paced a balanced offense that rolled up 486
yards of total offense against the Scarlet Knights. The defense,
meanwhile, overcome a couple of early lapses and held Rutgers to 81
yards offense in the second half, 271 overall (53 rushing).
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn completed 17 of 30 passes for 218 yards. He had two
interceptions, but scored on runs of 2 and 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Scott did a good job,'' O'Brien said. ``I don't think
our pass protection was as good as I would've liked (evidenced by
the two sacks Rutgers rang up), and he had to take off and run the
ball a little more than he did (last week). Both interceptions were
not his fault. The receiver didn't come back on the first one and
the second ball bounces off (Quinton Lee's) hands. He's doing what
he's supposed to do with the football; the guys helping him out
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't rush for 200 yards, as he did against Georgia
Tech, Cloud accumulated 201 all-purpose yards, rushing 27 times for
156 yards and scoring on runs of 2 and 6 yards. He also had three
catches for 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were too relaxed in the first half. We were still
coming off that high from that Georgia Tech win,'' said Cloud.
``When they scored (making it 20-14), we had to make adjustments
and we had to go stick it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   After rallying from the 7-0 deficit to score 20 unanswered
points _ on 2-yard runs by Cloud and Mutryn and a field goals of 23
and 33 yards by junior John Matich _ BC saw its 20-7 halftime lead
shrink to 6 points on Stephens's interception return. That's when
the Eagles _ or, more precisely, Cloud _ rose up and delivered the
knockout blow by responding with a seven-play, 80-yard touchdown
drive that made it 27-14 with 52 seconds left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud gained 73 yards on the scoring march, including 67 on the
first four plays _ a 1-yard run, an 18-yard catch and back-to-back
runs of 25 and 23 yards. After Lee came in for a 7-yard gain, Cloud
capped it with a 6-yard burst.
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn then scored on a 21-yard keeper and Lee notched a 4-yard
TD that made it 41-14 after McMahon, who was pressed into emergency
duty at punter when starter Charlie Titus suffered a facial
laceration, was tackled by Joe Mickens at the Rutgers 12 on an
ill-advised fake punt attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the guys on the sideline after we scored the 41st
point that it said a lot about this team as a unit,'' said Mutryn.
``When our backs were against the wall when it was 20-14, in years
past teams here would've folded and faded. It was gut-check time
and we went down and had a great drive with the offensive line and
with Mike running the ball tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a telling moment for this team, and it could
be pivotal moment for this team,'' he added. ``When things were
down, and it looked pretty bleak, guys just stepped up and started
making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   No panic. No worries. No problems.

PEARCE A BIG HIT FOR WOMEN'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was her college's all-time leading scorer, with 79 goals and
54 assists in 80 games. Yes, 79 goals in 80 games. In her senior
year, she ranked third in the nation in scoring. Nine times her
goal was the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Christie Pearce's coach called her to the front of the
team bus after a game in late 1996 and presented her with a letter
from the US women's national soccer team inviting her to camp, she
thought it was a gag.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it was her basketball coach, after a basketball
game. That was her main sport, the one that was paying her way to
college. For another, Monmouth University, in West Long Branch,
N.J., was hardly a school to which the national team reflexively
turned for new players. Had Mia Hamm gone to school there? Julie
Foudy? Michelle Akers? Christie Pearce didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no joke, and Saturday Pearce scored her fifth career
goal as the US team defeated Mexico, 9-0, in the first game of the
US Women's Cup at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was getting called up because I did something
wrong,'' said Pearce, 23, recalling her thoughts as she was handed
that prized letter. ``I didn't tell anyone at first, because I
didn't know if it was for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Her skepticism was well-grounded. When asked Saturday how many
women from low-profile soccer schools make his team, US coach Tony
DiCicco answered quickly: ``It doesn't happen often.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was for real, and so is Pearce, who since her first
international match in February 1997 has played in 33 more on her
way to becoming a strong tackler with speed who gives the US team
much-needed depth on the back line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her athletic ability is unbelievable,'' said Carla Overbeck,
who plays with her in the back. ``She's quick, she's fast, she's
just a great addition to our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco was wowed by that ability the first time he saw Pearce
play a couple of years ago, after getting a tip that unheralded
Monmouth would be bringing a diamond in the rough to its match
against Central Connecticut, near DiCicco's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the best athlete on the field,'' DiCicco remembers.
``She has a great attitude to be coached. She wants to get better.
She's the fastest player right now on the team. These are the
things that separate you from other players.''
</P>
<P>
   Even other players from schools such as perennial national
champion North Carolina, which sent seven former players to
Sunday's game and has plenty more where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' Pearce acknowledged. ``All I
knew was that this was the best team in the world. North Carolina,
Notre Dame, Portland _ these girls all had high-level training
through college. I figured I would just get my fitness up so I
could run with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Overbeck understands why Pearce might have been feeling
intimidated, even putting aside the 1996 Olympic gold medal and
1991 world championship. ``This team has been together, the
majority of us, for 10 years,'' she said. ``We're all grown up
together. Coming in, you very obviously have your doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pearce was received warmly, and soon began playing soccer as
if it were ... well, as if it were basketball, in which she had
scored 2,190 career points at Point Pleasant Boro High School and
as a senior was named New Jersey Female Athlete of the Year by the
New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball ``was definitely my main focus'' in those days, she
said. Even in her last year at Monmouth, she was the starting point
guard for the Hawks in the games she didn't have to skip for
national team soccer duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoyed soccer growing up, but never thought I was
that good at it, to excel to the next level,'' she said. Having not
played on US soccer's under-20 team or measured her talent in any
other developmental program, she was surprised to stick with the
team: When she left for home after that first camp, she figured
that even if she was never asked back, at least she had had a great
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a thrill,'' she said. ``I was 21 when I came here
and I knew little about the game. I never enjoyed soccer like I do
now.''

MCGWIRE HAS NOTABLE COUNTERPARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire's surge past Roger Maris was every bit as
inevitable as it was impressive. He had long since made it a
``when'' proposition _ rather than an ``if'' _ robbing the moment
of some drama. After all, Maris broke the record on the final day
of the 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Maris's moment, there have been other individual
accomplishments so out of the ordinary that they warrant
recognition for both drama and achievement. Bob Beamon's long jump
of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches in the 1968 Olympics at Mexico City comes
to mind, even though Mike Powell (29-4 1/2, 1991, Tokyo) has since
broken his world record. What was so astounding about Beamon's jump
was that it broke the record in an event of inches by nearly 2
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Another would be Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game; until that
night, no one had scored more than 78 points in an NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   But many of sports' record-breaking achievements fall into the
category of McGwire's 62d homer: They were destined to happen. Hank
Aaron's 715th homer and Cal Ripken's 2,131st consecutive game are
examples of this. Or, to go further back into sports history, there
was Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute barrier in the mile.
In each instance, it was just a matter of when the record would
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three notable achievements in the last 44
years. In each instance, the words are from the individual's
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; May 6, 1954, Oxford, England &QC; 
 &LR;  Roger Bannister already was a runner of some fame. He had been a
competitive middle-distance runner since 1946, juggling training
and racing with his desire to enter medicine.
</P>
<P>
   By the time 1954 arrived, Bannister, who would turn 25 in March,
already had decided that it would be his last year of racing. To
that point, his best effort at breaking what had been considered
the unbreakable wall of four minutes for a mile had been 4:02,
which he had run the previous summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister had not run a race in eight months when he took the
morning train from London to prepare for the evening running of the
mile at a track meet in Oxford. He had decided to go for the record
that day, using two teammates as pacesetters. But the windy weather
almost made him change his plans. He figured he needed to run a
3:56 mile _ six seconds faster than his previous best _ to make up
for the wind.
</P>
<P>
   But by race time, the winds had died down and Bannister decided
it was time. As he approached the finish, Bannister wrote in ``Four
Minute Mile,'' his 1955 autobiography, ``I leapt at the tape like a
man taking his last spring to save himself from the chasm that
threatens to engulf him.'' He finished in 3:59.4, not knowing the
actual time because the crowd's cheers drowned out the final part
of the historic announcement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; March 2, 1962, Hershey, Pa. &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To say that Wilt Chamberlain might have had an excuse for a
subpar night (by his standards, anyway) in this neutral-site game
between his Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks would be
a monumental understatement. No one explains it better than the man
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He had a date ``with a fine young lady,'' which, he said,
resulted in him staying up all night. He then caught an 8 a.m.
train from New York, where he lived, to Philadelphia and had little
time to rest as the team bus headed to Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, still without sleep, Chamberlain ran into
some friends from the Philadelphia traveling party in an arcade. He
broke records for a particular riflery game and, looking back,
regards it as an omen.
</P>
<P>
   This was Chamberlain's third year in the NBA, and he was as
dominating on offense as any player has ever been. He averaged 50.4
points a game, still a shuddering thought. In addition to his
100-point game that year, he had games of 78, 73, 67 (twice), 65
(twice), 62 (twice), and 61 (three times).
</P>
<P>
   There were only 4,104 in attendance for that encounter between
the Knicks and Warriors. Chamberlain was 36 for 63 from the field
and an uncharacteristic 28 for 32 from the foul line. He had
``only'' 41 points at the half, then came out in the third quarter
and scored 28 more. He added the final 31 in the fourth, making 12
of 21 field goals. With the crowd egging him on, and despite
freezing efforts by the Knicks, he hit 100 with a dunk in the final
minute. When the game ended, a 169-147 Philadelphia win, he was
mobbed by his teammates. He also had 25 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Chamberlain doesn't rate this historic performance
as his proudest basketball achievement. ``I'm a lot prouder of my
NBA record of 55 rebounds in one game than I am of the 100
points,'' he wrote in ``Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black
Millionaire Who Lives Next Door.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; April 8, 1974, Atlanta &QC; 
 &LR;  Hank Aaron said he received more than 900,000 pieces of mail in
1973. According to his 1991 book, ``I Had A Hammer,'' that was more
than any non-politician in the country. Dinah Shore was second. She
received 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mail was vicious, addressed simply, ``Dear Nigger.''
At one point, the FBI was opening everything, as Aaron received
countless death threats. He truly detested his historic run at Babe
Ruth's career homer rec-ord of 714, writing, ``I'm proud of the
home run record, but I don't like to talk about it because it
brings back too many unpleasant memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron knew early in 1973 that he would likely break the record.
The only pressure he felt early that season, he said, stemmed from
concern that he would either be injured or that his batting average
would dramatically drop. ``I had never been a one-dimensional
hitter and I didn't want to be one at the moment history came
knocking,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The hate mail started arriving in 1973 as Aaron approached the
heretofore unapproach-able mark. Rednecks, racists, and just plain
ignorant people warned him not to dare pass the Babe. Only when he
went public with the sheer viciousness of the mail was there a
change in the tone. He kept a lot of the nasty ones and said the
hate mail motivated him.
</P>
<P>
   There were kidnapping threats against his daughter, then a
college student in Nashville. He was assigned a bodyguard and had
to register at hotels under an alias, now an accepted way of travel
for sports celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Having ended 1973 with 713 homers, he survived the offseason and
another media/letter onslaught in spring training 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves opened that year with three games in Cincinnati, and
Mathews wanted to keep Aaron out of the lineup so the slugger could
break the record when the team returned to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, no fan of Aaron's, ordered the Braves
to play him in at least two games. Aaron homered off Jack
Billingham in the season opener, tying Ruth, and then had an
uneventful second game. The Braves returned to Atlanta to face the
Dodgers, and Aaron quickly broke the record with a homer off Al
Downing.
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped for a ceremony, and Aaron summed up the
whole experience with four meaningful words: ``Thank God it's
over.'' He retired with 755 home runs, still the all-time record.

 &HT;    Feeling the Philly heat
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Ray Rhodes and the Philadelphia Eagles are trapped
and gasping for air. It might be impossible for an NFL coach's
stock to sink this low this early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Rhodes seemed surprisingly calm over the past week after
last Sunday's 38-0 drubbing by Seattle. It was the worst home
opener in club history, dating to 1933, and given Philadelphia's
passionate and raucous sports fans, Rhodes probably feels lucky to
have escaped Veterans Stadium alive.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has read the rampant speculation that his days are
numbered. More than one analogy has been drawn by the Philly media
between the Titanic, the ill-fated ocean liner that sank in 1912,
and the Eagles. And on radio and television, fans are speculating
that Rhodes will not survive his fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play as bad, as poorly, as we played Sunday, the fans
have a right to be mad at our football team, mad at me, mad at our
organization,'' Rhodes said. ``We did not give them a good product.
It's up to me and our players to get this thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rhodes was hired in 1995, there was much talk about the
intensity the former Packers and 49ers defensive coordinator would
bring. For a while, it worked. The Eagles went 10-6, and he was NFL
coach of the year. They also went 10-6 in '96.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the Eagles finished the season by going 2-5-1,
including a 20-17 loss in Atlanta, and ended up with a 6-9-1
overall record. In the offseason, Tom Modrak, former Steelers
director of college scouting, was hired as director of football
operations. It took away much of Rhodes' power on draft day and
sent a message.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes also has taken heat for letting players go, including
linebacker Bill Romanowski (1995), defensive end William Fuller
('96) and running back Ricky Watters ('97).
</P>
<P>
   But Rhodes says he is oblivious to what's being said about him,
and, unlike some times in the past, he hasn't gotten defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about job situations or speculation about being
here or not being here,'' he said. ``That doesn't add any pressure
to anything I do. Through most of my career, I've worked on
one-year contracts, and I've never been concerned with that.''

 &HT;    Falcons keep eyes on prize
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Dan Reeves knows this situation first-hand. He knows
some folks are giddy about the possibility of the Atlanta Falcons
getting off to a 2-0 start for the first time since 1986. He knows
fans and players alike look at the opponent in today's home opener,
the Eagles, and lick their chops.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, after all, have won seven of their last nine, and
six of seven. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia story is ugly. The Eagles
got steamrolled 38-0 at home last week by the Seahawks, their
lockerroom reportedly is as uptight as it's been in coach Ray
Rhodes' four years, they gave up nine sacks last week, passed for
12 yards, and probably will play three rookie cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves knows looks can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on a team that lost 38-0 and went to the Super
Bowl,'' Reeves said, recalling when he was a player-coach on the
1970 Dallas Cowboys squad that lost 38-0 at home to the Cardinals
on Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   That team won 41-28 at Washington the next week, beat defending
Super Bowl champion Green Bay the following week and won five more
consecutive games before losing 16-13 to the Colts in Super Bowl V.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why every day we've been preaching to (players) how
important it is to play well yourself, and not worry about what
your opposition does,'' Reeves said. There will be intrigue at the
Georgia Dome, where the crowd should be around 45,000. Like the
Eagles, the Falcons last week had trouble with the blitz, as Chris
Chandler was sacked six times at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Hugh Douglas usually plays right defensive end,
but could switch sides and end up opposite rookie right tackle
Ephraim Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Falcon rookie cornerback Elijah Williams, a running
back for three years at Florida before switching to defense, may
play running back.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Falcons will try to run. When Atlanta beat the
Eagles 20-17 last year, the Falcons ran for a season-high 211
yards. Last week, the Seahawks ran for 188 against Philly. And,
running back Jamal Anderson said, they'll concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were a team for so long, and may still be, that
teams around the NFL take lightly ... it would be absurd for us to
take a team lightly,'' he said. ``Taking Philadelphia lightly is
not an option.''

ANGELS FOES ARE ARMED AND DANGEROUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In the past couple weeks, the Anaheim Angels have
faced opposing pitchers like Andy Pettitte, David Wells, David
Cone, Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield, Bartolo Colon, Tim Belcher and
Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   In this series with Baltimore the Angels already have faced
Scott Erickson and Mike Mussina, two quality pitchers even though
the Orioles are out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no short cuts any place worth going,'' pitcher Chuck
Finley said. ``I've been in their (Orioles') situation too many
times where they're trying to be the spoiler. They're not going to
bring up triple-A guys to finish the season. They'll keep giving
those guys (Erickson and Mussina) the ball and you better be ready
to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George Brett and I just talked about that the other day,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``It's all part of the game.
You've got to beat those guys. Either you're going to be good
enough ... if you are good enough, you'll beat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast recovery: First baseman Darin Erstad is making a rapid
recovery from his strained left hamstring and hopes to be ready in
time for the series against Texas Wednesday and Thursday. Collins
said it's doubtful he'd put Erstad back in the lineup by then, but
he said he might consider using him as a pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   No off days: The Angels don't have any more off days through the
end of the regular season, and it's a good thing for them. Since
the All-Star break, the Angels are 0-7 in games following an off
day. Thursday's off day this past week was their fourth in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are ready, they're pumped,'' Collins said. ``Then all
of a sudden the schedule has off-day after off-day. We don't want
that. I really believe routine is important in baseball. It's the
time of year you've got to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ejection: Third base coach Larry Bowa was ejected from the game
in the bottom of the first inning Saturday for arguing balls and
strikes with home plate umpire Rick Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Collins took over the third-base coaching duties from the second
inning on.
</P>
<P>
   Martin starts: Paco Martin started at third base Saturday
because he was 6-for-16 lifetime against Orioles starter Mike
Mussina. It was the third consecutive game Troy Glaus was not in
the starting lineup. Against Mussina on Saturday, Martin went
1-for-3.

MCGWIRE NOT JUST SLAP-HAPPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CINCINNATI _ The man who now ranks as the most prolific
slugger in baseball history is an adherent of a batting style that
often has been scorned for spawning slap hitters.
</P>
<P>
   True, Mark McGwire never met the late Charlie Lau, a hitting
guru of the '70s and early '80s. But, indirectly, McGwire is Lau's
star pupil _ and so what if Babe Ruth and Roger Maris might roll
over in their graves?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who on Tuesday became baseball's single-season home run
champion when he hit his 62d, is a Lau disciple by way of Carney
Lansford. The former Red Sox third baseman is listed as the St.
Louis Cardinals' bench coach, but one of his main priorities is to
scrutinize McGwire's swing in search of flaws. Obviously, he hasn't
found many lately.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Lau-McGwire connection is even a bit more
indirect. Lansford is a protege of former Red Sox batting coach
Walt Hriniak, who espoused the same basic principles as did Lau.
Hriniak was a Red Sox coach from 1977-88, and Lansford was one of
his star pupils. His two-year stay in Boston was highlighted by his
American League batting championship in 1981, when he hit .336. He
batted .310 the following year but was traded after the season to
make room for Wade Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Lansford developed into one of the game's premier
No. 2 hitters, batting behind Rickey Henderson. He retired in 1992
with a .290 lifetime average and served as a part-time coach under
Tony La Russa with Oakland in 1994 and '95. After a year's hiatus,
he joined La Russa in St. Louis as infield coach. When McGwire _
his former teammate in Oakland _ came over from the A's last
season, Lansford became his tutor.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has adopted the best of Lau's teachings, says Lansford.
It's not as if he has employed all of Lau's tenets _ swinging down
on the ball, striving to hit it up the middle, releasing the top
hand on the follow-through, and keeping the head down. In fact,
McGwire swings hard; he has more home runs (62) than singles (54).
But his head stays steady and his eye is so sharp that he has set a
National League record with 152 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people misunderstood Charlie and Walt,'' said
Lansford. ``They see the flailing away and the hits up the middle
and think that's what it is all about. It isn't. It's about
discipline. It's about keeping your head down and using all fields.
The worst thing a hitter can do is pull his head off the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire acknowledged that he was stubborn as a young player. He
had 49 homers as a rookie in 1987 and thought it was easy. In the
years since, he has become an even better hitter partially because
of the supervision he gets from Lansford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little drills that I used to hate to do in college and the
minor leagues finally sank in,'' said McGwire. ``I see my stroke as
a young player (compared) to where it is now, and it's totally
different. It's because of the work I've done. I get full
extension. The T-ball work and the soft toss I've done over the
last couple of years has brought me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansford says the difference in McGwire is almost like night and
day. ``For a big man _ and that is what he is _ he really shows a
lot patience,'' he said. ``He does hit the ball up the middle _ a
long way. He even lets go with that top hand, which is what gives
him more extension. But he's never heard of Charlie Lau or Walt
Hriniak. It's something he came up with on his own. He's just a
great hitter.''

UCLA MAKES SOME HISTORY IN BEATING TEXAS AGAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was not 66-3, but it was enough for UCLA
to make some history of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Almost one year to the day that UCLA handed Texas its worst home
loss, quarterback Cade McNown passed for 339 yards and three
touchdowns to guide the sixth-ranked Bruins to a 49-31 victory over
the No.22 Longhorns. In winning its first opener since 1995, UCLA
also set a school record with its 11th consecutive victory, a
streak that started with last season's drubbing of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole goal was to win the first game, and we're very happy
that we did that,'' UCLA Coach Bob Toledo said. ``My goal has
always been to win the Pac-10 and eventually compete for the
national championship, and we're on pace right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose bowl was packed with 73,070 fans hoping to see a
Heisman trophy showdown between McNown and tailback Ricky Williams
of Texas. It never materialized as McNown passed for 222 yards and
two touchdowns in the first half to help UCLA build a 35-3 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, a senior, had his way with the Texas defense, nimbly
sidestepping would-be tacklers and completing 20 passes in 30
attempts and throwing a 79-yard scoring strike to flanker Freddie
Mitchell with 7 minutes 39 seconds to go to put the game away.
McNown guided his team to five touchdowns in six first-half
possessions, and 379 yards in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to make some big plays, and certainly we have
the players capable of doing it,'' McNown said. ``We have a lot of
work to do, but we can improve. And the great thing is that all the
guys in the locker room know we can improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of defense was a concern for the first-year Texas
coach, Mack Brown. After all, his team gave up 36 points to New
Mexico State last week while winning by 30. But this was not New
Mexico State; this was a top-10 team with several offensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And they were all on display, as split end Brian Poli-Dixon
caught five passes for 78 yards and two touchdowns while flanker
Danny Farmer had four catches for 81 yards and a touchdown.
Mitchell finished with four catches for 108 yards. The Bruins
amassed 584 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gained 160 yards on 29 carries to become Texas' career
rushing leader, passing Earl Campbell. But in the first half, he
was not even the best tailback on the field. That honor went to
UCLA's Jermaine Lewis, who in his first game as Skip Hicks'
successor rushed for 71 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did score three fourth-quarter touchdowns, the third
one with 5:07 remaining to pull the Longhorns within 42-31. But
Williams' efforts were not enough as Texas had to play from behind
all game.
</P>
<P>
   After UCLA took a 21-3 lead in the opening minutes, the rout
continued in the second quarter as McNown hit Farmer on the right
sideline for a 25-yard pass play that put UCLA up by 28-3 with 3:39
left in the half. Two and a half minutes later, McNown struck
again, lofting a 20-yard pass to Poli-Dixon in the left corner of
the end zone to make it 35-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored on the first possession of the second half on a
17-yard run by fullback Ricky Brown just 1:44 into the third
quarter. But Williams' fumble on the UCLA 33-yard line set up a
3-yard scoring scamper by tailback DeShaun Foster to make it 42-10
with 8:10 left in the third quarter. &QL;

   ``We played with more confidence and we started looking more
like a team in the second half,'' Brown said.

 &HT;    Is this team ready for the playoffs?
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The question: How have you been throwing for the last
month?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-handed?'' Greg Maddux answered, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   That, too. But seriously, folks ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Inconsistent,'' Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes. For most of the last month, Maddux has been inconsistent,
at least by his Cy Young standards. In describing his pitching
performance in recent weeks _ one win and a 6.58 ERA in his last
four starts _ Maddux could have also been speaking for all the
Braves. Inconsistent. Inopportune at bat, especially with men in
scoring position. Individualistic. And indifferent to the calendar,
which shows the playoffs fast approaching, and the growing Astros
menace.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed, prompting Thursday's pregame, players-only
meeting in Montreal. That, and the fact the Braves had lost 10 of
12 games, their worst stretch of ball since late in the 1996
season, when they dropped 11 of 13. That team then won 10 of its
next 15 games, the NL East, the pennant and the first two games of
the World Series before the Yankees nightmare. This team began the
healing process with a meeting, then a solid 7-4 win over the
Expos, who fell 36 games behind Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think team meetings are the end-all cure-all,'' said
Tom Glavine, who called this one. ``No guarantee you're going to
win that night. Whenever you're in a rut like that, there's things
going on that guys don't like. You get all that out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we didn't win, we got everything all square. And we
played with some intensity, more than we'd been in this skid. That
was most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Maddux makes his 32nd start of the season, against the
poor Marlins. It's his 13th since the All-Star break, when he ended
the season's first half 12-2, with a 1.54 ERA and a lock on his
fifth Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, Maddux is just 5-6 with a 3.34 ERA. (His
1997 second-half stats: 8-1, 2.02 ERA.)
</P>
<P>
   His overall ERA is now 2.20, the highest it's been since 2.41 on
May 6. All this after he lost 6-3 last Tuesday in Montreal; in
seven innings, he allowed six hits and six runs (five earned),
walked four and threw a wild pitch. Yet Maddux, after allowing four
first-inning runs, retired the last 11 Expos in order and struck
out nine.
</P>
<P>
   He was encouraged by that outing. Still, ``My location's been
inconsistent,'' said Maddux, as reliant on location as a real
estate agent. ``But I've felt good. My stuff's been all right but
my location hasn't been where I want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Have his pitches been up, as they were on Aug. 23 and Sept. 2,
when L.A. and Houston each hit three homers (the first three-homer
games of Maddux's big-league career)? ``Both,'' Maddux said. ``Up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three-homer games were cause for alarm. Certainly, public
alarm. ``I just think a lot of times, people focus on results,''
Maddux said. ``I pitched pretty good against the Cardinals (Aug.
29) and didn't win (a no-decision in a 5-4 loss). I thought I
pitched pretty good (Tuesday). I really did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pitch well against Houston. I gave up four runs (all
coming on homers), could've given up more. (On Tuesday), I gave up
six runs, could've given up one. I've never focused on results.''
Rather, as Maddux himself would say, he's just tryin' to make good
pitches, man.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Montreal meeting, the Braves have refocused
on the common good and are stifling a September swoon, lest it
become an early-October death spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Already the youngest player in major-league history to hit 20
home runs and steal 20 bases in a season, Andruw Jones was on a
home run tear (homering in four straight games on the road trip
and, at one point, five times in 18 at-bats). Returning home with
29 homers and 24 stolen bases, he's said he hopes to become the
youngest 30-30 player ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling big time,'' Javy Lopez said forlornly after
Wednesday's 3-2 loss. ``I'm one of the guys leaving guys in scoring
position. I haven't delivered yet.'' This in part because Lopez was
preoccupied with reaching the 100-RBI plateau for the first time in
his career _ just as he was eager to hit his 30th homer. ``I want
to get 100 RBIs so bad,'' he said Wednesday, ``every time I'm at
bat, I'm thinking about that.'' He was also worried about grounding
into a double play, which he's done a team-high 19 times. Both of
those factors contributed to Lopez's latest GIDP Wednesday, when he
swung at a 3-0 pitch on the outside corner and grounded into a
6-4-3 DP.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, it's good for me that it happened,'' Lopez
said in the aftermath. ``If I'm in that situation again, you can
bet it won't happen.'' On Thursday, with men on first and second
and one out, he finally got a hanging breaking ball and smacked a
three-run homer to give himself 101 RBIs and Atlanta a much-needed
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, even a 43-year-old grandfather with 244 victories got
a kick out of the win and a kick-start out of the meeting. ``I
think we needed something to remind ourselves we still have a
couple of weeks to go in the season,'' Dennis Martinez said. ``That
really kind of woke us up. We were able to go out and do what we do
best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't throw the switch on in the playoffs,'' said Ozzie
Guillen. ``You can't just turn it on and off.'' Yet it's not just
increased intensity, but better execution, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs, there's going to be a lot of 2-1 games, 3-2
games. Close games,'' Guillen said. ``We've got to win those.
There's not going to be a lot of guys on base. We've got to do
little things, move guys over, to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They also need Maddux to be his typical, right-handed self.
``There's only been one little area where he's been off,'' said
pitching coach Leo Mazzone. ``I don't want to tell you what; I
don't want other teams reading it. He corrected that in (Tuesday's)
game. He's looked good in a side session since.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mechanics look solid. He looks good. He's just off target
in one little area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too far,'' Maddux said, ``from where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, the Braves hope, are they.

 &HT;    Springer throws without discomfort, could land playoff bullpen
role
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Reliever Russ Springer doesn't feel like he has to
pitch his own way into October. It only seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   Springer made his first appearance Friday night since his right
elbow was drained 10 days ago and just his third appearance in the
past five weeks, and while he threw without elbow discomfort, the
Braves almost had to show him where the mound was.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got out there, I could tell it was going to be a
little funky,'' Springer said. He retired a man in the ninth but
allowed a hit and two walks to load the bases before Kerry
Ligtenberg took over. ``I can tell when I'm warming up, I'm not
throwing as hard as did last year... But if I can get out there and
get comfortable and locate the ball, I think the arm strength I
have is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer will have a bone spur in the elbow removed in the
offseason, but with the postseason bullpen unsettled, the Braves
need to know what Springer can offer in October.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bradford dies
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves pitcher Larry Bradford, 50, died Friday night of
an apparent heart attack suffered in the lobby of the team offices,
where he was waiting to take part in a ceremony saluting local
participants in Opportunities in Baseball, a national youth
program. Bradford pitched for the Braves in 1977 and then from
1979-81 during Bobby Cox's first managing stint with the club,
recording a 6-4 record with seven saves and a 2.51 ERA in 104 games
with the club. He settled in College Park after his playing career
and was active in south Atlanta youth athletic programs.
</P>
<P>
   System salute
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made their player- and pitcher-of-the-year awards for
their minor-league system before Saturday's game. Those winners
included: Richmond (Class AAA) RHP Jon Ratliff and 3B Wes Helms;
Greenville (AA) LHP Bruce Chen and OF George Lombard; Danville (A)
RHP Rob Bell and OF Tyrone Pendergrass; Macon (A) RHP William Fleck
and 2B Marcus Giles; Eugene (A) RHP Michael Corey and OF Jerry
Simmons; Danville (Rookie) LHP Justin Willoughby and 2B Rafael
Furcal; Gulf Coast (Rookie) LHP Jung Bong and OF Ryan Langerhans.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rudy Seanez reports no pain and has thrown at 60
percent the past two days as he rehabs for a slight muscle tear in
his right forearm.

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Today 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS, WSB (750 AM).
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (17-8, 2.20 ERA;
7-2, 2.08 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Jesus Sanchez (6-8, 4.68;
1-1, 2.70 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Braves were encouraged by Maddux's last outing, even
though he dropped consecutive starts for the first time this
season. In losing 6-3 in Montreal Tuesday, Maddux appeared to have
worked through the mechanical problems that had reduced the
movement on his fastball. Maddux retired the last 11 Expos he faced
in order and allowed just one infield single in the last four
innings. In his past four starts, Maddux has yielded a shocking 19
earned runs and 32 hits while walking eight in just 26 innings. At
the All-Star break, he was 12-2 with a 1.54 ERA and the
front-runner for a fifth Cy Young Award. In the second half, he is
5-6 with a 3.34 ERA. Sanchez was more than the Braves could handle
the last time they faced him, when the rookie shut them out for
eight innings in a 3-1 loss July 10 at Pro Player Stadium. Sanchez
allowed five hits while striking out five and limited the heart of
the order (Chipper Jones, Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez) to an
0-for-8 night. Sanchez is winless in his last five starts and has
been roughed up in his past two games, giving up 14 hits and 14
runs in 8 2/3 innings.

SINDEN KEEPING DISTANCE ON OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ Day One of training camp, with rookies already here
and veterans reporting for physicals, came and went with the
Bruins' Gang of Five nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's top scorer, Jason Allison, was a no-show, as were
Anson Carter, Kyle McLaren, Steve Heinze, and Ted Donato. It's
likely that Allison, Carter, and McLaren will be out for a while.
In the estimation of president/general manager Harry Sinden,
Allison is trying to hit a home run with his new contract after a
breakout season. Sinden thinks he should prove himself for more
than one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the year before?'' said Sinden. ``He went 44 or 45
games without a goal. We think he's a terrific prospect and his
turn will come to really capitalize, but he's not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources indicate that Allison would settle for a base salary of
$2.5 million, with incentives that could bring it to $3.5 million,
while the Bruins are offering $1.5 million. While Sinden has a
policy against discussing specific figures, he said Allison was
asking for twice as much as the team was offering and the club was
offering him twice as much as it really wanted to give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's asking for four times as much as we want to pay him,''
said Sinden. ``It sounds like a long, long, long battle. It's too
much too soon. We're hoping he comes around to our reality. The
worst thing he can do is not play. We'll call him `Jason Nedved.'''
</P>
<P>
   The club isn't as far apart on McLaren but the situation isn't
much better. McLaren is said to be asking for $1.7 million for this
year followed by $1.9 million and $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sinden, assistant GM Mike O'Connell had a
conversation Friday with agent Doug Messier, but it didn't get very
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 100 percent (apart) with Jason and we're about 80
percent with Kyle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Carter, Sinden said the club didn't even find out about
his specific demands until Friday. Sources say Carter is looking
for close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They waited all summer until the 11th hour and they want an
answer in 10 minutes,'' he said. ``Mike is contemplating it now,
but it's not anywhere near what we're interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   With three far apart and Donato waiting for a trade, Sinden said
he thought he had a deal with Heinze. Sinden said agent Steve
Mountain basically accepted an offer Friday but had to have it
verified by Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear back,'' said Sinden. ``I told him, `Don't call
me back unless it's to verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Bruins report they had a good summer, full of
vacations, golf, and relaxation. Not so for 30-year-old right wing
 &UR; Rob DiMaio &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who underwent not one, but two surgeries on his
nasal passages. DiMaio has had his nose broken and smashed many a
time, and the scar tissue inside his sinuses was hindering his
breathing, especially when he was trying to sleep. DiMaio first was
operated on at the beginning of June in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to take a piece of bone out of my head in order to
rebuild my nose,'' said DiMaio. ``It was kind of a pain in the
butt. But there was so much damage, that was the only way they
could do it. I was pretty much out of commission for a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me it could be swollen for up to a year. I had so
much scar tissue built up all through my sinuses. The doctor told
me he hadn't ever seen anything like that. It's not ever going to
be 100 percent, but for sleeping purposes it really helps me. That
was probably the biggest problem I had. Now to be able to get air
properly, it makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The original procedure took five hours but didn't quite do the
trick. The scar tissue began growing back six weeks after the first
operation, and DiMaio had to have scar tissue cut out of his
sinuses while he was on vacation in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sinuses had started to heal shut,'' he said. ``They had to
cut some tissue out, and that wasn't pleasant either. If I knew
then what I know now, I wouldn't have done it. I would've waited
until after (retirement) because it took so long to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio joked often last season about how he was lucky he was
already married because bumps, bruises, and broken noses weren't
the most attractive features. Now, while his sinuses are a little
puffy, the rebuilt nose is a significant improvement cosmetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's straighter,'' said DiMaio, who will wear a visor for at
least the next few months, ``and there's actually a nose there now
a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the knucklehead who broke into  &UR; Aaron Downey's  &LR; truck
didn't meet the 24-year-old right wing in an alley somewhere.
Downey, who recently re-signed with the Bruins, is as soft-spoken
and polite as anyone you'll meet off the ice. On the ice, he led
the AHL in penalty minutes with 407. But he was heartbroken on his
first night in Providence after returning from his offseason home.
Downey's truck had a window smashed and he lost his prized mountain
bike, golf clubs, a stereo system, and tapes ... Rumors continue to
abound in Montreal about the goalie situation. It's one of the only
cities where goaltenders are a bigger obsessive topic than Boston.
Some reports had the Habs trading for Toronto goalie  &UR; Felix Potvin
 &LR; or signing free agent  &UR; Sean Burke &LR; . Burke, however, is out of the
running after signing with a deal with Florida. The only one
ignoring the hoopla in Montreal is goalie  &UR; Jocelyn Thibault &LR; .
``This is Montreal and people are always talking about hockey,''
said Thibault, who played 47 games while sharing duties with the
now-retired  &UR; Andy Moog  &LR; last year. ``I'm sure there are people out
there losing sleep over who's going to be the goaltender, but I'm
not one of them. I have my contract and I always stay positive. If
I get traded, there's nothing I can do about it. If they bring in
someone else, I'll fight for my job, just like I have to do now.''
Reports out of Montreal say Thibault was offered to the Maple Leafs
as part of a package for Potvin earlier in the summer ... It
appears former Colorado coach  &UR; Marc Crawford &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who resigned in May
and was replaced by  &UR; Bob Hartley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; will be signing a deal with
``Hockey Night in Canada'' as a TV analyst for this season.
Crawford is also being sought after by an unnamed publication to
write a weekly column ... The Lightning, who will make the trek to
Austria for part of training camp, are top-heavy with goaltenders.
They have to decide between  &UR; Daren Puppa &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has played only 32
games the last two years because of a bad back;  &UR; Corey
Schwab &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who missed most of the year with an ankle injury; and
former Bruin  &UR; Bill Ranford &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who played only 22 games for
Washington because of a bad back and the emergence of  &UR; Olaf
Kolzig &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who led the Caps to the finals ...  &UR; John Cullen  &LR; is back
with the Lightning after agreeing to a two-way contract that will
pay him $500,000 if he makes the NHL club and $100,000 for playing
in the minors. If he reaches all his incentives, he could top out
at $1.1 million. However, if he's unable to return as a player
after a courageous battle with cancer, he could earn $110,000 as a
coach or radio analyst. Cullen said he's not sure how the physical
part of the game is going to go. ``That's one of the things I'm
nervous and anxious about,'' he said. ``When I start getting banged
around, I've got to see how my body takes that. And I know it's
going to happen. I mean, just because I had cancer, a guy's not
going to say, `Oh, gee, Cully, I'm not going to hit you.' I'm going
to be out there getting punched in the head and hit all the time.
That's the way I play.'' ... Goalie  &UR; Arturs Irbe  &LR; has signed a
one-year deal with Carolina. The unrestricted free agent played 41
games for the Canucks last year but didn't fit into Vancouver's
plans ... Former Northeastern goalie  &UR; Bruce Racine  &LR; signed with San
Jose. Racine, 32, played for the International League last year,
splitting his time with the Fort Wayne Komets and San Antonio
Dragons. He had a league-leading 34 victories and 1,663 saves ...
Former Bruin  &UR; Sergei Zholtok  &LR; has landed in Montreal. The
25-year-old, who was originally drafted by Boston in 1992 (No. 55
overall), was left unprotected by Ottawa in the expansion draft in
June and became a free agent when the Senators elected not to make
him a qualifying offer. He is scheduled to make $300,000 US ... Now
that  &UR; Petr Nedved  &LR; has changed agents, hopefully his new one will
help him get a clue. Nedved sat out all of last year in a contract
dispute with the Penguins. Now he has replaced  &UR; Tony Kondel  &LR; with
high-powered  &UR; Mike Barnett &LR; . No matter what agent he hires, he'll
never be worth the $4 million a year he desires, so he ought to
just deal with it ... Flames coach  &UR; Brian Sutter  &LR; said he won't
treat his 17-year-old son,  &UR; Shaun &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the youngest player in
training camp, any differently than the treats anyone else.
``Everybody asks me if it's difficult to coach my son,' said
Sutter, who also was behind the bench for Shaun's Triple A midget
team in Red Deer, Alberta, following his Bruins firing. ``I say,
`He's just another player once he starts.''' Coaching family
members is not new for Sutter. He coached his twin brothers,  &UR; Rich
 &LR; and  &UR; Ron &LR; , &UR;  &LR; in St. Louis. ``I don't care what their names are.
Once they step on the ice, they're on their own. It's like I said
to (Shaun): `Son, you got drafted on your own and you've got to
play on your own.' He's got more pressure on him than any other kid
coming to our camp because of his last name. I'm lucky; I've got no
pressure. He's the one with all the pressure. But you go to a game
and watch him play, he's in the middle of everything that goes on
and he's been like that since he was 8 years old.'' ... Former BU
standout  &UR; Chris Kelleher  &LR; has a legitimate shot to make the
Penguins. The defenseman has made an impression on  &UR; Greg
Malone &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Pittsburgh's head scout. ``It wouldn't surprise me if he
does step in here and maybe play a little bit,'' said Malone. ``If
he doesn't start the season here, there's always the opportunity to
go down and, by the half season or so, come back up. I wouldn't
count him out right now, just because of the way he handles the
puck and looks after his own zone.'' ... 27 days to opening night.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It will be an all-Australian affair.
</P>
<P>
   Defending US Open champion Patrick Rafter outlasted an ailing
Pete Sampras and serve-blasting Mark Philippoussis took out Carlos
Moya in Saturday's semifinals to set up the first all-Australian
final in the Open in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter upended Sampras, 6-7 (8-10), 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 and
Philippoussis beat Moya, 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, to earn their spots in
Saturday afternoon's 4 p.m. final. When last two Aussies met here,
Ken Rosewall beat Tony Roche _ now one of Rafter's advisors _ in a
four-set match for the 1970 title.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left Sampras short of another Aussie. Sampras earned
his 11th major title at Wimbledon this summer and is chasing the
record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles held by Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, a four-time winner here, stumbled on the way to the net
for a volley midway through the third set and strained his left
quad. His mobility was limited from that point on.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough position to be in against the always-attacking
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the injury, I just kind of had to go for it on my
returns and on my serves,'' Sampras said. ``I didn't want to get
into any long rallies. It was really my only alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury took something _ but not much _ off the win for
Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to take a win against Pete whenever I can get
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Injured while serving at 4-2, Sampras held on to win the third
set, but could not win another.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter broke Sampras's serve in the first game of the fourth set
and went on to win that one. He broke Sampras again in the opening
game of the final set. With Sampras serving and trailing, 5-3,
Rafter won four straight points, the last two on a forehand
crosscourt and a backhand down the line, to get back to the title
match.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had problems with his first serve in the early going,
but was able to gain a split of the first two sets by outlasting
Rafter in the tiebreaker. At 8-8, Sampras hit a forehand return
down the line. Then he made a great reach for a winning volley.
Rafter got the only service break of the second set in the third
game to even things.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, who had never made a Grand Slam semifinal, is
fulfilling the promise he showed when he served Sampras out of the
1996 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm 6 feet 4,'' Philippoussis said. ``When a guy
sees me coming to the net, I don't think it looks too good on his
side.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the match.
</P>
<P>
   Things certainly didn't look too good from Moya's side once the
match got going. He could do little with the serve of
Philippoussis. Could do little with any part of Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concentrated extremely well,'' Philippoussis said. ``I
applied the pressure on him. He felt the pressure. I just served
great, you know, on my service games and was consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a blip at the end of the third set after Moya had
changed his style to come to the net more and scrambled to force a
fourth set, the match belonged to Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, who survived three match points in a tiebreaker
in the semis, took advantage of most every chance he had. Three
times he had break points in the first two sets and three times he
converted. He even won points from the baseline against the French
Open champion and No. 10 seed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a great match and his serve was unbelievable,'' Moya
said. ``You just have to guess where the ball is going to go, and
pray, you know. Because even if you kmow where the ball is going,
it is not easy to put it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya, serving at 5-5 in the third set, fell into a love-40 hole.
He clawed back, surviving four match points.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis served to get it into a tiebreaker. And finally,
Moya caught a break. Philippoussis was up, 30-15, when he put a
volley into the net and then double faulted twice to give up the
game and set.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two sets, Philippoussis won 35 points at the
net to Moya's 11. Moya actually won more points at net through the
next two sets, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis was all over Moya's serve in the fourth set. In
the seventh game, he got the only break of the set. Serving at 5-4,
he followed a 125-mile-per-hour serve to the net and volleyed a
match winner.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras figures Rafter probably has an edge, because of his
experience, Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philippoussis has never been in a final,'' he said. ``But you
know, that might help him. He might come out real loose, swinging
away. The court is so quick, as big as they're serving, it's going
to come down to a couple of points.''

DRIVEN DAVENPORT CLAIMS US OPEN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is a female battering ram a battering ewe? We'll
leave that one to the etymologists, zoologists, or whomever.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt, however, that at a tennis pasture called
Flushing Meadow no defending champion has ever taken such a
final-round battering and ramming as Lindsay Davenport meted out
Saturday to floor No. 1 Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The kid champ of last year went down for the count of 6-3, 7-5.
When it looked as if she could get up as she did Friday to take out
Jana Novotna in the semis, Hingis ran into a series of
high-velocity punches _ forehands and double-barreled backhands _
that sent her reeling on 12 of the last 15 points, and left her
muttering: ``She killed me. I got ahead, 5-4, in the second set,
and she killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of her own No. 2 ranking, Davenport was nobody's pick
to put American women back in the title business at the American
championship, a bauble that hadn't been won by a citizen since _
take your pick _ naturalized Martina Navratilova in 1987 or native
Chris Evert in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3-inch Davenport, out of Newport Beach, Calif., may
have lost her distaste for training, but not her punch as she took
a serious swing at becoming No. 1 by racing through the tournament
on the loss of zero sets.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened since Hingis way back in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my coach said I should run, get really fit, I went argh,''
she said with a grimace. But that was three years and 30 pounds
ago, and she was doing fine, a millionaire as a 205-pounder _ ``a
person nobody regarded as a US Open winner someday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly her first coach, the renowned Robert Lansdorp, who
launched the 1979-81 queen Tracy Austin, didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to him when I was 8, and asked if he'd give me
lessons,'' she said. ``He said, `No way,' and I started to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That murdered me,'' said Lansdorp, who took her on. ``But she
was no prodigy, like Tracy or Jennifer Capriati. Not that type.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport did not want to be a prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Capriati stuff scared me,'' she said. ``I wanted normal,
to finish high school.''
</P>
<P>
   When she happily flashed her high school diploma in the locker
room, her colleagues in a sport dominated by dropouts thought she'd
won a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   She says she could get a Nobel in weeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of that lately,'' she laughs. ``I cried a
lot when I watched Mark McGwire hit his 61st on his father's 61st
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   The least she could do, then, was win the Open on her mother's
birthday. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ann Davenport, mopping tears herself, was not giving out
stats _ ``I'm not 61 yet'' _ she wasn't disappointed that Lindsay
had forgotten a tangible present. ``This is just fine,'' she said.
Since the daughter had just pocketed $700,000, a decent gift is
probably forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a mother's gifts can't be appraised. Ann's were
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``She drove me,'' Lindsay said. Meaning ``to tournaments
everywhere all the time,'' not the hard-driving usually associated
with tennis parents. ``She sort of protected me from the family
volleyball culture.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, the Davenports are big people and volleyball mavens.
Papa Wink was a US Olympian in 1968, mom and two sisters were of
national caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom wanted me to have something of my own even though my dad
pushed volleyball,'' said Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Ann said, ``The most I hoped was Lindsay would be under no
pressure to do what the rest of us had done. That she could have
fun, a sport for herself in tennis, and maybe be good enough to win
a college scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   College had to wait. By that time Lindsay was on the tour, a top
10 player and natural power hitter with mobility and motivation
problems. A turning point was the 1996 Olympics, she says, falling
under the spell of the great emotional prodder, US coach Billie
Jean King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billie lectured me a lot, made me more aggressive. Before the
final, she made me see the importance _ that I might never have
this chance again,'' said Davenport. ``That's what a lot of players
don't realize. Mary Joe Fernandez (who lost her lone major final,
the Australian of 1992) told me the same thing this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw Billie Jean. She just winked at me, and said, `You
know the speech.' That was enough; I was ready. I believed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of tears at the Olympics,'' said Davenport.
``My family was there, too. That means as much to me as this Open.
All the good players were there, and I was only 20. Only three of
us have won this title and the Olympics _ Helen Wills Moody (1924
gold at Paris), Steffi Graf (1988 at Seoul), now me.''
</P>
<P>
   No crying for Hingis, ever the pro whatever the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm through at 17,'' she said with a grin. ``Is
it so bad to get to the final? It wasn't like last year, but it
wasn't a bad year at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, with the Aussie title, a final here, and semis at the
other two majors, French and Wimbledon. Still the season's finest,
most consistent record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay was awesome. Don't forget her anticipation. She was
always there, to hit with power, too. I think maybe Mary Pierce
hits harder, but Lindsay's ball has more length. It moves, curves
like a baseball. You get there, then wonder, where's the ball?''
</P>
<P>
   At the trophy presentation, Davenport and US Tennis Association
president Harry Marmion held a weep-in as 21,829 partisans roared.
Marmion, a guy who despaired that the US wouldn't have a US champ
during his watch, dripped happily all over the trophy. Don't worry.
It's sterling and won't rust. It doesn't look like Davenport will,
either, for a long time.

   With Tampa Bay At 57-88, Tampa Bay owner Vince Naimoli doesn't
appear to be too upset about his inaugural season. ``I guess we
have a lot to be optimistic about for next year,'' Naimoli said.
``If you go back, there's 15 games, at least, that we should have
won. Add those 15 to where we are now, and it would be a heck of a
season. Next year, you figure we're going to turn the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Combine the last 11 starts of Toronto's Roger Clemens and
Kelvim Escobar and they are 8-1 with a 1.20 ERA. ... Why Orioles
right-hander Juan Guzman took take himself out of Wednesday's game
after five innings, a game. Baltiimore the club actually won 6-2. ?
Was he hurt? No, said Guzman said he wasn't hurt. , who added, ``I
made the decision. I didn't feel very good, and I'm out there not
getting any calls. This (umpire) was making me throw a lot of
pitches.'' With that attitude, no wonder the O's are going nowhere
this October. ... With 103 wins, the Yankees are now just nine
victories from besting the setting a league single-season mark of
which is 111 set by the 1954 Indians. ... Yankees right-hander Andy
Pettitte is struggling, allowing 25 runs in his last 30 innings.
... The Red Sox are concerned about Mike Stanley, who is bothered
by a strained hamstring. Stanley has driven in 30 runs in 38 games
since coming over from Toronto.

   Last weekend, Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel hit his first homer
of the season, in coming on his 524th at-bat. He then issued this
warning to Mark McGwire: ``Mark is in trouble now. If I get on a
roll, he'd better be careful.'' Said mManager Mike Hargrove said,
``With all that power bottled up, you knew it would come out some
way.'' Vizquel then hit another one Wednesday and has just 29
homers in 4,578 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: White Sox outfielder Mike Cameron continues to point out
that he's the only one this year to take a home run away from Mark
McGwire. Earlier this season in an interleague game at Comiskey
Park, when he pulled down a ball that was going over the wall.
``I'm the only one to do that this year,'' Cameron said. ...
Indians fans might want to look at the following record before
getting too excited about the postseason: The Indians are 50-32
against losing winning teams but just 30-34 against winning ones.
... The Detroit pitching staff gave up eight home runs over a
two-day period in Chicago, which has where there is an exploding
scoreboard. and said iInterim Tigers manager Larry Parrish said,
``They're on the phone right now to see if they can get some more
fireworks.'' ... One of the strangest stats of the year has to be
Kansas City's home-road records. The Royals, 66-80 overall, are
24-44 at home but 41-35 on the road. , the club now 41-35 but just
65-79 overall.

   What a couple of days for Milt Cuyler of the Rangers. Cuyler
went , going from an independent-league team to the Class AAA club
for Texas and then to the major-league club, all in a 72-hour
period. Cuyler, last in the majors in 1996, will be used as a pinch
runner. And he and has increased his salary from $3,000 a month to
more than $19,000 for the final three weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bothered by a strained hamstring. tThe Angels expect
first baseman Darin Erstad to miss another week before he is ready
to play again. He has been bothered by a strained hamstring. ...
Gregg Jefferies has hit been a great pickup, hitting .455 with
eight RBIs in eight games for the Angels since coming over from the
Phillies. . . . The night after breaking the single-season home-run
record, Mark McGwire called Jason Giambi, an old friend from his
days in Oakland. ``It's something else to get a wake up call from
Babe Ruth,'' Giambi said. ``He was all excited. He wanted to relive
the moment.'' ... If anyone has a chance to catch all-time home-run
king Hank Aaron it is Ken Griffey Jr., who has 344 homers and is
only 28, six years younger than McGwire, who has 449. If Griffey
averages 50 homers over the next seven years, he would have 694 and
still be just 35. But he still would be 61 away from Aaron.

   Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski signed a new-five year
deal instead of going to the Dodgers because commodities trader
John Henry is going to buy the team, put some money into the
payroll and _ by the way _ make Dombrowski the team president.
Henry also said that if he cannot get public money to build a
baseball-only park, he would consider using his own. He must sell
his 1 percent stake in the Yankees before a deal can be approved by
the other owners.

   Notes: Braves right-hander Greg Maddux has allowed 13 homers,
the most he has given up in four years, and he is getting close to
his career high, 18 with the Cubs in 1991. ... Todd Hundley of the
Mets is working behind the plate for Class AAA Norfolk and in his
first game, against the Richmond Braves, no one tried to steal a
base. Hundley probably will be activated from the disabled list
this week and could make the playoff roster as a bench player. ...
Phillies center fielder Doug Glanville shaved his mustache and went
hitless in his next 18 at-bats. Needless to say, he is not using a
razor again. Meanwhile, teammate Desi Relaford decided to wear his
socks high and broke out of a 0-for-36 slump.

   The Cubs are very concerned about the elbow of rookie
righthander Kerry Wood and are worried that they might have to shut
him down for the rest of the season. For now, the club says Wood
will miss seven to 10 days, or two starts, but some people think
that Wood has been overworked this season. His loss would hurt
Chicago's wild-card chances, which might be bad news for the
Braves. If the Mets win the wild card, Atlanta would have to play
either San Diego or Houston in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Cardinals pitcher Alan Benes recently underwent his
second shoulder surgery in the last year. ... Good news for the
Pirates: Their payroll, at $13 million this season, will be raised
by $10 million next year. ... In their first year in the NL, the
Brewers have two homers by pitchers _ Brad Woodall and Bronswell
Patrick. By the way, both players hit their homers with bats
borrowed from starter Steve Woodard. ... Houston's Jeff Bagwell on
having the best record in the league, which would give the Astros
the home-field advantage in the playoffs: ``It may not make a
difference to some teams, but it would be a big boost for us.'' ...
Reds second baseman Bret Boone won player-of-the-week honors and
then went hitless on his next 20 at-bats.

   The Padres could be in serious trouble if they lose Tony Gwynn
for the rest of the season. Gwynn is out for at least a week with a
sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his right hand, but he also
continues to be bothered by a inflamed Achilles. That loss,
combined with the problems the rotation is having, except for ace
Kevin Brown, makes the Padres look much more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: It's hard to believe that Rockies third baseman Vinny
Castilla, unprotected by the Braves in the draft after the 1992
season, has collected 40 homers in each of the last three seasons.
Over that same span, Braves third baseman Chipper Jones has 85, 38
fewer than Castillia. Castilla came up as a shortstop, which could
have given the Braves both players on the left side of their
infield. ... Arizona outfielder Bernard Gilkey, who admits he has a
hard time picking up pitches, is expected to undergo corrective
laser surgery on his eyes after the season. ... Since undergoing
major shoulder surgery in 1990, Giants starter Orel Hershiser is
82-66. . . The Dodgers and Giants are considering sharing a
spring-training complex in Arizona.

   ATLANTA -- His first title defense eight years ago came against
George Foreman, who figured to be too old and too fat to threaten
anything but the Shoney's breakfast bar. His next opponent, Bert
Cooper, was a last-minute replacement, a reclamation project from a
drug rehab center.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield won both bouts, but struggled, establishing a
reputation for inconsistency in the ring and fighting to the level
of his opponent _ whether that level was high or low.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stewart didn't fight, he stared. But so did Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Czyz? Let's not even get started about Bobby Czyz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my whole career has kind of been like that, even going
back to the amateurs,'' Holyfield said. ``Sometimes you would fight
a guy who was, like, a state champion and he was nothing because it
turned out he hadn't fought anybody. Then sometimes you'd fight a
guy who didn't have a great record but it turned out he was pretty
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when a train runs off a track, it's not because a
piece of track is missing. There might be something really tiny on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ahead: Some nondescript rubble named Vaughn Bean. When
Holyfield defends his IBF and WBA heavyweight titles Saturday night
at the Georgia Dome, he will try to separate himself from the
stigma of stumbling against inferior, or perceived inferior,
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example was Czyz two years ago. The 5-foot-10,
overinflated former middleweight ended up quitting on his stool
after the fifth round, claiming his eyes were burning. But
Holyfield, determined to knock out his munchkin opponent quickly,
had looked so flustered and harmless that the world's most infamous
former indestructible force, Mike Tyson, quickly agreed to fight
him. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising Cooper's name has been brought up often
leading up to the fight against Bean, who is 31-1 but lost to the
only top-10 contender or champion (Michael Moorer) he faced. The
last time Holyfield fought in Atlanta, seven years ago, he was
knocked down in the third round by the journeyman Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield recovered to win in the seventh, landing 21 straight
punches. But after the bout, the late promoter, Dan Duva, had the
look of a wildebeest, having almost seen his meal ticket
disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's somebody who didn't even work out and he comes to the
fight with nothing to lose,'' Holyfield said of Cooper. ``In the
first round, I hit him with a shot (in the stomach) and he almost
quit. The ref gave him an eight count. Then all of a sudden he
decided he didn't want to quit and he started fighting and he
clocked me. It just shows you that you can't take that for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing experts believe a freakish recurrence against Bean is
unlikely because he doesn't possess Cooper's power. Holyfield feels
secure, but for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more mature now,'' he said. ``I'm smarter than ever.
I can't see getting to that point again. It's not like I really did
anything wrong. (Cooper) just threw a wild shot and it caught me
right on my doggone temple.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Holyfield allowed it to happen. He is the first to
admit there have been other disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a counterpuncher, Holyfield believes most of his
problems arise when opponents refrain from being the aggressors.
The best examples of that were the fights against Czyz, Stewart
(the rematch in 1993, a lackluster affair that went the distance)
and the first fight against Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Moorer won a narrow decision in the fight but was knocked down
five times in the rematch last November after Holyfield dropped his
hands and goaded him into attacking. Holyfield also struggled
against Larry Holmes, but said, ``That's just because Larry was so
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, doesn't believe Bean will lull
his fighter to sleep, as Czyz and others did. ``If (Bean) fights
the way he fought on the tapes I saw, keeping busy, throwing
punches, Evander will fight to the level he fought against Tyson,''
Turner said. ``He's not gonna hold him or do any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he does? Holyfield said it won't matter. If Bean tries to
keep his distance, Holyfield intends to cut off the ring and press
the attack. If Bean stays close, Holyfield will pound the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize now that any fighter who decides to fight is going
to be hard until they get tired,'' the champion said. ``But by the
fifth or sixth round, it comes down to skills. Bert Cooper was a
fighter. He was getting me in trouble until he started breathing
hard. Then I started hitting him with uppercuts and there was
nothing he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   As to those who question whether Holyfield will be focused on a
relative unknown? Holyfield acknowledges that a title unification
bout against WBC champion Lennox Lewis is his ultimate goal. ``But
all these steps in between are important steps,'' he said. ``If I
lose, I can't be undisputed champion. The guys you overlook are the
guys who you really can't get rid of.''

 &HT;    Moya, Hingis take issue with officiating, rules
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Carlos Moya and Martina Hingis each used the word
``ridiculous'' to describe aspects of Saturday's officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Moya had a problem with a line judge who he claims couldn't keep
up with Mark Philippoussis' speedy serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say this, but that woman was a little bit old,''
Moya said. ``The ball (serve) was like 130 miles (per hour). How
can she see that? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the match, Moya opined that she was fat, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who lost in the women's final to Lindsay Davenport, had
no unusual complaints about calls, but didn't like the choice of
chair umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty ridiculous that it was an American,'' the Swiss
Hingis said of Dessie Samuels of Terrell, Texas. ``This shouldn't
happen at the U.S. Open finals or any finals.'' Davenport is
American.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual, though not controversial, point in the match
came when Davenport was serving at 2-1, 30-30 in the first set.
Davenport's cap flew off on an approach shot, and she netted a
volley that would've given Hingis a break point. It was rightly
called a let.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the rules,'' Hingis said, ``but it's a stupid rule.
It's not fair because I had that point won. It's her fault if the
hat falls.''
</P>
<P>
   The same as when a ball flies out of a player's pocket during
play, the rule calls for a warning and a let on the first
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Maturing of Philippoussis
</P>
<P>
   Since he beat Pete Sampras as a teenager at the 1996 Australian
Open, Philippoussis had become the whipping boy of Australian
tennis fans because of his poor work habits and immaturity. This
year, he declined to play in the Davis Cup, drawing harsh criticism
from fans and teammates, including Patrick Rafter. They blamed him
for the first-round defeat. Then Philippoussis almost skipped
Wimbledon with burnout this year because he was on a 6-9 run. ``I
was in a bad state of my life there,'' said Philippoussis, who then
recruited former Australian great Pat Cash to help coach him. ``I
just thought I'm fortunate to be doing what I am at such a young
age. Ever since Wimbledon, I've doubled my hours on the court. I've
tried to knuckle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson's record is safe
</P>
<P>
   Former Australian great Roy Emerson, whose record of 12 Grand
Slam singles titles is being threatened by Sampras, who has 11,
left Ashe Stadium with the record intact. He didn't watch the
Sampras Rafter match, but once Philippoussis won the first
semifinal, Emerson had already picked his favorite. ``Pete doesn't
need to get the record against an Aussie,'' Emerson said. ``Pete is
young enough to get the record later.'' ... An Australian reporter
asked Sampras if the loss to Rafter made him feel the record was
getting away from him. ``That's a ridiculous question,'' Sampras
snapped.

 &HT;    G'day mate, it's all-Aussie final
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pete Sampras didn't come out and say he would have
beaten Patrick Rafter had he not pulled a left quadricep, but he
hinted strongly at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it didn't help,'' Sampras said. ``Things were going
pretty well till that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, down a service break in the third set when Sampras
jammed the quad, won 6-7, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 Saturday in the U.S.
Open men's semifinals. It was his 23rd victory in his last 24
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter will play Mark Philippoussis at 4 p.m. today in the first
all-Australian final since 1970, when Ken Roswell beat Tony Roche.
Philippoussis, unseeded, beat No. 10 Carlos Moya 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4
in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, 7-0 against the top 10 this year, didn't mind that
Sampras didn't give him all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those hard-luck stories for Pete,'' he
said. ``If Pete was fit there, it may have been a different
story.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy injury timeout, Sampras returned leading 4-2 in
the second set and won the next two games. In the final two sets,
however, Sampras was clearly hampered. Rafter lost just eight
points in nine serve games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I put any serious weight on my left side, I couldn't
push off,'' Sampras said. ``If I could just hold on to serve, maybe
I could get a couple of second serves (from Rafter). Anything's
possible. That's why I was hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' focus now is defending his No. 1 ranking. He's tied
with Jimmy Connors for the record of five straight years finishing
atop the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose Slams, you always have something to look forward
to, but the U.S. Open is the last one of the year,'' Sampras said.
``Now, I've got to find some sort of motivation to go over to
Europe and deal with that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, who was prematurely ordained as a future No. 1
when he beat Sampras as a teenager at the 1996 Australian Open, let
loose his immense potential against Moya.
</P>
<P>
   The 22nd-ranked Australian fired 21 aces and had 75 winners,
twice as many as Moya, the French Open champion, and was broken on
serve just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly feel like no one can beat me,'' said Philippoussis,
21. ``When I play good tennis, I know I can win this thing. I want
to prove that.''

 &HT;    Davenport tops Hingis for title
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Big girls don't cry, but Lindsay Davenport did.
</P>
<P>
   The one formerly known as the best player who'd never won a
Grand Slam championship buried her past Saturday and claimed the
U.S. Open women's title with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over world No. 1
Martina Hingis before a crowd of 21,829 at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She's the first American-born woman to hold the U.S. Open trophy
since Chris Evert in 1982, and the joy of it brought her to tears
at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest feeling you can experience being a
professional athlete,'' said Davenport, who didn't drop a set here
in seven matches. ``You can't put into words how much it means,
playing for so many years. This has been my dream, to win the U.S.
Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still trails Hingis by a small margin in the WTA Tour
rankings, Davenport, 22, can rightly call herself the world's best
hardcourt player. She has won 20 of 21 matches since Wimbledon on
the fast summer hardcourt circuit, and that includes victories in
both her meetings against Hingis, who is 1-3 against Davenport this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating with her return, Davenport won half the points that
Hingis served, including 12 of 16 when Hingis was forced to throw
in one of her slow-ball second serves. Davenport hit five clean
return winners in Hingis' final three service games of the first
set.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Hingis got back on serve in the second set, Davenport
broke her at love to go up 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference about Lindsay now and before,'' Hingis
said. ``Before, after you break her, she would let herself down.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Davenport's groundstrokes was simply too rapid. More
agile and svelte than when she won the Olympic gold medal in
Atlanta two years ago, Davenport ran down a drop shot on match
point and smacked a backhand winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to do out there,'' Hingis said. ``When you
see the ball flying from her side, you feel like, `Hey, this is not
so fast.' But it's so deep, with such good length. You can't do
that much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport had never made a Grand Slam semifinal. Reminders of
her shortcomings in majors always irritated Davenport, and her
Olympic victory didn't blunt the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overlooked,'' Davenport said. ``All the women played
that year with the exception of (Steffi) Graf. If I could pick only
two big ones, I'd pick the Olympics and the U.S. Open, and I don't
care if I win another one. I've got those two and I'll cherish them
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is the latest U.S. champion, but she was never
America's great hope in tennis. She was an admittedly awkward
teenager, self-conscious about her height, unappealing to the
sporting public. ``I was never a prodigy, I was never going to be
any good,'' she said. ``I think I've maximized everything I've had,
tried harder, let people say what they want. Maybe it bothered me
in my teens, but I realized after a certain point there's no use in
listening to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been only since 1996, she says, that she fully dedicated
herself. Once unwilling to discuss her weight, she now acknowledges
she played for years at 200 pounds. Now she's 6-foot-2, 176 pounds
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to do it out of the spotlight, grow up on my own
pace, do everything I wanted to do before I really set my eyes on
tennis,'' Davenport said. ``People didn't give me a shot a couple
of years ago to win a Grand Slam. I think I've proved everybody
wrong.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NNEW YORK _ Tiger Woods and Martina Hingis should do lunch, or
Oprah, together. Goodness knows, they have a shared experience in
life's hard lessons learned.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't gonna be so easy after all, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Golf phenom Woods became the chosen one at 21, the master of the
Masters. And Hingis, tennis' mighty Swiss miss, was already No. 1
at 16, daring to trump her Wimbledon title with another at the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   But now look. Hingis, beaten here Saturday by the determined
Lindsay Davenport, hasn't won a tournament anywhere since May. And
Woods had the door grandly slammed shut on him at his sport's '98
majors. For both, it becomes a time for reflection and
rededication, for forging a higher level of commitment. Immortality
isn't preordained; it's earned.
</P>
<P>
   They should consult with Pete Sampras on this. Once, Sampras was
a precocious 19-year-old U.S. Open champion himself who buckled
under the weight of having achieved too much too soon. He has been
exactly where Hingis and Tiger are today, wandering lost in a foggy
shroud of self-doubt, caused by the unrealistic demands upon them.
</P>
<P>
   The Sampras story line has turned out pretty well, though. Pete
would go for what probably felt like forever before he won that
second Slam, yet he has been collecting them in a steady stream
ever since, even if he won't be adding his record-tying 12th one
today at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He came up lame in Saturday's second men's semifinal, and
Patrick Rafter, a formidable adversary as the defending champion,
put him away in five sets, setting up a throwback all-Australian
final, the first here since 1970. Rafter next faces Mark
Philippoussis, a strapping, bazooka-serving bloke of 21 who has
himself been bowed by the burden of unfair expectations in his
country.
</P>
<P>
   As with Davenport, it has been said of Philippoussis that he
lacks the right stuff, his physical tools notwithstanding. Now,
like Davenport, he can change our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, once they've heard Pete out, Hingis and Woods would do
well to learn from Lindsay, too. She stands atop the game today as
the best player on the WTA Tour _ her No. 2 ranking is a mere
computer glitch _ after having worked about three times as hard as
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't determined enough or dedicated enough to win a major,
we assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Bad assumption.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hingis, she's going to have to improve her athleticism,
as the original Martina _ Navratilova _ did back in the early
1980s. The then-chubby Navratilova underwent a total physical
overhaul. She went from being a very good player, good enough to
have won Wimbledon consecutively, to a buff hardbody who elevated
the women's game to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, whose court sense is mature way beyond her years, must
still get stronger and, yes, lose a little baby fat. It's the same
painful realization that Davenport came to, and the much-deserved
payoff for the affable, self-deprecating 22-year-old from
California arrived spectacularly in the form of a convincing 6-3,
7-5 victory over her teen-queen cover-girl adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, back-to-back, Lindsay mowed down Venus Williams and
Hingis, the WTA's ranking heiresses apparent heading into the 21st
century. Youth would not be served, although it's troublesome to
think of Davenport as an old-timer.
</P>
<P>
   We had assumed it would be Venus, perhaps in tandem with her
sassy sister Serena, who saved women's tennis in America, which
hadn't produced a home-grown U.S. Open champion since Chris Evert
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast there, kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot to improve on,'' Davenport said, as if to
remind us she has only just begun. ``People didn't give me a shot a
couple years ago to win a Grand Slam. I think I've proved everyone
wrong by improving a lot the last couple years. I don't necessarily
think I'm done. With more hard work, I can definitely get better.
Mentally, I'm much stronger now, and that's one of the biggest
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can get better. It's been exciting to see myself
improve and be able to do different things. That's why you play, to
see if you can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of Davenport as clumsy and slow-footed must be hard to
shake, however. Hingis would, after all, try to drop-shot her at
match point, only to be left standing there helplessly herself as
Lindsay chased down the ball, then ripped it sharply crosscourt for
a backhand winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a pretty long point, too,'' she said, beaming. ``That's
so great. My first Slam final, my first match point, and I think I
played a great point. Getting the drop shot, hitting a winner.
Everything was just perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the two weeks have been great. I didn't lose a set. I
don't think I ever got down on myself, which has been a big thing
for me. I was able to really, in my eyes, act like a champion and
go win the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has come easily for Lindsay. Her appreciation for what
she has accomplished is huge, as it should be. Hingis has no idea,
really.

TEXAS UPBEAT AFTER 49-31 LOSS TO UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Improvement is measured differently at Texas,
a school trying to rebuild and recapture past glory.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Longhorns' achieved yesterday: They outscored
UCLA 28-14 in the second half and reduced their margin of defeat
against UCLA from 63 to 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   And never mind the final score of UCLA 49, Texas 31 before
73,070 at the Rose Bowl. The Longhorns were unflinchingly upbeat
for a team that had lost its first game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we did quit in the second half,'' Texas running
back Ricky Williams said. ``But it wasn't as bad as last year
because we didn't play very well. I think we earned a lot of
respect in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different walking off the field compared to last
year,'' Texas middle linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``I told the
guys I was really proud of 'em. There was some positive things in
the second half. We fought our guts out to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the sixth-ranked Bruins (1-0) had little trouble
gutting a Texas defense that is still a work in (tedious) progress.
UCLA had 584 yards in total offense. 379 of that came in the first
half as the Bruins barely broke a sweat in building a 35-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was a perfect game for UCLA,'' Texas coach Mack
Brown said. ``No turnovers, no penalties, no mistakes. I thought
they played a great first half, and that unnerved us a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy won't be awarded for another three months,
but UCLA quarterback Cade McNown probably stepped in line ahead of
Williams. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was 20-of-30 for 339 yards for three touchdowns and one
interception. His final TD pass was highlight quality, a perfect
throw on the run to Freddie Mitchell for a 79-yard score. Williams,
who passed Earl Campbell as the Longhorns' leading rusher, had 29
carries for 160 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it being a Heisman showdown,'' said
Williams, who also caught three passes for 54 yards. ``I just
wanted us to play a good defense like UCLA and see how good we
really are.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown facilitated a UCLA attack that in the first half averaged
10 yards per play. On each of the Bruins' five scoring drives, they
had a play that covered at least 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well at the beginning and fizzled off a little,''
McNown said. ``Texas played us very, very well. In the second half,
we just weren't intellectually there, and we made some mental
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored on its first second-half drive to make it 35-10,
then held the Bruins on downs. However, the next Longhorns
possession ended on a Ricky Brown fumble. That was Texas' only
turnover; it made eight in last year's game. UCLA converted that
mistake into a touchdown and a 42-10 lead. BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas senior quarterback Richard Walton suffered an injury _
either a bruise or a broken bone _ to his throwing hand and left
the game midway through the fourth quarter. Walton is scheduled to
be X-rayed today.
</P>
<P>
   Texas running back Ricky Williams has 4,530 career rushing
yards, surpassing the 4,443 totaled by Earl Campbell. Asked about
becoming the school's leading rusher, Williams was terse. ``I
haven't thought about it yet,'' he said.

AIKMAN'S MOBILITY PROPELS COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ You never knew what he was going to do, whether he'd
run or pass, whether he'd zig or zag. By game's end he had
strong-armed two touchdown passes, and ran through bewildered
defenders for two more in a blowout victory.
</P>
<P>
   This could be Elway, any John Elway highlight. But that was Troy
Aikman doing an Elway against the Cardinals last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (1-0) likely will need more free-lancing from Aikman
at noisy Mile High Stadium, where they face the defending Super
Bowl champion Denver Broncos (1-0) today.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are 71/2-point favorites. If the game plays
according to form, Aikman will be counted on to lead a
fourth-quarter comeback. He has 19 regular-season in his career, 13
fewer than Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman would be forced to ad-lib his Cowboys down the field for
the game-winning points, running when the Broncos think he's going
to pass, passing while on the run, being Elway while the Broncos
quarterback watches the game's final moments.
</P>
<P>
   In coach Chan Gailey's new scheme, Aikman showed he can lead an
extemporaneous offensive attack. Aikman used his second and third
wide receivers often _ Billy Davis and Ernie Mills combined for
seven receptions for 121 yards and two touchdowns against the
Cardinals last week. He kept the defense off balance by rushing
five times for 43 yards, most since he was a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense is not predicated on timing as much as the other
one was _ I have the ability to hold the ball a little more and
because of that it gives us the ability to make some bigger plays
downfield,'' Aikman said. ``And in the shotgun, it gives me the
flexibility to move around more in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradeoff is at times, I might get hit more. There might be
a few more sacks involved. For everything you gain, you lose
something else. But I don't want to sound critical of what we used
to do. I was very fond of the offense I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won three Super Bowls in four years in the old
system, which was timing-based, and fueled by Aikman's accuracy. If
a pass pattern called for Aikman to throw the ball 18 3/4 yards, no
matter what the defense did, he threw the ball 18 3/4 yards. He
stood robotically in the pocket, oblivious to the fierce pass rush.
He rarely threw on the run. He rarely ran.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years, however, blitzing defenses have caved-in
both the pocket and any quarterback who couldn't or wouldn't escape
the maelstrom. Aikman was one of the pocket's casualties. In 1997
Aikman was sacked 33 times, the most since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When Aikman did try to make a play from the pocket, the result
was not always favorable. No image sums up the Cowboys' catastrophe
of 1997 more than a retreating Aikman, running backward circles
around the Carolina Panthers defense on fourth-and-one, being
dumped for a 25-yard loss on Monday Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, mobile quarterbacks in the NFL have flourished. In
the 1996 and 1997 AFC and NFC championship games, six of the eight
quarterback positions were manned by a mobile passer _ Brett Favre
(twice), Steve Young, Elway, Kordell Stewart, and Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, championship pocket passers have gone the way of the
``Macarena''.
</P>
<P>
   But Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is confident Aikman can dance to a
new beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was asked to step back in the pocket, stay there, and
deliver to a point on the field, he got an A-plus for doing that
and he was one of the best,'' Jones said. ``Now when he's asked to
do it differently, using his judgment and his skills, who is to say
that he can't be great in this system?''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was asked if Aikman is too perfection-minded, too
mechanical to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical?'' Irvin asked rhetorically. ``He got labeled that
because of a system. The old offense we were in made him a
mechanical guy. He did what the offense demanded of him. He dropped
back and after five steps, boom, he let it go. This offense demands
something different of him and he'll be great in this system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who don't have a tested backup, just hope Aikman,
31, can stay healthy. He has a history of concussions. Holding the
ball longer in his dropbacks and running around in the pocket could
lead to another big hit that could jeopardize his season, and
perhaps his career. The San Francisco 49ers live with this
possibility every Sunday with Young's daredevil approach.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Gailey accept the risk that comes with Aikman running.
To return to championship football, it is a risk they are willing
to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his skills and his accuracy,'' Jones said, ``if he has
gotten comfortable with an impromptu approach then there are going
to be more exciting times around the Cowboys over the next five or
six years than we've had in the past.''

   The Browns boss
</P>
<P>
   Because of a shared background with the 49ers, Carmen Policy,
president of the new Cleveland franchise, feels obligated to meet
with George Seifert about the coaching position there. That hardly
means Seifert is Policy's top choice. Along with owner-in-exile Ed
DeBartolo, the fingerprints of Policy are all over the
unceremonious dismissal of Seifert after the '96 season and the
hiring of Steve Mariucci. Write off, too, rumors that Green Bay
coach Mike Holmgren could end up in Cleveland. By rule, the Browns
can't trade any draft picks for the next 16 months as compensation
for hiring a coach under contract. And Policy has said he does not
like a front-office structure in which the coach is also the GM,
which is what Holmgren desires.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Charlie
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumors, Kansas City, seeking a change-of-pace tailback
as a complement to Donnell Bennett, probably won't get
Philadelphia's Charlie Garner in a trade. Personnel men Terry
Bradway of the Chiefs and the Eagles' Tom Modrak recently revisited
talks that began about a month ago. Philly is seeking a high-round
pick for a guy who has averaged fewer than 100 carries a season,
must be driving coach Ray Rhodes nuts with his lack of durability
and is playing behind second-year man Duce Staley. There were
reports last week the Chiefs would trade holdout defensive end Dan
Williams for Garner. But Williams would have to sign a contract
first, and agent Rosey Barnes said Friday that he had not spoken
with either team.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals corner
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati owner Mike Brown struck out in attempts to bring
cornerback Carlton Gray, cut last week by Indianapolis, back to his
hometown to play. One reason the Bengals were so desperate to get
Gray is that extension talks are going so poorly with corner Ashley
Ambrose. The Bengals are offering a $2.5 million signing bonus,
while Ambrose is seeking $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards to start
</P>
<P>
   New England coach Pete Carroll is saying tailbacks Robert
Edwards and Sedrick Shaw probably will split time tonight against
Indianapolis. But several Patriots blockers hope the former Georgia
star, in his first start, seizes the chance to lock up the No. 1
job. ``As good as Curtis (Martin) was for us, Edwards has the kind
of long speed that he didn't,'' tackle Zefross Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   On the run
</P>
<P>
   Although rookie quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf got
solid reviews in their debuts, their respective teams need to run
the ball a lot better to help them. The Colts had 14 first-down
rushes and eight were for 1 yard or less. In fact, 17 of Indy's 32
first-down snaps netted 1 yard or less. The Chargers, who aren't
getting much help yet from tailback Natrone Means, had consecutive
running plays just twice last week. Opposing defenses are already
on to Manning's fondness for wideout Marvin Harrison on third down
and Leaf's habit of going to Bryan Still. The Chargers face
Tennessee today, and the Oilers have beaten the last four rookies
they've faced as starters _ Jake Plummer, Eric Zeier, Todd Collins
and Rick Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine
</P>
<P>
   Two of the hottest assistant coaches in the league right now
work in the AFC Central: Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim
Haslett and Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer. ...
Seattle quietly extended the contract of former Georgia fullback
Mack Strong last week. The three-year extension is worth $3.5
million in ``new money.'' ... Agent Leigh Steinberg plans to
approach the Steelers about a new contract for QB Kordell Stewart
after this season. ... Steinberg, who represents Leaf, and Tom
Condon, who has Manning, are expected to go head to head for the
right to represent Kentucky's Tim Couch.

   The long Green
</P>
<P>
   Look for new Minnesota owner Red McCombs to give two-year
contract extensions to the assistant coaches soon. They would
follow a three-year extension for Dennis Green that surprised the
coach and his Atlanta-based agent, Ray Anderson. As recently as
three weeks ago, McCombs and club president Gary Woods rejected two
extension proposals. ``It was amazing how they changed their
minds,'' Anderson said. ``But once we got rolling, it was the
fastest negotiation I ever did.'' Green will average $1.55 million
for the extension. But the assistants need some security. Both
coordinators, Brian Billick on offense and Foge Fazio defensively,
lost lucrative opportunities last spring when then-CEO Roger
Headrick wouldn't let them leave.
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers
</P>
<P>
   Among the phone calls New Orleans general manager Bill Kuharich
received after the season-ending injury to Billy Joe Hobert were
those from agents for these former NFL quarterbacks: Vince Evans,
43, who hasn't played since 1995; John Fourcade, 37, last with New
Orleans in '90; Jay Schroeder, 37, who was with Arizona in '94; and
Timm Rosenbach, 31, who last played with the Cards in '92. ``You
can call it the 'Steve DeBerg Syndrome,' I guess,'' offensive
coordinator Danny Abramowicz said. Kuharich instead signed Billy
Joe Tolliver. Coach Mike Ditka joked about bringing in Jim McMahon
but hasn't ruled out looking at Bobby Hebert during next week's
bye.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp-ing his strength
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defensive tackle Warren Sapp is listed at 275 pounds,
played late last year at about 290 and suddenly is up to 303. Coach
Tony Dungy and defensive line aide Rod Marinelli haven't made an
issue of the extra tonnage yet. But Sapp will need to be more
productive today at Green Bay than he was last Sunday, when he had
just one tackle at Minnesota and was badly outplayed by Vikings
guard David Dixon. ``He says he can play at this weight, ... but
we'll see.'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   The goods on Gray
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Conrad Hamilton is more a ``nickel'' corner than
a replacement for Jason Sehorn, the Giants signed free agent
Carlton Gray to a four-year, $8.65 million deal and expect him to
start in two to three weeks. In addition to paying Gray the $1.4
million he was to make this season in Indianapolis, the Giants made
another concession. General manager Ernie Accorsi and agent Marvin
Demoff have a gentleman's agreement that the team will release Gray
at the end of the year if the fifth-year veteran wants to be free.
But if Gray plays well and likes it in New York, and Sehorn comes
back strong, the Giants might consider trading corner Phillippi
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's price tag
</P>
<P>
   The price for getting coach Mike Holmgren out of Green Bay at
the end of this season is considerably less than the Jets paid
Patriots owner Bob Kraft in compensation for Bill Parcells last
year. According to Holmgren's contract, reworked in January by
Green Bay president Bob Harlan, the Packers must get a second-round
draft selection in return for letting Holmgren leave before his
contract expires in 1999. To get Parcells, New York surrendered
third- and fourth-round picks in the '97 draft, a No. 2 in '98 and
must give up their first-round choice in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine
</P>
<P>
   Bucs running backs coach Tony Nathan isn't suggesting Mike
Alstott abandon his second-effort style, but the fullback fumbled
again last week fighting for extra yards. Alstott led all league
running backs in '97 with five lost fumbles. ... The breakdown on
Chris Chandler's new contract: a signing bonus of $6 million and
base salaries of $2.3 million (1998), $3.5 million ('99), $4.4
million (2000), $5.0 million (2001) and $5.8 million (2002).

 &HT;    It's open season on QBs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Having emerged from a Wednesday videotape session in
which he'd watched Derrick Thomas dominate the Oakland offensive
line with six sacks, Jacksonville tackle Tony Boselli know he faces
a large challenge when the two compete today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all arms and legs tangled up, kind of like an octopus,
and then you just see the quarterback on the ground,'' said Boselli
in assessing Thomas, one of the NFL's premier pass rushers. ``He's
a one-man wrecking crew when he gets it cranked up. But then again,
if you play left tackle, you expect to see a big sack guy almost
every week. Look at how many sacks there were in last week's games
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the opening week of the NFL season may have served
notice that 1998 could be a year of abnormally high sack numbers _
and, as a result, a year of living dangerously for league
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Eight starting quarterbacks went out with injuries in the
opening weekend, and at least three of them will not play this
week. The aggregate sacks for the 15 regular-season openers was 76,
or 5.1 per game. Six teams permitted four or more sacks. The
Raiders surrendered 10, the Philadelphia Eagles nine, the
Washington Redskins eight.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen individual defenders had at least two sacks each, and
Thomas _ a hybrid-type player who is listed as a linebacker but
lines up at end in passing situations _ came within one more hit on
Jeff George of tying his own league record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a quarterback and you watched the ESPN highlights,
you probably didn't sleep too well,'' said San Diego strong safety
Rodney Harrison, who had three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coaches point out that NFL free agency has eroded
the quality of play on the offensive line more than at any other
position. Only four teams began this season with the same unit they
had in 1997. Three teams have four linemen each in new positions.
Among the 150 starters, there were 31 linemen who went into Week
One with fewer than a dozen starts at their current positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos opened defense of their championship Monday
night with only two blockers, left guard Mark Schlereth and center
Tom Nalen, in the same spots they played last January in Super Bowl
XXXII. The starting tackles for San Francisco are a converted
guard, Derrick Deese, and a former deep-snapper, Dave Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're doing a lot of cut-and-paste anymore,'' said St. Louis
assistant Jim Hanifan, one of the league's premier line coaches.
``Because of free agency, it's rare when you're not breaking in at
least one or two (new starters) in camp. The consistency has been
diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   And the sacks have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the first year for free agency, sacks have increased
by one-third, from 3.9 per game from 5.2. Every season since '94,
there has been an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the deterioration of offensive lines, the extensive
deployment of zone-blitz packages has helped fuel the sack craze.
Defensive coordinators are sending people at the quarterback from
every conceivable angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lines are blurring (because) every defensive guy can rush,
the way the game is played now,'' Indianapolis offensive
coordinator Tom Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   That is evident by what positions collected last weekend's
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ends led the hit list with 21 of the 76. The
rest of the distribution in the opening week: outside linebackers
(19 1/2), tackles (19), safeties (7 1/2), inside linebackers
(seven) and cornerbacks (two).
</P>
<P>
   That sacks have become as much a function of scheme as skill is
obvious, except maybe to the natural assassins like Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys,'' he said, ``are just born to put quarterbacks on
their backs.''

NO LONGER A DYNASTY, DALLAS STILL DANGEROUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos, defending world champs (that sounds weird),
have been on their best verbal behavior all week. If they couldn't
say something nice about the Cowboys, then they did the next best
thing. Lie.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is standard NFL procedure, but even more so
when a strong head coach like Mike Shanahan is involved. The big
mouths in the locker room aren't going to cross the big man.
</P>
<P>
   But since it's Dallas going into Mile High Stadium today, even
an elite Broncos' team has to be dealing with a legitimate mixture
of curiosity and caution.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty is dead, but there are also just enough Super Bowl
relics still hanging around to make the Cowboys dangerous under the
right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Then add the Chan Gailey factor _ beyond a new set of X's and
O's, Gailey is attempting to reintroduce the concept of a head
coach being an authority figure and problem solver. For the
previous four years, the Cowboys have been far removed from this
area of the football mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dallas, we understand what we're dealing with,'' Denver
tight end Shannon Sharpe said last week. Oh, yeah. Then maybe
Shannon could break the news to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team still trying to find out how good we can be,''
quarterback Troy Aikman said after a successful season opener vs.
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game will certainly offer a contrast in priorities, plus
the obvious role switching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is now where we've been so often,'' said wideout
Michael Irvin. ``They are on top and trying to stay there. We are
now one of those teams we used to face all the time _ we're trying
to get to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL schedule-maker did the Cowboys a favor, scheduling
Denver this early. They are on the road, they are a 71/2-point
'dog, and the public expectations of Dallas winning are remote. But
if they pull the upset, then the Cowboys could take off on a
psychological rocket ride. Even if they play well and lose, the
Cowboys could reap long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Game 2 on the schedule,'' said Aikman, trying to shrug
off any extra significance. When it was suggested he was being less
than truthful, Aikman smiled, and walked off.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Billy Davis, however, took the more direct and youthful
approach. ``We have the opportunity here to send a very clear and
precise message that we are for real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it like we could convince anyone the old
Cowboys are back. But this is a team that has lost the intimidation
factor it used to enjoy, and we need to regain some of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it used to be around here _ the cruise-control
thing. We can't get away with that anymore, and that's good. No one
looks ahead to anything. Coach Gailey has us thinking one play at a
time instead of even one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Billy, this is Denver. You know _ Elway and Terrell
and all them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extra motivation, yes,'' said Davis, ``but this is also just
like the Arizona game. Everyone is putting 100 percent into how
we've prepared, just because that's the way we have to treat all 16
games. I see that becoming a trademark of ours because of coach
Gailey.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it once was, the Cowboys played the Denvers of the NFL
with an air of superiority. The Denvers would talk about knocking
on the Super Bowl door, but the Cowboys already had opened that
door, moved right in and made themselves at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that's a strong psychological advantage when you have
that working for you,'' said Irvin. ``We know the feeling that
Denver now has. But they also know that we know. Playing Denver at
this point in the season helps us. It will tell us a lot about
where we are as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical demands for Dallas today get right down to
elementary football. Slow down Terrell Davis and the Broncos
running game, and the opportunity to win will probably be
available.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to accomplish that is for Aikman and Co. to hog the
football for long periods of time. Just like against Arizona,
except this is not Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys showed enough offense last week to give Denver
reason for concern. It had been awhile since an opponent had any
real proof that such concern was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Out of necessity, the Broncos played it verbally straight last
week. At the moment, it's the logical and safe way to deal with
this Dallas team.

 &HT;    Here come the Astros
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In its last six trips to the postseason, Atlanta
generally has been the league favorite to go to the World Series.
This year appears to be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The best team in baseball these days is certainly not the
Braves, or even the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it is Houston.
</P>
<P>
   While New York has had a better overall season, the Astros have
been rolling over everybody the last month and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 31, when Houston obtained Randy Johnson, the Astros
have won 32 of 41 games. Over that same period, the Yankees are
28-15 and the Braves 22-17.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros find themselves with the best record in the league,
96-53, and if they can hold it, they will be rewarded with
home-field advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a huge plus for Houston, which is 52-21 in the
Astrodome. Also, Johnson, their No. 1 starter in October, is 5-0
there with four shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to come from behind on the (Padres and Braves) and
still have a little ways to go and protect it,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``The way we have played, I wouldn't be surprised if
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is in much better shape than the Braves and Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have no holes in their starting lineup. The Braves
have injuries at both second and short and have received little
production from their outfielders except for Andruw Jones. The
Padres are missing Tony Gwynn for another week, while center
fielder Steve Finley is hitting .246 and third baseman Ken Caminiti
is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also have a stronger pen than the Braves and a deeper
bench than San Diego. The Astros are hitting .281, 10 points better
than the Braves and 25 points better than the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a better team ERA, 3.41 to 3.52, but since the
break, Houston is tops, 3.46 to 3.55.
</P>
<P>
   And Houston is gaining confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said, ``We've played the
Yankees this season, and Houston can play with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Javier Lopez said, ``They are starting to feel
comfortable with each other and are hungry to win. That is the type
of feeling I have noticed from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were very much the same way in 1991 when they first
climbed to the top of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say 'down' in this clubhouse,'' Astros
outfielder Carl Everett said. ``We never give up in this
clubhouse.''

 &HT;    For Bucs, beating Packers   arrival
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. -- Tony Dungy jogged off the practice field of the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday afternoon, spotted an out-of-town
reporter he has known for more than 20 years and said: ``Boy, must
be a big game, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bucs, one of the league's emerging young powers but
reeling from an opening-day 31-7 meltdown in Minnesota last Sunday,
there may be no bigger game than today's grudge match with the
Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   Every superb NFL team of the last quarter-century can point to a
defining moment that elevated it to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bucs attempted to forget the lambasting that defensive
coordinator Monte Kiffin conceded left several players
``shell-shocked,'' they seemed to realize the potential for such a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lofty preseason predictions, veteran players
acknowledged that they won't be regarded as legitimate Super Bowl
contenders until they defeat the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a daunting schedule, Tampa Bay figures to have another
10-win season, but it won't mean as much without defeating the
Packers at least once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go 13-3 and maybe not beat Green Bay during the
season,'' said linebacker Hardy Nickerson, one of Tampa Bay's
elders. ``But let's face it, there will come a point when we have
to beat them for all the marbles. They're hearing all the talk
about how we've closed the gap. But they've got that championship
mentality like, `So what?' It's like they figure, `Hey, until the
Bucs beat us, we don't have to worry about them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They're curious about us and that's about it,'' Nickerson
said. ``We won't seem serious to them until we prove we can beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs, whose midweek practices were marked by intensity and
attention to detail, approached the NFC Central matchup with a
sense of urgency and not an eye on history.
</P>
<P>
   During its current five-game losing streak to Green Bay, the
23-year-old Bucs have been outscored 106-39 and scored more than 7
points only once. In their last 18 meetings, Tampa Bay scored 20
points just twice. Even in their lone victory of the last 12 games,
in 1995, the Bucs generated just 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Only one team, the 1993 Dallas Cowboys, ever opened a season 0-2
and went on to win a Super Bowl. A defeat today would give Tampa
Bay two losses in the division. One of Dungy's major concerns was
the pall that lingered after Sunday's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``History can tell you what's happened in the past, but it can't
tell you what's going to happen in the next game,'' Dungy said.
``Our guys are saying we can go up there and win. Now they have to
believe it. I hope we're looking forward to this.''
</P>
<P>
   One player seemingly counting the hours until kickoff is tackle
Warren Sapp, who used the '97 playoff defeat at Lambeau Field to
establish himself as one of the league's most dominating defenders.
Sapp, whose heart is even bigger than his mouth, sacked Brett Favre
three times and forced two fumbles and spent much of the fourth
quarter jawing with the Packers quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp is relishing the opportunity to pester Favre and the
Packers again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's over,'' he said, ``I want them to know they were in
a war. It's going to be two bullies going into the back alley to
punch each other in the mouth. Two teams enter, but only one team
leaves; that's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches spent much of last week reminding Sapp that he had just
one tackle against the Vikings, and he conceded that the Bucs are
not yet the same team that started 5-0 in 1997. As the team
practiced Friday morning, its first workout in the new Raymond
James Stadium, which opens next week, Sapp's high-pitched voice
urged fellow defenders to ``get back focused on the prize'' against
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we can't even think we're a good team,'' Sapp said.
``We haven't played our game yet; something is missing. We're a
team that usually likes to watch ourselves on film. This week, when
the coaches flipped off the lights and put the tape on _ oooh, you
needed to have some tough skin on, 'cause it got nasty. It was hard
to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that pervaded the Tampa Bay locker room was that a
win today will force the Packers to regard the Bucs in a different
light, but Dungy disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this game will determine at all how the Packers
view us,'' he said. ``But it may help change how we view ourselves.
And when you talk about coming together as a team, that's a lot
more important.''

 &HT;    Pack ambushes Seminoles
 &HT;    By Mark Aumann
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. -- When Chris Weinke hit a wide-open Peter Warrick
for a 74-yard touchdown on Florida State's first play from
scrimmage, it looked like another long day for N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 31 points the week before to lightly-regarded
Ohio, it
</P>
<P>
   seemed like a nightmare in the making for the much-maligned
Wolfpack
</P>
<P>
   defense.
</P>
<P>
   Holt everything. State wide receiver Torry Holt, who bypassed
the NFL Draft to return for his senior season, scored the go-ahead
touchdown on a twisting, weaving 68-yard punt return near the end
of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He then was on the receiving end of a 63-yard fourth-quarter
bomb from Jamie Barnette that put the finishing touches on State's
incredible, improbable 24-7 victory over the No. 2 Seminoles
Saturday at Carter-Finley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Wolfpack secondary picked off an ACC
record-tying six
</P>
<P>
   passes against FSU quarterback Weinke in handing the Seminoles
only their second conference loss since they joined the ACC in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfpack head coach Mike O'Cain, who fielded calls on his radio
show this week from angry N.C. State alumni after Thursday's
squeaker against Ohio, was suddenly answering questions about
becoming the front-runner for the ACC title and Holt's possible
Heisman Trophy candidacy after upsetting FSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave us a dog's chance in this game,'' a smiling O'Cain
said. ``I
</P>
<P>
   think they've heard about N.C. State today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida State locker room, head coach Bobby Bowden was
bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they would beat us like that,'' Bowden said.
``I was
</P>
<P>
   surprised we fell apart. N.C. State played great. They won the
football
</P>
<P>
   game.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Wolfpack snared its final interception of the game,
the fans, who stood and mocked Florida State's tomahawk chop in the
final few minutes, gathered on the edges of the field. Finally,
with 20 seconds remaining, they could wait no longer, pouring from
the end line and enveloping the two goal posts and the N.C. State
sideline like ants at a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   As supporters ripped down the goal post at the north end of the
field, one fan spread out face-up at the 30, stuck like a postage
stamp to the turf, perhaps in total disbelief, certainly oblivious
to the din around him.
</P>
<P>
   As the Wolfpack fans paraded around the stadium with their
trophy, carrying the upright on their shoulders like workers toting
a telephone pole, fans at the other end pulled and pushed on the
south post.
</P>
<P>
   It bent but refused to break, much like State's defense, which
gave up 439 yards, but made huge plays throughout the game. The
clincher came with Florida State trailing 16-7 early in the fourth
quarter but on the move. On third-and-5 from the State 34, Weinke
saw Warrick open in the left flat for the first down. But the ball
deflected off Warrick's shoulder pads and into the hands of Anthony
Cason.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far, this is a great achievement,'' said Cason, a freshman
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on defense made big plays when they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, Barnette found Holt streaking between two FSU
defenders down the near sideline and hit him in full stride at the
Seminole 30. Holt, the object of some ridicule by Seminole players
in the media during the week, made sure FSU knew who he was by
scoring his seventh touchdown against the 'Noles in two meetings, a
score which sewed up the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got behind both of them and Jamie made a good pass,''
Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, that's what we needed. It was a big play down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU started things off with a big play of its own when Weinke
found Warrick behind the State defense on a slant pattern covering
74 yards and giving the Seminoles a quick 7-0 lead. But Florida
State never found the end zone the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, N.C. State looked like the poised, veteran team, as
Barnette
</P>
<P>
   calmly nailed Eric Leak for a 31-yard score with 5:34 to play in
the first quarter, capping a 99-yard drive in which the Pack
converted on three straight third-down attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Then Holt stunned the Seminoles on his long punt return on FSU's
next
</P>
<P>
   possession, looking like a human pinball as he bounced off
tacklers and
</P>
<P>
   outraced others, cutting back across the field for the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was gone when I broke that last tackle,'' Holt said.
``We knew we could win the game.''

BURN CONTROLS PLAYOFF DESTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dangling postseason hopes and an unbending opponent were not
enough to keep the Dallas Burn from a date with the dramatic on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Major League Soccer woke up Friday morning wondering
what the Burn has tucked away for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (14-15) closes its MLS home schedule against the San Jose
Clash (10-18) today at the Cotton Bowl. Burn defender Jorge
Rodriguez punched in a last-second goal on Thursday to edge the
Chicago Fire, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-place Burn (34 points) erased a 2-1 deficit and has
its destiny firmly in hand with three regular-season matches
remaining. A victory could give the Burn some breathing room, even
affording them the chance to lose one of their final two games.
</P>
<P>
   After today, matches against Kansas City (32 points) and
third-place Colorado (35) remain, with both teams in the hunt for
the final two MLS Western Conference playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win was really big as far as our comfortability level,''
Burn coach Dave Dir said. ``If we take care of these two games,
that really puts Kansas City's back against the wall playing us at
their place.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's winning attack that covered 100 yards in 12
seconds, Burn players spoke of momentum and good fortune at the
right time of year. Dir, though, says beware of recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask for better timing,'' Dir said. ``We have to take
care of a rested San Jose. We're a team that doesn't do good when
they relax. We've had some big wins before.''
</P>
<P>
   Five wins that the Burn considered big this season _ against
Colorado (twice), two-time MLS champion DC United, West leader Los
Angeles and New York/New Jersey _ all preceded losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look closely at a win like this,'' Burn goalkeeper
Mark Dodd said of Thursday's victory. ``We were fortunate to come
out ahead. Until the last few minutes, I don't know if we won the
second half. We can take confidence and momentum from this but also
understand that every game is do or die.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose is all but eliminated from the MLS playoffs, having
lost eight consecutive road games. When healthy, forward Eric
Wynalda (six goals) has been off his game most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cerritos (12 goals, nine assists) has picked up some
slack for a Clash team that has occupied the MLS West basement for
two seasons.

MITCHELL'S DEBUT MEMORABLE FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When flanker Jim McElroy moved on last year
and took his team-leading 47 catches with him, UCLA coach Bob
Toledo went back to the drawing board. A Disney artist must have
met him there because the character the Bruins lined up at flanker
Saturday is more animated than Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   To describe Freddie Mitchell as excited about making his Bruins
debut against the Texas Longhorns is like saying the Bruins looked
good in their home and season opener. Both observations, though
technically correct, are paler shades of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Mitchell was higher than the Met Life blimp
hovering overhead, and the sixth-ranked Bruins looked like a team
that could rise all the way to No.1 by the season's end. Their
49-31 dismantling of the Longhorns in front of a sun-splashed crowd
of 73,070 was as impressive as last year's 66-3 drubbing insofar as
the 1997 Texas team literally gave the game away, committing eight
turnovers that led to 42 of UCLA's points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had to earn their rout this time around, which they
did with a huge assist from Mitchell. On a day when two Heisman
Trophy contenders _ UCLA quarterback Cade McNown and Texas running
back Ricky Williams _ graced the Rose Bowl stage, the redshirt
freshman stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out last season because of academic deficiencies,
Mitchell definitely was ready for his close-up. His teammates knew
it, too, having gotten an eyeful of his circus act at practices.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else would figure it out soon enough; Mitchell's first
two receptions were on pivotal third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   Senior strong safety Larry Atkins, who has the unenviable task
of trying to stop Mitchell day in and day out at Spaulding Field,
sidled up to his twitching teammate before the opening kickoff and
said, ``Remember, Freddie, they don't know anything about you
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell then went out and blew his cover _ and effectively the
game _ wide open. He threw for the Bruins' first touchdown in the
third minute of the first quarter, broke a 30-yard run on a reverse
two possessions later to set up another score, crossed the goal
line himself on a sizzling 79-yard catch-and-carry midway through
the fourth quarter and returned punts and kickoffs for good
measure.
</P>
<P>
   If he seemed reluctant to leave the field, there was good
reason: playing football is like breathing for Mitchell and after
having to hold his breath for 22 months he was relishing every
gulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's a real emotional player and he had all this energy
building up,'' said sophomore split end Brian Poli-Dixon, who was
on the receiving end of Mitchell's 34-yard throw off a reverse that
capped a seven-play, 80-yard opening drive. It was a bull's-eye
befitting a guy who'll grace the Bruins' outfield come baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just reared back and gave it, well, not all I have but a
little bit,'' Mitchell said, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt about it in my mind I was going to do
good,'' he added. ``I knew there were people probably saying,
`Well, he's awesome at practices but can he do it in a game?' I
used that as motivation. I was really looking forward to showing
people what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Bruins program doubted Mitchell would find success
on the field. But it took a while for Toledo and his staff to
impress upon him that he had to hit the books as hard as he did the
seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just me being ignorant,'' Mitchell said, shrugging. ``I'm
really glad coach Toledo redshirted me last year. Like any other
freshman, you want to come in here and play right away. But I
wasn't ready to handle football and baseball and school. (The
coaches) pushed me. They kept telling me, you put as much time into
school as you do football, you'll succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough, right? If only it were so, the sports
landscape wouldn't be littered with supremely skilled athletes who
fritter away bright futures because they can't overcome their
something, be it their own inertia or ignorance or childhoods or
whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is determined not to become one of them. That's why
there are doctoral candidates who would be hard-pressed to match
the intensity with which he tackles football. Even last year when
he wasn't playing, he would lay his body out like a throw rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits so hard in practices, he comes off the field sometimes
with a bloody forehead,'' senior guard Andy Meyers said. ``We all
knew Freddie was going to do something amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Meyers said something that should turn the rest of the
Bruins' opponents into instant insomniacs: ``What you saw today
from Freddie is just a small taste of what you're going to see for
the next 11 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 19, has great instincts, on and off the field. He was
recruited by Florida State out of Kathleen High in Lakeland, Fla.
The Seminoles already had a stable of receivers but that's not the
primary reason Mitchell moved clear across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people in Florida,'' Mitchell said, ominously.
``I wanted to try to stay away from all the bad apples and get in
with a good bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Longhorns, Mitchell and the Bruins were good to the
core.

CLINTON ADVISERS WAIT FOR PUBLIC REACTION TO LATEST DEVELOPMENTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand and refine)   By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's closest advisers waited
nervously Saturday to see whether the most audacious political
gamble of his career _ declaring last month that he told the truth
when he swore he did not have a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky _ would cause the public to turn on his inquisitors rather
than on him.
</P>
<P>
   The president's advisers and Starr's allies blamed each other
today for prosecutors' packing explicit details about Clinton's
dalliances with Ms. Lewinsky into their 445-page report made public
on Friday by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the grand jury on Aug. 17, Clinton insisted that
he told the truth during his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit in January, when he denied having had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The ``inappropriate intimate
contact'' he had with Ms. Lewinsky, he said, did not fit the
definition of sexual relations used by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, but he
repeatedly refused to answer prosecutors' questions about the
specific nature of the contact.
</P>
<P>
   After testifying to the grand jury, Clinton declared to the
public that his denials under oath were ``legally accurate.''
Clinton's advisers said he had no choice legally but to make that
argument. His only other option was to admit that he committed
perjury in his Jones deposition. ``Out of the question,'' an
adviser said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers also said they had seen a potential avenue of
attack if Starr responded to the president's testimony by releasing
an avalanche of embarrassing sexual details in his report. As a
result, the advisers said, Clinton's decision to stick with his
denial of perjury _ and refusal to answer questions about specific
contacts _ merged his political and legal strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense that Starr might feel compelled to put all this
sex stuff in, to try to prove that the president lied,'' one
associate of Clinton said. ``There was talk that if he did that, we
could say there was nothing to the serious charges and all this
amounts to is a sex report.''
</P>
<P>
   The associate said the White House had been startled by the
sexual detail in the report, and was fearful of how the nation
would react.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his prosecutors have long been concerned over
accusations that they have functioned as ``sex police,'' a
criticism made with rising volume from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles G. Bakaly III, said on May 31 that
the Lewinsky inquiry ``is not about sex. This case is about
perjury, subornation of perjury, witness tampering, obstruction of
justice.'' Clinton's lawyers provided that quotation in the first
sentence of their 42-page rebuttal, which was released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the prosecutors took pains to blame the
president for the release of ``highly personal information,''
including ``sexually explicit'' material.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfortunate, but it is essential,'' Starr wrote. ``The
president's defense to many of the allegations is based on a close
parsing of the definitions that were used to describe his conduct.
We have, after careful review, identified no manner of providing
the information that reveals the falsity of the president's
statements other than to describe his conduct with precision.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also dismissed criticism, leveled by Clinton himself, that
his prosecutors had tried to ``criminalize my private life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The regrettable fact that the investigation has often required
witnesses to discuss sensitive personal matters has fueled this
perception,'' Starr wrote. ``All Americans, including the
president, are entitled to enjoy a private family life, free from
public or governmental scrutiny. But the privacy concerns raised in
this case are subject to limits.''
</P>
<P>
   One limit, Starr said, is unique to Clinton's job as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the enormous trust and responsibility attended to
his high office,'' Starr wrote, ``the president has a manifest duty
to ensure that his conduct at all times complies with the law of
the land.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the first page of their rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers
mocked Starr's ``pious defense'' of his ``pornographic
specificity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that `sex' is precisely what this four-and-a-half
year investigation has boiled down to,'' the lawyers wrote. ``The
referral is so loaded with irrelevant and unnecessary graphic and
salacious allegations that only one conclusion is possible: its
principal purpose is to damage the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The president had repeatedly assured congressional Democrats in
recent days that there would be ``no surprises'' in the report.
Most of the sex acts it described had already been disclosed in
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   There was a palpable sense of relief at the White House on
Saturday about the evidence cited by Starr to support the charges
that the president had abused the power of his office and
obstructed justice. Clinton's advisers said they felt confident
that their rebuttal would refute these accusations.
</P>
<P>
   They reserved their harshest comments for Starr's descriptions
of intimate sexual details, which underpinned his claims that the
president lied to the grand jury and perjured himself in the Jones
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he'd do this,'' one adviser to Clinton said. ``He
couldn't help himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides have been warning reporters for days that
the report would be full of sexual matters. And on Saturday, they
portrayed Clinton as the victim of overzealous prosecutors, raising
the specter of the government intruding into a consensual sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is so overwhelmingly about sex,'' one
administration official said. ``Say what you will about Bill
Clinton, you have the power of the federal government investigating
somebody's private life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior aide to Clinton said Starr was using a ``stampede
strategy,'' highlighting intimate matters to try to disgust the
public. Details such as the fact that Clinton was talking on the
telephone with a congressman during a sex act, this aide said, were
not relevant to the accusation that he lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Although another friend of Clinton acknowledged deep worry over
how the public would respond to the lurid details, he said the
White House would step up its attacks on the report's sexual
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a penny-ante high school sex novel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of its aggressive strategy, the White House is
planning on Sunday to take the unusual step of dispatching
Clinton's legal team to attack Starr's report on television. David
E. Kendall, the president's private lawyer; Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel; John D. Podesta, the deputy chief-of-staff;
and two other members of the counsel's office, Cheryl Mills and
Lanny Breuer, are all scheduled to appear.

BLUE JAYS BEAT YANKEES, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees needed the gregarious David Wells
Saturday like a party needs music. Something to liven up the joint.
A reason for everyone to find their groove.
</P>
<P>
   But the suddenly so-so Yankees, a playoff team in waiting,
continued their pedestrian pace toward the post-season by losing,
5-3, Saturday to the Blue Jays, the team's 13th loss in 24 games.
For the moment, the Yankees' label of greatness has begun to peel
and chip just a bit during the dead air between the regular season
and post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this lull is because of a lack of urgency a team has when
it has already clinched its position. Or perhaps it is the
spring-training mode the Yankees are in as Manager Joe Torre rests
his starters in turns. Whatever the reason, there was a hint of
unease at Yankee Stadium Saturday as the Blue Jays walked away with
a quiet victory.
</P>
<P>
   There did not seem to be any residue left after the
bench-clearing fight between these teams on Friday night. Nothing
about the Yankees appeared threatening on Saturday as they bowed
out before the 23-year-old Chris Carpenter, who gave up just three
hits and one earned run in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not happy in there,'' Torre said, sitting in his
office outside the locker room. ``We want to win. But I think we
can rise to the occasion for the playoffs. We're playing well, but
you lack a certain amount of intensity. I think we'll be ready when
the playoffs come. Right now, there's nothing at stake except the
records, which won't consume us.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, agreed. He did
not seem overly concerned about his team's recent mediocrity or the
fact that the Yankees (102-44) are watching their chance to break
the major league record for victories (116), set by the 1906 Cubs,
become next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records don't mean anything,'' Steinbrenner said. ``What means
something is getting to the World Series. That's what means
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Yankees, who have 16 games left, would still like
to set the club record for victories (110). But doing so would
require mustering some fire to break them from their recent funk.
</P>
<P>
   So often, Wells has inspired and provided an edginess to this
team. The twitching, uniform-tugging pitcher has been someone the
Yankees can latch on to, even as their starting rotation has grown
unsteady of late. This fact had been especially true at Yankee
Stadium this year, where he was 11-0 as his day began.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells never secured command of his pitches, which was clear
when he allowed an 0-2 curveball to dangle like a soap bubble
before Tony Fernandez in the sixth inning. Fernandez smacked the
pitch for a triple that scored two runs and gave the Blue Jays a
5-2 lead. Wells responded by angrily snatching his shirttails out
of his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jersey always gets turned around anyway, so I might as well
tear it out,'' said Wells (17-4), who allowed four earned runs and
committed an error to allow another run in six innings of work.
With just two starts left, he will fall short of a 20-victory
season. ``I can't blame anyone but myself today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been the norm for the Yankees. Throughout the year,
they have been the team that has balled up and discarded opponents.
Now the Yankees seem like a harmless team biding its time, waiting
for the post-season to begin. Wells, for one, is not satisfied with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why go halfway? Why not go hard?'' Wells said. ``Why let up?
You can still spoil someone else getting into the playoffs. These
guys hate losing as much as I do. There are no ifs ands or buts
about it.''

SHARPTON-LED MARCH GETS WARM RECEPTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Denouncing a Labor Day parade float that featured
white men, including two firefighters and at least one police
officer, wearing blackface in Queens County, the Rev. Al Sharpton
and more than 100 supporters marched peacefully into the tiny
island community of Broad Channel, where some white residents
welcomed them with lemonade, water and crumb cake.
</P>
<P>
   The warm reception in the neighborhood of the parade offered a
striking contrast to the marches of the late 1980s that Sharpton
frequently led through predominantly white neighborhoods in
response to bias crimes. During those demonstrations, he was often
cursed with racial epithets and taunted with watermelon. At one
march, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in 1991, Sharpton was stabbed in
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, as the marchers neared Cross Bay Veterans Memorial
Bridge, which links the Rockaway Peninsula to Broad Channel, they
were met by a banner proclaiming, ``Welcome to Broad Channel, Rev.
Al and Rev. Gray. Pray for us, we will pray for you. Let's pray
together.'' The Rev. Evan D. Gray is pastor of Macedonia Baptist
Church in Far Rockaway, where the march began.
</P>
<P>
   The refreshments and banner were organized by Dan Tubridy of
Broad Channel, who is a restaurant owner, and his brother, Tim
Tubridy. ``There really isn't any disharmony,'' Tim Tubridy said.
``And we want to get the word out what a beautiful community Broad
Channel is.'' He described the float as ``a comedy act gone wild
and blown way out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   The float, which was caught on home video and then broadcast on
television, included what appeared to be a re-enactment of the
dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was killed in
Texas. ``On the video some people were laughing and clapping,''
Sharpton said before the march. ``So we want to walk through that
neighborhood and let them now it's not funny to us.''
</P>
<P>
   As they marched, some people chanted slogans, including,
``Respect for James Byrd!'' and ``No justice, no peace!'' Several
of the marchers wore T-shirts from the youth rally in Harlem on
Sept. 5 that ended in a confrontation with the police. And there
was frequent criticism at yesterday's march of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for his handling of the Harlem rally.
</P>
<P>
   As Gray spoke to the crowd gathered in a park in Broad Channel
for a prayer vigil, an airplane landing at nearby Kennedy
International Airport drowned out his words. Sharpton quipped, ``It
ain't no helicopter, don't worry,'' referring to the police
helicopter that had flown low over the crowd in Harlem at the youth
rally.

 &HT;    Schools see an increase need for nurses
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- School starts at 7:15 a.m. at Dayton's Colonel
White High School. Within five minutes, nurse Diane Judy has her
first patient, a girl complaining of wisdom tooth pain.
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession, the girl is followed by another suffering
from a sore throat and fever, a third experiencing a headache and a
fourth complaining of dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   So begins another typical day for the petite dark-haired nurse,
who drapes a blue and silver stethoscope around her neck as she
takes care of one crisis after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they follow me down the hall when I come in in the
morning,'' Judy said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide 1,000 school nurses are employed by the 611 school
districts, illustrating how unique Dayton's staff of 54 nurses is,
said Betty Holton, Dayton's director of health services.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the availability of school nurses ranges from none in
Trotwood-Madison to Dayton and Fairborn's one nurse per building
policies. Some districts, including Xenia, have clinic aides
available in the nurse's absence. Others contract out with nurses
to complete state-mandated screenings and rely on school
secretaries and principals to take care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dayton ups the ante by unveiling a 39-foot traveling
clinic staffed by physicians who, unlike school nurses, will
prescribe medicines. Funded in part by the state, the Physicians
Charitable Foundation and United HealthCare of Ohio, the clinic
will travel from school to school every day and be used for
screening, health education and a variety of other health-related
tasks. Holton sees it as a logical extension of a school-based
health care system that she believes is making a real difference in
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   She bristles at the idea that schools should stick to education
and leave health care to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are part of the educational team and part of
education is having these support services available,'' said
Holton, leaning forward in her chair. ``It saves lives, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   School nurses perform a variety of state-mandated jobs _
maintaining immunization records, screening for hearing and eye
problems _ and trying to control outbreaks of head lice, ringworm
and pink eye. They're also in the classroom, teaching about proper
hygiene, AIDS, sexuality, hypertension and substance abuse. Many
times they're the ones who notice signs that a child is suicidal or
has been abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of our school nursing is counseling because the
kids come in with a lot of problems,'' Judy said .
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the meds: the ubiquitous Ritalin and asthma
medications and a variety of other medicine that must be given to
as many as 30 children a day at some Dayton schools. With the
mainstreaming of many medically fragile children, school nurses are
caring for students with feeding tubes and catheters and some who
are on heavy-duty psychotropic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, E.J. Brown Elementary nurse Sandy Gordon was taking
care of two ill youngsters when nine youngsters filed in for their
midday medicine. Some were literally bouncing around her tiny
office, unable to stand still as she carefully handed out little
white cups of water with their doses and recorded their names.
</P>
<P>
   She said sometimes the kids who come to her office just need a
little tender loving care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Band-Aids go really far. Sometimes they just want the
attention of someone putting a Band-Aid on them,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, it is not a school nurse taking care of these
duties. Most area schools, and those across the state, have nurses
traveling between buildings.
</P>
<P>
   For the traveling nurse, it's a matter of packing the car with
everything that might be needed and then moving, really fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between checking (immunization) records and checking heads I
am going crazy,'' said Xenia school nurse Sandy Pramer, who shares
the district's 10 buildings with another nurse. ``I think it's not
fair to the kids, it's not fair to me. We're just short-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's Greenmont Elementary secretary Corene Taylor said
she's in charge of medical problems about four days a week in the
district, which has six nurses who serve 11 elementary and middle
schools and a full-time nurse for the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days it's not bad, some days it's a bother,'' Taylor
said, adding that she always feels inadequate when she's not sure
if an injury is serious. When in doubt, Taylor said she always
calls the parent to come look or take the child to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Judy said one advantage to having a full-time nurse is fewer
kids get sent home because the nurse knows real-sick from
fake-sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I let everybody go home that came to me and said, 'I just
threw up in the bathroom,' I'd be sending home the multitude,''
Judy said.
</P>
<P>
   Her constant emphasis with the students is to stay in school and
she views the school nurse's job as one of teaching preventive
health care and treating health problems, both with the goal of
cutting down on the number of absences.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton and Fairborn have found the money to fully staff schools
because they believe it is a critical need, said Holton and Joy
Paolo, Fairborn's administrative assistant for student services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If children are not healthy, they're not going to learn,''
Holton said.
</P>
<P>
   Holton has used what she calls ``creative funding'' to build
Dayton's $1.7 million health services program. She even has
Medicaid HMOs reimbursing the district for physicals and special
treatments nurses perform on Medicaid-eligible students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to feel that we're on the cutting edge of districts in
the country,'' Holton said.

 &HT;    Ole Miss is 17-0 victim of Auburn `vendetta'
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ Yes, Virginia, there is an Auburn. An Auburn
defense, certainly, but now even a whiff of offense, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after being humbled at home on national TV by
Virginia, Auburn vented in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like a vendetta,'' said fullback Heath Evans,
who scored the second touchdown Saturday in Auburn's 17-0 shutout
of Ole Miss in the SEC opener for both teams. Nothing personal,
mind you. The Tigers (1-1, 1-0 SEC), who have beaten Mississippi
(1-1, 0-1) in 15 of their last 16 meetings, have started to atone
for their 19-0 loss to Virginia on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not as good as we think we are, but we are not as bad
as we played last week,'' said coach Terry Bowden, now 12-1 in
games after a loss at Auburn. ``Neither one of those teams on the
field today are as good as Virginia. We are a good football team
but we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, when LSU comes to Auburn, followed by
Tennessee, then road games at Mississippi State and Florida. The
specter of an 0-6 start, and the memory of a dismal opener, gave
Auburn a real sense of urgency Saturday. But for the largest crowd
in Vaught-Hemingway Stadium history, one of the few chances to
revel came during a PA announcement: ``Today's attendance,
48,371.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got us a good old-fashioned lesson in reality
checks,'' said Ole Miss coach Tommy Tuberville, whose Rebels mauled
Memphis 30-10 in their opener. ``It was back to the SEC.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after passing for 332 yards and two touchdowns in his
first start, Ole Miss sophomore quarterback Romaro Miller was
11-for-35 for 104 yards, with two interceptions and three sacks.
``Some birthday, huh?'' said Miller, who turned 20 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Leard, this was Christmas in September. ``The reason I
came to Auburn,'' said the sophomore from Hartwell, Ga., ``is for
the way we played today.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Virginia, Leard looked like what he was: A kid making
his first collegiate start against a stifling defense that harassed
him all night. Leard was 11-for-25 for 146 yards against Virginia,
was sacked twice and fumbled each time. Not so Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really comfortable,'' said Leard, sacked just once
while going 16-for-27 for 195 yards and Auburn's first touchdown, a
28-yard fade pattern to Karsten Bailey that kick-started Auburn to
a 14-0 first-quarter lead and left Leard jumping in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he looked far more composed than against Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as eager, wasn't as anxious, wasn't as nervous,''
Leard said. ``I wasn't quick to look at things. It was fun, really
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Auburn used bootleg action and threw to the
fullback and tight end extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing for us is we're 1-0 in the SEC,'' Leard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Virginia's a memory.

 &HT;    New-look defense revives Tech
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the 36,382 fans at Bobby Dodd Stadium who came to see
Georgia Tech pick up the pieces after last week's 10 point
season-opening loss to Boston College, the trip was well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets, determined to show they were a different
team from a week ago, used hapless New Mexico State to prove their
point.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defense bowed up to keep the Aggies' option offense
stymied, and Charles Wiley rushed for touchdowns of 2, 1 and 14
yards Saturday as the Yellow Jackets took care of their task and
New Mexico State 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   The same defensive unit that gave up 41 points and 491 yards to
Boston College wasn't budging against New Mexico State. This week's
version of the Tech defense featured some new looks: gang tackles,
sacks, turnovers, substitutions, blitzes, goal-line stands and
zeros.
</P>
<P>
   The front seven stayed fresh with full-scale substitutions,
first by series and later by situations. Defensive linemen were
making stops up front and applying pressure on quarterback Ty
Houghtaling.
</P>
<P>
   About the time it looked like Tech's defense was finally
starting to wear down, the Yellow Jackets came up with a big play.
New Mexico State had just scored its first touchdown to cap a
63-yard drive and had the ball again deep in Tech territory
following a Joe Burns fumble at Tech's 22-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But when Houghtaling went for receiver A.T. Holloway on a post
pattern just short of the end zone, freshman safety Chris Young
delivered a hit on his back to jar the ball loose and junior
Travares Tillman cradled in an interception at the 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jacket offense responded with a 98-yard scoring drive
to put the game away. They faced some adversity of their own, with
a third-and-11 play from the 1, but Joe Hamilton found Dez White
for a 47-yard bomb. White had beat Demetric Norwood to a jump ball
deep, and kept his balance to run for another couple of yards
before Marsey Hawley brought him down. Tech scored five plays later
on Wiley's third scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was time to give some young players a test.
George Godsey filled in at quarterback, Burns scored his first
collegiate touchdown and freshman Kelly Campbell made his first
catch.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State, which was the 2-9 a year ago, had scored 36
points against Texas. Not this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets had a shutout through the first half, and in
that time forced three turnovers, held New Mexico State short on
two fourth-down attempts and used a Matt Uremovich interception to
end the Aggies' longest trip into Tech territory. Outside
linebacker Delaunta Cameron scored on touchdown on a fumble return
and set up another with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico State running back Denvis Manns, who's trying to
become only the third player ever to rush for 1,000 yards in four
consecutive seasons, had 61 yards in the first half, and 31 of that
came on one run.
</P>
<P>
   That run gave the Aggies their best first-half scoring
opportunity, but defensive end Nate Stimson helped thwart it by
getting his hand on a Ty Houghtaling pass at the line, allowing
Uremovich to make an interception at Tech's 6.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Rogers jump-started Tech's scoring with a 52-yard punt
return three minutes into the game, starting past defenders up the
right side, then cutting back left where he ran into punter Andy
Kohl, who eventually pulled him down 2 yards shy of the end zone.
Charles Wiley bulled in off left tackle on the next play to give
Tech got something it hadn't had yet this season _ a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton missed his first five targets in the first quarter
before finally hitting David Powell near the left sideline for a
30-yard gain on third-and-13 to the New Mexico State 35. The Aggie
defense then loosened up against the run, as Tech rushed the next
seven plays and scored on a 1-yard Wiley run off right tackle for a
14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   From there it became a quick strike attack with the defense
getting in on the act. Outside linebacker Cameron was the
beneficiary of a Jesse Tarplin sack, as he picked up the resulting
Houghtaling fumble and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown to make
it 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of penalties, Cameron got his hands on the ball
again, intercepting Houghtaling and returning it seven yards to the
Aggie 28. Two plays later, Hamilton found Dez White open in
one-on-one coverage in the end zone for a 24-yard touchdown and a
28-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next Tech series, Hamilton apparently jammed the ring
finger on his left (nonthrowing) hand and spent the final few
minutes of the first half on the bench with an ice pack on his
hand. He returned at the start of the second half.

 &HT;    Alexander continues to impress as Tide rolls
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ On what would have been Bear Bryant's 85th
birthday, Alabama gave the legendary coach reason to squirm in his
grave Saturday afternoon at Legion Field. Vanderbilt had no regard
for the occasion, performing at a level well above that of a team
perpetually at the bottom of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Commodores did for a while. They led by a touchdown
early and trailed by just seven points at halftime.Then, the
Crimson Tide flexed its considerable muscle and, with running back
Shaun Alexander solidifying his Heisman Trophy candidacy, Alabama
manhandled Vanderbilt in the second half en route to a 32-7 victory
before a crowd of 81,091. It was Alabama's 15th straight triumph
over Vanderbilt, which lost an SEC game for the 18th consecutive
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's encouraging,'' said quarterback John David Phillips,
who had a 31-yard scoring pass to Quincy Jackson, ``is that we
haven't played our best yet. Our best game is still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is showing that he's among the country's best. He had
113 yards in the first quarter en route to 206 on 20 carries.
Alexander scored three touchdowns after getting 115 yards and five
TDs against Brigham Young last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My offensive line is making plays,'' Alexander said. ``They
like to see me score, and I like to make them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Alabama coach Mike DuBose: ``I don't know if a player in
the country is doing more than Shaun Alexander.''
</P>
<P>
   While the junior back was brilliant, with scoring runs of 36, 8
and 35 yards, the Bama defense keyed the conquest. Other than a
lapse on Vandy's second possession that allowed a 50-yard David
Wallace-to-Tavarus Hogans touchdown pass for a 7-0 Commodores lead
with 9:06 left in the first quarter, Alabama's D was dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Vanderbilt's net rushing total was minus 33 yards
on 27 carries. The Tide had nine sacks for minus 58 yards and
registered two safeties in the third quarter. On the first,
Wallace, with two Crimson Tide players in pursuit in the end zone,
was called for intentional grounding _ a safety that moved
Alabama's lead up to 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   Two possessions later, Vanderbilt started on the 16-yard line
and ended up back in the end zone, as Wallace was sacked for
another safety. Vandy probably will not see another back like
Alexander. He shuns talk of the Heisman with a bright smile saying,
``Whatever happens, happens. I just want to help our team win.
That's it. I won't get caught up in Heisman talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Others will. ``I'm saying it now,'' Tide cornerback Fernando
Bryant said, ``Shaun for the Heisman. Why not?''

MALONE IS BEST BET TO REVIVE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Kevin Malone signs with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Mike Piazza signs with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the more important hire? It's Malone, the former
minor-league second baseman from Cleveland, who paid his dues
scouting the San Fernando Valley a decade ago and now joins the
Dodgers as their new general manager after four years in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza might have been the best position player in Los Angeles
Dodgers history, but the team still wasn't going to win a
championship bringing him back as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is the one who can get this organization back to where it
belongs. A lot will depend on who stays and who goes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Friday introductory news conference the dais bridged the
old and the new.
</P>
<P>
   There was Peter O'Malley, who in June rambled on and on about
his support for firing Bill Russell and top lieutenant Fred Claire.
Friday he was catatonic. He just returned from a trip to Singapore,
but he looked like he had just come back from 50 years of
last-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Peter Chernin, who represents new owner Rupert
Murdoch. He wanted to blame injuries on this season's collapse but
really hired Malone to run the bulldozer. Most of all, the man who
green-lighted ``Titanic'' wants the Dodgers to run themselves and
make lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   New Dodgers president Bob Graziano spent most of his time
thanking Tom Lasorda for stepping into the wreckage in June and
adding a positive spin. Graziano has ideas, but Claire, often
criticized for not being a baseball man, was more responsible for
O'Malley's success the past 30 years than anyone will ever know. He
should have been made club president for a couple years to ease the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Lasorda, who got the new title of senior vice
president for putting his health at risk the past three months. He
worked hard, probably too hard at age 71. He improved the starting
lineup with trades but depleted the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda doesn't want to return to the banquet circuit where
Claire exiled him. He wants input in building the Dodgers. Malone's
biggest trick might not be trying to sign a No. 1 starter, but
finding a way to keep Tommy happy and involved.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean re-signing Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has told former teammates that the Dodgers are not in his
future. He also has conceded that at age 30, he can no longer catch
every day and that the the designated hitter might have to become
part of his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is losing and their free agents didn't help. Piazza
would help. The New York Mets will try to keep him, driving up the
asking price, but Piazza knows where the future is.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore also is losing its general manager, Pat Gillick, who
is planning to retire at the end of the year and move back to
Toronto where he built two World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd that Malone would leave Baltimore with Gillick
stepping down, but it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Peter Angelos operates at his own schedule. He
wasn't going to let anyone who works for him dictate the timetable
for naming a new general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos probably would have given Malone the job, Piazza and a
very nice payroll. This year's was $71 million and it didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably the amount Fox will give Malone. With two weeks
left in the season, let the games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Good buddy: Turns out that Mark McGwire kept a promise when he
mentioned former A's teammate Jim Corsi during his postgame press
conference Tuesday after hitting the record 62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had returned Corsi's congratulatory phone call during
the day. During their conversation, Corsi told McGwire how his Red
Sox teammates had been ribbing him about his ``supposed''
friendship with the record-breaking slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been kidding me in here, saying stuff like, `If he's
such a good friend, why doesn't he fly you out there?''' Corsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark told me, `If I hit it tonight (Tuesday), I'll mention you
in the postgame conference.' I said that's all right. That will
shut these guys up.... But for him to even remember to do that was
beyond the call of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, McGwire's mention of Corsi during his big night
only intensified the ribbing. Corsi, however, seemed intent on
getting the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy over there (Tom Gordon) said, `If he mentions you in
his press conference, I'll carry your bags.' So, there's my little
bellhop over there,'' Corsi said, pointing at Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi asked his wife to put a tape in the VCR to record the
postgame ceremonies in St. Louis. He had just seen McGwire receive
his Cardinal-red 1962 Corvette when his wife entered the room.
``She had tears in her eyes,'' Corsi said. ``I asked her if
something was wrong. She said, `No, did you hear the press
conference?' Then she told me about it and my eyes welled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Corsi can just get one more favor from McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Corvette and said, `God, that's my favorite car, a
'61 or '62 Vette,'' Corsi said, then noted one reason McGwire might
be persuaded to part with the car. ``He can't fit in that car,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Yanks clinch: The Yankees' victory over the Red Sox on Wednesday
represented their 102nd victory and increased their lead to 20{
games, matching the widest gap in franchise history, set in 1941.
The Yankees also clinched the AL East on Wednesday, the earliest
the Yankees ever have won. The Yankees celebrated wildly in the
visitors' clubhouse at Fenway _ a surprising outburst, considering
they've controlled the division since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember hearing Mark McGwire saying once that the A's got
so used to winning, that one year they didn't even celebrate after
they won (the West),'' Tino Martinez said. ``Turns out he didn't
get to the playoffs again for something like six-seven years, so I
made up my mind not to pass up a chance like this, even though we
all knew this day was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Yankees were privately critical of the Cubs' reaction to
McGwire's historic home run Tuesday night, wondering how they
could've allowed themselves to be swept up in the post-62
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered how Gary Gaetti could've bear-hugged McGwire at
third base, and why Sammy Sosa didn't wait until after the game to
pay his respects. Joe Torre said that Bob Gibson, his former
teammate and a Hall of Famer, would've never offered a handshake on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made everybody happy, and that's great,'' Torre said.
``Both (McGwire) and Sammy are class acts. But if I'm (Cubs pitcher
Steve) Trachsel, I'm having a hard time with everybody hugging
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still angry: Mickey Morandini, with the Phillies during much of
J.D. Drew's bitter contract battle with the team, was playing
second base for the Cubs on Tuesday night when Drew made his
major-league debut by looking at a called third strike for the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of a pennant race, so we're not real
worried about J.D. Drew,'' Morandini said. ``But over the long
haul, I think he'll be perceived as a kid who was a little bit
greedy, a guy that hadn't played an inning of major-league baseball
and wanted to be paid like a superstar. I know a lot of Philly
players already stated their opinion about it and I'm sure a lot of
players feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who hit his first homer the next night in Cincinnati,
admitted that in his minor-league stops in Little Rock and Memphis,
he endured some abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd run into fans here and there and it could get pretty
hectic at times,'' he said. ``But it's not really that bad and it's
one of those things that I expect. Hopefully, in two years, it will
all be beyond us. The people who come out to watch hopefully will
respect the way I play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Morandini warned the worst is yet to come. And it will come next
Aug. 9, 10 and 11 when Drew makes his initial appearance in
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``As loud as it has been here with the cheers (for McGwire),
that's how loud the boos will be there,'' Morandini said.
</P>
<P>
   Fish story: After earning his first win since July 28 with a 6-0
win over the Angels on Tuesday night, Minnesota's Brad Radke
remained at a loss to explain his 0-for-August. He has made no
major adjustments. He has not changed his mechanics. He feels fine.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Radke did do on this trip, though, was skip the
scallops when he went out to dinner Monday night. But that's not
new, either.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming so violently ill last October after eating a
scallops dinner that he wound up losing 20 pounds, Radke has
changed his eating pattern.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think that his prolonged illness last fall has
directly related to his disappointing season because he's been back
to his usual 185 pounds since April. But he was lighter in spring
training and, well, he has never come close to matching his 20-win
season in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year really took a lot out of me, mentally, going through
the (12-game) winning streak,'' Radke said. ``What (Mark) McGwire's
doing is a heck of a lot more important but, still, when you go
through something like that you're mentally drained.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke thinks that could have contributed to his illness last
fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scallops, or it could be that I was just mentally drained.
It could be either one of those,'' Radke said.

POLL (undated) _ More than two thirds of Arizonans believe
President Clinton lied under oath and more than half believe he
obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair. But Clinton has
never been more popular in the state, according to the Arizona
Poll, based on a telephone interview of 409 state residents between
5 p.m. Friday and noon Saturday. Clinton has a 56 percent approval
rating for the job he is doing, up 1 percentage point from January.
By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ELECTION (Washington) _ The timing of independent prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton's sex scandal _ less
than two months before a national election _ has turned the
November balloting into a virtual referendum on impeachment, some
political analysts say. While the analysts agree that the report
will almost certainly hurt Democrats, Republicans need to watch out
for a backlash. BY ADRIENNE FLYNN. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REBUT (Washington) _ President Clinton's lawyers charged Saturday
that he is the victim of a ``smear campaign'' by a prosecutor bent
on drowning his presidency in a sea of sexually explicit
allegations. ``It is plain that `sex' is precisely what this
four-and-a-half year investigation has boiled down to,'' the White
House said in a second rebuttal of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL;

IMPEACH? BEEN THERE, DONE THAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   A country band had set up an amplifier in the grass outside the
state Senate building and was performing a tribute to Gov. Evan
Mecham. They'd taken the music from the song ``Elvira'' and redid
the lyrics to say, ``Our heart belongs to Ev Mecham.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, the Senate had voted to convict Mecham on
two counts at his impeachment trial. Like a lot of other reporters,
I was heading back to the office.
</P>
<P>
   It was early April, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation and trial of Arizona's governor had gone on
for what seemed like forever. Now, it was over. As I left the
Senate building, however, a man suddenly blocked my way.
</P>
<P>
   He had a head like a jack-o'-lantern, all puffed out and filled
with fire. He moved close enough to bump noses and thumped my chest
with the back of one hand, as if I were a door into which he was
demanding entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me liberty or give me death!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   So he shouted again, ``Give me liberty or give me death!''
</P>
<P>
   I pushed his hand away, saying, ``Give me a break,'' although
not that politely.
</P>
<P>
   He kept shouting, and the country band kept playing, and all
around there were politicians and people carrying pro-Mecham signs
and anti-Mecham signs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest story ever in Arizona, and the biggest story
that night on the national TV news. &QL; 
MUST WE FORGET?
</P>
<P>
   It was proclaimed by all serious analytical souls to be the most
tragic, most difficult, most (fill-in-the-blank) day in the state's
history. A day we all believed we'd never forget.
</P>
<P>
   But, we did.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered the guy outside the Senate but not the country
band. I read about it in an old newspaper clipping. I didn't recall
the names of Mecham's lawyers or his accusers, either, or even the
details of the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   Mecham, then, was like Clinton is now.
</P>
<P>
   There was no middle ground. He was like gun control or capital
punishment or abortion. Everyone had an opinion and those opinions
could not be altered by fact, argument or the verdict of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If you're with him, the Starr report is a dud. He lied under
oath about having sex with a girl, which we already knew. You don't
impeach the guy over sex.
</P>
<P>
   If you're against him, the Starr report is a bomb. He lied under
oath about having sex with a girl, which we already knew. You
impeach him because he lied.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen it happen.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes to it, there will be no fair trial for Clinton, as
there was none for Mecham. Politicians are like the rest of us.
They've already made up their minds, mostly along the lines of what
will get them re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to impeach is no different than a vote on a tax cut or
affirmative action. If they get the votes, it passes, good or bad,
right or wrong, just or unjust. &QL; 
WHAT'S OUR PRICE?
</P>
<P>
   There is a price to pay, too.
</P>
<P>
   It shows itself in anger and confusion. Over the next couple of
weeks, what you'll see on TV and hear on talk radio are hundreds of
people from all walks of life incomprehensibly shouting, ``Give me
liberty or give me death!''
</P>
<P>
   What they really mean is, ``Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But they won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, politicians will talk about fulfilling solemn
obligations and approaching impeachment proceedings with open
minds.
</P>
<P>
   (This particular lie, apparently, is not impeachable.)
</P>
<P>
   And they'll also talk about cleansing government and restoring a
sense of trust, morality and dignity to elected office, the kind of
campaign promises that led, in the wake of the Mecham scandal, to
the election of J. Fife Symington III as governor of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And which kept him in office for six years, right up to the day
he was convicted of fraud in federal court. &QL;

   It shows itself in anger and confusion. Over the next couple of
weeks, what you'll see on TV and hear on talk radio are hundreds of
people from all walks of life incomprehensibly shouting, ``Give me
liberty or give me death!''
</P>
<P>
   What they really mean is, ``Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But they won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, politicians will talk about fulfilling solemn
obligations and approaching impeachment proceedings with open
minds.
</P>
<P>
   (This particular lie, apparently, is not impeachable.)
</P>
<P>
   And they'll also talk about cleansing government and restoring a
sense of trust, morality and dignity to elected office, the kind of
campaign promises that led, in the wake of the Mecham scandal, to
the election of J. Fife Symington III as governor of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And which kept him in office for six years, right up to the day
he was convicted of fraud in federal court. &QL;

 &HT;    Bulldogs Defense gives up 3 points
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Much has changed at Georgia in recent years _
coaches, the transformation of Tailback U. into Air Georgia and,
more recently, losing to winning. But one thing has remained
constant: criticism of the Bulldogs' defense.
</P>
<P>
   That changed as well in Saturday's SEC opener against South
Carolina, when the defense led the 15th-ranked Bulldogs to a 17-3
victory in front of 83,411 fans, the second-largest crowd ever at
Williams-Brice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, Georgia surrendered just one field
goal, and allowed South Carolina only 132 total yards. Gamecocks
quarterback Anthony Wright, who nearly beat the Bulldogs by himself
two years ago, completed only 6 of 16 attempts for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Using a generous rotation of defensive linemen, Georgia sacked
Wright three times, and he threw an interception at the Bulldogs'
1-yard line in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give our defense credit,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan
said. ``We've played two games now and they haven't given up a
touchdown, which is pretty remarkable considering the field
position we gave (South Carolina).''
</P>
<P>
   The defense's biggest play came early in the fourth quarter.
Facing second-and-11 from the Georgia 37, Wright dropped back and
threw to wideout Jermale Kelly near the goal line. But cornerback
Jeff Harris stepped in front of Kelly for the interception and
Georgia took over at its 1.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth of five times the Gamecocks were held without
a touchdown inside Georgia's 40-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All preseason we kept thinking that the defense was going to
have to hold up strong early in the season,'' Georgia safety Kirby
Smart said. ``I really didn't know if it was going to happen or
not. But (Saturday night) we held true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs put Carolina away for good from there, driving 90
yards in 16 plays for junior Hap Hines' 26-yard field goal with
3:03 left. Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter, who was brilliant in
his debut against Kent, got a tougher challenge from the Gamecocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make as many plays as I thought we would
offensively, but at the same time we made enough,'' Donnan said.
``That (fourth-quarter) drive was critical coming out and
scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter hit only two of his first nine pass attempts, but he
recovered in the second half with 6-of-10 passing for 123 yards.
Late in the fourth quarter, he threw a 50-yard bomb to two-way
player Champ Bailey, which set up Hines' field goal. Georgia rushed
for 192 yards, with senior Olandis Gary finishing with 58 yards on
12 carries.
</P>
<P>
   After a sluggish first half, Georgia finally started to pull
away in the third quarter. After sacking Wright on third down to
force a punt on Carolina's first drive of the half, Georgia took
more than six minutes off the clock on its ensuing drive.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's 5-yard run with six minutes left in the third quarter
gave Georgia a 14-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks appeared to catch a big break early in the second
quarter. With Georgia facing third-and-2 from its own 36, Carter
threw to Gary, who fumbled at the 38 on safety Homer Torrance's
hit. Linebacker Kenneth Harney scooped up the ball and returned it
35 yards down the left sideline to the Bulldogs' 3.
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina's offensive problems _ 4-of-9 passing for
only 12 yards and 55 rushing yards on 21 attempts in the first half
_ continued from there.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, fullback Steve Mixon picked up 1 yard to the 2.
Tailback Troy Hambrick was thrown for a 5-yard loss on second down,
and then Wright's pass to Kelly in the right flats was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina placekicker Courtney Leavitt sneaked his 24-yard
field goal just inside the right upright to pull the Gamecocks
within 7-3 with 10:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' own problems continued on their next possession,
when Carter overthrew senior wideout Tony Small and the pass was
intercepted by free safety Ray Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks converted a pair of third-down plays to move to
the Georgia 40, but the drive stalled when Hambrick gained only 2
yards to the 28 on third-and-4. On fourth down, Wright tried a
naked bootleg run to the right, but Georgia's Antonio Cochran
stopped him for a 2-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had nearly all of the breaks early. Facing third-and-8
from the Carolina 37 on the Bulldogs' opening drive, Carter
scrambled up the middle for 8 yards. He was stopped short on fourth
down, turning the ball over to the Gamecocks at their 30-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On South Carolina's first play, Cochran, the senior rush end
playing in his first game after missing nearly a month with an
ankle injury, batted Wright's pass high in the air. Linebacker
Adrian Hollingshed intercepted the ball and the Bulldogs took over
at the Gamecocks' 19.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, Pass gained 14 yards to the 5, but the drive
appeared to stall when Gary was stuffed on third-and-goal at the 1.
But South Carolina was penalized for being offsides, and Carter
scored on a 1-yard sneak for a 7-0 lead with 9:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was a big game for us,'' Carter said. ``Once I
got settled down out there, I really grew up as a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the Bulldogs did, too.

CLINTON APPROVAL RATING UP IN ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of Arizonans believe President Clinton lied
under oath, and more than half believe he obstructed justice in the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has never been more popular in the state, according
to the Arizona Poll, based on telephone interviews with 409 Arizona
adults between 5 p.m. Friday and noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has a 56 percent approval rating for the job he is
doing, up 1 percentage point from January, up 14 percentage points
from a poll in April 1995 and up 8 points from a March 1993 poll.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say that all is forgiven with the beleaguered president.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 52 percent of respondents believe Clinton should be
impeached if it is established that he lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight percent of Arizona residents polled believe he
committed perjury, 55 percent think he abused his presidential
power, 53 percent feel he obstructed justice and 47 percent think
he tampered with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But only 38 percent said Clinton should resign and 54 percent
said he shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Angulo, 65, a retired meat cutter from west Phoenix, said
he doesn't understand why Clinton's sexual misconduct is such a big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who had sex with a girl who was of age,'' Angulo
said. ``Am I supposed to care? It's not like he killed anyone. I
mean, was he really going to tell the truth, being married and
all?''
</P>
<P>
   Angulo said he was more interested in the rise of his stocks and
the healthy state of the economy since Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Britnee Weaver, 42, a south Phoenix medical worker, also said
Clinton should not resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he did was wrong and that he was trying to pull
one over on the public,'' Weaver said. ``But now that he's been
caught I think he'll run the country in a respectable manner. When
you think about it, this only hurt a handful of people, and it
certainly doesn't affect me.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the majority of those polled, Weaver said it will
become a far more serious matter if it is established that Clinton
perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did that, I think he should be impeached,'' Weaver said.
``It's going to be interesting to see if anyone in Congress buys
into his splitting hairs about what sex is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nataly Bistline, a 29-year-old Fredonia firefighter, said she
finds Clinton's peccadillos highly offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's entitled to his privacy, though. This should be a
personal issue, not a public one,'' Bistline said. ``It seems to me
the humiliation he is suffering with the American public is enough
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly, said Chester York, 50, a southwest Phoenix construction
worker. York, a Vietnam War veteran, said he could put up with
Clinton ``dodging the draft and that stuff about not inhaling
marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this (Starr) report has hit like a bombshell, and the
preponderance of evidence to me shows that he has got to go,'' York
said. ``He has embarrassed a lot of hard-working people in this
country, and we're $40 million poorer because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which all means that Clinton should resign immediately, said
Cindy Kominska, a 37-year-old Tempe homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, no guy forgets about whether he had an
affair,'' Kominska said. ``He obviously committed perjury, and what
are we teaching our children if he gets away with this? Besides,
with all these women coming forward, he needs to resign so he has
the time to deal with his sexual addiction problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Snyder, 28, a Chandler homemaker, said Clinton should be
booted out the door if he doesn't resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to no one in this country being able to trust what
he says, I think he's weakened us with countries all over the
world,`` Snyder said. ``How can anyone be fearful of us with his
position being weakened so much? Besides, he never has been a good
president. He just got lucky with the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many Arizona residents who feel Clinton shouldn't resign
are nonetheless angry about his deceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very selfish and is only into what's good for him,'' said
V.E. ``Chuck'' Tadlock, a 73-year-old retired tire dealer who lives
in Sun City West. ``I'm giving him (Clinton) the benefit of the
doubt now, but Starr has made a good case, and it wouldn't take
much for me to want impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many respondents apparently have their doubts about
Starr's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Republican independent counsel has the
nation's best interests at heart, only 25 percent agreed, while 59
percent said they
</P>
<P>
   believe he's motivated by politics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In other findings, 63 percent of respondents feel that
Clinton's actions have negatively affected the United States'
reputation worldwide, 48 percent said they found Clinton's
statements of regret sincere and 92 percent said they were aware
that Starr had sent his report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Poll was prepared by the research department of The
Arizona Republic. The Analytical Group, a Scottsdale market
research firm, interviewed the randomly selected poll respondents. &QL;

TULANE IMPROVES TO 2-0 WITH 31-21 VICTORY AGAINST SMU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For those arriving at the Cotton Bowl last night with
fond memories of Tulane as the neighborhood punching bag, there was
scarcely a spark of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Green Wave comes equipped with new uniforms, a
new logo, new white shoes, and an ``Indy'' offense with a Bowden
behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   For SMU (0-2) it all added up to a dismal 31-21 defeat, bringing
Tulane _ 2-0 for the first time in 23 years _ to 9-4 overall in the
Tommy Bowden era.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully for the Mustangs, the Green Wave was without its
leading rusher, Jamaican Dartez, who injured a knee after gaining
195 yards last week.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for the guests. There was still Shaun King, who
introduced himself to the Mustangs by throwing for 259 yards _ in
the first quarter _ out of a no huddle run-and-shoot attack that
the New Orleans crowd has named after a popular national speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave required little in the way of a warmup to get the
affair started, zipping 80 yards in less than two minutes for a
score.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, King threw 31 yards to JaJuan Dawson, 22 to
Kerwin Cook and 14 to P.J. Franklin, before running the final eight
yards himself.
</P>
<P>
   Late the the quarter, however, the Mustangs had the Green Wave
bottled up at its six-yard line. Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   But King whipped a sideline pass to Dawson, who ignored a
defender committing interference and raced home _ 94 yards for a
14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, SMU finally registered a first down, but it
was little help. Tulane's Brad Palazzo nailed a 46-yard field goal
early in the second quarter for a 17-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For SMU, the final indignity of a disastrous first half was
delivered by the Tulane defense _ set up when the Wave killed a
punt at the Mustangs' one yard line.
</P>
<P>
   SMU advanced only to the two in three plays, and the rush
engulfed punter Colin Vadheim in the end zone. Linebacker David
Dorsey blocked the kick and recovered the ball for a 24-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After an SMU drive fizzled in the third quarter, King directed a
73-yard drive in slightly over two minutes, capping it with a
36-yard scoring pass to Franklin to make it 31-0.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the Mustangs revived under backup quarterback
Josh McCown, who shrugged off a sack and an interception that
killed two promising drives.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:20 left in the third period, McCown hit Albert Johnson
with a 75-yard scoring pass, and five minutes later, the duo hooked
up again on a 60-yard TD play.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the final period, SMU was back again, with a
67-yard march capped by a one-yard spurt from Rodnick Phillips.
With 6:19 left, the Mustangs trailed by 10.

FALL ELECTIONS LOOM AS REFERENDUM ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The timing of independent prosecutor Kenneth
Starr's report on President Clinton's sex scandal _ less than two
months before a national election _ has turned the November
balloting into a virtual referendum on impeachment, some political
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   While the analysts agree that the report will almost certainly
hurt Democrats, Republicans need to watch out for a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the House voted to release the report to
the public (indeed, to the world) and then immediately adjourned
for home to test the wind with constituents. They'll make their
decisions on what to do with the impeachment report based on public
opinion polls, rather than the actual details, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of whether the president should be impeached
over the information contained in the report most likely will be
answered by the Congress elected in 1998 _ putting voters in the
extraordinary position of deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having released Starr's report on the Internet diminishes the
role Congress will play in making the decision, because now it's
out there in the court of public opinion,'' said Arthur Miller,
political science professor at the University of Iowa. ``All of a
sudden, we have shifted control over the process from where the
Constitution says it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (House members) are all acting in their own
self-interest, and right now that is to do whatever they have to do
to get elected, and that means doing what their constituents want.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to be voting on the basis of their
conscience. They're going to be voting on the basis of
public-opinion polling. The public is going to be making this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the formal process: The House Judiciary Committee will
decide whether to open an inquiry and ultimately whether to refer
the charges to the full House, where every member would have a vote
on impeaching the president. If a majority approved, the case would
be turned over to the Senate, which, if the process ran its course,
would vote on whether to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde has said the process will be
deliberate, and the committee is unlikely to conclude its work by
the November election. That means voters will have an unusual level
of influence over what will happen to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be sending a message to candidates on which way
they'd like an impeachment inquiry to go, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton issue will so dominate the debate that it ``wipes
off the table all the other issues,'' said Lesley Israel, a
Democratic political consultant. The only question asked
challengers and incumbents now, she said, will be how will they
vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) becomes the issue of discussion, even though he
may not be the issue they cast their vote by,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts agree that the release of the report is costlier to
Democrats. Just a few months ago, it looked possible for them to
make a real run at regaining a House majority. Now they'll be lucky
to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their chances of retaking the House are now minimal,'' said
Larry Sabato, political science professor at the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato disagrees that the Starr report makes a referendum of the
1998 election. He said there is no single question on the ballot
that asks if Clinton should be impeached. Voters simply don't vote
a single clear issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he does agree the scandal will play a major role in the fall
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are likely to stay away from the polls in depression
over their president's troubles, while Republicans, particularly
social conservatives who have long hated Clinton, are more
motivated to vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, Republicans could face a backlash if they
fail to be scrupulous in their handling of the hot potato Starr has
handed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``By responding intemperately, by rushing to judgment, by
appearing to be unfair _ those are the dangers they (Republicans)
face,'' said Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of
the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both House and Senate leaders have urged temperance on
their members. They are, Gans said, aware of the possible
consequences. &QL;

EXPOS BEAT METS, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Plenty of the moves made by Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine this season have worked out, no matter how unusual they
may have seemed at the time. But Saturday night two moves
backfired, and the Mets are now a game behind the Chicago Cubs in
the National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves came in the final three innings of a 5-3 loss to the
Montreal Expos, the Mets' second loss in a row to the Expos. They
now have an 82-67 record and one more chance against Montreal on
Sunday. But regardless of how they do in that game, they have
already wasted a chance to help themselves against the Expos, a
team still more than 30 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Mets were trailing, 3-2, when Lenny Harris
led off the seventh with a home run to tie the score. Luis Lopez
followed with a single, and after Rey Ordonez sacrificed him to
second the Mets were threatening to retake the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine _ perhaps wary of a bullpen that has become shaky
again outside of closer John Franco _ gambled and let starting
pitcher Rick Reed hit for himself with one out, although Reed was
pitching only a so-so game. Reed popped out to center. The Mets did
not score any more runs in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, the Expos scored twice, one run
charged to Reed on a single off Dennis Cook by pinch-hitter Robert
Perez, and another charged to Cook on a little line drive from
Terry Jones that short-hopped Lopez at second and went through for
a costly error.
</P>
<P>
   On to the top of the ninth. With the Mets now trailing by two,
Harris led off with a single and Lopez walked. The normal move at
that point would be to bunt the runners over to second and third
and hope for a game-tying hit from one of the next two batters. But
this time Valentine elected to hit away, and Matt Franco hit into a
double play. End of rally, and not long after that, end of game, on
a Tony Phillips strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, it was the end of a day where just about
everything went wrong. At one point Saturday afternoon, the
Milwaukee Brewers led the Cubs, 10-2, at Wrigley Field, prompting
one Met to say, ``They're just waiting for us to snatch it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs somehow snatched the game back, winning 15-12. And
the Mets, even with their leading hitter, John Olerud, back in the
lineup, were unable to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud arrived from New York about 90 minutes before game time.
He had spent 15 hours in the hospital Thursday night while his
wife, Kelly, gave birth to the couple's first child, a 9-pound,
4-ounce boy they named Garrett. Olerud said the Mets had let him
decide when to return, even though they are in the midst of an
intense wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like they put very much pressure on me,'' Olerud
said before the game. ``It was pretty much left up to me, what I
thought was best. And it was a really tough decision. But these are
big games. And since it's a night game followed by a day game, I
decided to try to make it back today.''
</P>
<P>
   So there was Olerud in the starting lineup and nearly giving the
Mets a three-run lead in his first at-bat, when he followed a Tony
Phillips walk and an Edgardo Alfonzo run-scoring double with a fly
ball to deep right. Vladimir Guerrero was able to run the ball down
at the warning track. But Alfonzo advanced to third on the play and
then scored on a Mike Piazza grounder to short. And Reed had been
staked to an early 2-0 lead, all while the scoreboard in left had
changed to reveal that the Cubs had rallied for an improbable
victory in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reed had a couple of runs to work with, the lead was by
no means safe. Reed has been victimized by the long ball over the
last five weeks. In his first 21 starts, the All-Star right-hander
had allowed 13 home runs. But in his last 6 before Saturday night,
Reed had surrendered 10, including 3 in a 4-0 loss to Atlanta six
days ago. And sure enough, Shane Andrews belted a first-pitch homer
to left with two out in the bottom of the first, just after Tony
Phillips had thrown Terry Jones out at third from the left-field
corner as Jones was trying to stretch a two-base hit into three. So
now the Mets led 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it would be a tie game, after Fernando Seguignol blasted an
0-1 pitch over the fence in left-center in the fourth. And then it
was Guerrero's turn. On Friday, the 22-year-old right-fielder had
tied the Expos' franchise record with his 36th home run. Saturday
night, he hit No. 37, an 0-1 shot to left with two out in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, meanwhile, were flailing in vain at rookie
right-hander Javier Vazquez's pitches. After their two-run first,
the Mets could only muster three more singles over the next five
innings against a pitcher with a 4-14 record and a 6.13 earned run
average coming in. And when it was all done, and Valentine was left
to ponder the moves that didn't work, the Mets found themselves on
the outside looking in in the wild-card race with only 13 games to
go in the season.

CLINTON'S LAWYERS ATTACK `HIT-AND-RUN SMEAR CAMPAIGN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers charged Saturday that
he is the victim of a ``smear campaign'' by a prosecutor bent on
drowning his presidency in a sea of sexually explicit allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain that 'sex' is precisely what this four-and-a-half
year investigation has boiled down to,`` the White House said in a
second rebuttal of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and his deputies are engaged in a ``hit-and-run smear
campaign'' because their case lacks the legal foundation to impeach
the president, the rebuttal said. It said the prosecutor was using
the details of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky for ``shock
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House counterattack, its second in two days, came as
lawmakers and the American people continued uncomfortably to digest
Starr's report alleging 11 possible grounds for Clinton's
impeachment based on concealing an affair with Lewinsky, a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning what some lawmakers termed a ``make-or-break
weekend,'' the president delivered his Saturday morning radio
address with only a fleeting allusion to his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an exhausting and difficult week in the capital _
not only for me, but for many others,'' Clinton said. ``The most
important thing to do now is to stay focused on the issues the
American people sent us here to deal with, from health care to the
economy to terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore came to the defense of the president
during a campaign swing through Oregon. In his first comments on
the Starr referral, he said it did not constitute grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe this report serves as the basis for
overturning the judgment of the American people ... that Bill
Clinton should be their president,'' Gore said in Hillsboro, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leading Democrats on Saturday put public pressure on
Clinton to drop his arguments that he did not commit perjury and
instead signal his readiness to accept congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta said Saturday
that the time has come ``to stop the legal quibbling about whether
he lied about that sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear he misled the country,'' Panetta said. ``He needs
to cooperate with Congress, not engage in the same tactics he has
for the last seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans of past Republican administrations echoed
Panetta's judgment. Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary to Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush, said, ``I don't think people will
see this as ``high crimes and misdemeanors,' '' the Constitution's
description of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll feel disgusted and think him an unworthy president who
violated his oath of office,'' Fitzwater said. ``But I think
they'll come down on the side of censure, rather than
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial opinion around the nation was more scathing. Several
newspapers, from Philadelphia to Detroit to Seattle, called on the
president to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton should resign,'' the Philadelphia Inquirer told
its readers. ``He should resign because his repeated, reckless
deceits have dishonored his presidency beyond repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Several House Judiciary Committee members admitted that they
were disturbed by Starr's report, but promised to withhold final
judgment on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am offended by the behavior outlined in the Starr report, as
most people will be,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Tex. ``But the
Judiciary Committee must go beyond that and base our judgments on
the serious allegations of obstruction of justice and lying under
oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Wisconsin Democrat who was appointed to
the committee on Friday, said, ``Obviously he (Clinton) did
something wrong. You don't violate your marriage promises and walk
away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barrett said he would continue to review the evidence ``and
then make a decision (on impeachment) as to what is right for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the lurid nature of
the report was unfortunate but caused by the president's initial
denial of a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. He called on
lawmakers to hold off on making a decision about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you cannot render . . . any judgment until you have
given the president a chance to respond and given the Judiciary
Committee a chance to do its job,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest White House rebuttal clarified a legal and political
strategy of admitting to some wrong, but not to an impeachable
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In the 42-page document, Clinton's lawyers don't deny that he
met alone with Lewisnky, nor that they exchanged gifts.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't refute that he helped find her a job, but notes
that it was Lewinsky who initiated the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the (Independent Counsel's) view that the president
should have cast Ms. Lewinsky off and refused to assist her in any
way simply because the (Paula) Jones (sexual harrasment) case was
filed. Fortunately, the law requires no such callous absurdity,''
the rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal also doesn't deny that Clinton and Lewinsky tried
to keep their affair secret.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attempt ``is hardly a remarkable proposition. The use of
cover stories to conceal such a relationship, apart from any
proceeding, is not unusual and not an obstruction of justice,'' the
rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal also asserts that:
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton could not have committed perjury last January when he
denied having sex with Lewinsky because the definition of ``sexual
relations'' is subject to interpretation. ``All the (Independent
Counsel) has is a witness who gave narrow answers to ambiguous
questions,'' the president's lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   _There is no evidence that Lewinsky was instructed by the White
House to surrender gifts the president had given her. According to
Starr's report, Lewinsky said she turned over the gifts to
presidential secretary Betty Currie after Currie called her. But
the rebuttal says Currie testified it was Lewinsky's idea, not
Currie's, to turn over the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _Prosecutors erred in arguing that Clinton tampered with a
witness by summoning Currie to the White House on a Sunday in what
the secretary viewed as an effort to either influence her or gauge
what account she might give of the Lewinsky relationship. The White
House says it couldn't be tampering because she wasn't a witness
under subpoena at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has made himself unavailable for comment since his report
was issued, as has Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, the cable-TV channel, reported that relatives who have
spoken with Lewinsky indicate that the family is ``very touched and
gratified'' that Clinton apologized to them.
</P>
<P>
   The president's apology was delivered at a breakfast Friday with
religious leaders. He also apologized to his family, friends, staff
and the Cabinet. &QL;
