U.N. Won't Probe Charges Against NATO
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor on Friday
rejected claims that NATO committed war crimes during last year's bombing of
Yugoslavia, and said the accusations merit no further investigation. ''Although
some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied that there was no
deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets by NATO during
the bombing campaign,'' Carla del Ponte told the Security Council.

Court Rules on Saipan Workers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that garment
workers on Saipan can sue their employers over alleged sweatshop conditions
anonymously because they fear disclosing their names could get them fired or
deported. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by a judge
on the island who had required that 23 women suing factories on the island must
reveal their names or their lawsuit would be dismissed. The suit seeks damages
for 25,000 garment workers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department said Friday the nation's unemployment
rate rose to 4.1 percent in May as businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the biggest
reduction in nine years. The report showed the jobless rate rose by 0.2
percentage point from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent reached in April. While
private sector jobs declined, this was offset by government hiring of temporary
Census workers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After finding nearly 150 cases where aircraft maintenance
could not be documented, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed to strip
Alaska Airlines of the right to perform maintenance on its planes. The step
could eventually force the airline to park its planes and stop flying. ''We have
serious concerns about critical processes, including management effectiveness,''
Nick Lacey, director of Flight Standards Service for the FAA, said Friday. The
FAA's investigation is proceeding and enforcement actions -- usually civil fines
-- could be announced in coming weeks, Lacey said.

   PECOS, N.M. (AP) -- Firefighters tackled a 25,000-acre wildfire head-on

''We are attacking with all our might today,'' fire information officer Tom Mott
said. ''When it's safe, it's time to strike.'' The blaze was 60 percent
contained. Thunderstorms Thursday and Friday gave firefighters a chance to

Man Convicted in Shelter I. Murder
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- In the first recorded murder on Shelter Island since
it was settled 348 years ago, a man was found guilty Friday of fatally shooting
his neighbor and longtime friend. A Suffolk County jury convicted Kenneth Payne,
44, of second-degree murder for the April 1998 death of Curtis Cook. Payne faces
25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced June 30. The killing shocked the
community of about 2,500 year-round residents. The 12-square-mile island is off

<HEADLINE> Heroin Addict Gets 25 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A judge sentenced a heroin addict to 25
years to life in prison Friday for the torture killing a toddler
left in his care.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Fouts, 35, was convicted of murder in March for the 1997
death of 1{-year-old Joshua Massengill. Joshua's mother, Jenise
Massengill, had been sharing a motel room with Fouts and had left
Joshua with him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was later found propped up against a wall at a
convalescent hospital, his body scalded and bruised and the skin on
his genitals nearly rubbed off. Marks on the child's head showed he
had been struck with a narrow rod nearly two dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts, an admitted heroin addict, testified he had gotten high
just before Massengill left. He said Joshua's injuries resulted
from a series of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts was acquitted of a charge of molestation, a special
circumstance that, had he been found guilty, would have made him
eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Elizabeth Henderson called Joshua's death ''the most
heinous, brutal child murder I've seen.''

<HEADLINE> Panel criticizes EPA ecological data on Hudson PCBs  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- An Environmental Protection Agency
study that found animals endangered by PCBs in the Hudson River was
criticized by independent experts who questioned its value.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a peer review panel said Friday that the federal
EPA's ecological assessment lacked enough information to be used by
the agency as it considers whether to order a dredging of the upper
Hudson. Two of the seven panel members called the EPA's work
unacceptable, and one suggested starting some work over.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is so far short of what is needed,'' said panel member
Lawrence Kapustka.
</P>
<P>
   The critical comments are a blow to the EPA as agency officials
move to wrap up their long process on whether to dredge. EPA
officials could not say Friday if this development would delay the
EPA's proposal on a course of action, which is due in December.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Hudson River Project Manager Alison Hess said the agency
would consider the recommendations and make the appropriate
revisions. But she added that the agency had already established
the human health risk posed by PCBs sufficiently enough to go ahead
with a study on the best course of action for the river.
</P>
<P>
   Hess was referring to another EPA report that found health risks
to people eating PCB-contaminated fish from the upper river are
higher than acceptable levels. A separate peer review panel agreed
with that contention on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ecological review panel, which met on Thursday and Friday,
was the last of four peer review panels to scrutinize the EPA's
work on the river.
</P>
<P>
   This panel looked at a report in which the EPA claimed fish in
the river are at risk due to PCBs -- particularly larger fish that
eat other fish such as largemouth bass and striped bass. The agency
also concluded that other animals that eat river fish -- like
eagles, belted kingfishers, great blue herons, mink and river otter
-- are similarly at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A central complaint of panel members was a lack of information --
things like population data, ecological survey data, toxicity data.
Panel member Dwayne Moore said the report gave him no basis for
deciding the best course of action for the river.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two panelists who called the EPA report unacceptable
-- Kapustka and Moore -- four others called for major revisions. The
seventh panelist left early and has yet to make a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rough one for us,'' Hess conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution from General Electric factories on the Hudson is
largely blamed for PCBs legally dumped for years into the river.
The substance, used as insulating material in transformers and
other electrical equipment, was banned by the federal government in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   GE, which could be forced to spend billions of dollars if a
dredging is ordered, has been a vocal dredging opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Friday's development illustrates fatal
flaws in the EPA's work. Spokesman Mark Behan also noted that two
peer review panelists that looked at human health concerns earlier
this week had called for major revisions to that report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core of EPA's scientific case has been called into
question,'' said Behan.
</P>
<P>
   GE has funded a study that found the river is cleaning up
naturally. More recently it launched an advertising campaign citing
the opposition of local government to dredging and landfilling.

<HEADLINE> State police detail investigation of death of elderly man  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Harold Carter and Mary Anne Voorhees sat next
to one another in Oneida County Court. They never spoke nor did
they make eye contact as a state police investigator was questioned
about the disappearance of the elderly man they're accused of
murdering.
</P>
<P>
   Senior State Police Investigator Dennis P. Dougherty, a 20-year
veteran of the force who was assigned to the case, revealed in more
than two hours on the witness stand Friday that Carter gave three
statements detailing what happened to Glenn Morgan Jr. the night he
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Although defense attorney Joseph P. Giruzzi tried to portray
investigators as desperate because Morgan had been missing for
several days, Dougherty said Carter was willing to talk and very
cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told him it was very important to us and more important to
the Morgan family that he be found and have a proper funeral and
burial,'' Dougherty testified. ''For the first time, he showed a
little bit of emotion. He acted like he was very sad about what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 42, and Voorhees, 53, each is charged with two counts of
second-degree murder, first-degree robbery, and second-degree
robbery in connection with the death of Morgan, a retired postal
worker who disappeared after celebrating his 73rd birthday last
Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   His decaying corpse was found nine days later about 15 feet down
a brush-strewn embankment in suburban Utica by a woman walking on a
nearby sidewalk. She smelled a strong odor and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities still don't know what caused Morgan's death and
probably never will because his body was so badly decomposed. It
was discovered several miles down the road from the Whitesboro
American Legion post where Morgan met Voorhees that night.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the defendants are being tried at the same
time before two juries. Oneida County Judge Barry Donalty decided
it made sense to conduct the trials together because the same
witnesses will testify against both defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The trial entered its dual-jury phase on Friday, the fourth day
of testimony. Evidence was presented that related only to Carter.
Donalty excused the Voorhees jury until Monday, when evidence
concerning Voorhees will be heard and the Carter jury will not be
present.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Dougherty said Carter agreed last Aug. 25 to write
the Morgan family an apologetic letter but had a difficult time
focusing on what to say, calling it ''the worst day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said Carter admitted in each confession to striking
Morgan. He also agreed to take troopers to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was our goal that day -- to find Mr. Morgan's body,''
Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   In a confession lasting three hours, which he signed, Carter
told troopers he had known Voorhees for six years and knew all
about her routine for hustling older men, buying them drinks,
taking them to secluded spots where she performed oral sex, and
then taking their cars and money.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty said Carter changed his confession three times in a
two-day period, adding details each time. Carter said in his final
statement that Morgan fell unconscious after he struck him, then he
and Voorhees took the body to a boat launch and went drinking
again. Carter said when they returned later, Morgan's body was
cold, so they tossed it into a dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution plans to call about 50 witnesses in the trial,
which is expected to take about two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party head says he will deliver 350,000 votes for Lazio </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state Conservative Party
says he expects to deliver at least 350,000 votes to help
Republican Rick Lazio in his U.S. Senate race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a potentially decisive boost in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our people are really energized,'' said Michael Long
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Long's prediction came on the eve of his party's state
nominating convention at which the little-known Long Island
congressman is to officially be named its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the state Liberal Party's leadership was meeting in
New York City to give its backing to the first lady. The path was
cleared for Clinton to get the Liberal Party nod after Republican
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race
to deal with his prostate cancer. One of Giuliani's closest
political advisers is Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's withdrawal from the race, and Lazio's quick entry
into it, also opened the way for the Republican and Conservative
parties to restore their traditional partnership in statewide
races. Long had refused to get behind Giuliani because of the
mayor's strong support for abortion rights and his closeness to the
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio has said he is an abortion rights supporter, he has
repeatedly voted to cut off federal Medicaid money to pay for poor
women's abortions and favors a ban on what critics call
''partial-birth abortion.'' That has been enough to win Long's
support.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican seeking statewide office in New York has won
without Conservative Party support since 1974. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York
without Liberal Party backing since it was founded more than 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the state Conservative Party began airing a
television advertisement promoting Lazio on Albany-area TV stations
and on an all-news New York City cable TV station.
</P>
<P>
   The ad drew a put-down Friday from a Giuliani adviser because it
was produced by Nelson Warfield, a veteran New York political
operative who had been critical of Giuliani's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought much of his political commentary and I don't
think much of his political advertising,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum,
Giuliani's Senate campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Told about Teitelbaum's comment, Warfield said: ''I thought we
all had the same target -- Hillary Clinton. It's disappointing to
see some other folks have different agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfield, Bob Dole's presidential campaign spokesman in 1996,
has been a top adviser to cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who ran
unsuccessfully against Giuliani for the GOP nomination for mayor in
1989. Giuliani narrowly lost the general election that year to
Democratic nominee David Dinkins who Giuliani then beat in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party backing can be critical in New York elections.
Three-term Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo was beaten by
Republican George Pataki in the 1994 governor's race on the
strength of the 328,695 votes he received on the Conservative Party
line.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Independence Party, the state arm of the national
Reform Party, will hold its state nominating convention on Monday
in Albany. Its chairman, Frank McKay, said Friday he wasn't certain
who might end up with the party's nomination and that there might
be a Sept. 12 primary to determine the nominee. McKay said it was
possible that neither Clinton nor Lazio would qualify for such a
primary.

<HEADLINE> Critics say fee for finding money in bankruptcy case is too high and too soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Bankruptcy trustee Richard Breeden says he
has nearly finished his work in the Bennett Funding case and wants
to be paid early, even though years of lawsuits and legal
proceedings remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no more billing, no more collecting, no more people
to manage or sell hotels,'' said Breeden. ''Substantially all of
the things that I can control have been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for the outcome of the last lawsuit, Breeden
has asked a federal judge to award him $4.8 million to $12.3
million now. The money would be a special payout based on a
percentage of the money already repaid to creditors. Breeden is
entitled to as much as 3 percent of the money he collects.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden, a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has spent four years collecting money for creditors of
10 Bennett companies. Under Breeden's direction, workers collected
leases, sold property and three hotels, and made deals to get money
back for the creditors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has collected $500 million, meaning he could earn up
to $15 million if paid the full 3 percent commission. He already
has received $2.7 million, representing $50,000 a month draw, plus
a $250,000 one-time special payment.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he has paid $44 million to the lawyers,
accountants and other professionals assisting in the case.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bennett Funding companies collapsed in a fraud and
bankruptcy scandal in 1996, the companies owed $1 billion to at
least 21,000 secured and unsecured creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Former chief financial officer Patrick Bennett and several other
company officials were convicted of a variety of fraud and money
laundering charges. Bennett was sentenced last month to 30 years in
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the 10,000 unsecured creditors have received 8.5
percent of what they were owed. By the end of the case, Breeden
estimates investors will get 32 to 43 cents back on the dollar -- or
$320 to $430 on a $1,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden's request, however, is facing some challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing a committee of unsecured creditors,
Daniel Stolz, is vehemently opposed to paying Breeden's commission
before the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to evaluate a trustee is to rate his entire
results, Stolz said. Breeden hasn't finished his tasks, Stolz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our objection we suggest that if the court had to do a
report card on the trustee at this point, the only grade that could
be assigned is incomplete,'' Stolz said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Trustee Guy Van Baalen also objects to Breeden's
request. Van Baalen's job is to monitor cases and their fees as
they go through the bankruptcy process.
</P>
<P>
   Both plan to argue against Breeden's early payment when the
question comes before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Stephen D.
Gerling July 11.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.75 million for four years worth of work is pretty good
compensation, Stolz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a lot of the investors feeling sorry for somebody
who earns $600,000 a year plus his expenses,'' Stolz said.

<HEADLINE> DEC gives water permit approval for Hudson River power plant  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Department of Environmental
Conservation has imposed a limit on the amount of river water a
proposed plant in the Hudson River Valley could use to less than
200,000 gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   DEC Commissioner John Cahill issued the water discharge permit
Friday, requiring PG&AMP;E Generating to use the ''best technology
available'' to control its river water usage at its proposed
electric generating plant in Athens, Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   The State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit
issued to PG&AMP;E prevents the plant from withdrawing more than
180,000 gallons water each day.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier ruling by an administrative law judge had proposed a
water intake structure that would have allowed about 4.2 million
gallons of water per day to be taken and required the use of a
filtering device called a Gunderboom. A Gunderboom would fit over
water intake structures and prevent fish from being damaged or
killed when water is pulled into the system.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Cahill said federal and state laws mandate the
use of the best technology available in power plants. He rejected
using a Gunderboom, citing the state's relative inexperience with
the technology and the lack of information on how the device would
work at the Athens plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill also found that the state's policy on river water quality
is sufficiently protective so that the Athens plant would not harm
the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   DEC spokeswoman Jennifer Post said that with the limit on how
much water the plant could withdraw from the Hudson, ''it appears
that those limits would require the dry cooling technology,'' which
would be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens plant is the first major power plant to be proposed
in New York in nearly a decade, and Pataki administration officials
have said it and others will be needed to meet heightened peak
power demands starting in a few years. The proposed facility will
be a 1,080-megawatt electric generating plant that would be powered
by natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have argued that the plant would spoil the scenic Hudson
River Valley area and harm the fish habitat or create undue
pollution in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Post said that the issuance of a SPDES permit is a ''significant
step'' in getting the final approval of the power plant. PG&AMP;E
applied in August 1998 for approval from the state Board on
Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, and the board is
scheduled to make a decision later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Siting Board will incorporate this decision and any other
permits into its analysis ... as expeditiously as possible,'' board
spokesman Edward Collins.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for environmental activists fighting the project
were also not immediately returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> State looking for more jobs from Adelphia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki told Adelphia
Communications executives the state might increase its financial
incentives for the cable company's expansion plans if Adelphia
commits to creating more than the 1,000 jobs it already has
promised to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We reminded them the more jobs they can commit to, the more we
can help,'' Charles Gargano, executive director of Empire State
Development Corp., told The Buffalo News in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, Pataki, Adelphia chairman John Rigas and his son,
Timothy Rigas, executive vice president of the Coudersport,
Pa.-based company, met in Albany Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intent was to try to explore ways to wrap this deal up,''
Gargano said. ''We all want it to happen, the Rigases wanted it to
happen, and they understand we're trying our best. It was a very
frank and open discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia, the fourth-largest cable communications company in the
United States, wants to build a $125 million operations center
employing more than 1,000 people on Buffalo's waterfront. It's
hoped the project would prompt further development.
</P>
<P>
   Talks have been underway since January but a major sticking
point has been determining ways to relieve Adelphia's financial
problems at HSBC Arena, the waterfront venue for the NHL's Buffalo
Sabres, which the Rigases also own.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres are expected to lose $20 million this year, in part,
Adelphia officials say, because of the 30-year lease they inherited

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Rangers 4  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Jay Bell had four hits, including a
tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning Friday night that led
the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Texas Rangers 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Texas center fielder Ruben Mateo, one of the American League's
top rookies, broke a bone in his upper leg and is likely to miss
the rest of the season after tripping over first base while trying
to beat out a grounder in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the starting second baseman for 52 of the 53 previous
games, was the designated hitter in Arizona's first interleague
game of the season. After grounding out in the first inning, he had
four straight hits.
</P>
<P>
   After Texas came back from a 3-0 deficit to tie it, Bell led off
the seventh with a solo homer off Rick Helling (7-3), who allowed
nine hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the go-ahead homer, Bell had three singles and
scored twice. It was his first four-hit game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's homer helped keep Brian Anderson (5-0) undefeated.
Anderson allowed five hits in seven innings, struck out four and
walked none for the fifth time in 10 starts this year and the 24th
time in 61 starts with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei got three outs for his second save, allowing a run
on a wild pitch. With runners at first and second and one out, Chad
Curtis flied to right, advancing the potential tying run to third.
Scarborough Green then flied out.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lost its first game in June after going 18-10 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb doubled in the third and No. 9 hitter Royce Clayton
followed with his ninth homer of the season. Rafael Palmeiro tied
the game at 3 an inning later with his third homer in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has allowed 14 home runs this season, and they have
accounted for 21 of the 35 runs (60 percent) scored against him. He
allowed an NL-high 39 homers in 1998, and cut it to 15 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona used four doubles off Helling to build a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Counsell and Damian Miller, the 8-9 hitters in the
Diamondbacks lineup, had consecutive two-out doubles in the second.
An inning later, Steve Finley had an RBI double and scored when
Greg Colbrunn followed with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez added a sacrifice fly in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro's homer was the 377th of his career, tying him for
43rd place with Norm Cash and Harold Baines. ... Finley missed his
20th home run by a matter of inches in the fifth inning when he hit
a ball that curled just outside the right-field pole. ... Since
returning from the disabled list last Saturday, Texas OF Rusty
Greer is 3-for-22 (.182). ... OF Jason McDonnell rejoined the
Rangers on Friday. He had been in Sacramento with his wife for the
birth of their first child, a girl born Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Car Drives Into Playground; 11 Hurt  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- With the driver screaming he couldn't stop, a car
drove into a school playground Friday as a crowd gathered for an
awards assembly. At least 11 people were injured, mostly children.
</P>
<P>
   Several remained hospitalized Friday night, including a
4-year-old boy in serious condition with a fractured skull.
</P>
<P>
   The car went through a fence and across a playground at the
Robert Fulton Elementary School on the city's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was coming real fast,'' witness Sandra Taylor said. ''It
was like he wouldn't stop or he couldn't stop. I don't know which
one. Everybody was trying to get out the way but he was coming too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Lamont Prince, 22, was cited with five traffic
violations and was scheduled to appear at a bond hearing Saturday,
said police spokesman Edward Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was heard ''yelling out he couldn't stop,'' said police
Cmdr. John Killackey. He said police planned to run toxicology
tests to see if Prince had been drinking or taking drugs. Witnesses
also said Prince tried to flee but was apprehended by people at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   More than an hour after the incident, yellow and blue chairs
were scattered on their sides across the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Harris, a member of the school's neighborhood parent
patrol team, said one child had been dragged by the car and was
still under it when it stopped. She said her son, his friend and
two teachers lifted the front of the car to help free the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''God gave us the strength to lift that car up,'' Harris said.
The driver ''certainly wasn't trying to stop. It seemed like he was
hitting the gas instead of hitting the brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports from police and hospitals about
how many people were injured and how many were children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 4-year-old boy in serious condition with a
skull fracture and several cuts and bruises, a 4-year-old girl was
in fair condition and was expected to be hospitalized overnight.
Three other children were in good condition and a fourth was in
fair condition.

Jobless Rate Up To 4.1 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent in May
as businesses cut 116,000 jobs, the biggest reduction in nine years. Today's
report triggered a rally on Wall Street, where it was viewed as the best
evidence yet that the red-hot economy is slowing enough to keep the Federal
Reserve from boosting interest rates further. ''This is a strong indication that
the economy is throttling back from its very robust growth of the past year,''
said Mark Zandi, senior economist at RFA Dismal Sciences in West Chester, Pa.

will be measuring one another on issues that will outlast them both. Clinton
flies to Moscow on Saturday after five days of conferences and ceremonies with

Putin: Teamwork To Fight Missile Threat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian political and military officials lined up Friday
behind President Vladimir Putin's proposal that Russia and the United States
work jointly on a nuclear defense against so-called rogue nations. President
Clinton was due to arrive in Moscow on Saturday for talks with the new Russian
leader. Topping the agenda at the summit will be the U.S. proposal to modify the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The United States wants to construct a
national missile defense against possible nuclear strikes by states such as
North Korea and Iran, which it fears may acquire nuclear weapons. Russia objects
to ABM Treaty changes.

extorting money from them. O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter
Robin Murray O'Hair disappeared in 1995 along with $500,000 in gold coins.
Authorities believe they were killed and dismembered, though their bodies were
never found. Gary Paul Karr, 52, convicted on four counts involving extortion

<HEADLINE> Drought Helps Expose Ancient Canoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Researchers are working quickly to
document the finding of more than 20 ancient Indian canoes at the
bottom of a lake.
</P>
<P>
   The canoes were discovered by high school students this week at
Newnan's Lake, where the water level has dropped because of a
recent dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research is
taking measurements and looking for clues to how the canoes were
built. They will also take samples to determine the type of trees
used and may do radiocarbon testing to determine their exact age.
</P>
<P>
   When the documentation is complete, the canoes will be reburied
in the lake bottom. Otherwise, they could crumble in a matter of
days if left exposed to the air and sun, archaeologist Melissa
Memory said.
</P>
<P>
   Data collected will be added to that of more than 300 canoes
already documented, said James Levy, the bureau's historic
conservator.
</P>
<P>
   The canoes are up to 22 feet long with pointed sterns and
rounded bows. They are believed to be between 500 and 3,000 years
old and were probably used as fishing boats.

<HEADLINE> Wide Pay Gap in Rich, Poor Schools  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world of high-stakes standardized tests and shrinking
budgets, teaching high school art usually means long days of trying
to inspire kids with the glories of Renoir and Monet for precious
little compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Thom Ritenbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Next school year Ritenbaugh will take home a whopping $90,000
for teaching high school art classes. That's more than many of the
young accountants and lawyers in his upscale suburban Philadelphia
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The big paycheck highlights a trend that education experts say
is a potent threat to inner-city schools: Wealthy districts are
quickly raising salaries to retain experienced teachers and scoop
up new ones.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, including New York, California and Texas, the
gap between the highest- and lowest-paid teachers is widening.
Similar trends exist in school systems in Colorado, Michigan,
Oregon and Massachusetts, education experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that school districts are having trouble
keeping their most experienced, highly qualified teachers in the
profession,'' said Richard Ingersoll, an education professor who
researches teacher pay at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ''So those who can afford it are making sure that they are in
the best position to retain good teachers. They are putting down
the big bucks and not paying attention to any past notions of what
a teacher should be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the highway from the spacious lawns and two-story houses of
Council Rock School District in Newtown, where Ritenbaugh works,
some experienced teachers in urban Philadelphia are making around
$35,000 -- about the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ritenbaugh receives the highest pay in his district
because he has a doctorate and 20 years of experience, the median
salary for teachers in Council Rock is $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love what I do, and I value that the district sees my career
as important enough to make a substantial investment,'' Ritenbaugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experienced teachers in the New York City school system
make $32,500, while new teachers in the White Plains district in
affluent Westchester County, N.Y., received a $1,500 raise last
year to make $37,583.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, teachers with five years' experience make
$29,500, while some teachers in Beverly Hills with similar
experience recently received increases that brought their salaries
to $73,400.
</P>
<P>
   Ingersoll said his research shows some veteran teachers are
heading for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few in education begrudge districts the right to dole out
big paychecks for highly qualified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Al Fondy, president of the Pennsylvania Federation of Teachers,
said the solution is to find a way to pay teachers more across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing wrong with what Council Rock is doing,''
Fondy said. ''They are simply trying to take advantage of their
resources to provide the best education possible for their
students.''
</P>
<P>
   David Yates, the principal at Council Rock High School, said he
believes other districts could pay better but choose to spend
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other people think technology, textbooks and facilities are
the way to improve education,'' Yates said. ''Council Rock has put
money into teachers. We believe you can build the Taj Mahal for
education and with mediocre teachers, schooling will fail.
Conversely, you could open a school on the third floor of a barn
with great teachers and kids will learn.''

<HEADLINE> UN Troops, Rebels Clash in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers have again begun
pushing into rebel-held areas of Sierra Leone to enforce a shaky
peace accord and have been met with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in Sierra Leone insist peacekeepers will not be
drawn into an offensive war, but U.N. special representative
Oluyemi Adeniji admitted that a ''more robust response'' to rebel
attacks was required. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers were attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and
returned fire with machine guns Friday. There were no casualties,
said U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place as 400 Indian peacekeeping soldiers were
deploying to Rogberi Junction, the scene of a May 6 battle between
U.N. peacekeepers and rebels from the Revolutionary United Front,
said Okabe.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief attack, the rebels melted into the bush and the
peacekeepers proceeded to Rogberi Junction, she said. It was the
first time in more than 10 days that U.N. troops had a
confrontation with the rebels, Okabe said at U.N. headquarters in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rogberi Junction, about 50 miles east of the capital Freetown,
is about halfway between Port Loko and Lunsar, which is roughly the
front-line in fighting between government forces and the rebels,
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic gunfire was reported overnight near Port Loko, about 45
miles northeast of the capital, U.N. officials said Friday. It was
unclear who controlled the strategic town of Lunsar, some 60 miles
east of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government soldiers retreated from Lunsar on Wednesday, just
days after taking the town from the RUF, but aerial photographs
suggested the rebels might also have pulled out, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone mission -- currently the largest U.N.
peacekeeping operation -- has been criticized for surrendering
weapons and vehicles to the country's feared rebels and allowing
hundreds of members to be taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands
of civilians and intentionally maimed many more during the West
African country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels signed a peace accord last July in nearby Lome, Togo,
but reignited the conflict in early May, when they captured 500
U.N. personnel and advanced to within 25 miles of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces have since been pushing the rebels back
from the capital. The hostages were released after several weeks in
captivity, but none of the stolen weapons or vehicles have been
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sierra Leoneans, terrified of a possible rebel attack on
Freetown, have pleaded for a strong military response by the
international community. So far, the U.N. peacekeeping mission has
used force infrequently, and only when attacked.

<HEADLINE> Dissidents Seek Tiananmen Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Eight dissidents from northeast China have
appealed to the government to compensate those imprisoned and the
families of those killed in the Tiananmen Square crackdown 11 years
ago, a human rights group said today.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji, the dissidents said the government was ''absolutely wrong''
to crush the pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square,
said the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The government sent in troops who shot their way through Beijing
on June 3-4, 1989, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, and ending
seven weeks of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents, from northeastern Jilin province, called for the
release of political prisoners and for political reforms and
democracy, said the Information Center, which reported the letter.
</P>
<P>
   They also demanded compensation for victims' families and for
the thousands of people imprisoned in the crackdown, and urged the
government to reverse its verdict that the 1989 demonstrations were
a ''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that had to be quelled, the
Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the letter was drafted by dissident Liang Liwei and
signed by the seven others.
</P>
<P>
   The government has never allowed an investigation into the
crackdown or a full accounting of those killed, injured and
imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Images Hide Pacific Ethnic Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Flick through the tourist brochures and
South Pacific island nations could scarcely be more inviting:
swaying palm trees fringe white sandy beaches that gently slope
into the crystal waters studded with coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the palm trees, the reality in many of the islands is
far from idyllic as traditionally tribal cultures struggle to adapt
to poverty and Western democracy imposed on them by colonial
masters who have long since left.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have been highlighted by the turmoil in Fiji, where
armed rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the
democratically elected government hostage, forcing the resignation
of the country's president and a military takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts fear the coup, led by failed businessman George
Speight, could spark more unrest across the South Pacific, which
looks to the Fijian capital Suva as its regional hub.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be more Speights in Fiji in the future and, one
fears, in other South Pacific states,'' Fiji expert Brij Lal of the
Australian National University wrote in Thursday's edition of The
Australian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some conflicts already were bubbling throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Solomon Islands, one ethnic faction has taken up arms
to force another off the nation's main island, Guadalcanal. Dozens
of people have been killed in fighting in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   -- Parts of Papua New Guinea have been pushed close to anarchy
recently by infighting and lawlessness in a nation that hundreds of
tribes call home.
</P>
<P>
   -- International peacekeepers continue to patrol Bougainville, an
island in eastern Papua New Guinea. A 10-year secessionist war in
Bougainville cost thousands of lives before a cease-fire was signed
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Samoa, two former Cabinet ministers were sentenced to death
earlier this year for their part in the assassination of a
government colleague, a plot that revolved around attempts to stamp
out corruption. The ministers' sentences have since been commuted
to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Roderick Alley, a political science professor at Victoria
University in New Zealand's capital, Wellington, says many of the
Pacific's problems are rooted in attempts by former colonial powers
to impose Western democratic systems on traditionally tribal
societies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a link in terms of colonial legacy of government
systems grafted on to these cultures,'' he said. ''Indigenous
people are complaining about the loss of their land or the
violation of culture and custom.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding credence to that argument is Tonga, one of the region's
most stable countries -- it is ruled by a prime minister appointed
for life by the country's monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has claimed he launched his coup on behalf of all
indigenous Fijians, whom he says have been marginalized by a 1997
constitution that he claims gave Fijians of Indian descent too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, taken hostage and then deposed
by Speight's coup, was Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister.
Indians descended from cane cutters brought to Fiji by British
rulers form a sizable minority in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   But ethnic tensions are just one factor in the mix.
Mismanagement and corruption also has eroded government authority
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   There is ''a legacy of poor public management ... and also quite
serious corruption in Papua New Guinea, a certain amount in the
Solomons, certainly some in Vanuatu,'' Alley said.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts agree the Pacific does not always live up to its
peaceful image, they cite some success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fry, of the Australian National University's Research
School of Pacific and Asian Studies, pointed to the Samoan
assassination case as ultimately a victory for law, order, strong
government and independent courts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was dealt with as a murder, the people responsible are in
jail, and the government went on,'' Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace has returned to the islands of New Caledonia after years
of sporadic violence between independence supporters trying to
break away from colonial ruler France and pro-Parisian forces. A
plan is in place for the country's transition to self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   And while there are still peacekeepers in Bougainville, a
cease-fire has held there for years and negotiations are under way
with a view to giving it limited autonomy from Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   But even in rock-solid democracies like New Zealand, there
remain rumblings from indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was visited Friday by a delegation from a radical group
of Maori, New Zealand's first people.
</P>
<P>
   Tama Iti, spokesman for Tino Rangatira Tanga, a group that
advocates Maori sovereignty in New Zealand, said indigenous people
throughout the Pacific had been dominated by and discriminated
against by colonialist settlers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Police Chided in Luxembourg Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The world's largest journalists' group
has asked that Luxembourg police tactics be investigated after
officers posing as a TV crew lured a gunman into an ambush to end a
hostage crisis. One journalism professor, however, said he would
excuse the deception because lives were saved.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman emerged for an ''interview'' Thursday holding a
child in one arm and a grenade in the other, police posing as
cameramen shot him twice in the head. That led to the rescue of 25
children and three adults held hostage for about 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are disturbing tactics,'' cautioned Aidan White, general
secretary of the Brussels-based International Federation of
Journalists, which represents more than 450,000 journalists
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each year many journalists die reporting on incidents of
violence. ... Their life is dangerous enough without adding to
their difficulties,'' White said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg police defended their strategy, saying it minimized
the threat to the hostages. Interior Minister Michel Wolter said
the hostage-taker's demand for TV airtime gave police an
opportunity to get a clear shot.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern University journalism professor Nicholas Daniloff
said the tactic was ''a case of deception, and journalists as a
whole try not to be deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   And Fred Brown, chairman of the Society for Professional
Journalists' Ethics Committee, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just adds to the sense that journalists are not always
what or who they appear to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daniloff said the situation called for extreme measures.
Since the hostages were freed unharmed and the hostage-taker
arrested, Daniloff said he would be inclined to forgive this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a question of saving lives,'' he said. ''You can
argue that the results justified what was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostage-taker Neji Bejaoui, an unemployed Tunisian immigrant,
was shot at the day-care center in Wasserbillig, a village of 2,300
people in eastern Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Bejaoui was recovering from his injuries Friday after surgery,
and police said his wounds were no longer life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities released details Friday about the 39-year-old gunman
who brandished a pistol, a hand grenade and a knife as he seized
his hostages Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Luxembourg government said Bejaoui had a history of violence
and was convicted of assault in 1998. He had been seeing a
psychiatrist for several years. Its statement called Bejaoui ''very
unstable'' and said he suffers from paranoia and craves attention.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Bejaoui, who lived in the nearby village of
Manternach and obtained Luxembourgish nationality in 1991, was
seeking to avenge a 1994 decision to deny him custody of his two
children. Residents of Wasserbillig said he blamed the day-care
center for the loss of custody when he and his wife separated.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said police were forced to
act when Bejaoui demanded to flee in a car with three children. The
government said the decision to act also came after Bejaoui brought
crying children to the telephone, then refused to speak to police
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Police then sent in the two officers disguised as journalists
with Radio Television Luxembourg. Col. Pierre Reuland of the
Luxembourg police said the force requisitioned cameras and other
equipment from RTL.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment on reports police had used a gun hidden in
a camera, but RTL Station Manager Vic Reuter said the camera was
returned with no damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a legal request, so we had no opportunity to refuse
it,'' Reuter told The Associated Press. ''They wouldn't tell us
what it was for. We discovered the use just like the rest of the
journalists, only after it had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuter said he had mixed feelings about the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course we are happy we could contribute (to the rescue). On
the other hand, we are journalists and are conscious of the fact
this might have consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bejaoui seized 37 children and the three teachers Wednesday at
the Sparrow's Nest center. He released eight children that day and
then demanded a flight to take him to Libya. He freed two toddlers
Thursday morning and two more around noon, leaving three adults and
25 children aged 2 to 11 as hostages.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Panel Planned in Congo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council has decided to create
a panel of experts to investigate how the exploitation of Congo's
diamonds and other natural resources has fueled the country's war.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel would take six months to collect
information on the illegal exploitation of resources -- traveling to
Congo and other countries if need be -- and report back to the
council with recommendations, according to a statement formally
adopted Friday by the 15 ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   Congo has accused Rwanda and Uganda of backing rebels in the
country so they can have access to Congo's diamond and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   The council's statement also suggested, however, that the team
would look into government-controlled exploitation of natural
resources and how that has prolonged the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The statement distinguished between ''illegal exploitation''
that violates Congo's sovereignty and how the basic ''exploitation
of the natural resources and other forms of wealth'' has fueled the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused President Laurent Kabila's government of
using its diamond holdings to solicit support from neighboring
countries in its war against the rebels. Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola have backed Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council, already concerned at how diamonds have
fueled Angola's civil war, asked Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a
January resolution to suggest ways to curb the exploitation. Backed
by France, Annan recommended a panel of experts, similar to the one
that uncovered massive violations of a diamond ban on Angola's
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Annan has also recently suggested that the council look into how
Sierra Leone's rebels have benefitted from that country's diamond
mines, which some estimate have earned the rebels $200 million a
year since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Integrating Russia  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- President Clinton is taking a mixed message of
hope and concern over the future of democracy in Russia to his
first summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Clearly,
though, he is extending a hand of friendship to the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   After a close-up look at an emerging new course in European
politics, known as a Progressive or Third Way movement, Clinton was
flying today to Moscow with limited expectations of persuading
Putin to help clear a way for a new U.S. anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Candid about concerns over Russia's future, and speaking after
another move by Putin to consolidate his power over regional
chiefs, Clinton said Friday on what probably is his last trip to
Europe as president that much needs to be done to achieve European
unity. And that, he said, includes the development of ''a Russia
that is fully democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing concern about Russia's direction and dismay over its
forceful crackdown on rebels in the republic of Chechnya, Clinton
also said ''there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable
journey over these last few years from dictatorship to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia,'' he
declared, specifically mentioning NATO, the Western military
alliance, and the 15-nation European Union which focuses on trade
and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Full normalization of relations with Moscow will bring about
''the end of our vision of an undivided continent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is eyeing Clinton, as well. The former KGB official is
known for listening intently and saying little. He has already
warned that if Clinton chooses to go ahead with a missile shield
against North Korea, Iran and other so-called ''rogue states,''
Russia might abandon the whole regimen of arms control accords with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aims to reassure Putin that Russia was not the target of
the anti-missile shield. He is offering to share some of the future
technology with Russia and with other ''civilized'' friendly
nations.
</P>
<P>
   And once in Moscow, Clinton and Putin are expected to announce
their intention to cooperate in strengthening early warning
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reflected on Europe's past and its future in Aachen as
he accepted the Charlemagne Prize, awarded annually by the town's
city fathers to those who do the most to advance European unity.
</P>
<P>
   He is the third American to win the award in its 50-year
history, and the first U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the sacrifices of many Americans who helped
rebuild Europe in the years since World War II, and to the work of
previous recipients.
</P>
<P>
   In a sun-drenched ceremony Friday outside the city's famed
Aachen cathedral, Clinton saluted the ''shining light of European
union.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe is more united, more democratic and more peaceful than
ever,'' Clinton said. But, he added, ''The job or rebuilding Europe
is not finished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ''first piece of unfinished business'' was to
resolve long-simmering tensions in southeastern Europe. He said
that not only means peace in the Balkans but a full partnership for
Turkey with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   As for Russia, Clinton said, ''There is certainly reason for
hope,'' despite many remaining obstacles and the state of Russia's
still-fragile democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he cited ''Russia's remarkable journey'' since the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and told a crowd of several hundred
villagers and international dignitaries:
</P>
<P>
   ''We must build real institutional links to Russia. It will not
be easy. But it is possible, and absolutely necessary,'' the
president said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Infrastructure Weakened  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a mess in Washington, this one
underground. Many of the city's water, telephone, sewer and gas
systems are on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The capital's underground systems were among the earliest
installed anywhere in the United States, and utility companies are
struggling to keep them going.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of our existing infrastructure has reached the end of its
useful life,'' said Dan Tangherlini, the capital's transportation
director. ''These folks are under court orders and consent decrees
to replace that infrastructure, or have made business decisions to
modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than a dozen companies and scores of contract
crews have been aggressively ripping up Washington's streets to
install the fiber optic cables that will form the
telecommunications network of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber optic lines are closer to the surface than water and
sewer lines. That means when older gas, water and sewer lines have
to be replaced over the next two decades, the fiber optics could
also be subject to relocation -- a problem likely to be faced by
many cities with webs of cables from competing utilities
crisscrossing streets.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarty, assistant executive director of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, said his group's 1,100 member cities face an
annual investment gap of $34 million for upgrades in water and
sewer systems alone.
</P>
<P>
   For District of Columbia residents and commuters from the
Maryland and Virginia suburbs, what's underground isn't nearly the
problem as the daily punishment inflicted on their cars by the
capital's pockmarked roads.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city has spent $5 billion to repair and resurface
its 1,421 miles of roads in the past 25 years, roadbuilding experts
say the streets are likely to get only worse.
</P>
<P>
   Trenchwork for optic cables has added insult to injury. After an
outcry, Mayor Anthony Williams declared a monthlong moratorium, and
set new guidelines requiring that streets be repaired within 45 of
the completion of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the moratorium, contractors paid a one-time processing
fee of $24 for each project. District officials are now considering
charging companies between 14 cents and 88 cents a linear foot for
underground work and fees of 38 cents to $1.88 for utilities strung
in public space above ground. The higher fees could generate
between $6 million and $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous work on sewer, gas, electric and telephone
lines could jeopardize Williams' plan to resurface 150 blocks of
city streets in fiscal year 2001. City officials concede it could
take two years simply to develop a mapping system that pinpoints
the locations of all the underground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly a spaghetti bowl under the streets,'' said
Councilwoman Sharon Ambrose at a hearing prompted by yet another
problem -- 13 manhole fires and explosions since February.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blasts just released a little smoke, but others blew
the 80-pound steel disks 30 feet or more into the air. A manhole
cover on a sidewalk outside the White House where tourists often
gather was among those sent flying. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A panel created by Congress to oversee the district's finances
estimates it could take as much as $5 billion to put Washington's
infrastructure in shape. Some work is already happening.
</P>
<P>
   The independent D.C. Water and Sewer Authority, for example, is
in the third year of a $1.6 billion 10-year capital improvement
plan. The Blue Plains water treatment plant, with a capacity of 370
million gallons a day and 130,000 residential and commercial
customers, is connected to sewer lines dating to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Newer infrastructure systems are not immune. For the past 13
months, train operators on the Metrorail subway system have been
forced to use manual breaking controls because of problems with
17,000 electrical relays used in the 103-mile long system that
serves 549,000 riders each day. In April, firefighters had to
evacuate 273 passengers from a subway tunnel after an electrical
fire between stations.
</P>
<P>
   The transit agency is spending $254 million on maintenance and
repairs to the 24-year-old system this year.

<HEADLINE> Czar Nicholas II To Be Canonized  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After years of deliberation, the Russian Orthodox
Church seems close to canonizing the nation's last czar, Nicholas
II -- already regarded as a saint by many Orthodox believers.
</P>
<P>
   The church's council of bishops will meet in August, and it is
expected to rule that Czar Nicholas Romanov and his family deserve
sainthood for the humble way in which they accepted death at the
hands of the communist Bolsheviks, said Father Maxim Maximov,
secretary of the Holy Synod's commission on canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view it will be positive,'' Maximov said of the
council's decision.
</P>
<P>
   A weak but imperious ruler, Nicholas was executed in 1918 by a
Bolshevik firing squad. He has already been canonized as a martyr
by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, a group that broke away from
the Moscow patriarchate over its acceptance of the Soviet regime.
</P>
<P>
   The exiled church has made Nicholas' canonization by the Moscow
patriarchate a precondition for reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Many inside the main branch of the Church are also pushing for
the czar to be declared a saint, with some clerics telling their
parishioners that he is already a saint, regardless of the Church's
official decision.
</P>
<P>
   A weeping icon of Nicholas has been touring Orthodox churches;
the myrrh that it leaks is regarded as a miracle, and evidence of
the czar's sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Canonization has already taken place, for the Lord himself has
glorified him, and weeping are his icons,'' said Father Igor
Konkov, a priest who leads the congregation at the 17th-century
Church of the Nine Martyrs in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a believer, the question is settled,'' Konkov said. ''It's
our (church) hierarchy that's holding it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Scaffolding reaches to the ceiling of the dimly lit nave of the
church, which is covered with frescoes. The church has become a
center of grass-roots support for canonizing the last czar.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged parishioner stood near the entryway, holding out a
small reproduction of the weeping icon as he spoke of the miracles
he believes it has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been healed, and their everyday problems have been
solved,'' said the parishioner, who gave only his first name,
Alexander. ''People ask and receive what they have asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarchate still refuses to give the Romanovs martyr
status, which is meant for those who have died for their faith. But
the Synod's commission has recommended that the family be canonized
as passion-bearers, for suffering their fate with Christian
humility, Maximov said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nicholas II rejected offers by foreign governments to smuggle
him out of the country,'' Maximov said.
</P>
<P>
   An aura of mystery and violence surrounds the last czar, and
believers talk about his canonization as a sacred obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia carries the burden of the sin of regicide,'' said
Alexander. ''And to atone for this sin, it takes repentance by
every person, and the glorification of the sovereign.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeper inside the Church of the Nine Martyrs, almost deserted on
a Friday afternoon, an elderly woman with a dark scarf covering her
head was bent in prayer over a copy of another icon of Nicholas.
Believers say that portrait once leaked blood -- a miracle and
potent sign in the Orthodox tradition.
</P>
<P>
   After Nicholas and his family were shot by the Bolsheviks, their
bodies were burned and the remains dumped in a mass grave outside
the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   The nine skeletons were recovered from a roadside pit in 1991,
and repeated DNA testing confirmed their identities as Nicholas,
his wife, three of their children and four servants.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were reburied in 1998 in St. Petersburg, the
traditional place of interment for the royal dynasty. The bodies of
Nicholas' two other children were never found.

<HEADLINE> Town Welcomes New Bush Ranch  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAWFORD, Texas (AP) -- The road to Gov. George W. Bush's country
home winds through rolling pastures dotted with wildflowers and
cactus, chin-high stalks of corn and bales of golden hay.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle outnumber people along Prairie Chapel Road, the stretch
in western McLennan County where Bush bought a 1,580-acre spread
last August and is building a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can get out in the middle of that ranch and talk to the
cows,'' Bush said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's when they start talking back that makes me a little
nervous,'' he joked in that interview, with Yahoo on the Internet.
But he concluded more seriously, ''I do get away and I can find
solitude and that's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the nearby town of Crawford say Bush has found the
perfect place to escape big city bustle and high-pressure politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good town to wind down in,'' said Lola Solero, who runs
an antique store called the Lonesome Dove. ''There's nothing
nerve-racking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the one-stoplight town of 700 say they hope Bush's new
weekend home will become a vacation Texas White House if the
Republican contender wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see it attracting tourists and small businesses to
town,'' said Mayor Robert Campbell. He said he hopes Bush will
follow the example of President Johnson, who often returned to his
LBJ Ranch near Johnson City and delighted in showing off the land
to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   From the road, Bush's new ranch looks like any other farmland in
the area. There are no signs with the Bush name on the fenced-in
property. The only entrance, by a dirt road, has a locked metal
gate.
</P>
<P>
   The property is about 18 miles west of Waco, about 90 miles
north of the governor's mansion in Austin and just northeast of
Fort Hood, which could be used to land Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The big draw for Bush and his wife, Laura, was the beautiful and
varied topography, said Kenneth Engelbrecht, whose family sold Bush
the property. Bush has not released financial details of the
purchase but local real estate agents have said the land is
probably worth $800 to $900 per acre, or at least $1.2 million. The
county tax appraiser's office says the market value is $988,353.
</P>
<P>
   The property, which adjoins a tributary of the Middle Bosque
River, features waterfalls cascading over limestone cliffs, hiking
trails and plains of native grasses and wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if they ever saw it, they'd have to have it. It's that
pretty,'' said Engelbrecht, who has lived there his entire life and
still oversees the property and several hundred head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes have renovated a 60-year-old farmhouse that
Engelbrecht's parents built, and are building another home on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will have a huge porch that wraps around the house that
catches all the southerly breezes,'' said Texas Secretary of State
Elton Bomer, a Bush family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, an avid fisherman, has built a private fishing lake on the
land, which will be stocked with largemouth bass, Bomer said.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Bush has insisted that contractors building the new
house preserve trees on the property, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The property also has native wildlife, including turkey, but
Bush said he has no plans to go hunting for the big birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather look at them than shoot them,'' he told Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say they know the Bushes are in town only when they
see a convoy of cars or Secret Service agents buying hamburgers at
the town's only restaurant, a converted gas station called The
Coffee Station.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife sold their home in Dallas after his 1994
election as governor. They've been living in the governor's mansion
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Some Crawford residents say they hope Bush's presence leads to
economic development in Crawford, which consists of two blocks of
mostly empty storefronts on Texas Highway 317.
</P>
<P>
   The town once had four grocery stores, a drugstore, movie
theater and car dealership. Now most residents work and shop in
Waco, although the city does boast five churches and a growing
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Max Shaw said he has mixed feelings about the impact of his
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might get a grocery store again,'' Shaw said. ''But then
again I might have to quit (raccoon) hunting out there. The Secret
Service might not like it.''

<HEADLINE> Passengers Wait 8 Hours on Runway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- About 200 passengers on a United Airlines flight
bound for Washington, D.C. sat on the runway at O'Hare
International Airport for more than eight hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1806 was scheduled to take off at 1:44 p.m. The wheels
finally left the tarmac at 9:53 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 777 was one of hundreds delayed by a string of
thunderstorms on the East Coast, United Airlines spokesman Kurt
Ebenhoch said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was only one flight path open and that was through St.
Louis and priority was given to flights already in the air,''
Ebenhoch said. He said air traffic controllers continued to delay
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had known the delay would have been this long, we would
never have left (the gate),'' Ebenhoch said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was forced to return to the gate twice, once to refuel
and once to replace crew members who had been on duty too long
under Federal Aviation Administration rules.
</P>
<P>
   There were no meals available to the passengers during the
delay, but Ebenhoch said the flight crew passed out granola bars
stored on the plane for unexpected delays.
</P>
<P>
   United decided not to cancel the flight because all the other
storm delays would have made it difficult for the passengers to
make other plans to reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Some passengers were allowed to make brief trips into the
terminal when the plane was called back, but most remained onboard
during the delay, Ebenhoch said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, winter weather led to a similar flight delay at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport, with passengers stranded aboard a
Northwest Airlines flight for more than eight hours. The incident
led to a class-action lawsuit filed by passengers inconvenienced by
the delay.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Questions SBA Practices  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator wants answers from Small
Business Administration chief Aida Alvarez for why employees sign
their own travel expense vouchers and why she has spent so much
time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said in a statement that those
practices amount to an abuse of the SBA's travel and expense
accounts. In a letter to Alvarez dated Thursday, Coverdell, R-Ga.,
a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, also criticized
the SBA's use of ''advance teams,'' and the practice of SBA
employees approving their own trips and reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am troubled by the potential abuse of taxpayer dollars by
the SBA,'' Coverdell said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell listed 63 SBA employees who approved their own
expenses without review in the past year, and gave eight examples
of their expense vouchers, ranging from $250 to $2,000. All but two
of the 63 cases involved either district directors or regional
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also upbraided Alvarez for spending one-quarter of her
working days on the road ''in light of the agency's problems in its
core programs.'' And he asked why advance personnel were necessary
for SBA trips when the agency has 70 field offices, some of which
are staffed by as many as 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It baffles me why you as the Administrator of the SBA need an
'advance team' under any circumstances,'' Coverdell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Christopher S. ''Kit''
Bond, R-Mo., requested the travel expense documents from the SBA a
year ago, according to Coverdell's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paperwork provided by the SBA raises some troubling issues
about potential abuse of taxpayer dollars,'' Coverdell's chief of
staff, Zaid Ojakli said Friday. ''And we're looking forward to an
explanation from them.''

<HEADLINE> Settler's Remains Stir Debate  </HEADLINE>
By TRUDY TYNAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. (AP) -- What remains of Elisha Nims -- a bit of
spine still holding the French musket ball that killed him -- is a
bone of contention more than 250 years after he died near here
outside an English outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Some local historians wanted to rebury Nims' bones on Memorial
Day in a historic cemetery. But those plans were called off when
others balked at burying an Englishman alongside Revolutionary War
veterans on a day of remembrance for America's war dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now no one is quite sure what to do with what's left of Nims, a
French and Indian War casualty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no clue, but we will have a meeting soon to discuss
it,'' Daniel Connerton, chairman of the North Adams Historical
Commission, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He had supported plans by Jean Vincent, a library trustee and
curator of the city's historical collection, to ceremonially bury
the vertebrae complete with the musket ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the remains of a human being,'' said Vincent, who has
not allowed the bones and bullet to be placed on display.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could bury him on Veterans Day,'' said Mayor John Barrett,
who agreed to cancel the Memorial Day burial in hopes of ''keeping
peace in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The burial plans prompted complaints from some who say the
Englishman's remains have no place among those of American
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely foolish and totally inappropriate to put him
in with American soldiers. Mr. Nims was an English settler when the
United States of America was not even a twinkle in anyone's eye,''
said Paul Marino, a local historian.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Nims' descendants contacted and the bones sent to the
Army Pathological Institute for DNA testing to confirm their
identity. He also wants a cast made of the damaged spine and the
musket ball preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bullet could be the gem of the North Adams historical
collection if it could be documented,'' he said. ''Then the bones
could be reinterred in Deerfield with the Nims family looking on.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Oathout, of Gloversville, N.Y, who is married to an
eighth-generation descendant of Nims' brother Moses, said she
previously viewed the spine fragment more as a piece of history
than a relative's remains.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ''It would be nice to have an appropriate,
dignified resting place. I think that would be more important than
where and when.''
</P>
<P>
   Oathout, who acts as historian of the Deerfield-based Nims
Family Association, said she could understand concerns that the
remains not be buried as though they belonged to an American
soldier. She added, though, ''When we think of Americans, we think
of people who came here for one reason or another.''
</P>
<P>
   According to local histories, 26-year-old Nims was mortally
wounded in June 1745 during a raid by French and Indian forces on
Fort Massachusetts, established by British colonial authorities to
protect the settlers here.
</P>
<P>
   The stockade fell during the raid and was burned. More than 30
settlers, including women and children, were taken captive. About
half survived a forced march to Canada and eventually were
ransomed.
</P>
<P>
   Nims' original grave and headstone were discovered in 1852. A.L.
Perry, a professor at nearby Williams College, unearthed the
skeleton and cut out the portion of spine bearing the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he gave the remains and the headstone to the local
historical society. Over the years the remainder of the skeleton
and headstone have disappeared along with the little graveyard
where Nims was originally buried.
</P>
<P>
   The site where Fort Massachusetts once stood is now a
supermarket parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our best guess is his original grave is now under the Fortune
Garden Chinese Restaurant,'' Marino said.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Highlights Book of Kings  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 1,000-year-old poem, lavishly illustrated
over the centuries and still at the heart of Iran's troubled
politics, goes on show Sunday at the Smithsonian Institution's
Sackler Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 60,000 verses in ornate script, the Shahnama or Book
of Kings may be the world's longest epic. In writing it, the poet
Firdawsi, regarded as Iran's greatest, combined history, legend,
fighting, feasting, hunting and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Massumeh Farhad, co-curator of the show, visited her homeland
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book is just as important as it always was,'' she said.
''Like Shakespeare in England or Homer in Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one scholar thinks one story may be the distant
ancestor of Shakespeare's Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Another tale recounts how Shah Bahram V went hunting on a camel
with his harpist Azada. She challenged him to shoot an arrow that
would pin the hoof of a wild ass to its ear. His first shot grazed
its ear, and when the animal raised a hoof to scratch it, his
second arrow pinned ear and hoof together.
</P>
<P>
   The shah's feat failed to impress her, causing him to shove her
from the camel and the beautiful harpist was trampled to death. A
yellow and green tile, borrowed from New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art, depicts the story.
</P>
<P>
   Firdawsi was a Muslim; professing another faith in the Iran of
1010 might have cost him his head. But his loyalty seems to have
been lukewarm to the religion that Arab conquerors brought to his
country. Though the Book of Kings is in Arabic script, like Iranian
writing today, he made a point of rhyming in pure Iranian, using
few of the Arabic words that now pervade the language.
</P>
<P>
   The poet was denied burial in a Muslim cemetery and his
suspected heresy makes him less than popular among the fervent
Islamists who now rule Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to change the name of the university called after
Firdawsi,'' said Dr. Mansour Panah, who now practices in Bowie, Md.
''But it was as if someone tried to change the name of George
Washington University. After a few years they went back to the old
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon B. Alterman, who specializes in Iran at the United States
Institute of Peace, said that when revolutionaries overthrew the
last shah in 1979, they were looking to Islamic revolutions in a
series of countries. Now he sees young Iranians looking more toward
the nationalist ideas symbolized by the Book of Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ''To this day the poem is considered a potent expression of
Persian literary and national identity,'' says the Sackler
Gallery's introduction to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Successive conquerors of Iran sought to legitimize their rule by
commissioning elaborately illustrated editions of book. The
pictures would typically show earlier conquerors, such as Alexander
the Great, in Iranian garb and performing Iranian deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are among the best work of Iranian art and
form the core of the 38 works in the exhibit: ''The Heroic Past:
the Persian Book of Kings.'' It will be open through Oct. 29,
Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Piazza Examined After Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets catcher Mike Piazza went to a Manhattan
hospital for a CAT scan before Friday's game against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, then returned to the ballpark with medical clearance to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, I just attributed it to the trip back from the West
Coast,'' Piazza said, ''but after I had been up two or three hours,
I still felt sluggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was struck in the head Wednesday night by the bat of the
Dodgers' Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really headaches -- just like fogginess -- but I'll be
all right,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was hit by on Sheffield's follow-through Wednesday night
at Los Angeles, taking a stitch in the head to stop bleeding and
was reported to have a slight concussion. He had originally been
expected to play Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, hitting .372 with 14 homers and 36 RBIs in 45 games, was
sent to the Hospital of Special Surgery in Manhattan for the test.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jamie Moyer returned from a seven-week stint on
the disabled list and pitched five innings for the win as the
Seattle Mariners beat the San Diego Padres 7-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez, who hit .441 with 10 homers, 32 RBIs and 24 runs
scored in May, picked up where he left off in the new month by
going 2-for-5 with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez got to stay in the lineup because the designated hitter
is used in interleague games played at AL parks.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (3-1), who was sidelined because of a strained muscle in
the back of his left shoulder, was activated before the game. He
gave up Tony Gwynn's single and Phil Nevin's 14th home run in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer limited the Padres to two hits in the next four innings
before being replaced by Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sprague, replacing Ryan Klesko at first base, committed a
two-run throwing error in the second to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   After John Olerud led off the Seattle second with a double, Matt
Clement (5-4) walked Jay Buhner. David Bell bunted and Sprague
threw wildly over second baseman Bret Boone, allowing both runners
to score.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko did not start because of a slightly stiff back. He
pinch-hit in the ninth and struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners went ahead with two runs in the third. With one
out, Martinez singled and Clement followed with walks to Olerud and
Buhner to load the bases. Bell hit an RBI single and Dan Wilson had
a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   After Alex Rodriguez drew a walk from Matt Whiteside in the
seventh, Martinez followed with his 16th home run of the season.
The Mariners got another run in the inning when Mark McLemore drew
a bases-loaded walk by Carlos Almanzar.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres scored twice in the eighth on Nevin's RBI single and
a wild pitch. Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his eighth save
in nine chances.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, pitching for the first time since April 14, struck out
three and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, who lost for the fourth time in his last five
decisions, had three wild pitches, giving him 12 for the season and
tying him with Cincinnati's Scott Williamson for the most in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
Notes: San Diego lost for the second time in eight games. ...
Seattle's Rickey Henderson came out of the game after six innings
because of a stiff neck. ... 3B Carlos Guillen was optioned to
Triple-A Tacoma when the Mariners activated Moyer. Guillen was
hitting .143 with no home runs and five RBIs in 23 games this
season. He began the season as Seattle's starting 3B, but lost his
job when he went on the DL April 13-27 with a pulled left
hamstring. ... The Padres announced that LHP Matt Whisenant has
cleared waivers and been outrighted to Triple-A Las Vegas.
Whisenant was designated for assignment on Tuesday.

Fiji Rebels: Military Backed Out

   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels who have seized control of Parliament charged
Saturday that Fiji's military has backed out of an agreement that would have led
to the quick release of 30 hostages. Rebel leader George Speight had earlier
said he might release his captives this weekend, following an agreement with the
military to let Fiji's influential tribal chiefs determine the next form of
government -- military or civilian. But the rebels said Saturday that the
military had changed its mind.

some mistakes were made by NATO, I am very satisfied that there was no
deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets by NATO during

on the island who had required that 23 women suing factories on the island must

percentage point from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent reached in April. While

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--New York Senate, Bjt,510  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sen. Chuck Schumer announced a new gun licensing
proposal on Friday and said New Yorkers should elect Hillary Rodham
Clinton to join him in the Senate so that she can vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers deserve a senator in Washington who we can
absolutely count on every single time there's a critical gun
control vote,'' said Schumer, who joined fellow Democrat Clinton at
a news conference at the Manhattan headquarters of the United
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No hesitation, no equivocation, no waiting till the last
minute to announce a position, but true, iron-clad commitment to
stand with the people of New York on gun control,'' Schumer said.
''New York needs Hillary Clinton because she will vote with us on
gun control 100 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said that under his proposal, which he will formally
introduce next week, a person would have to pass a gun-safety
course and obtain a gun license in order to buy a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be a three-year renewable photo license that can be
easily renewed just like a driver's license or a passport at state
agencies, so long as the individual has not committed a crime or
done some other act that makes them ineligible to own a gun,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is running for U.S. Senate against Republican Rep.
Rick Lazio, said the proposal ''is the right fight for New York,
and it's the right fight for our children and families.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be here today to state my very strong support for
Chuck's new landmark gun-licensing legislation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a four-term congressman from Long Island, has backed a
variety of gun control measures but has called licensing
''invasive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud of my record on guns,'' Lazio said during a campaign
stop at a Brooklyn day-care center earlier Friday. ''I'm a former
prosecutor. I've stood with law enforcement. I was a co-sponsor of
the Brady Bill. Didn't just talk about it. I did it. I voted for
the assault weapons ban. I didn't just talk about it. I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about handgun registration, he said he has not seen a plan
that is ''workable'' and he favors other gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have smart-gun technology which is now already developed,''
Lazio said. ''If you have only the person who owns the gun who can
shoot the gun, where you have the ability to track potentially the
ammunition. There's a lot of things that we can do from a
technological standpoint that will be much less bureaucratic and
much less invasive and will yield at least as good results, if not
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's position on gun control was virtually
indistinguishable from that of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose exit
from the Senate race because of his prostate cancer opened the door
for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she would fight Lazio on the issues, adding,
''Supporting this bill is another one of the important differences
between me and my opponent.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Said Up For Sale Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Interbrew SA, the Belgian brewery that owns the
Toronto Blue Jays, will soon receive a new set of offers to buy the
team, the Toronto Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those interested in purchasing the team, valued at $150
million by its owner, are Rogers Communications, Bell Canada
Enterprises, CanWest Global and Sportsco, which last year bought
the SkyDome, the Blue Jays' ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball commissioner Bud Selig said Friday he hasn't
heard anything about a proposed sale, a Blue Jays official speaking
on the condition he not be identified said the organizations are
among the ''multiple parties interested'' in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Interbrew had the team up for sale in 1997, but yanked the
two-time World Series champions off the market because the
uncertainty distracted many of the team's top players.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 103, Lakers 93  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In one week, the Portland Trail Blazers
have gone from ''death's door'' to the threshold of one of the
NBA's greatest comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   When it counted most, Portland finally beat the Los Angeles
Lakers at home Friday night, sending the Western Conference finals
to a deciding Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 26 points and Bonzi Wells had a
career-playoff high 20, 14 in the fourth quarter, as the Trail
Blazers took the lead halfway through the first quarter and never
gave it up in a 103-93 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored 33 points for Los Angeles and played the
entire game despite a sprained right foot, but it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, the team Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson said
was ''at death's door'' after the Lakers won twice in Portland a
week ago, can become the seventh team to come back from a 3-1
deficit to win a series, and the first to do it in the West finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a team effort today,'' Scottie Pippen said. ''It was a
great game. We knew what we were up against, and we stepped up to
the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's second consecutive victory, and first at home in four
tries against Los Angeles, tied the series 3-3. Indiana's opponent
in the NBA Finals will be determined in a showdown Sunday in Los
Angeles, where the Blazers have won two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to lay it all down,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ''The
fans have to be ready, the city has to be ready and the players
have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he knew it would be difficult to beat Portland
three consecutive times in the Rose Garden, and his players
understand how tough this series is.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not happy with their performance, that's for sure,''
Jackson said, ''but they understand this is a war. We lost a battle
tonight, but the war's not over.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, averaging 29.2 points in the playoffs, had 17 points and
11 rebounds but was only 7-for-17 from the field and 3-for-10 at
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they played extremely well on Shaquille,'' Jackson
said. ''A lot of his touches were crowded. It was tough for us to
get spacing on the floor to get it in to him. But they were giving
us other things. We had the types of shots we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity has built as the Blazers tightened the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've noticed as the games went on they started to turn away
from playing the game and started to do other activities away from
the game,'' Pippen said, ''taking cheap shots at guys to try to
start altercations. I'm just telling my guys to stay focused, play
hard and try to walk away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Fox said to me, 'It's going to be on in L.A.' I'm looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, O'Neal missed his first six shots and was
called for a flagrant foul for flattening Pippen on a drive to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   After lying on the floor for several minutes, Pippen got to his
feet and made one of two free throws to put Portland ahead 60-49
with 5:21 to play in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hit me pretty hard,'' Pippen said. ''It was obvious what he
was trying to do. He had no intention of going to the ball, so I'll
see if he gets fined $10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was fined $10,000 for an elbow to the back of John
Salley's head late in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored a series-low nine points and was just 1-for-6 from
the field, but the deep, talented Blazers had more than enough
offense elsewhere with five players in double figures. Rasheed
Wallace scored 18, Damon Stoudamire 14, 10 in the first half, and
Arvydas Sabonis had 10 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many weapons, coming off the bench and as starters,
they have to key on five guys,'' Wells said, ''not two like the
other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice and Brian Shaw scored 12 apiece for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers clinched the victory by going 15-for-16 at the foul
line in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were playing desperate ball,'' O'Neal said. ''But we knew
it was going to be hard to come up here and win three games.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 1-for-1 from the field and 2-for-2 at the line in the
fourth quarter. Bryant was 4-for-6 on 3-pointers in the fourth
quarter and 6-for-9 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers took an 83-68 lead on Wells' two free throws with
6:56 to go, but Los Angeles mounted one last challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw hit a 3-pointer and O'Neal made two free throws,
after going 1-for-8 up until then, to cut it to 83-75 with 5:31 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Then coach Mike Dunleavy put Smith back into the game. Bryant
committed his fifth foul on Pippen's drive to the basket, and the
two free throws put Portland ahead 86-75, then Smith sank a
3-pointer from the corner to a deafening roar and the Blazers were
up 89-75 with 4:49 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's 3-point barrage cut it to eight on several occasions,
but Portland responded with free throws to hold off any late
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defining moment was late in the game when we kept making
pushes and they kept getting to the line and knocking down free
throws,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Pippen was scoreless in the first half and didn't
take a shot until 34 seconds before the break, the Blazers led by
as many as 15 in the second quarter and were up 49-39 at the half.
Smith and Stoudamire had 12 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had eight tough-to-get points in the first half but was
0-for-6 at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, which has shot out to early leads in every game of the
series, used a 16-2 burst to take a 24-13 lead on Sabonis'
20-footer with 1:29 to play in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: One of the referees was Ron Garretson, who threw Wallace
out of Game 2. He gave Wallace the second technical for staring at
him. Although Garretson took a lot of heckling from the fans, there
were no exchanges between him and Wallace ... Among those in the
crowd: Tiger Woods, Bill Gates, Steven Speilberg and Clyde Drexler,
who got a huge ovation when shown on the giant video screen. ...
Sabonis, in foul trouble virtually throughout the series in his
matchup with O'Neal, didn't have a foul in 21 minutes on the court
in the first half. ... The last team to come back from a 3-1
deficit was Miami against New York in the 1997 Eastern Conference
semifinals. ... Fox and Dunleavy each drew a technical foul for a
heated exchange in the final minutes.

<HEADLINE> New Land Mine Detection Devloped  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- With land mines left over from past wars posing a
threat to peacetime populations, scientists at Georgia Institute of
Technology say they may have a way of detecting the devices as they
lay hidden from sight.
</P>
<P>
   The trick? Detect them with sound.
</P>
<P>
   Associate professor Waymond Scott and his team of researchers
say they have made progress with a system that shakes the ground to
create sound waves that could be used to detect all kinds of mines.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings were presented Friday at the 139th annual meeting
of the Acoustical Society of America in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The team has been testing the system in the lab with anti-tank
and anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to take the experimental system out into the field
doing the studies we're doing now in a more real environment,''
Scott said. ''The first most important thing we need to clearly
understand is how waves in the ground interact with mines so that
we can reliably detect them and find the best way to configure
different sensors.''
</P>
<P>
   Current systems using ground-penetrating radar can't tell the
difference between mines and rocks, roots, cans or sticks, Scott
said. Metal detectors, on the other hand, see every metal can,
scrap and shell casing, resulting in a high false alarm rate.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, there are 26,000 injuries or deaths a year from land
mines and about 100 million mines remain buried, according to
statistics compiled by the State Department, Red Cross and United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Tech mechanical and electrical engineers and
students are experimenting with a system that uses an
electrodynamic shaker in direct contact with the soil to create
measurable sound waves. As the waves travel through the ground, a
radar measures changes when the waves bounce off of a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   Scott predicted that a manufactured system to detect mines could
be from five to 10 years away.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things always take much longer than it would seem
because some of these things that seem rather simple can take a
long time to figure out the first time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> German Reporters Held in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages on a
southern Philippine island captured a group of German journalists
and held them for ransom, police said today.
</P>
<P>
   The group, together with a Filipino coordinator and two other
people, were released late Friday after paying $25,000 to members
of the Abu Sayyaf group, Inspector J.G. Sabdani of the Sulu
provincial police force said in a report.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists -- three from Germany's ZDF television, two from
Sat. 1, two from RTL television and one Der Spiegel reporter -- were
stopped by the rebels in the village of Bandang in Talipao near
Jolo, about halfway to the rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took their personal belongings like shoes,
wristwatches, bags, notebooks and other valuables, police said. One
journalist said the rebels also seized a satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   They were herded inside a cottage where the rebels demanded $1
million for their freedom, but the amount was later lowered to
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels then told four of the journalists to go back to Jolo
to collect the cash and threatened to behead one of those remaining
if they do not return with the money. The group was released after
the four handed over the cash, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The group had planned to visit the rebel camp to interview 21
hostages -- three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South
Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- who were
seized from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan April 23 and taken to
Jolo Island in the southern Philippines, about an hour away. Jolo
is 590 miles south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   A government negotiating panel met rebel leaders for their first
round of talks to free the hostages last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chief negotiator Robert Aventajado said today he expects the
second round of talks to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the first negotiations, Aventajado rejected two of the Abu
Sayyaf's three formal demands -- an independent Islamic state and a
commission to investigate the treatment of Filipinos in neighboring
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also asked that foreign fishing boats be prevented
from poaching.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they will prepare a response to the government's
stance before the second round of negotiations. The rebels are
expected to also ask informally for a sizable cash payment.
</P>
<P>
   While the Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two guerrilla groups
fighting for an independent Islamic state, espouse political
ideals, many say they are bandits who survive by kidnapping and
extortion. Most agree, however, that crime and disaffection in the
southern Philippines stem from poverty and discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Phone Book Misidentifies President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- It's not a wrong number in a phone
book but the wrong name of a native son that has callers abuzz in
northeastern Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andrew Johnson's statue in downtown Greeneville graces
the cover of the new Sprint Yellow Pages, the nation's 17th
president has been misidentified as fellow Tennessean Andrew
Jackson, the seventh president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's appropriate that in the new century, people still
don't know who Andrew Johnson is or where he's from,'' said Tom
Ferguson, president of the Greene County Partnership/Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But local residents know.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the first president to be impeached -- in 1868 over
his dispute with Congress on Reconstruction -- and attendance at the
Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Greeneville shot up after
President Clinton was impeached in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilhoit, a spokesman for Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, said
the error is ''embarrassing in a big way,'' but a correction isn't
likely because many of the 48,000 copies of the phone book already
have been distributed.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Found Oscars Robbed of $40K  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The man awarded $50,000 for finding dozens of
missing Oscars days before this year's Academy Awards program says
he lost $40,000 of it to burglars who broke into his apartment
while he was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't get a chance to even enjoy my money,'' a dejected
Willie Fulgear said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he returned home Thursday to discover burglars had made
off with a 500-pound safe containing the cash and jewelry. Fulgear
said he kept the cash at home rather than in a bank so his son
would have no trouble getting to it if anything happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Ed Funes, a police spokesman, said Fulgear reported the
burglary shortly after midnight Friday and the case was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Television broadcasts showed Fulgear's apartment being dusted
for fingerprints and photographed for damage. Calls to his home
went unanswered Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear received his reward from Roadway Express, the Akron,
Ohio-based company that shipped the awards. The 61-year-old salvage
man found 52 of 55 missing statues in a trash bin in the city's
Koreatown section March 19.
</P>
<P>
   One person has been charged in connection with the theft. Three
Oscars remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expressed its
gratitude by inviting Fulgear and his son to its March 26 show.

Israel: Syria May Wants New Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Syria may be signaling that it wants to resume peace talks
with Israel, an Israeli Cabinet minister said today, after Prime Minister Ehud
Barak made an overture to Damascus. Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
said that Syria is ''suddenly'' praising Israel after it pulled its army out of
Lebanon. The Iraqi-born Ben-Eliezer said there are nuances in Syrian statements
in Arabic that might indicate a new attitude. After meeting Thursday with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said
Syria would accept U.N. certification that Israel has fully withdrawn from
Lebanon.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department said Friday the nation's unemployment

reduction in nine years. The report showed the jobless rate rose by 0.2
percentage point from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent reached in April. While
private sector jobs declined, this was offset by government hiring of temporary
Census workers.

wheels finally left the tarmac at 9:53 p.m. The Boeing 777 was one of hundreds
delayed by a string of thunderstorms on the East Coast, United Airlines
spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said. There were no meals available to the passengers
during the delay, but the flight crew passed out granola bars stored on the

<HEADLINE> Bob Hope Makes Mark on Hometown  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Hope Drive. Bob Hope Cultural
Center. The Bob Hope-Chrysler Golf Classic.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to miss the impact that the 97-year-old
entertainer has had on the Palm Springs region, flush with second
homes for Hollywood's rich and famous, presidents, magnates and
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As Hope recovers from a bout of gastrointestinal bleeding, many
people in the sun-soaked Coachella Valley paused to reflect on just
how much he means to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Hope is Palm Springs and that's how we all feel,'' Mark
Graves of the Palm Springs/Desert Resorts Convention and Visitors
Authority, said Friday. ''He's been the driving force behind
building the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope's presence is everywhere. He's the honorary mayor of Palm
Springs and host of the well-known golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Even Eisenhower Regional Medical Center, where Hope is being
treated, wouldn't have been built without him -- Hope donated the
100 acres of land on which the hospital is built.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was taken to hospital Thursday and received blood
transfusions before the bleeding in his colon stopped. He was in
critical condition early today, but Dr. Gary Annunziata said he
expected that to change shortly.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was taking in hundreds of faxes from around the
world with encouraging words for Hope, Annunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital lobby already features a Bob Hope showcase with a
large portrait of him and his wife, Dolores, along with
memorabilia, including some of his golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Dolores Hope Outpatient Care Center.
</P>
<P>
   When newcomers arrive in the Palm Springs area, one of the first
things they do is drive over to see Hope's house in Rancho Mirage,
said Eisenhower spokeswoman Lea Goodsell.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a time when callers to the Convention Center
were greeted by an answering machine with a recording from -- who
else -- Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   His weeklong golf tournament each year gives the region several
days of national TV exposure and injects about $30 million into the
local economy, said longtime Hope friend Bob Bremson. The
tournament donates $1 million to the hospital and pumps additional
money into other charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just an awesome man,'' said Rosemary Lopez of nearby La
Quinta. The 32-year-old housewife and mother of two said she and
her family would often see Hope around town, and he always waved.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, whose father had a heart attack Friday, said she met Mrs.
Hope in the hospital elevator and she appeared to be in good
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Hope started coming to Palm Springs in the 1930s after he
arrived in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Originally it was his hideout,'' Bremson said. But others soon
discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the desert region around it is a fabricated paradise.
Once covered with brush and cactus surrounded by craggy mountains,
it is now covered with golf courses, mansions and lush grass yards
that require nearly constant watering.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Hollywood stars arrived, most of the land was owned
by Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   The year-round population stands at 260,000 people and jumps to
a half million during the winter, when snowbirds from northern
states arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Rancho Mirage is known as a playground for presidents -- golf
lovers Dwight Eisenhower and Gerald Ford have had homes here.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists drive down Frank Sinatra Drive, Gerald Ford Drive,
Dinah Shore Drive and Ginger Rogers Road. The medical center is on
Bob Hope Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Though is name is everywhere, locals say Hope is no snob around
town, often seen treating a friend to an ice cream cone or sharing
dinner at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And when he drives around town, it isn't in some limousine with
dark windows, Lopez added.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's such a down-to-earth person.''

<HEADLINE> Entertainer Bob Hope Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Bob Hope is well enough to sit up
and watch television, but isn't up to cracking any jokes yet about
the medical condition that put him in the hospital, his doctor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hope still was listed in critical condition early today,
Dr. Gary Annunziata said he expected that to change shortly.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 97-year-old entertainer appeared to be making a
speedy recovery from the gastrointestinal bleeding for which he was
hospitalized on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The condition is common in older people and not considered
life-threatening. ''This kind of thing will cure itself,'' the
doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hope's vital signs were strong, he was taking liquids and was
well enough Friday to take in a little television, Annunziata said.
But so far, the doctor said Hope hadn't cracked any jokes with him.
</P>
<P>
   The master of the one-liner was taken to Desert Regional Medical
Center in Palm Springs after waking up with stomach pains Thursday
morning. He later was moved to Eisenhower Regional Medical Center
where, coincidentally, he had been scheduled for a checkup on
Thursday.
</P>

   Delores Hope, the entertainer's wife of 66 years, hasn't left
her husband's side since his hospitalization and was watching
television with him on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged To Note Chechen Murder  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In a report loaded with harrowing descriptions of
murder, rape and looting, Human Rights Watch has detailed an
alleged Russian rampage in Chechnya and urged President Clinton to
push Russia to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based rights group released the report on Friday,
one day before Clinton was to arrive in Moscow for a summit with
President Vladimir Putin. The United States has criticized Russia
for its offensive in Chechnya, but the summit is expected to focus
on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives an expanded account of previous allegations
that Russian servicemen went on a rampage in Aldi, a suburb of the
Chechen capital Grozny, a few days after rebels fled the relentless
Russian assault on the city.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 civilians were killed by angry and drunk soldiers
who plowed through the suburb, shooting at will -- even at children,
the elderly and household pets -- the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some killings were accompanied by demands for money or
jewelry, which served as a pretext for execution if the amount was
insufficient,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soldiers were not happy with 300 rubles ($10) and shot him
and Zina and Khussein Abdulmezhidov in the yard,'' Aldi resident
Luisa Abulkhanova was quoted as saying, referring to friends and
neighbors who were victims. The report also gives accounts of six
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   After initial denials, Russian authorities have assigned three
civilian prosecutors to the case, but have refused to classify the
incident as a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   But ''as far as we know, not one serviceman has been suspended
from duty, let alone indicted, for the wholesale massacre of
civilians,'' said Human Rights Watch researcher Malcolm Hawkes.
''There's a culture of impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are urging President Clinton to push the massacre in Aldi
firmly on the agenda with President Putin,'' said Hawkes.
</P>
<P>
   The killing reportedly began Feb. 5, after rebel fighters had
fled the capital and some residents were just beginning to relax,
believing the war had passed them by. Police units were conducting
a sweep operation intended to locate rebels disguised as civilians,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered the suburb on Feb. 4, after the city had
endured five months of siege and daily bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone, especially the elderly, were happy that everything
was over. That night was the first night my father slept in the
house,'' the report quoted Aldi resident Sultan Aidayev as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has criticized Russia for using excessive force in
Chechnya and is expected to repeat this objection during the
summit. But Washington has taken no action against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations called on Russia last month to open an
inquiry into allegations of massacres and other war crimes, but
Russia's response has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged killings at Aldi were one of three reported large
massacres in Chechnya. The two others reportedly occurred in the
village of Alkhan-Yurt in December and the Grozny suburb of
Staropromyslovskaya in January.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Newspaper Temporarily Closed  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's U.N. administrators
temporarily shut down a newspaper tied to Kosovo Albanian leader
Hashim Thaci today in a bid to crack down on reporting that
inspires hate and ethnic intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Police and NATO-led peacekeepers moved into the Pristina offices
of the newspaper, Dita, closing down the eighth floor of the
capital's press building and barring editors from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The move is certain to fuel controversy over an April 27 article
that accused a U.N. translator of membership in a Serb paramilitary
organization. The translator was found stabbed to death two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolved crime sparked a dispute about whether the article
was an example of journalistic freedom, or simply irresponsible
reporting that fed the province's climate of hate.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations closed the newspaper's doors for eight days
to drive home the point that vigilante justice would not be
permitted in this troubled southern province, which is struggling
to overcome a decade of oppression under Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to send a message, imperfect as it is, that there is a
justice system,'' said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. ''You do not
take the law into your own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an executive order, the top U.N. administrator in Kosovo,
Bernard Kouchner, cited not only the article about slain U.N.
translator Petar Topoljski, but also Dita's lack of contrition
about the matter. The newspaper sent Kouchner an open letter
insisting it would continue to publish the names of individuals
''involved against Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner's order said the pattern ''would inevitably put such
persons at risk of life from vigilante violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dita publisher Behlul Beqaj, a longtime political adviser to
Thaci, huddled outside Dita's offices with other staff members for
about 30 minutes after the closure, trying to decide what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just like Milosevic,'' said Gezim Salihu, the newspaper's
managing editor. When asked how many police officers and NATO-led
peacekeepers were involved in the shutdown, Salihu simply said,
''Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice by ethnic Albanian newspapers of branding
individual Serbs as war criminals -- most in advance of any formal
charge or even an investigation -- has alarmed Western officials who
administer the province. They say that freedom of the press must be
weighed against fears that vigilante justice will prevent Kosovo
from ever being at peace.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe have long debated whether to impose press
restrictions during the tense postwar period, but had refrained,
aware that such a move is likely to provoke criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Petar Topoljski, 25, who was found stabbed to death
May 14, however, seemed to push Kouchner to act in defense of one
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Beqaj and editors across the capital, Pristina, argue that if
the Western officials had done a better job of organizing a
criminal justice system in Kosovo, they wouldn't feel compelled to
publish such allegations. For his part, Beqaj said he's not backing
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say that if we discover the facts about an individual,
we are not doing it for hate,'' he said. ''But if we cover up the
facts, we will provoke more hate.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Infrastructure Weakened  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a mess in Washington, this one
underground. Many of the city's water, telephone, sewer and gas
systems are on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The capital's underground systems were among the earliest
installed anywhere in the United States, and utility companies are
struggling to keep them going.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of our existing infrastructure has reached the end of its
useful life,'' said Dan Tangherlini, the capital's transportation
director. ''These folks are under court orders and consent decrees
to replace that infrastructure, or have made business decisions to
modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than a dozen companies and scores of contract
crews have been aggressively ripping up Washington's streets to
install the fiber optic cables that will form the
telecommunications network of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber optic lines are closer to the surface than water and
sewer lines. That means when older gas, water and sewer lines have
to be replaced over the next two decades, the fiber optics could
also be subject to relocation -- a problem likely to be faced by
many cities with webs of cables from competing utilities
crisscrossing streets.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarty, assistant executive director of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, said his group's 1,100 member cities face an
annual investment gap of $34 million for upgrades in water and
sewer systems alone.
</P>
<P>
   For District of Columbia residents and commuters from the
Maryland and Virginia suburbs, what's underground isn't nearly the
problem as the daily punishment inflicted on their cars by the
capital's pockmarked roads.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city has spent $5 billion to repair and resurface
its 1,421 miles of roads in the past 25 years, roadbuilding experts
say the streets are likely to get only worse.
</P>
<P>
   Trenchwork for optic cables has added insult to injury. After an
outcry, Mayor Anthony Williams declared a monthlong moratorium, and
set new guidelines requiring that streets be repaired within 45
days of the completion of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the moratorium, contractors paid a one-time processing
fee of $24 for each project. District officials are now considering
charging companies between 14 cents and 88 cents a linear foot for
underground work and fees of 38 cents to $1.88 for utilities strung
in public space above ground. The higher fees could generate
between $6 million and $30 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous work on sewer, gas, electric and telephone
lines could jeopardize Williams' plan to resurface 150 blocks of
city streets in fiscal year 2001. City officials concede it could
take two years simply to develop a mapping system that pinpoints
the locations of all the underground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly a spaghetti bowl under the streets,'' said
Councilwoman Sharon Ambrose at a hearing prompted by yet another
problem -- 13 manhole fires and explosions since February.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the blasts just released a little smoke, but others blew
the 80-pound steel disks 30 feet or more into the air. A manhole
cover on a sidewalk outside the White House where tourists often
gather was among those sent flying. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A panel created by Congress to oversee the district's finances
estimates it could take as much as $5 billion to put Washington's
infrastructure in shape. Some work is already happening.
</P>
<P>
   The independent D.C. Water and Sewer Authority, for example, is
in the third year of a $1.6 billion 10-year capital improvement
plan. The Blue Plains water treatment plant, with a capacity of 370
million gallons a day and 130,000 residential and commercial
customers, is connected to sewer lines dating to the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Newer infrastructure systems are not immune. For the past 13
months, train operators on the Metrorail subway system have been
forced to use manual breaking controls because of problems with
17,000 electrical relays used in the 103-mile long system that
serves 549,000 riders each day. In April, firefighters had to
evacuate 273 passengers from a subway tunnel after an electrical
fire between stations.
</P>
<P>
   The transit agency is spending $254 million on maintenance and
repairs to the 24-year-old system this year.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Stage 28 Attacks in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechen guerrillas attacked Russian
positions in Chechnya 28 times over the past 24 hours while Russian
warplanes continued the bombardment of rebel bases in the southern
mountains, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   Su-25 attack planes and helicopter gunships have flown 52 combat
missions since Friday, mainly attacking targets in the Argun and
Vedeno gorges, a key refuge for the rebels, the military command's
press service said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the press service, six rebel strongholds and a
communications facility were wiped out by the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops raided a rebel base near the southern village of
Sharo-Argun on Friday, killing 18 rebels and wounding 40, the
military said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The command said military checkpoints and units of federal
forces are constantly being fired on in hit-and-run attacks, and
Russian positions had come under fire 28 times over the past 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   They were the latest in a series of small attacks in
Russian-controlled territory that show the Chechen fighters are far
from defeated, despite Russian claims that organized rebel
resistance has been crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry officials said today they had found and
neutralized several explosive devices planted by the rebels since
Friday. Two bombs were defused near a market in the village of
Kurchaloi and a road connecting Kurchaloi and the village of Novaya
Zhizn was cleared of mines, the officials said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops rolled into Chechnya in September, occupying the
lowland areas and driving rebel bands into mountain strongholds.
Though the rebels have not mounted large-scale operations recently,
they have stepped up guerrilla attacks that have cost the Russian
scores of casualties in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 500 rebels remain at large in the capital Grozny, the
military command's press service said today. They continue to
attack Russian positions and vehicles in Grozny, even though the
Russians took control of the Chechen capital more than four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They re-entered in September after Islamic militants based there
seized several villages in the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Dissidents Seek Tiananmen Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Eight dissidents from northeast China have
appealed to the government to compensate those imprisoned and the
families of those killed in the Tiananmen Square crackdown 11 years
ago, a human rights group said today.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji, the dissidents said the government was ''absolutely wrong''
to crush the pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square,
said the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The government sent in troops who shot their way through Beijing
on June 3-4, 1989, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, and ending
seven weeks of protests.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent commemorations, authorities stepped up security today
and extra military police patrolled in front of Tiananmen gate,
which overlooks the vast square in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Beijing dissident Ren Wanding said police visited his
home Friday and ''told me not to carry out any activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Ding Zilin, a prominent campaigner for victims of the
1989 crackdown whose 17-year-old son also was killed, said
plainclothes police were stationed outside her house and that her
phone had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Ding were unsuccessful. The phone appeared to ring but
no one picked up, even though Ding's friends said she was at home.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the dissidents, from northeastern Jilin
province, called for the release of political prisoners and for
political reforms and democracy, said the Information Center, which
reported the letter.
</P>
<P>
   They also demanded compensation for victims' families and for
the thousands of people imprisoned in the crackdown, and urged the
government to reverse its verdict that the 1989 demonstrations were
a ''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that had to be quelled, the
Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the letter was drafted by dissident Liang Liwei and
signed by the seven others.
</P>
<P>
   The government has never allowed an investigation into the
crackdown or a full accounting of those killed, injured and
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Families of those killed planned quiet memorials.
</P>
<P>
   Su Bingxian, whose 21-year-old son was killed with three bullets
to the chest, said she, her husband and their surviving two
children would spend this evening together in commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Xianling said she placed flowers under a portrait at home
of her 19-year-old son who was killed and would visit his grave
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Serb Police Up Activists Arrests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian police detained 40
opposition activists, including an 11-year-old, in intensified
raids on opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic, the independent
Beta news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests took place in several towns across Serbia, mostly
targeting activists of the increasingly popular anti-Milosevic
organization Otpor, or Resistance, who are now being routinely
arrested whenever seen carrying the organization's symbol -- a
clenched fist -- or merely for putting up posters calling for
resistance to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single group arrested Friday was in the town of
Smederevska Palanka, 35 miles southeast of Belgrade, where police
pushed 20 Otpor activists into police vans and interrogated them
for two hours at a police station.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old was arrested in Ivanjica, in south-central
Serbia, for waving a flag with the Otpor sign. The Beta report said
police also questioned the boy's father who defended his son's
support for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government has declared Otpor a ''terrorist'' group
and prosecutes its members, saying Otpor has not been registered as
an organization. The authorities, however, have rejected all
applications by Otpor leaders to be officially registered as a
group.
</P>
<P>
   At least three members of two leading opposition parties, the
Democrats and Serbian Renewal Movement, were also arrested in two
other towns in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Leaflets and posters of Otpor and the opposition parties found
with the activists were confiscated in nearly all cases. Homes of
several activists were also thoroughly searched by the police in
what has become a daily routine in cracking down on dissent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Integrating Russia  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- President Clinton is taking a mixed message of
hope and concern over the future of democracy in Russia to his
first summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Clearly,
though, he is extending a hand of friendship to the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   After a close-up look at an emerging new course in European
politics, known as a Progressive or Third Way movement, Clinton was
flying today to Moscow with limited expectations of persuading
Putin to help clear a way for a new U.S. anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is important is that President Putin is signaling that he
is open to discussions,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told the German news media today.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, it was ''very interesting'' that the Russian
leader seems to be saying there is some kind of threat from North
Korea and that ''we should look at it together.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, she said, the decision Clinton is pondering
''must be a decision based on American national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conference here on new political directions, Clinton said
there were ''great opportunities'' through global cooperation to
solve such problems as social injustice and hunger. ''There are
things we can do to help each other and help our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the leaders agreed to set up groups to identify the
problems and move toward a practical way of dealing with them.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of unity, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said experts would assemble in Lisbon next month to start work on
identifying the problems. ''We don't have to wait for the whole
architecture to be restructured to tackle these issues.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And President Ricardo Lagos of Chile said ''there is a very
important network to tackle future tasks, the values that we have
enshrined in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said cooperation in setting interest rates should be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the 14 leaders pledged to seek international
social agreements to promote ''an idea of community'' worldwide.
Special attention was called for in fighting unemployment and on
creating a climate that encourages the development of technology
and the entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after another move by Putin to consolidate his power
over regional chiefs, Clinton said Friday on what probably is his
last trip to Europe as president that much needs to be done to
achieve European unity. And that, he said, includes the development
of ''a Russia that is fully democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing concern about Russia's direction and dismay over its
forceful crackdown on rebels in the republic of Chechnya, Clinton
also said ''there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable
journey over these last few years from dictatorship to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia,'' he
declared, specifically mentioning NATO, the Western military
alliance, and the 15-nation European Union which focuses on trade
and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Full normalization of relations with Moscow will bring about
''the end of our vision of an undivided continent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is eyeing Clinton, as well. The former KGB official is
known for listening intently and saying little. He has already
warned that if Clinton chooses to go ahead with a missile shield
against North Korea, Iran and other countries regarded by the
United States as ''rogue states,'' Russia might abandon the whole
regimen of arms control accords with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aims to reassure Putin that Russia was not the target of
the anti-missile shield. He is offering to share some of the future
technology with Russia and with other friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today about his differences with Putin over a missile
defense system, Clinton said: ''We'll talk about it in Russia; it
won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in Moscow, Clinton and Putin are expected to announce their
intention to cooperate in strengthening early warning systems.

<HEADLINE> Albright Meets With Montenegro Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Saturday
with President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro, signaling U.S.
support for the smaller of the two republics that make up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Albright offered her sympathy for the slaying of Goran Zugic,
the national security adviser in the independence-minded republic,
a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first slaying of a prominent Montenegrin official
after a series of high-profile killings in Serbia, and Rifat
Rastoder, a deputy speaker of Montenegro's parliament, has accused
the Yugoslav government of complicity.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic is at odds with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and is seeking autonomy or outright independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Djukanovic also discussed Yugoslav actions against
the media and the general situation in the area, the State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Exhumed From Bosnian Grave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Forty bodies have been
exhumed over the last three days from several mass graves in
Bosnian Serb-controlled territory, officials announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy head of the Muslim Commission for Missing Persons,
Jasmin Odobasic, told The Associated Press that bodies were exhumed
near the Serb-held town of Foca, some 22 miles southeast of the
Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were believed to be Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb
soldiers in the beginning of the Bosnian 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   Odobasic announced his investigators will continue digging next
week in several mass graves throughout Bosnia, including the sites
around the town of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was a Muslim enclave in northeast Bosnia. The United
Nations declared it a safe zone but did nothing to prevent Bosnian
Serb forces from overrunning it in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the enclave fell, some 7,000 Muslims disappeared. They
were believed to have been massacred by the Serbs and are now being
found in numerous mass graves spread throughout the area. So far
some 3,000 bodies have been found.

<P>
   ''Thousands of bodies are still undiscovered in this area,''
said Odobasic, adding that investigators expect to exhume next week
a few hundred bodies from several mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bosnian war, some 200,000 people were killed. More
than 20,000 are still missing.

<HEADLINE> One U.N. Worker Freed in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Kidnappers of a United Nations observer
team released one of five hostages Saturday, and the freed man
reported that all remaining captives were alive and being treated
well, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappers freed Ismed Zade, an ethnic Abkhazian who works for a
British non-governmental mine-clearing organization, said Veselin
Koshtev, the political counselor with the U.N. mission in Georgia.
Abkhazia is a separatist province of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The other hostages are Danish military observers, a Briton from
the mine-clearing organization, and an Abkhazian translator.
</P>
<P>
   The team was last seen on Thursday in the remote Kodor Gorge,
the only part of Abkhazia that is still under Georgian control.
They were reported missing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Zade told U.N. representatives that all hostages were alive and
treated well, Koshtev said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the kidnappers planned to contact the authorities,
using radios seized from their captives.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. observers have been targeted previously in the region. Five
observers, a U.N. doctor and a translator were seized in October in
the Kodor Gorge, near where the team was working Thursday; all
seven were released unharmed after two days.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Aid to Latin America  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- President Clinton said Saturday that democracy
''is under great strain in Latin America,'' largely because of a
rise in drug-traffickers and terrorists in Colombia and other
nations, and urged action to strengthen governments under stress.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of Brazil, Argentina and Chile joined 11 other
leaders at a Berlin conference on progressive governance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been an enormous amount of economic and political
reform in Latin America in the last decade, but ... because of the
rise of narco-traffickers and terrorist activities in Colombia and
other countries, democracy is under great strain in Latin
America,'' Clinton said at a closing news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should make sure that we do whatever we can to see that the
economies work for ordinary citizens ... and that we try to
strengthen those governments that are under particular stress.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has worked to persuade Congress to help Colombia and
the other countries in the Andean regions to deal with the impacts
that narco-traffickers and civil wars have had on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is weighing a proposed $1.6 billion in aid designed
mostly to combat drug trafficking, but also would bolster
Colombia's sagging economy and address social problems.
</P>
<P>
   Skepticism on Capitol Hill is based partly on the human rights
record of the Colombian Army and a suspicion of links between the
army and paramilitary units.

<HEADLINE> US Supports Serb Return From Croatia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The United States will set aside $5
million to support the return of Serbs who left Croatia during and
after the 1991 war, according to a statement by the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used as a humanitarian assistance both for the
return and the reintegration of Serbs -- for the repair of houses
and to provide incentives to entrepreneurs
</P>
<P>
   On her visit to Bosnia in March, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright praised the efforts of Bosnia and Croatia for the return
of refugees and announced financial aid from the Clinton
administration totaling $1 million for the reconstruction of about
100 homes on each side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of good will, both sides agreed to let 4,000 Bosnian
Croat and Croatian Serb refugees return home within the next three
months. The refugees fled their homes during ethnic wars in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some 30,000 Serbs who fled Croatia now live in the
Serb part of Bosnia and about 70,000 Croats who escaped from their
homes in Bosnia took refuge in Croatia, according to U.N. figures.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Withdraws Vote Observer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Commonwealth withdrew a senior election
observer from Zimbabwe on Saturday over his links to a firm with
close ties to the government of President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moses Anafu was en route to London after being recalled from
the Commonwealth observer mission in Harare, Commonwealth
Secretary-General Don McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is due to monitor Zimbabwe's June 24-25
parliamentary elections, which pit Mugabe's long-ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front party against the fledgling
Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   The Times newspaper reported Saturday that Anafu, a senior
Commonwealth adviser on Africa, was also a non-executive director
of Oryx Diamonds Ltd. Oryx holds a concession to sell diamonds from
areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo that are under Zimbabwean
military control.
</P>
<P>
   The British government and others have condemned the selling of
diamonds from African war zones.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said Anafu last week had assured him that he had not
yet been appointed a non-executive director and had received no
remuneration from the company.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday Anafu admitted ''he had received payment for
some travel costs,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Anafu's confirmation of his involvement with Oryx, ''it is
inappropriate that he continue to be involved in the Commonwealth
observer mission in Harare,'' McKinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon added that the Commonwealth Secretariat would
''consider the wider implications of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's election campaign has been marred by attacks on
opposition supporters and candidates that have led to more than 20
deaths, and overshadowed by the government's support for black
squatters who have occupied white-owned farms. The government
itself announced Friday that it would immediately start seizing 804
mostly white-owned farms
</P>
<P>
   The farmers say the agitation for land reform is really a cover
for a ZANU-PF terror campaign against the opposition.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Fights Crime Against Women  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- While 50,000 rapes are
reported to police each year in South Africa, women's groups say
the real number is far higher -- perhaps more than 30 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   They say social attitudes discourage most women from reporting
rapes and other violence, and even those who do come forward can be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is fighting an uphill battle against violence
targeting women, said Mmabatho Ramgoshi, director of the National
Network on Violence Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when the country held its first all-race elections,
politicians have passed laws protecting women and drafted policy
documents entrenching women's rights. Yet not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge that we all face in this country now is to
implement all of these beautiful commissions, regulations and
laws,'' said Patricia de Lille, an opposition member of Parliament
and women's rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   The Domestic Violence Act, which took effect in December, aims
to protect women, the elderly and children from violence, even
detailing how authorities should handle domestic violence cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good piece of legislation, but not all the
mechanisms are in place to implement that,'' de Lille said.
</P>
<P>
   Too few police officers have been trained about what the law
entails, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Holtmann, spokeswoman for the department of safety and
security, said she understood the frustration of women's
organizations, but said there are places where victims get good
service.
</P>
<P>
   Several government departments are cooperating to prevent
violence against women and to support women who are victimized, and
training programs have been started to teach police and other
officials about being sensitive to women, Holtmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But laws can only do so much.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get to a point in this nation where we reject
criminal behavior,'' Holtmann said. ''We have to comply with the
law and not be complacent about criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, communities often shun women who report abuse to
authorities, feeling it is something that should be handled within
the family so a man's dignity is not harmed, Ramgoshi said.

<HEADLINE> West Papua Calls for Independence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAYAPURA, Indonesia (AP) -- A landmark congress of West Papua
activists on Saturday demanded full independence from Indonesia
despite Jakarta's warning that the restive province will not be
allowed to break away.
</P>
<P>
   A draft document read to about 3,000 cheering and applauding
delegates called for an immediate declaration of independence as
well as U.N. recognition of a new West Papuan state by Dec. 1. A
formal statement of secession was expected to be included in a
final communique Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The call for independence in this mineral-rich and
jungle-covered former Dutch colony of 2 million people is the
latest challenge to Indonesia's national unity.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Abdurrahman Wahid's government entered into
a cease-fire with rebels in the northwestern province of Aceh,
which also wants to break away.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, who came to power as a democratic reformer last October,
has offered Aceh and other provinces greater powers of autonomy.
But he has repeatedly stressed that he will not allow the breakup
of Indonesia, a huge archipelago grappling with massive social and
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Small bands of rebels have waged a limited guerrilla war against
Indonesian forces in West Papua over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the call for independence was made, Wahid delivered
a fresh warning to West Papua, which is also known as Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said his 8-month-old reformist government would reject any
call to break away, the Suara Pembaruan newspaper reported. Wahid
and several senior government officials criticized the congress
last week as not truly representing West Papua's population.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia annexed West Papua in 1963, a process formalized by
the United Nations in 1969 following a vote by community leaders.
Independence activists now say that this process of
self-determination was a sham and should be overturned by the world
body.
</P>
<P>
   The congress was to have closed Saturday but was extended by 24
hours after debate and speeches dragged on in a hot and crowded
indoor sports stadium decorated with secessionist flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''The aspiration of the people of West Papua is to be
independent,'' said delegate Thoha Al-Hamid in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Jayapura, about 2,000 miles east of Jakarta, said
the situation in the town was tense Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of spectators, including tribal members from remote
villages, congregated outside the congress venue while police kept
watch. Many shops and offices were closed.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Loan Sharks Spark Debate  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Sales at Nobuhiro Komukai's construction company
were plunging, and he couldn't pay his 11 employees. He needed
cash, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But with mainstream banks slashing lending amid the country's
prolonged economic slump, Komukai turned instead to Nichiei Co.,
Japan's biggest non-bank commercial lender.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the threatening calls demanding repayment started
pouring in -- and they continued every two hours, every day for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Komukai's situation isn't unique. In Japan, tales of exorbitant
interest rates and overzealous collection tactics have made front
page news and been the focus of long hours of debate in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The victims are generally like Komukai -- the owners of small- or
medium-sized businesses strapped for cash by the worst economic
slump to hit Japan in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Shunned by banks, they got loans from what seemed to be
respectable financial institutions. What they found, however, was
not much different from the neighborhood loan shark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was overcome with fear,'' Komukai said of the months of
calls he said began when he fell behind on his loan payments, which
included a 30 percent interest rate. He recently got Nichiei to
stop the calls by borrowing from a friend to pay off the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The burst of Japan's speculative bubble in the late 1990's left
many businesses in a cash-flow crunch. Banks, saddled with their
own debt, responded to the crisis by adopting tightfisted lending
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic downturn, commercial lenders in the
mid-1990s began listing their shares on the prestigious first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, allowing them to gain access
to cheap loans from banks -- often borrowing at interest rates as
low as 1.7 percent and then lending to businesses like Komukai's at
rates as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mainstream banks, the commercial lenders require no
collateral as long as the borrower can find a guarantor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nichiei and Shoko Fund -- the second-biggest commercial
lender -- control about 90 percent of Japan's $76 billion small
business loan industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nichiei alone reported a net profit of $307.8 million for the
year that ended March 31, 1999, a 23 percent jump over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Such profits have attracted investors such as United States
financial giants Goldman Sachs International, Chase Manhattan Bank
and State Street Bank and Trust, who are among the biggest
shareholders of Nichiei and Shoko Fund, according to Toyo Keizai, a
Japanese financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders play a crucial role.
</P>
<P>
   With banks refusing to provide loans, many small and
medium-sized businesses, the backbone of Japan's economy, would
likely collapse without lenders like Nichiei. An estimated 80,000
companies have borrowed from commercial lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason why these firms have flourished over the last
decade is because the mainstream financial system has been dead in
the water,'' said Chris Calderwood, chief economist at Jardine
Fleming Securities (Asia) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without their willingness to lend without collateral, many
more firms would have presumably bitten the dust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of regulation, critics say, has allowed overzealous
lenders too much leeway.
</P>
<P>
   Kenji Utsunomiya, a lawyer representing 150 Nichiei debtors who
have filed suit for alleged harassment, said the those making the
most money in Japan right now are ''loan sharks and commercial
lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded to complaints by ordering Nichiei
to suspend operations at its 180 nationwide branches for one week
in February. And on Jan. 18, former Nichiei employee Eisuke Arai
was sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to extort payments
from a loan guarantor.
</P>
<P>
   Nichiei spokesman Tomoharu Yoshida said the company has never
used violence to collect payments, but added that Nichiei -- whose
president and founder resigned in February -- is screening
prospective borrowers more closely now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't stop until we're certain that this won't happen
again,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'Microcredit' Loans Give Big Help  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUASTATOYA, Guatemala (AP) -- Snow cones bought the house, the
stove, the 21-inch TV. They even have Berta Alicia Ortez and her
husband talking about indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to worry about where the food was going to come
from,'' said Ortez, 32, who got a ''microcredit'' loan worth nearly
$260 three years ago and turned it into a snow cone cart. ''Now we
have enough money to build a new bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Her savior is a heavy yellow bicycle frame fitted with a canopy,
a cooler for ice, a hand-crank blender, foam cups and white plastic
spoons and jars of strawberry, banana, chocolate and orange syrups.
</P>
<P>
   From this contraption, Ortez sells about 200 snow cones a day
for 1 quetzal each -- about 12 cents -- in this town of 2,000 people
in the mountains 45 miles northeast of Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest part is the hills,'' said Ortez, who has mounted a
car stereo over the bike's cooler to play a tune she pirated from
an ice-cream truck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ortez and seven other women formed the ''Friendship
Group,'' which secured a $270 loan from a local United
Nations-affiliated charity.
</P>
<P>
   The interest-free loan helped them open a small one-room store
near the center of a nearby village, El Progreso.
</P>
<P>
   ''All you needed was initiative,'' said Adilida Maroquin, 55,
who served as the group's president. ''It was like being paid for
an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The shop, which offers Coke and Pepsi in glass bottles, purified
water and beef and bean tostados cooked by Maroquin in a tiny
kitchen, proved such a success that the women applied for
individual loans and struck out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some began making and selling tortillas. Some used plants to
make organic shampoo. Some became handicraft artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ilda Elsira originally applied for a loan to bake bread and sell
it out of her home. When that business stalled, she switched to
raising, slaughtering and selling chickens, an operation run
entirely out of her cluttered backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best day for us is Sunday when we sell 25 chickens a lot
of times,'' said the 33-year-old. ''If you sell something as
popular as chickens you will never stop getting orders.''

<HEADLINE> World Leaders Address Prosperity Gap  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- President Clinton, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and a dozen world leaders endorsed a set of broad principles
Saturday meant to distribute more evenly the fruits of the
burgeoning global economy: wealth, technology and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The conference on ''Progressive Governance'' -- the new buzzword
for the attempt to balance pure capitalism with pure socialism --
expanded a core group of six nations that met in Florence in
November to include poorer countries trailing behind in an age of
rampant globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders addressed that growing gap during the three-hour
session, announcing three programs that wealthy nations will pursue
at the next summit of the Group of Seven biggest industrial powers
and Russia. They are: spreading educational opportunities, closing
the technology gap and fighting infectious diseases, especially
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe that you can have social justice and deal
with all these other challenges we face unless you have effective,
progressive government that makes the most of the new economy and
deals with its rough edges and difficulties as well,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe in just laissez-faire economics but we don't
believe that government alone can solve these problems or just
ignore them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rather grandiose goal of the conference is to improve
citizens' lives by focusing on issues once considered mostly
domestic -- but which increasingly bind nations in the complex
global economy -- such as immigration, education reform and job
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to live in a community, not merely work in a
market,'' the leaders said in a final statement.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that entailed promoting ''common values,
democracy, social cohesion and the fight for human rights and
against racism and anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   The final document contained a number of broad pledges,
including one sought by Latin American participants for stronger
regulation of financial markets that have wreaked havoc on their
economies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki said developing nations
understand and welcome the markets but want a voice in determining
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a global democratic system of policymaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also stressed the need for new international social
agreements to promote ''an idea of community'' worldwide, to
coordinate the fight against unemployment and to create a climate
that encourages the development of technology and entrepreneurial
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The conference -- held in a former East German government
building decorated with stained glass windows honoring workers -- is
the most serious attempt by liberal leaders to take a coordinated
stab at solving problems outside of traditional international
forums that often exclude poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are also trying to address the critical problem of
how to apply common solutions to a collection of nations with
vastly different economic resources and social concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is not just with resources. The problem is how can
we forge cooperation,'' said Chilean President Ricardo Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, Germany, Canada, France and Italy --
which all are members of both NATO and the G-7 -- the conference
included leaders from Sweden, the Netherlands, Portugal, Greece,
New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading proponent of the movement,
also known as the ''Third Way,'' skipped the conference to stay
home with his 2-week-old son, Leo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Progressive Governance and the Third Way are pro-family,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Threat Shadows Summit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- For more than a quarter-century, U.S.-Russian
summits have dwelled on ways to reduce the danger of nuclear
conflict. President Clinton's talks in Moscow this weekend are no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a green light from President Vladimir Putin to
alter a landmark treaty banning national defenses against missiles.
On the theory that North Korea, Iran and possibly other ''rogue''
states might attack the United States in the years ahead, Clinton
is considering a partial shield. He is due to decide in late summer
or the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is weighing several factors, including cost and impact
on the carefully constructed architecture of arms control
agreements with the former Soviet Union and then Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Russia's initial insistence that construction of a
missile defense could touch off a race to build new missiles to
pierce the shield, Clinton's advisers were dampening any
expectations an accord will be concluded at the Moscow summit.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-trip news conference, Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, said he did not expect ''any
resolution'' of negotiations with Russia on a new round of cutbacks
in long-range nuclear warheads either.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
detected signals from Putin that he was open to discussion. But
ultimately, Albright said, the decision Clinton is pondering ''must
be a decision based on American national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's signal of an openness to compromise came in an NBC-TV
interview in which he raised the possibility of working jointly
with the United States in building a defense against countries
whose missiles could threaten either nation.
</P>
<P>
   At Putin's urging, the Russian Duma, or lower house of
parliament, on April 14 approved the START II treaty that President
Bush concluded in his last days in office in January 1993. It sets
new and lower ceilings of 3,000 to 3,500 warheads apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are committed to working out a START III treaty
with even lower ceilings of 2,000 to 2,500. The Russians would go
further and pare down to 1,500, but the members of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff don't think that is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign of an agreement on defense or offense, Berger said,
''I never expected an issue as complex as this to be resolved in
this summit.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just as well in the view of Richard N. Haass, vice
president and director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time is not right for major undertakings,'' Haass said.
Negotiations should be deferred for the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even more skeptical, Kim R. Holmes, vice president at the
Heritage Foundation, said even if Clinton and Putin managed to work
something out, it would run into stiff opposition in the
Republican-controlled Senate, where sentiment is strong against
committing the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a summit in search of a mission, and the worst thing
the President could do is to try to force an agreement on arms
control,'' Holmes said. ''It would be dead on arrival in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be worse, he said, would be to commit the next
president to an agreement he might have to undo, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Jackson Jr., an official with the U.S. Arms Control
Agency in the Carter administration, also is opposed to Clinton
taking up missile defenses with Putin this weekend -- but for
different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the Clinton administration was going overboard in
trying to threaten the Russians -- with a breakout from the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty -- if the Russians won't give the
administration room to protect Vice President Al Gore from a
''soft-on-defense'' charge.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican candidate for
the presidency against Gore, supports a far more extensive missile
defense than the one Clinton is considering.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a senior U.S. official said recently that if Clinton
failed to persuade Putin to change the 1972 treaty, he would go
ahead with a decision on a limited defense -- 100 launchers and new
radar -- if he concludes that the program is in the U.S. national
interest.

By The Associated Press	   How the estate tax works:
<TEXT>
<P>
   A person who dies in 2000 would owe taxes immediately on an
estate worth more than $675,000, unless the entire estate is left
to a surviving spouse, who can inherit it tax-free. When the
surviving spouse dies, an exemption of twice the single exemption
applies, which amounts to $1.3 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tax rates begin at 18 percent on the first $10,000 of a taxable
estate and top out at 55 percent on those over $3 million. But
because of the $675,000 exemption, estate taxes in 2000 begin at
the 37 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   A 5 percent surtax is imposed on estates between $10 million and
$17.1 million. Above $17.1 million, the rate drops again to 55
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some special rules apply to family farms and small businesses.
They can claim a higher exemption of $1.3 million per person in
2000 and they can use special valuation rules to reduce estates by
up to $770,000. In addition, they can pay off estate taxes over 14
years at low interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Rich Stand To Gain From Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Family farmers and small businesses are
leading the fight to repeal estate taxes, even though the very rich
stand to gain the most from such an action, sought by House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service records and independent studies show
that in 1997 about 20 percent of the taxable estates above the
exempt level of $600,000 were limited partnerships, closely held
stock, real estate or other typical assets held by small businesses
and farms.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, two-thirds of those taxable assets were stocks,
bonds, mutual funds, cash or insurance. Of the $97.6 billion in
gross taxable estates in 1997, almost half the value came from
those worth more than $5 million -- and the 329 richest had a
combined value of more than $24.6 billion combined.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of House members, including 45 Democrats, has found
merit in the case made by a powerful coalition: that the ''death
tax'' is killing farmers and small entrepreneurs, forcing farms to
be sold off and carved up by developers and forever eliminating
jobs provided by family businesses now compelled to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   The House is set to vote this week on legislation that would
phase out the inheritance tax by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tax that is initiated by death, and I don't think that
should be a taxable event,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., the
main GOP sponsor. ''These are very often normal people who have
worked hard all their lives. They are not multimillionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 organizations are advocating repeal, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent
Business, the National Newspaper Association, a variety of farm
groups and associations representing winemakers, florists, factory
owners, grocers and insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their print ad campaign shows a tombstone with an epitaph
reading, ''The Family Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they often talk of the devastating impact of the tax on
heirs, most of the real-life stories told by farmers and
small-business owners focus on the complicated and costly planning
steps they must take to avoid it. A simple estate tax plan can
easily cost $3,000, said Clint Stretch of the DeLoitte &AMP; Touche
accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't show up in the statistics, but writing a check to
an estate tax planning lawyer is a pretty clear and present cost,''
Stretch said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Roger Hannay of Hannay Reels, Inc., of Westerlo,
N.Y., said he spends about $300,000 a year on insurance premiums to
ensure his manufacturing business does not have to be sold to pay
estate taxes, which would put his 150 employees put out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still worry that I may have overlooked something that will
prevent my business from being passed on intact to my children,''
Hannay said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Appel, a wheat and barley grower in Colfax, Wash., said he
is ''concerned about how much time and money it will take to
consult countless attorneys and accountants about estate tax
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   To supporters, this estate tax planning burden falls most
heavily on the least wealthy farmers and entrepreneurs -- and even
more disproportionately on women and minorities -- while the richest
people can easily afford the costs and avoid the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rich continue to find loopholes and the middle class gets
whacked,'' said Dan Brandenburg, federal affairs manager at the
National Federation of Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has acted to ease the estate tax burden. A 1997 law
gives family-owned businesses and farms an exemption of up to $2.6
million per family this year, compared with $1.3 million for other
estates. They can also take advantage of special reduced-value
rules for estate purposes and defer tax payments for up to 14 years
at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trouble with the Republican leaders' approach is that it
gives colossal tax breaks to those who are already the most
fortunate,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, senior Democrat
on the House Ways and Means Committee. ''We can eliminate the
estate tax for all but the richest families and do it in a fiscally
responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel has proposed an alternative that would raise exemptions
for farms and small businesses to $4 million per family and reduce
all rates by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar approach is advocated by top White House officials,
who say President Clinton would veto the Republican repeal bill
partly because of its cost -- estimated at $50 billion a year when
the tax ends in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Clinton's
chief of staff, John Podesta, said in a letter to lawmakers that
the tax serves a purpose by ensuring that the wealthy cannot
entirely shield their incomes through tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The estate tax promotes the integrity and fairness of the
overall tax system by acting as a backstop to the income tax,''
they wrote.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fights Lazy Congress Image  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans hoping to preserve their
thin majority this election year have reversed decades of stagnant
Democratic leadership with a slew of accomplishments, a congressman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those accomplishments include a balanced budget and welfare
reform, Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., said in the GOP radio address
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was boasting of accomplishments that some Democrats point to
as accomplishments of President Clinton's administration. In fact,
they were the result of a cooperative effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite 40 years of Democrat control, it took a Republican
Congess to clean the House,'' Bilbray. ''Oh yes, we've also
balanced the budget and provided the first surplus in a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray said Republicans erased Congress' perennial ''do
nothing'' reputation with positive changes made in a bipartisan
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Among other achievements Bilbray cited: the lowering of the
national debt, a repeal of the Social Security earnings limit on
working senior citizens, a 5-year moratorium on taxing Internet
commerce, and increasing funding to school districts for special
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should all be proud of the accomplishment Congress has made
this session and I believe that we will make even more important
legislative decisions before the year is over,'' Bilbray said.
''Instead of wallowing in partisanship, Republicans put together an
ambitious and thoughtful agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the House and Senate are working on HMO reform and
a prescription drug benefit for needy senior citizens. This week,
the House will consider repealing the tax on inheritance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray, a surfer, also touted his ''Beach bill,'' which was
passed by the House. The measure would establish national water
quality criteria for testing and monitoring of beaches and make the
results public.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all,'' he said, ''you have a right to know what your
family is swimming in.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Make New Demands  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Backtracking on his plan to release the prime
minister and more than 30 other hostages, failed businessman George
Speight issued a new list of demands Saturday that would place Fiji
under the control of his rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who claims to be acting on behalf of Fiji's indigenous
majority, accused the country's new military regime of wrecking a
plan to end the hostage crisis and lashed out against Fijians of
Indian ancestry as ''our common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said the government of Commodore Frank
Bainimarama -- which eventually assumed power after Speight's rebels
seized the country's elected prime minister, lawmakers and Cabinet
members -- had been consistent in dealing with Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman accused Speight of prolonging the crisis, now in
its third week, by making fresh demands.
</P>
<P>
   Speight released a nine-point proposal that ruled out freedom
for the hostages until the military transfers its powers to the
influential tribal chiefs in this Pacific Ocean nation 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Speight also issued a demand that would seem unthinkable to the
many Fijians who hold their chiefs in high regard -- telling the
Great Council of Chiefs that it would have to name Speight ally
Ratu Jope Seniloli as president. He would then choose a government,
presumably including Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The latest demands come just a day after a solution to the
standoff seemed near.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Friday he would release the hostages this weekend
as part of a deal in which the tribal chiefs would meet Monday and
choose between a military government and a civilian government of
Speight supporters to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, Speight said Saturday the military had reversed itself
and was insisting on staying in power, so the deal was off. But the
military said it had always maintained it would stay in command
until new elections were held.
</P>
<P>
   Speight threw Fiji into turmoil on May 19, storming parliament
along with six gunmen and taking the government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The military eventually took charge, declared martial law and
threw out a constitution that granted equal rights to Fiji's ethnic
Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, among those still held in the
parliamentary complex, had been the first ethnic Indian to serve as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new round of disagreements, Speight said Saturday he
wants to keep negotiating with Bainimarama, the military ruler,
also an ethnic Fijian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want Fijians fighting Fijians -- our common enemy is
the Indians,'' Speight said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ethnic Fijians agree.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people, many of them indigenous, turned out at a rally
in western Fiji on Saturday to express support for Chaudhry's
government and to condemn Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The west is Fiji's economic heart, with most of the sugarcane
fields, some small gold mines and the better tourist resorts.
</P>
<P>
   A tribal chief, Ratu Sairusi Naganigavoka, told the crowd that
if Speight takes control of Suva, the capital to the east, then
western Fiji should break away.
</P>
<P>
   Military roadblocks have cut off supplies to the parliamentary
complex where the hostages are held, and Speight's men have been
coming out to rob nearby homes, plunder garden crops and kill
cattle. There have been frequent skirmishes between Speight
supporters and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Nations including the United States, Australia and New Zealand
have threatened to impose economic sanctions if Fiji doesn't return
to democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> Town leaders criticize Gejdenson on tribal issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWICH, Conn. (AP) --Several town leaders from southeastern
Connecticut say U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson is not doing enough to
investigate questions about the federal recognition of the
Mashantucket Pequot tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with the town officials Friday, Gejdenson
called on the Mashantuckets to supply the documents that would
quell the genealogical debate -- documents promised to Congress when
the tribe was federally recognized in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But officials say Gejdenson sidestepped their request for a
congressional hearing. Gejdenson said he would forward their
requests to the House Resources Committee that dealt with the
recognition process but suggested the towns work out their
differences directly with the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all feel there is a big difference between working toward
an outcome rather than just passing it along,'' Preston First
Selectman Robert Congdon said. ''I definitely left that meeting
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new book ''Without Reservation,'' by author Jeff Benedict,
Gejdenson is characterized as pushing through the recognition and
land claims legislation without heeding warnings from other federal
officials that there were problems with the Mashantucket Pequots'
genealogy. The book, published by HarperCollins, claims the tribe
is not descended from the Pequots, and may have a thin blood link
to the Narragansetts in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   With several local Indian tribes seeking recognition, and the
possibility of more casinos and annexed land -- which is not
taxable, town officials say the recognition process needs to be
improved. They say the tribes receive preferential treatment while
the towns' problems are pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson, a 10-term incumbent expected to announce his
candidacy this summer, said no one questioned the Mashantuckets'
genealogy when it was federally recognized in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, there was a general consensus that this was the
tribe,'' Gejdenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson said he supported recognition of the tribe not so that
it could build a casino, but to lift the cloud of uncertainty over
surrounding properties. He said people throughout New London County
couldn't sell their homes because of the specter of annexation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My job is to do what I think is right for the state,'' he
said. ''Any politician who tries to do what's popular instead of
what's right doesn't deserve to hold office.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Mashantuckets said the tribal council would
consider meeting with the towns, as Gejdenson suggested.

<HEADLINE> Investigation of vehicle emissions fraud troubled, records show  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Until allegations of serious fraud
brought increased scrutiny, the Department of Motor Vehicles lacked
the manpower, expertise and equipment to properly investigate the
contractor running the state's mandatory vehicle emissions testing
program.
</P>
<P>
   Internal memos obtained by The Associated Press through a
Freedom of Information Act request show the department has known
for years that its investigative unit was underequipped.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Munson, the DMV official in charge of the $25 million
emissions testing contract with Envirotest Systems Corp., wrote in
a May 7 memo that the investigative unit consists of one detective
who is ''clearly short of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson said the DMV's emissions division could not do a
''sting'' operation to identify Envirotest employees who were
allegedly soliciting bribes in exchange for emissions certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal last month called for the
DMV to investigate the alleged fraud, including bribes and the
theft of emission stickers. The contract with Envirotest runs
through mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   DMV spokesman Bill Seymour said at the time that the agency,
assisted by the state police, was already investigating.
</P>
<P>
   But Seymour acknowledged in an interview last week that the DMV
had trouble communicating the gravity of the problem to the state
police.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 7 memo, Munson said the DMV had confirmed several
cases of inspector fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we have found that the state police are not
normally interested in pursuing cases,'' Munson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the problem was with the DMV, not state police, Seymour
said. Agency staff thought theft of emissions stickers amounted to
sixth-degree larceny; theft of a government document is actually a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't presenting the cases properly,'' Seymour said.
</P>
<P>
   State police spokesman Sgt. Paul Vance said authorities would be
happy to investigate such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never turn our back on any theft involving ... state
government,'' Vance said.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo, Munson said the low pay for Envirotest employees
creates an atmosphere that promotes fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering the cost of living and low unemployment rate in
Connecticut, Envirotest's $6.25 per hour starting pay rate is
ludicrous,'' he wrote. ''The problem of low wages combined with the
lack of incentive to grow in a position severely limits the labor
pool Envirotest can draw from.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson said DMV officials have repeatedly discussed the need for
improved surveillance equipment. He said it would take two video
surveillance cameras for each lane at inspection stations to deter
inspectors from engaging in illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fraud investigations were hobbled by lack of manpower, not
having our staff focused clearly on what needs to be done,''
Seymour acknowledged. ''However, that has all changed in the last
month or so.''
</P>
<P>
   DMV officials said they are beefing up the investigative staff.
The agency has also used other means, such as audits of computer
records, to detect possible fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland has ordered an independent audit examining
both the DMV and East Granby-based Envirotest.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging its own shortcomings, DMV said Envirotest
has the primary responsibility for detecting and preventing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Envirotest spokeswoman Martha Sanders said the company has
investigated wrongdoing and cooperated fully with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a zero tolerance in regard to that type of behavior,''
said Sanders, who said Envirotest regularly reviews employee pay
and incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV correspondence cites other concerns about the program,
particularly staff shortages and long waiting lines at some
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said the company tries to staff stations properly and is
proud of its average waiting time, which she said was under 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the internal correspondence, DMV officials express
frustration after repeated discussions with Envirotest. The memos
say average waiting times are sometimes distorted by a practice
known as vehicle stacking, in which data for several cars is
entered into a computer before they are tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think basically what we have here is a long history of
recurring types of issues,'' said John Yacavone, chief of legal
services for DMV. ''I think that the contractor has many times
responded verbally, but they haven't taken the necessary actions to
do the job right.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- First 'N Sync. Then Britney Spears. Then Eminem.
Now Kid Rock discs are flying off store shelves as a new generation
seizes control of the music business with a startling springtime of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The three fastest-selling albums since accurate records have
been kept -- and maybe in music history -- have all appeared within
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have converged: a demographic bulge of young
people with disposable income, media that cater to them and hot
artists backed by marketers skilled at creating anticipation. And,
of course, music that fans can't wait to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it's Britney, Eminem, Kid Rock or matchbox twenty, no
one's buying records that they don't like,'' said Jason Flom,
president of Lava Records. ''It's a sign the music business is
healthy because the music is good.''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync sold a stunning 2.4 million copies of its ''No Strings
Attached'' album the first week it was available in March. In May,
Spears sold 1.3 million copies of her new album in a week and
Eminem 1.7 million, according to Soundscan, the company that
measures music sales.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Backstreet Boys had held the one-week record
with 1.1 million. Soundscan has been in operation since 1991, and
precise sales figures before then are considered unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   First-week sales have become a measuring stick like the first
weekend's box office receipts are for movies -- and only add to the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Spears and 'N Sync have much in common: they sing mostly sunny
pop tunes, have nifty dance steps and looks that make teen-aged
boys and girls swoon. They even record for the same company, Jive
Records, which is known for a well-oiled marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's comical, foul-mouthed raps appeal to many of the rap
and rock fans who can't stomach the pop bands. He even revels in
making fun of them.
</P>
<P>
   All three albums were perfectly poised for mega-success. They
were followups to enormously successful debuts -- usually the time
of peak interest in a musician's career -- and were preceded by
successful singles that whetted their fans' appetites.
</P>
<P>
   All appealed to young people who absolutely, positively had to
have them right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's anything new about the intensity of
fans,'' said Danny Goldberg, president of Artemis Records. ''When I
was a kid, I would go into a store every day when I heard a new Bob
Dylan record was coming. Getting it even two days late, I would
feel culturally deprived.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans aged 12 to 19 has grown from 28 million
in 1991 to 31 million now. In a good economy, their buying power
has increased exponentially: this age group spent $80 billion in
1990 and $153 billion last year, according to MTV.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, which has more viewers now than at any time in its nearly
20-year history, is the cultural destination of teens. ''Total
Request Live'' is like a national Top 40 radio station. MTV gives
plenty of well-timed exposure to its favorites: Eminem had his own
two-hour special the weekend before ''The Marshall Mathers LP''
came out, and 'N Sync drew 7,000 fans to MTV's Times Square studio
the day its album was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to support what we consider good albums,'' said Tom
Calderone, MTV's senior vice president for music programming.
''We're not going to do a two-hour special on an album that we
don't think is going to connect with our audience.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV's research is relentless -- on down to asking kids standing
in Times Square what albums they are looking forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Artists try to become ubiquitous near the time their albums
''drop'': Kid Rock was on ''Saturday Night Live,'' on the cover of
Rolling Stone and on thousands of cardboard cutout likenesses that
were shipped to music outlets, Flom said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the music industry is deeply suspicious of the
Internet because of its capacity to distribute music for free, it
has become a powerful tool for uniting fans and building the
anticipation for new music.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about access,'' said Todd Cunningham, MTV's chief
researcher. ''You can be equally plugged in to pop culture in Des
Moines as if you were living in West L.A. or South Beach in
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   When sales figures come out Wednesday, Flom expects Kid Rock
will have sold about a half million copies of ''The History of
Rock,'' even though it's largely a compilation of previously
released material.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives worry that such explosive successes may be so
distorting that the industry loses patience for promoting acts over
a long term. Macy Gray is now a Top 10 artist, for example, but her
album was out nearly a year before it caught on. The Dixie Chicks
sold 341,000 copies of their album in its first week; it has since
built steadily to 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a marathon, not a sprint,'' warned Mike Shalett,
Soundscan's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The same week Eminem sold 1.7 million, Don Henley sold 114,000
copies of his new album, he noted. What message should his record
company take from those numbers?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the megasales are heartening for the music industry. A
few years ago, some experts worried that with the Internet, video
games and so many other entertainment choices, teen-agers wouldn't
be as interested in music as their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. Haven't you heard those stereos blaring?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great sign that a new generation is bonding to music,''
Goldberg said.

<HEADLINE> Nations Seek Women's Equality  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years ago, the biggest global
gathering of women in history helped spur 189 countries to adopt an
ambitious plan to achieve equality of the sexes. Still very far
from that goal, the same nations meet Monday to try to agree on an
accelerated roadmap toward equality for women.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican and a group of Islamic countries are objecting
to the same proposals they did in Beijing in 1995 -- including
sexual and reproductive rights for women, adolescent sex education
and the definition of the family -- as well as some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's becoming very, very clear that there are a few countries
that are trying to stand in the way of progress,'' said Linda
Tarr-Whelan, the U.S. ambassador to the Commission on the Status of
Women.
</P>
<P>
   Tarr-Whelan pointed to Algeria, Sudan, Libya, Iran and to a
lesser extent the Vatican, saying there has been a ''backlash''
against the progress that has been made since Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are folks who like it the way they have it and are
trying to slow the whole process down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The final document outlining initiatives to spur implementation
of the 150-page Beijing platform was supposed to have been
completed this past week. But the ideological divide over a range
of issues was likely to keep negotiators working through much of
the five-day conference to try to reach consensus before it ends
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, delegates are celebrating the first successes
after Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing platform runs the gamut from promoting women's
inheritance rights to condemning rape in wartime and alleviating
the increasing poverty of women. For the first time, a U.N.
document declared that women have the right to decide freely all
matters related to their sexuality and childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   The platform also calls on governments to revise laws to ensure
women's equal rights, to provide equal education for girls, and to
put women in top decision-making positions in business and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, U.N. surveys show more girls are going
to school and more women are working and receiving health care.
There's also been ''a tremendous amount of women's rights and
anti-discrimination legislation'' though not all of it has been
implemented, said Assistant Secretary-General Angela King, the top
U.N. adviser on women.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will speak here Monday about
expanding the use of small loans to help poor women escape poverty
-- an issue she promoted at the Beijing conference, where it was
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest achievement since Beijing ''is that women are really
on the agenda,'' said Charlotte Bunch, director of the Center for
Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But women remain underpaid, underrepresented in governments, and
under threat of physical and sexual abuse -- and three-quarters of
the world's poorest are women and children.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of conservative opposition, Susana Galdos, a member
of the Peruvian delegation, said she fears this week's conference
could reverse the gains of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the new document reaffirms the 189 nations'
commitment to the Beijing platform, every reference in it to sexual
rights is still bracketed -- signifying disagreement among
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations are trying to soften the Beijing platform's
strong affirmation that countries have a ''duty'' to protect human
rights ''regardless of their political, economic and cultural
systems.'' They have proposed language saying countries can
implement the platform ''with full respect'' to religious or
cultural backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and conservatives object to the Beijing platform's
reference to nontraditional families, which they view as an implied
blessing of homosexual unions, single parents and couples living
together out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also remain divided on newer issues, including the
effects of globalization on women and how to educate young people
about the dangers of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   And a reference in the new document to legal measures in a
growing number of countries ''to prohibit discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation'' also remains bracketed. At Beijing,
lesbian rights were dropped from the final draft.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers estimate that 10,000 delegates and grass-roots
activists will attend the conference -- compared to at least 40,000
in Beijing. And on the eve of the opening session, nobody is
certain what the final document will say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a backlash against women's visibility,'' said Bunch,
of Rutgers. ''There's a backlash against women pushing the
boundaries of the issues. And that's what we're seeing in this
process now -- the backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said, delegates have already agreed to the most
important provision -- the reaffirmation of the Beijing platform for
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yakin Erturk, director of the U.N. Division for the Advancement
of Women, said the United Nations hopes the final document will go
further and call on member states to set deadlines to achieve
progress toward equality for women.
</P>
<P>
   Tarr-Whelan, the U.S. ambassador, said her pessimism has turned
to optimism that the final document ''will be the next roadmap to
give more concrete steps for action for achieving women's
equality.''

<HEADLINE> 60 Minutes Founder Chides 'Insider'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''60 Minutes'' founder Don Hewitt lashed out at
a former colleague for ''The Insider'' movie, saying he wouldn't
allow Lowell Bergman ''within a hundred miles of a newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who has kept largely silent about the movie that depicts
a dark episode in ''60 Minutes'' history, chose a speech before a
conference of investigative reporters and editors on Saturday to
talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which drew strong reviews last fall but was a
disappointment at the box office last fall, depicts ''60 Minutes,''
and Hewitt, caving to pressure from CBS lawyers and not airing a
whisteblowing report from an ex-tobacco executive. The full report
eventually aired.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman was portrayed by actor Al Pacino as a crusading ''60
Minutes'' segment producer who arranged ex-tobacco executive
Jeffrey Wigand's interview, then quit when CBS initially would not
air it.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt criticized the film, and Bergman, for taking artistic
license with the story. In reality, Bergman kept working for CBS
after the episode, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a journalist who professes to be dedicated to the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth conspires with a
screenwriter to concoct a movie about himself that portrays him, by
name, saying things he never said and doing things he never did,
that is not a journalist I would allow within a hundred miles of a
newsroom,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who now works for PBS's ''Frontline,'' said that he
didn't have control over the script.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's entitled to his opinion,'' Bergman said. ''He didn't seem
to have any problem and in fact on many occasions praised my work
and its accuracy and the subjects I chose to cover for 16 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt said that Bergman had asked ''60 Minutes'' correspondent
Mike Wallace to intercede to get him more work at CBS after the
Wigand episode. Bergman said that was not true.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Bergman's assertion, ''60 Minutes'' was not afraid
to talk about corporate censorship, Hewitt said. But Bergman said
that this came only after outside pressure was applied.
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes'' is not afraid to take on big institutions or
report negatively on things in which CBS has a corporate interest,
Hewitt said. He cited a report about bribery at a Winter Olympics
that CBS broadcast and a Wallace story about defects in the Ford
Pinto, even though Ford was a major CBS advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has watched '60 Minutes,' let alone worked for '60
Minutes,' knows that is foolishness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also criticized the Columbia University Graduate School
of Journalism for holding a seminar on ''The Insider.'' Bergman
said Hewitt was invited to attend -- and noted that he wasn't
offered an opportunity to rebut Hewitt before the investigative
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Fourth-grade fife and drum corps steal the show wherever they go  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) -- They play just three instruments -- the
fife, the drum and the recorder. They prefer their own fancy moves
to marching in step. And when they line up alongside polished high
school bands, these 10-year-olds still manage to steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Watkins Glen Elementary School Fife and Drum Band is a rite
of passage in a town with a world-famous auto racing track. When
local pride is at stake, the band's stirring sounds can easily
drown out the rumble and roar of stock-car engines.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many school administrators and taxpayers are
lending a tin ear to music education, this 65-member corps of
fourth-graders flourishes. It may also be the only organization of
its kind in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against high school and middle school bands, the
Watkins Glen youngsters step lively through all manner of tunes and
get surprising range from their limited instrument collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're an amazing group. They're unbelievable,'' said Bill
Birkett, chairman of the Pageant of Bands in Gorham, where the band
was performing Saturday, 40 miles from home in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Good as they are, the marchers don't seem so impressed with
their own talent. They're just doing what most fourth-graders in
Watkins Glen have done for the past 16 years. Come fifth grade,
fife-and-drumming will become a memory to savor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a big deal, but it's sort of normal,'' fifer
Molly Bilinski said in Saturday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lindsay and his wife, Carol, who retired from their jobs as
music teachers at Watkins Glen Elementary last June, started the
band.
</P>
<P>
   ''The principal and I sat down and talked about how we would
like to do something special for the kids,'' Ed Lindsay told the
newspaper. ''I suggested a fife-and-drum band because it can have
14 kids or it can have 80 kids -- you just balance the number of
instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcity of money also played a part. Recorders sell for under
$5, fifes for around $12 and Lindsay was able to obtain some drums
from an inactive drum and bugle corps.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven fourth-graders were in the original band. In their
first performance, on Memorial Day, ''we struggled to get down the
street, but they played both their songs,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   After a few years, the band was drawing about 90 percent of all
fourth graders and dressed up in maroon-and-blue pullovers and
matching shorts. The Lindsays also began teaching the recorder in
third grade to prepare students for the band experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Davis, who plays a single drum, knows that practice makes
all the difference. ''You do it for a while and it gets easier,''
he said as he rushed to a rehearsal.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Released in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages on a
southern Philippine island grabbed a group of foreign journalists
and then released them 10 hours later in exchange for $25,000 in
ransom, police and one of the journalists said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 journalists, mostly Germans working for Germany's
television networks ZDF, Sat. 1, RTL, and Der Spiegel magazine,
were seized in a nearby village Friday while planning a visit to
the rebel camp to interview the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel reporter Andreas Lorenz said his group included six
other Germans, one Australian, one Dane and one French.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenz said they had planned to follow a medical team sent by
the government Friday to visit the hostages, but the rebels stopped
them.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebels first asked them to ''pay'' 50 sacks of rice
to be allowed inside the camp, but the group refused on grounds
that journalists do not pay for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists were led inside a jungle, where rebels took
their personal belongings, including shoes, watches, tape
recorders, bags and a satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the rebels initially demanded $1 million
for their freedom, but later lowered the amount. They allowed four
journalists to go back to their hotel in the town of Jolo, and
threatened to behead one of those remaining if they did not return
with the money. Jolo is 590 miles south of Manila, the capital of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us if the money wouldn't be there by (10 o'clock) in
the evening, they would start killing some ... of us,'' Lorenz told
Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenz said his group was held for about 10 hours and was moved
around the jungle while they waited for the money.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists were seeking interviews with hostages seized on
April 23 from a Malaysian resort island and brought to the
Philippines. The hostages consist of three Germans, two French, two
Finns, two South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have been moved to a series of jungle hide-outs by
their captors, a small Muslim rebel group called Abu Sayyaf. They
are currently living under two large tarps -- one for the European
hostages and one for the Asians -- which don't adequately protect
them from heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   A government negotiating panel met rebel leaders for a first
round of talks to free the hostages last week. Chief negotiator
Robert Aventajado said Saturday he expects the second round of
talks to be held next week.
</P>
<P>
   A separate Abu Sayyaf band is holding six Filipino children and
two teachers hostage on the nearby island of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two rebel groups fighting for
an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between government forces and a larger rebel group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has intensified in recent months.
Those rebels are considering an offer of expanded autonomy, instead
of independence, presented in three days of peace talks that ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Jolo, a grenade exploded Saturday outside a Catholic church.
No one was injured and there was little damage, police said, but
the blast renewed tension in Jolo, where seven people were killed
last month when three grenades exploded inside a market.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Computer Grants  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- President Clinton announced $128 million in
federal grants Saturday to give computer training to American
teachers, saying a majority feel ill-prepared to use computers in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers must be ''as comfortable with a computer as they are
with a chalk board,'' the president said in his weekly radio
address, recorded in the Germany city where he met with world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The grants, $44 million this year and the total of $128 million
over a three-year period, will support partnerships between teacher
colleges, elementary and secondary schools, community-based
organizations, and high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''In too many ways, the education budget making its way through
Congress simply doesn't make the grade,'' Clinton said, threatening
a veto unless it provides more school spending.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts countered that
the GOP is ''working to improve schools and develop new models
while the Clinton-Gore team continues to distort the facts on an
issue that's critical to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, R-Okla., said the grants ''may help train some
teachers,'' but he suggested a new approach is needed to bring
Internet skills to all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans are working to lower tax and regulatory barriers
that prevent underserved communities from gaining access to the
Internet,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton said his administration is making
progress in ''bridging the digital divide'' to put more computers
in classrooms. He said 95 percent of schools and 63 percent of
classrooms now are wired for the Internet, a dramatic improvement
from the levels early in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in from abroad on an issue in the presidential campaign
at home, Clinton said Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
candidate to succeed him, deserves much of the credit for expanding
school computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the next step must be to train more teachers in
computer instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''America will need more than two million new teachers over the
next 10 years,'' Clinton said. ''We have to make sure every one of
them can use a computer to help students meet high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an Education Department survey of 3,560 teachers in
kindergarten through 12th grade found that only one in five felt
''very well prepared'' to use computers in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Schools and Libraries Division of the Universal Service
Administrative Co., which is overseen by the Federal Communications
Commission, now distributes money to schools and libraries to help
pay for discounted Internet connections. More than $3.6 billion has
been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money -- collected on fees on telecommunications
companies and passed on to their customers -- helps pay for the
internal wiring schools and libraries need to hook their computers
together or to the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Chian Marks Tiananmen Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Families of those killed planned quiet memorials,
dissidents demanded redress and police tightened security Saturday
on the eve of the 11th anniversary of the Chinese government's
crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Zhu Rongji, eight dissidents from northeast China said the
government was ''absolutely wrong'' to crush the seven weeks of
protests centered on the vast square in Beijing, a Hong Kong-based
human rights group said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents called for the release of political prisoners,
for political reforms and democracy and for compensation for
victims' families and the thousands of people imprisoned in an
ensuing nationwide crackdown, according to the Information Center
for Human Rights and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, drafted by dissident Liang Liwei and signed by the
seven others, also urged the government to reverse its verdict that
the demonstrations were a ''counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that
had to be quelled.
</P>
<P>
   Troops backed by tanks and armored carriers shot their way
through the Chinese capital on the night of June 3-4, 1989, killing
hundreds, possibly thousands, and ending the protests that
sometimes drew crowds of more than a million.
</P>
<P>
   The government has never allowed an investigation or a full
accounting of the dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent commemorations, authorities stepped up security and
extra military police patrolled Saturday in front of Tiananmen
gate, which overlooks the square in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Beijing dissident Ren Wanding said police visited him
Friday and ''told me not to carry out any activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop him from issuing a statement Saturday that
paid tribute to those ''who died for a just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Ren also called for a reassessment of the demonstrations and of
a democracy movement in 1978-79 and student protests in 1986,
saying a ''just evaluation'' would be ''a cornerstone for social
democracy, popular reconciliation, national stability, people's
happiness and the strength and prosperity of the nation.''

<HEADLINE> Peru's Toledo Faces Uphill Battle  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Alejandro Toledo looked more like a winner
than a loser when he addressed 50,000 supporters massed in a
downtown plaza after President Alberto Fujimori's tainted
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The throng roared as he announced a campaign of ''peaceful
resistance'' to bring down Fujimori's ''dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo, who has no organized party and became a serious
contender only in the final weeks before the first round of voting
April 9, faces a formidable task in keeping the anti-Fujimori
forces united behind his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Many Peruvians wonder whether he can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo's true support is very small. Toledo is a mirage. You
see a lot of strength but when you try to put your hand on it, it's
not there,'' said Patricio Ricketts, a pro-Fujimori political
commentator.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo continued with his crusade to galvanize support
against Fujimori, the foreign ministers of the Organization of
American States convened Sunday to discuss Peru's questioned
presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign support could fade quickly for opposition forces within
Peru fighting for new, clean elections if Toledo does not maintain
pressure as well as his credibility in the coming months, political
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Alberto Adrianzen said Toledo will have to keep his
backers mobilized until Fujimori's inauguration. ''That is going to
depend a lot on his leadership capacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has vowed to put 4 million protesters into Lima's streets
on July 26 to block Fujimori's inauguration for a third five-year
term two days later.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is traveling throughout Peru addressing
political rallies. But analysts say Peruvians may grow weary of his
fiery rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori can bring the tanks into the streets but he will not
defeat us,'' Toledo bellowed to supporters Thursday night in
Canete, a coastal town south of Lima. ''They will first have to
pass over millions of Peruvians.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori shows no sign of being worried. In an interview
published last week, he said he did not expect Peruvians to keep
protesting day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologically, after an election, people who are not
activists return to their daily lives,'' the 61-year-old Fujimori
said.
</P>
<P>
   He called Toledo ''a passing phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo boycotted the second-round runoff against Fujimori on May
28, accusing him of planning to rig the vote. Foreign monitors
withdrew when the government refused to delay the election to give
them time to study new vote-tabulation computer software. An OAS
mission said the election was ''far from what could be considered
free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first round Toledo had 40.2 percent of the vote to
Fujimori's 49.9 percent, blocking him from a majority and forcing a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Toledo's support was an anti-Fujimori vote, not a
vote for what Toledo represented as a candidate, public opinion
pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   He reached the runoff in an 11th-hour surge, in part because a
government smear campaign had destroyed two other opposition
candidates once viewed as strong threats to Fujimori's re-election
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo is unlikely to be a solid opposition voice in the
coming years,'' Piero Ghezzi, a Peruvian financial analyst with
Deutsche Bank in New York, predicted, noting he had very little
core support of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old U.S.-trained economist who grew up in
poverty, must move from being a political candidate to assuming the
leadership of a broad range of opposition parties, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo is the candidate but he's not the leader of the
opposition,'' said political analyst Santiago Pedraglio. ''There's
an important difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru's numerous opposition parties have a long history of not
cooperating. That was the case again in this year's elections.
Eight opposition parties fielded presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also must contend with a government willing to use the
courts, tax investigations and intimidation by Peru's feared
intelligence service to smother opposition movements.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps his greatest challenge will be to counter damage to
his own image provoked by his waffling on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Velasquez, a 52-year-old waiter in the San Isidro banking
district, said he had voted for Toledo, but now had doubts about
his ability to govern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ''Toledo doesn't take firm positions,'' he said. ''He says one
thing and then he contradicts himself and I think that is the
reason that people are not going to support him, no matter how hard
he seeks a new election.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Attack Russia Troops  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebel fighters launched scores of
hit-and-run attacks on federal forces across Chechnya, officials
said Saturday, while Russian planes bombed the southern mountains
where the militants' grip remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed a Russian special forces policeman in the
capital Grozny early Saturday, the Interior Ministry said. The
officer was patrolling near the city's sole surviving Russian
Orthodox church. Another officer was slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also attacked Russian positions 28 times over the
last 24 hours, mostly engaging Russian troops in skirmishes and
quickly retreating, the military said Saturday. There were no
reports of casualties on either side in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   They were the latest of scores of attacks in Russian-controlled
Chechnya that have chipped away at Russian troop strength and
demonstrated the rebels' continued determination to fight despite
Moscow's claims that they are near defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The military conceded Saturday that as many as 500 rebels are in
Grozny, even though the Russians took control of the Chechen
capital more than four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russians kept up their bombing of Chechnya's
southern mountains, which the rebels still control. Attack planes
and helicopter gunships have flown 52 combat missions since Friday,
the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces recently launched a new campaign to take the
south, stepping up air and artillery raids. Officials claimed that
Russian troops had killed 18 rebels and wounded 40 in a raid on a
rebel base near the southern village of Sharo-Argun on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty figure could not be confirmed, and both sides
routinely exaggerate the other's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war. They
re-entered in September after Islamic militants based there seized
several villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and
after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government
blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Liberal Party backs Clinton; Conservatives set to back Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up
the backing of the Liberal Party's leadership today in her bid for
a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Conservative Party leadership, meeting in Albany,
was set to endorse Clinton's Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio,
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous backing for Clinton's candidacy from the Liberal
Party's state committee came this morning during a party convention
held at a Manhattan hotel. The first lady was scheduled to address
the Liberal Party leaders in the wake of her endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that today's endorsement of Hillary Rodham
Clinton brings her a giant step closer to victory in November,''
Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements for Clinton and Lazio, the little-known Long
Island congressman who jumped into the race after New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew, could prove crucial in the Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, the head of the Conservative Party, said Friday he
expected to deliver at least 350,000 votes for Lazio, a potentially
decisive boost in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our people are really energized,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
also count votes from third-party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   The path was cleared for Clinton to get the Liberal Party nod
last month after Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race to deal
with his prostate cancer. One of Giuliani's closest political
advisers is Liberal Party leader Raymond Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's withdrawal from the race, and Lazio's quick entry
into it, also paved the way for the Republican and Conservative
parties to restore their traditional partnership in statewide
races. Long had refused to back Giuliani because of the Republican
mayor's strong support for abortion rights and his closeness to the
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio has said he supports abortion rights, he repeatedly
has voted to cut off federal Medicaid money to pay for poor women's
abortions and favors a ban on so-called ''partial-birth abortion.''
That has been enough to win Long's support.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican seeking statewide office in New York has won
without Conservative Party support since 1974. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York
without Liberal Party backing since it was founded more than 50
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Putin May Be Flexible on Missiles  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Hours before President Clinton's first summit with
Vladimir Putin, U.S. officials found encouragement today in a
signal from the new Russian president that he may be flexible about
Clinton's plans to build a limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is important is that President Putin is signaling that he
is open to discussions,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told the German news media in Berlin at an international conference
on political governance.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, it was ''very interesting'' that the Russian
leader seems to be saying there is some kind of threat from North
Korea and that ''we should look at it together.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the decision Clinton is pondering ''must be a
decision based on American national interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked today about his differences with Putin over a missile
defense system, Clinton said: ''We'll talk about it in Russia; it
won't be long now.'' The president arrived in Moscow a few hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   After a short rest, he was joining Putin for what was described
as a ''working dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   In an NBC interview, Putin offered the first evidence that the
Kremlin may be relaxing its unyielding opposition to altering a
landmark missile treaty -- a step vital to the proposed missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's words were vague and lent themselves to varying
interpretations, he indicated a willingness to compromise and work
jointly with the United States in erecting a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such mechanisms are possible if we pool our efforts and direct
them toward neutralizing the threats against the United States,
Russia, our allies or Europe in general,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have such proposals and we intend to discuss them with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader may have been referring to a proposal floated
in Washington earlier in the year by his foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov. It would attempt to counter any new long-range missile
threat with defenses proposed by the United States and accepted by
Russia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They involve using interceptors at agreed speeds to defend
against incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is not considered in violation of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. But senior U.S. arms control experts
consider so-called theater missile defenses inadequate against
potential long-range missiles from North Korea and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   At the Berlin conference on finding a middle way between
liberalism and conservatism -- the so-called Third Way -- Clinton
said there were ''great opportunities'' through global cooperation
to solve such problems as social injustice and hunger. ''There are
things we can do to help each other and help our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the leaders agreed to set up groups to identify the
problems and move toward a practical way of dealing with them.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of unity, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres
said experts would assemble in Lisbon next month to start work on
identifying the problems. ''We don't have to wait for the whole
architecture to be restructured to tackle these issues.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And President Ricardo Lagos of Chile said ''there is a very
important network to tackle future tasks, the values that we have
enshrined in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said cooperation in setting interest rates should be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the 14 leaders pledged to seek international
social agreements to promote ''an idea of community'' worldwide.
Special attention was called for in fighting unemployment and on
creating a climate that encourages the development of technology
and the entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after another move by Putin to consolidate his power
over regional chiefs, Clinton said Friday on what probably is his
last trip to Europe as president that much needs to be done to
achieve European unity. And that, he said, includes the development
of ''a Russia that is fully democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing concern about Russia's direction and dismay over its
forceful crackdown on rebels in the republic of Chechnya, Clinton
also said ''there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable
journey over these last few years from dictatorship to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia,'' he
declared, specifically mentioning NATO, the Western military
alliance, and the 15-nation European Union which focuses on trade
and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, he said would be a future of tension between
Russia and the rest of Europe and ''the end of our vision of an
undivided continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin is eyeing Clinton, as well. The former KGB official is
known for listening intently and saying little. He has already
warned that if Clinton chooses to go ahead with a missile shield
against North Korea, Iran and other countries regarded by the
United States as ''rogue states,'' Russia might abandon the whole
regimen of arms control accords with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aims to reassure Putin that Russia was not the target of
the anti-missile shield. He is offering to share some of the future
technology with Russia and with other friendly nations.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Says Ethiopia Attacked Port  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Hopes of an imminent end to the ruinous
war between two of Africa's poorest countries faded Saturday, as
Eritrea accused Ethiopian forces of attacking military outposts
near its main Red Sea port.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of renewed fighting between the two Horn of
Africa neighbors came three days after Ethiopia declared the war
against its rival over and amid reports that Eritrea's humanitarian
crisis was deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrean presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel said
Ethiopian artillery and ground forces struck Eritrean military
positions near Assab at 3:30 a.m., and furious fighting raged for
seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yemane called for the immediate imposition of economic sanctions
against Ethiopia and urged the U.N. Security Council to lift its
arms embargo against Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, government spokeswoman
Selome Taddesse denied Eritrea's allegation, saying Ethiopia had
not launched any offensive on any front.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made it publicly clear that as far as Ethiopia is
concerned, military operations are over. But if there are any
provocations by the Eritrean army, our defense forces have been
instructed to deal with them decisively,'' Selome said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of launching ''military
provocations'' to sink peace talks underway in Algeria. It was
unclear what provocation Ethiopia was referring to, although
Ethiopia said Saturday that Eritrean forces, using heavy artillery,
had attacked Ethiopian positions southwest of Assab on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia announced the end of its war with Eritrea on Wednesday,
saying it had retaken all land under dispute between the two
countries along their 620-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea has already pulled out of territory claimed by its
neighbor, including Bure. Ethiopia has said it is ready to withdraw
from uncontested Eritrean land captured during the recent 19-day
offensive if its neighbor joins a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Yemane, the Eritrean spokesman, said Saturday's fighting
occurred on undisputed Eritrean territory, 23 miles west of Assab.
Eritrea withdrew its forces to that position one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still wary of Ethiopian aims, Eritrea earlier this week flew
troops and arms to Assab in case of an Ethiopian move on the port.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council approved an arms embargo against
Eritrea and Ethiopia on May 17, five days after Ethiopian forces
invaded Eritrea, rekindling the on-again-off-again border war that
is believed to have killed tens of thousands of soldiers and
civilians and cost each side $1 million a day in military
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's purported attack came during indirect talks in the
Algerian capital, Algiers, between the two Horn of Africa
countries. The talks resumed Saturday, and a Western diplomat said
progress was being made, but slowly. The outcome apparently hinges
on details of Ethiopia's withdrawal and the security of the
long-disputed border.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Organization of African Unity, the
European Community and the United States are brokering the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the World Food Program said Saturday it would be
revising its estimate of war-affected Eritreans from 330,000 to as
high as 750,000. That number includes displaced Eritreans and those
in need of emergency food, spokeswoman Lindsey Davies said. Daily
aid flights from the Balkans of emergency food rations were to
begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's Commission on Refugees said Saturday that the number of
Eritrean refugees seeking shelter in Sudan had risen to 52,953, an
increase of 20,000 in one week.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan, Congolese Presidents Meet  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The presidents of Congo and Rwanda,
enemies in a 22-month civil war that has drawn five foreign armies
into Africa's third-largest nation, met Saturday in Kenya and
agreed to promote peace and to restore bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Kabila of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda met in
Eldoret, 150 miles northwest of Nairobi, Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A Rwandan security source who accompanied Kagame to Eldoret said
it was the first time the two leaders had met since rebels, backed
by Rwanda and Uganda, staged an uprising in eastern Congo in August
1998 and came close to capturing the capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles
to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention of troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
halted the rebel offensive, but they went on to capture the eastern
third of the country, including the Congo River port town of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kenyan statement said the two leaders had agreed
''to work together to promote peace, security and stability between
their two countries and the region,'' the Rwandan source said no
deals had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that before any real rapprochement can take place,
Kabila has to agree to deal with former members of the Rwandan
Armed Forces and interahamwe militia who took part in the 1994
genocide in Rwanda of at least half a million people, most of them
minority Tutsis. Thousands of the former soldiers and militia have
been recruited into the Congolese army.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Kabila made no commitment on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Rwandan government spokesman Joseph Bideri said it was
Rwanda's understanding the Kabila would cooperate in disassociating
himself from the Hutu militia.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of things were discussed ... and we will continue the
dialogue,'' Bideri said, adding that Rwandan state television would
broadcast the first images of Kagame and Kabila together since the
outbreak of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Before his election as president April 17, Kagame was
vice-president and defense minister in charge of Rwanda's
participation in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a peace accord
signed last July and August in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, by
Congo, three rebel organizations and the five foreign nations
involved. Under terms of the agreement, the United Nations is to
deploy 5,537 military observers to monitor the cease-fire and
troops to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda, who fought pitched battles in Kisangani last
August and last month, have completed their pullback to 62 miles
from the port, and South African military logistics personnel are
expected to travel to the town in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Moi made an official visit to Rwanda on May 12, and Kagame has
visited him several times in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rwanda and Uganda said they intervened on the side of the
rebels because Kabila failed to remove the former Rwandan soldiers
and militia as well as Ugandan rebels from their bases in eastern
Congo from which they were launching attacks on both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Congo and Rwanda never formally broke diplomatic ties, and
Kabila recently sent an emissary to Kigali.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Cops Thank Michael Douglas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Actor Michael Douglas, who once played a
police officer on the television series ''The Streets of San
Francisco,'' has the gratitude of Cincinnati police after helping
them capture two car theft suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Steve Wilger said officers hope to thank the actor,
who is in Cincinnati filming the movie ''Traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilger said two 17-year-olds ran for cover after crashing a
stolen car not far from the site where the movie company was
filming Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived, Douglas came up to them and directed the
officers to an alley where the suspects were captured, Wilger said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers were charged with obstructing official business.
One of the two also was charged with receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas and the rest of the movie crew are wrapping up their
second week of filming in Ohio. In the movie, Douglas plays a
conservative state supreme court justice who agrees to supervise a
national drug task force without knowing one of his own family
members has a drug problem.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Andy Warhol got his start in fashion, so it is
only fitting that a new exhibit at the museum that bears his name
reflects that influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Warhol Look'' opens at the Warhol Museum in the artist's
hometown on Sunday after a three-year international tour.
</P>

   Warhol worked as a teen-ager designing window displays at a

jewelry.
</P>

   The show of 500 objects includes Warhol's work and those of
people influenced by him. It includes video of Warhol being dressed
as a woman and life-sized recreations of his display windows.

that cut across everything he did,'' said Margery King, the

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura To Appear on Soap Opera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura has found another perk
to being the country's first professional wrestler-turned-governor.
</P>
<P>
   He's been invited to make a guest appearance on his favorite
television soap opera, and he gets to play himself.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office announced Friday that Ventura will tape a
segment of CBS's ''The Young and the Restless'' in Los Angeles on
June 14. The episode is to air later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who says he got hooked on soap operas during his days
as a professional wrestler, says his favorite character is the
brooding and much-married millionaire Victor Newman, played by Eric
Braeden. When Braeden celebrated his 20th anniversary on the show
earlier this year, he got a surprise call from Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's TV stops are part of a seven-day trip to
California that starts June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Before being elected governor, the former professional wrestler
and radio talk show host appeared in several movies, including
''Predator.''

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Greet Korean War Vets  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Half a century has passed since a
17-year-old Joseph F. Shearer fought a war in a country he had
never heard of before. Still, it was tough coming back to Korea
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brought a lot of memories,'' Shearer, 64, said during a
ceremony Saturday. ''You don't want to think about bad things. ...
A few of my friends got killed here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War veteran from Cleveland, Ohio, said that seeing
South Korea prospering as a democratic country was worth the trip --
and the sacrifices he made for this Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   The Seoul-based charity Kwang Sung Foundation International
invited Shearer and 12 other veterans from a dozen countries that
contributed troops to U.N. forces to help South Korea fight
Chinese-backed communist North Koreans during the 1950-53 war.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, South Korea will commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the start of the war with wreath-laying ceremonies
and battle re-enactments involving up to 1,000 veterans from the
United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the graying veterans, chests covered with medals,
were greeted by a brass band of South Korean veterans in a ceremony
in front of a national theater at the heart of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   School children presented flowers and sang songs.
</P>
<P>
   ''On behalf of all South Koreans, we welcome you and thank you.
We know it was late, but we are happy to be able to host you before
you pass away,'' said Lee Wan-taek, head of the charity group.
</P>
<P>
   Shearer served 18 months in Korea with the 2nd Infantry
Division. He suffered shrapnel wounds in his stomach and legs and
received disability discharge in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am honored to have served here. Whatever I did, however
small it was, I thought it was worth the sacrifices, especially
when I saw the children today,'' the ex-sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs from the war were on display for pedestrians, and
the national flags of all 14 U.N. allied nations that fought the
war on South Korea's side flapped in wind.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans will review a military parade Monday and have a car
parade Thursday in Pusan, the south coast port where they first
arrived for the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''This morning, when we visited an elementary school, all the
children were looking at us as if we were God,'' said Retired Lt.
Col. Serge-Louis Bererd, 73, from Poitiers, France. A French
infantry battalion fought in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans were happy that the peasant country they fought to
protect from communism was now the world's 12th largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I landed here in November 1950, I was appalled because
the people were so poor. They had no place to sleep and no food to
eat,'' Bererd said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other veterans of the ''forgotten war,'' Bererd had his
disappointment. ''We are not being properly recognized in France. A
little angry for that,'' he said. In France, the Korean War has
always been obscured by the country's war in Indochina, he said
</P>
<P>
   James Dempsey, 72, from Halifax of Canada's Nova Scotia, had a
sticker on his wallet that gave the Canadian casualties of the war:
''516 Killed. 1,255 Wounded. 26,971 Served.'' He also had a Korean
War tattoo on his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says it's a forgotten war. But it's not. It's not
brought up enough,'' said the Canadian ex-private.
</P>
<P>
   The war started on June 25, 1950 when North Korea attacked South
Korea. It ended in an armistice, not in victory, in 1953. More than
33,000 Americans were killed in the war, as were thousands of
troops from allied countries. South Korea lost 175,000 soldiers in
the war, and civilian deaths in both Koreas are estimated at 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas are still divided and their border is sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see the great devastation the war caused by dividing the
families over 50 years. ... Some of them will never see their
relatives,'' Shearer said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il are scheduled to hold the first-ever summit between the two
Koreas on June 12-14 to discuss reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to see a unified Korea some day,'' Shearer said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling: Photog can stage nude shoot below bridge  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barely hours before its scheduled start, a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling Saturday cleared the way for a Manhattan
artist to photograph scores of naked people beneath the
Williamsburg Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so excited,'' artist Spencer Tunick said after getting
word of his victory. ''I don't think that the government should own
your vision as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials had sought an order blocking Tunick from staging
his picture in the early morning hours Sunday, but the Supreme
Court denied their application.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to happen,'' confirmed city Corporation Counsel
Michael Hess, who had argued against the photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came only 17 hours before Tunick's planned shoot in a
park beneath the bridge. Tunick, who has been arrested five times
at previous sessions, was elated by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just so happy,'' he said. ''I've been doing my work while
looking over my shoulder for five years. It's nice to know I can
have breakfast at home after we're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled that
Tunick had a First Amendment right to take his unusual photos.
Tunick, who has battled with the Giuliani administration since
1994, had sued Police Commissioner Howard Safir last summer after a
heavy police turnout forced cancellation of one shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick agreed to conduct his Sunday shoot between 5:15 a.m. and
5:45 a.m. Sunday in the East River Park. A turnout of between 125
and 150 nude models was expected.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that while Tunick has won this battle, the war wasn't
over. ''We'll take each event as it happens,'' Hess said of any
future all-nude shoots.
</P>
<P>
   The next event, according to Tunick, will involve 400 nudes
inside Grand Central Terminal this November.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Tunick has often photographed large groups of
nude people in public places. Some of his more unusual pictures
have attracted police attention.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, 1996, two of his nude models were arrested atop of a
Manhattan snowdrift, posed beneath an ice-cream parlor sign that
advertised ''Frozen Fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve 1994, Tunick and a model were arrested when
she posed nude on top of an 8-foot-high simulated Christmas tree
ornament at Rockefeller Center. Charges were dismissed in both
cases.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Tunick canceled a photo shoot when dozens of
officers with plastic handcuffs showed up to arrest anyone who
disrobed.
</P>
<P>
   The city had argued that New York law criminalizes public
nudity. Tunick maintained that state law does not prohibit nude
photography and that police interference violated his
constitutional rights.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Discover Lost Cities  </HEADLINE>
By VIJAY JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- Archaeologists scouring the
Mediterranean seabed announced Saturday they have found the
2,500-year-old ruins of submerged Pharaonic cities that until now
were known only through Greek tragedies, travelogues and legends.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stunning discoveries at the sites -- where the cities
of Herakleion, Canopus and Menouthis once stood -- are remarkably
preserved houses, temples, port infrastructure and colossal statues
that stand testimony to the citizens' luxuriant lifestyle, which
some travelers had described as decadent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that historians have found physical
evidence of the existence of the lost cities, which were famous not
only for their riches and arts, but also for numerous temples
dedicated to the gods Isis, Serapis and Osiris, making the region
an important pilgrimage destination for various cults.
</P>
<P>
   Herakleion, once a customs port where commerce flourished until
the founding of Alexandria by Alexander the Great in 331 B.C., was
found in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an intact city, frozen in time,'' French archaeologist
Franck Goddio, who led the international team in the search, told
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The team worked for two years off this city on Egypt's northern
coast in waters 20 to 30 feet deep, using modern technology
including the use of magnetic waves to map the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the most exciting find in the history of marine
archaeology. It has shown that land is not enough for Egyptian
antiquities,'' said Gaballa Ali Gaballa, secretary-general of the
Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egypt's top archaeology body.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, underwater television footage of the site
was shown to reporters. Some of the treasure was also on display --
a basalt head of a pharaoh, a bust of the curly haired and bearded
god Serapis and a life-size headless black granite statue of the
goddess Isis, sculpted as if wearing a diaphanous cloth held
together by knots at her breast.
</P>
<P>
   ''At long last, these lost cities of Menouthis and Herakleion
have been located,'' said Gaballa.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cities -- probably built during the waning days of
the pharaohs in the 7th or 6th century B.C. -- will be left as they
are in the sea and only smaller pieces will be retrieved for
museums.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous ancient texts speak of the importance of the region and
the cities, before they were covered over by the sea, probably
following an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Greek historian Herodotus, who visited Egypt in 450 B.C., wrote
about Herakleion and its temple dedicated to Hercules. The sites
were also named in Greek tragedies -- Greek mythology tells the
story of Menelaos, king of Spartans, who stopped in Herakleion
during his return from Troy with Helena. His helmsman Canopus was
bitten by a viper and subsequently transformed into a god. Canopus
and his wife Menouthis were immortalized by two cities that bore
their names.
</P>
<P>
   Authors such as Strabo describe the geographic location of the
cities and their rich lifestyle, while others, such as Seneca,
condemn their moral corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Herakleion lost its economic importance after the building of
Alexandria. It was probably destroyed by an earthquake, indicated
by the position of collapsed columns and walls. They had all fallen
systematically in one direction, said Amos Nur, a geophysicist from
Stanford University who did the magnetic mapping of the area.
</P>
<P>
   The sea encroached on the land following the quake, and ruins of
Herakleion are now about four miles from land in the Bay of Abu
Qir. The sea also engulfed Canopus and Menouthis.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction most likely happened in the 7th or 8th century.
Divers found Islamic and Byzantine coins and jewelry from that
period, but none more recent.

<HEADLINE> Explorer Discovers Peru Lost City  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An American explorer credited with discovering
several major Indian ruins in Peru's rain forests has pulled back
the jungle curtain to reveal another ancient city lost in time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's Cajamarquilla, one of the fabulous lost cities of
the Chachapoyas people,'' said Gene Savoy, just returned from an
18-day expedition into the high cloud forest in northern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy described the Chachapoyas as tall, fierce, fair-skinned
warriors who were defeated in the late 15th century by Inca ruler
Tupac Yupanqui shortly before the Spanish conquest of Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The Incas so respected their fighting prowess that they made the
Chachapoyas their bodyguards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we found is the vestiges of a lost jungle empire in the
rain forest of northeastern Peru,'' Savoy told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologist Miguel Cornejo, one of 47 members of Savoy's
expedition, called the find ''a completely new discovery that
constitutes a major contribution to Peruvian archaeology and the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, measuring 25 square miles, includes stone roads
weaving through a network of massive terraced cliffs and at least
36 burial towers, said archaeologist Alberto Bueno. Both Bueno and
Cornejo were assigned by the Peruvian government to accompany
Savoy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were many more structures, at least 60 or 70, but they
were obscured by vegetation,'' Bueno said, adding that Savoy may
have very well found the legendary Cajamarquilla, mentioned by
early Spanish colonial chroniclers.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply set terraces, roads and ornate stone structures, many
with protruding carved faces, indicate a large concentration of
people lived, farmed and worshipped there, Bueno said.
</P>
<P>
   The robust 73-year-old explorer, who lives most of the year in
Reno, Nev., where he directs the Andean Explorers Foundation, has
written three books about his expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy has discovered dozens of Peruvian ruins since the early
1960s. The three most important were Vilcabamba, the last refuge of
the Incas; Gran Pajaten, a citadel city atop a jungle-shrouded
peak; and Gran Vilaya, a complex of more than 20,000 stone
buildings in a damp, fogbound region of the Andes that Peruvians
call the ''jungle's eyebrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He says Gran Vilaya, situated on a ridge 6,000 feet above the
Maranon River, was the capital of the Chachapoyas empire -- one of
seven legendary cities strung like a necklace along the heights of
the high jungle of northern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Savoy reported that he had found evidence of
another of the lost cities, Conturmarca, in a valley along the
Tepna River.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, he ventured back into the jungle, 340 miles north of
Lima, accompanied by the archaeologists, a representative from the
National Cultural Institute and an armed detail from the national
police.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy said the official entourage was required under new
government regulations put into place after a grave robber sacked
several of the burial towers he had publicly identified after last
year's expedition.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Supporters Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian police detained 40
opposition activists, including an 11-year-old, in raids focusing
on an increasingly popular student group opposed to President
Slobodan Milosevic, a news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a court refused bail for two other supporters of the
Otpor student group, who last month were arrested after a brawl
with associates of Milosevic's son and charged with attempted
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests took place in several towns across Serbia on Friday,
including 20 Otpor activists who were detained and questioned in
Smederevska Palanka, 35 miles southeast of Belgrade, the
independent Beta news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old was arrested in Ivanjica, in south-central
Serbia, for waving a flag with the Otpor symbol -- a clenched fist.
His father was also questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Otpor -- or Resistance -- has long extended
beyond university campuses, leading to an increasing crackdown
against the group.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Milosevic's hometown extended the detention of
Otpor backers Momcilo Veljkovic and Radojko Lukovic for another
month until July.
</P>
<P>
   Veljkovic and Lukovic were beaten up in a May 2 fistfight with
associates of Milosevic's son in Pozarevac, 50 miles east of the
capital, and both suffered serious injuries. However, they were
treated as the perpetrators and charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests caused outrage among opposition supporters and human
rights groups. Milosevic's police sealed off Pozarevac last month
to prevent a protest rally.
</P>
<P>
   At least two judges from the Pozarevac District Court resigned
last month in protest against government pressure to treat the
suspects as perpetrators, despite evidence to the opposite.

<HEADLINE> Warring Afghans Agree to Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Guns in Afghanistan will fall silent
for three days starting Saturday, as the country's warring factions
allow the United Nations to carry out a polio vaccination campaign,
a senior Taliban official said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a complete cease-fire until Monday, said Tayyab
Agha, a senior Taliban spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, are
battling their northern-based opposition on several fronts in an
effort to extend their rule throughout the country. But the two
sides often hold brief cease-fires to allow anti-polio drives and
to distribute humanitarian aid, including medicine, food, clothing
and tents.
</P>
<P>
   Naseer Ahmed, a U.N. official, said more than 1,300 teams will
give polio vaccines to 4 million children under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, polio immunization campaign could not be carried out in
the opposition-controlled territory because a cease-fire could not
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is one of 30 countries where polio continues to
cripple people, mostly young children. In 1999, 156 new polio cases
were identified here, according to U.N. data.

<HEADLINE> Even party primaries now littered with attacks  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Slippery. A liar. A swindler. Shady.
</P>
<P>
   Voters and political professionals alike are inured by now to
nasty and negative campaigns. But usually the worst is saved for
November. This year, however, members of the same party have
violated any remaining semblance of protocol and gone at each other
full throttle with those labels, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional election analyst Stuart Rothenberg summarizes New
Jersey's primary races this way: ''Somewhere between entertaining
and revolting.''
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue reached rock bottom late last week when radio
stations in central New Jersey aired an ad implying a link between
Mike Pappas and the Ku Klux Klan because of the history of the
church he works for, Pillar of Fire.
</P>
<P>
   So outraged was former Gov. Tom Kean -- a frequent critic of
Pappas and supporter of Pappas' Republican rival, Dick Zimmer --
that he told the Pappas campaign he would be happy to defend him to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is beyond the bounds of what I consider proper
politics,'' Kean said. ''I've lived and worked in campaigns, so I
get every mailing there is. And I've never seen anything like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pappas campaign presented evidence tying the group behind
the ad, ''Citizens for Tax Reform,'' to people associated with the
Zimmer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer denounced the ad, but his campaign otherwise brushed
aside questions about its involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to go back and forth and play this little
game,'' said Zimmer campaign manager John Holub. ''The next thing
you know, he's going to say we shot Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer leveled his own charges of unlawful coordination, between
Pappas and the anti-abortion factions supporting him. But Pappas
denied any involvement in mailers that looked suspiciously like his
own campaign material.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are contributing to the tone of this year's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   First, much is at stake nationally. Leadership of the House and
the Senate could change based on the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Also, largely anonymous independent groups are proliferating and
often are responsible for the basest political assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Citizens for Tax Justice'' attack on Pappas was one
example. In the 7th District, the so-called ''Council for
Responsible Government'' has sent mailings criticizing two of the
four Republicans seeking the nomination. In the 5th District, the
conservative Club for Growth is using a snippet of a three-year-old
quote to criticize Rep. Marge Roukema as too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, campaign operatives bombard reporters with e-mails
that include charges and name-calling that their candidate wouldn't
utter personally for fear of being sullied. Nowhere has that been
more evident than in the gloves-off Democratic primary for Senate
between former Gov. Jim Florio and former Wall Street executive Jon
S. Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mails, the Corzine campaign has called Florio ''Governor
Tax,'' a man who ''has no remorse about lying'' and who is
''celebrating 10 years of misleading New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, meanwhile, has used the word ''obscene'' to describe
Corzine's spending and ''despicable'' to describe Corzine's use of
a private investigator in the campaign. Florio also alleged that
Goldman, Sachs was partner to a ''swindle'' while Corzine worked
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7th District House contest, Republican Patrick Morrisey
called Mike Ferguson ''slippery.'' In the Democratic primary in
that district, Jeff Golkin accused Union County Manager Michael
Lapolla of nothing less than ''a scandalous lack of ethics'' and
''a shakedown'' for taking money from county employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use his first radio ad to introduce himself to
voters, Lapolla aired a parody portraying another opponent,
Maryanne Connelly, as flighty and indecisive. Connelly denounced
the ad as sexist.
</P>
<P>
   And what of clean campaign pledges, which now are proposed or
signed in most competitive races? More often than not, they become
hammers used to beat up each other.
</P>
<P>
   A Ferguson radio ad charged Joel Weingarten, another Republican
running for the House in the 7th District, with breaking a
clean-campaign pledge -- then went on to attack him.
</P>
<P>
   As he signed a ''framework for civility in government,'' Pappas
took the opportunity to assail Zimmer for ''shady'' campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Reed, who monitors campaigns as director of the Eagleton
New Jersey Project at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of
Politics, said voters are turned off -- even the party regulars who
actually vote in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disrespectful, nasty, they wouldn't want to be treated that
way. That's what I'm hearing,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, now the president of Drew University, has seen the
campaign both as a political pro and as the father of Tom Kean Jr.,
a candidate for House this year. He said he urges college students
to go into politics, but the current campaign gives him pause.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in rough campaigns,'' Kean said. ''I've run against
Jim Florio, and we attacked each other. But it was on issues, it
was on qualifications. It wasn't on personalities, and it wasn't
stuff put out at the last minute. This is a nasty turn that was
never there when was I was in politics.''

<P>
   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) -- A regional leader in eastern
Tajikistan was shot and killed Saturday on his way home from the
capital, Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
   Armed assailants killed Sergei Davlatov, as well as his
bodyguard and driver, as they were driving in Davlatov's official
car toward his home region, Garm, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Davlatov was a member of Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov's
People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said it was considering the attack a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, has been

<HEADLINE> Russia Ministry Chides UN Prosecutor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on Saturday
criticized the decision of the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor not
to investigate allegations that NATO committed war crimes during
last year's air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian parliamentary commission and lawyers working for
Yugoslavia had produced evidence to support charges that NATO
committed war crimes during its 78-day bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte told the Security
Council on Friday that there was no basis for an investigation into
NATO's conduct, and that she was satisfied NATO had not
deliberately targeted civilians or illegal military areas.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against NATO included an airstrike on a bridge
as a passenger train was crossing, the bombing of a refugee convoy
near Djakovica, and the targeting of the Serbian TV building in
Belgrade. Serbian officials have said NATO bombs killed more than
300 people, but that number was not independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Foreign Ministry said Del Ponte's decision ''was not a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time the tribunal closes its eyes on cases
of violations of the norms of international humanitarian rights by
other participants in the conflict, thus demonstrating its
political bias,'' the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal was established seven years ago by the U.N.
Security Council to prosecute those responsible for atrocities in
the Balkans following the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision is likely to further damage relations between
the tribunal and Yugoslavia, which has accused U.N. prosecutors of
bias and essentially cut off all cooperation with them.

<HEADLINE> Promotional bison attacked in Buffalo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Bison can't seem to catch a break in any
century here.
</P>
<P>
   The city steeped in a history of massive herds of buffalo
roaming the the area only to be hunted to near extinction in the
19th century now is the home of a bison victimized by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week one of Buffalo's eight ''Wind Up/Round Up''
promotional bison in the ''Herd About Buffalo'' campaign had its
2-foot-tall windup key wrenched from atop its fiberglass body.
</P>
<P>
   ''People put their heart and soul into this project, and then to
have some cretin come along and vandalize it is unconscionable,''
said Lt. Larry Baehre of the Buffalo Police Department. ''If we do
catch these people, I hope they get the maximum fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind Up is part of a fund-raising stampede for charity and the
arts with support from the City of Buffalo. The project, while
showcasing the work of western New York artists, also aims to
enliven the city's landscape as more of the bison show up on city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morgulis, the artist who designed Wind Up, tried to
patch the critter up with some epoxy, tape and Band-Aids.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't it a drag? It must have taken a couple of people,
because the entire buffalo was turned around,'' Morgulis said.

<HEADLINE> Planners say GOP convention shouldn't disrupt traffic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With 35,000 people expected to arrive for
the Republican National Convention, staying in hotels in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, a week of terrible traffic
could be in store -- but planners say they have things under
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't minimize the impact of the convention, but we
shouldn't sit and quake about managing it,'' said Andrew Warren, a
district administrator for the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation. ''It's not something that needs to be feared. It's
something that needs to be managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren noted that there can be 80,000 or more people moving
toward the sports complex in South Philadelphia at once when there
are major events at Veterans Stadium, the First Union Center and
the First Union Spectrum on the same night. So he is not worried
about the convention, which is being held at the First Union Center
from July 31 to Aug. 3. Transportation officials have been working
with Republican Party officials for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said one way to keep the expressways from getting clogged
will be a fleet of lime-green tow trucks cruising the roads during
rush hours to get stalled cars and those with flat tires out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty percent of all congestion is caused by just those minor
breakdowns,'' Warren said. The trucks, which will begin service by
July 1, are to remain in use after the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements that PennDOT plans include electronic signs
on Schuylkill Expressway ramps to give traffic information and
having PennDOT's control center at Valley Forge staffed 24 hours
during the convention instead of the usual 15. Also, PennDOT's
maintenance yard is to have a crew stationed there around the clock
to get to any crashes or spills quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The convention has ... fairly predictable peak times for
transportation,'' convention spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said. ''If
the schedule follows the '96 schedule, sessions will start after
rush hour has pretty well concluded, and end much later in the
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, which oversees taxi
service, has authorized 150 new cabs for Philadelphia, with a
''passenger's bill of rights'' posted in every taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times, the first impression a person gets of your
city is that first cab ride, and we want to make sure passengers
get what they want,'' PUC spokesman Kevin Cadden said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, officials said construction will be suspended on
major routes used to get into Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to ensure that every available lane will be open
during the convention,'' New Jersey Department of Transportation
spokesman John Dourgarian said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware officials cannot make that promise, though, because a
major reconstruction of Interstate 95 had been planned for a long
time. By the time of the convention, the northbound lanes are to be
shut down. But officials there are doing what they can to make sure
alternate routes work as well as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done a lot of small improvements to roads that connect
to and from the city from (Interstate) 495,'' Delaware Department
of Transportation spokeswoman Michele Ackles said. ''We're pretty
comfortable right now that we've got a plan in place to make travel
not too difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Meet in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Vladimir Putin dined on
trout, goose and spicy boar in a Kremlin summit dinner Saturday,
with Clinton intrigued by the new Russian president's suggestion he
has relaxed his stern opposition to a planned U.S. system to defend
against missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior administration official, briefing reporters later,
refused to specify whether Putin demonstrated a willingness to go
along with a modification of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct
one, now being tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say anything whatsoever with regard to
details on the substance that characterize either side's
position,'' said the official, who declined to be further
identified. ''This is a very serious and focused beginning of a set
of conversations that are going to continue through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting -- the leaders' first since Putin took office -- was
described as friendly, though the presidents did not address each
other as ''Bill'' and ''Vladimir.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an easy-going nature to the conversation,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nearing the end of a weeklong European tour, flew here
from a skull session in Berlin with the leaders of more than a
dozen nations. They talked about one of Clinton's favorite topics --
forging a ''Third Way'' of governance, a course between liberalism
and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin talked for two hours and 45 minutes,
continuing even when they broke before dessert to tour the personal
residence of the Kremlin. Putin took Clinton to see his book-lined
study, a small chapel, and his workout room. He spoke an occasional
phrase in English, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents were joined at dinner by only two aides, Strobe
Talbott, Clinton's envoy to Russia, and Sergei Prikhodko, deputy
chief of Putin's staff. On the menu: cabbage soup and cold spicy
wild boar, baked stag ham, trout and goose with red berry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner came a jazz concert. Band leader Oleg Lundstrem
brought along a saxophone just in case Clinton felt like making
some music, too.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the summit, Putin said in an NBC-TV interview that
the ABM treaty must be preserved, calling that a condition for
further nuclear arms reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same interview, he said he sees the potential missile
threat from states like North Korea. Putin suggested that a
different system, within the ABM treaty, could intercept missiles
near liftoff and protect Europe and Russia as well as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are new threats arising that we must address but our
proposal is to answer them together,'' the Russian president said.
''And these proposals in our view have prospects. ... I think we,
on that point, will have a substantive and useful dialogue with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The American official said this was discussed, too, but he
withheld details.
</P>
<P>
   They also discussed international economics, the situation in
the Balkans, the strategic nuclear relationship between the United
States and Russia and Russia's war against rebellious Chechnya,
where fighting has flared anew. Rebel fighters have attacked
Russian troops across Chechnya and Russian warplanes bombarded the
southern mountains in the latest outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   But the most sensitive topic was the planned American missile
defense system -- a scaled-down version of Ronald Reagan's ''Star
Wars'' idea in the early 1980s, but intended to defend against
missile attacks from such states as North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.S. system would begin with 100 anti-missile
missiles in Alaska, to knock out attackers in space. Such a system
is barred by the ABM treaty. It was drafted in the era of East-West
mutual deterrence to assure both sides that neither would lose its
power to retaliate if hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is important is that President Putin is signaling that he
is open to discussions,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said in Berlin on Saturday, reflecting on Putin's ambiguous
comments.
</P>
<P>
   She told German journalists it was interesting that Putin seemed
to see some risk from North Korea and that he suggested ''we should
look at it together.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton and Putin will meet for more than six hours
and deliver statements on their conclusions. The president also
plans to field questions from Russians in a call-in radio show in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will become the first American president to
address the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, before
he bids Putin goodbye, pays a courtesy call on former President
Boris Yeltsin and leaves for Kiev, Ukraine, and home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A unmanned NATO spy plane lost power
on a mission over southern Kosovo and was forced to make a
parachute landing early Saturday, a U.S. Army statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The small U.S. plane, called Hunter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,
went down just after midnight inside Macedonia, within two miles of
the Kosovo border, the statement said without providing details.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if the plane had been damaged. U.S. army
officials in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo were reportedly
working with Macedonia's government to recover the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in two weeks that an unmanned NATO
aircraft was forced to make an unscheduled landing in the area. A
British ''Phoenix'' was forced last week to make a parachute
landing in the ground safety zone, which is the three mile buffer
zone along Kosovo's boundary with Serbia proper, sources in the
NATO-led mission said.
</P>
<P>
   The border is patrolled by NATO aircraft to give early warning
of any potential intrusions. However, the ''Phoenix'' aircraft was

<HEADLINE> OAS Target of Diplomatic Maneuvering  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Suddenly, everyone wants a piece of the
Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   After working for decades in relative obscurity, the 34-member
international body finds itself a target of diplomatic maneuvering
and protesters at its 30th general assembly beginning Sunday in
Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who disrupted a World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle in December and tried to interrupt the International
Monetary Fund-World Bank meeting in Washington in April say Windsor
is the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   The official agenda lacks any trade issues that inspired street
protests complete with pepper spray, damaged property and televised
images of police clubbing demonstrators in Seattle and Washington.	   But
protesters say some of the broad issues being discussed --
globalization and poverty -- also involve free trade. Apparently
gearing up for a confrontation, a group called the Coalition to
Shut Down the OAS held a workshop Friday at the University of
Windsor to discuss issues such as how to deal with pepper spray and
protesters' legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to have some kind of voice. ... Shut down the meeting
so that they listen and hear as they listened and heard in
Seattle,'' said Jean Grossholtz, a professor at Mount Holyoke
College in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign affairs minister and
chairman of the OAS assembly, called threatened protests a
''perverse response'' to a meeting designed to discuss ''human
rights, democracy, corporate responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The very issues that the groups say they're interested in,
they're trying to forestall by shutting the meeting down,''
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Windsor and the neighboring city of Detroit, just
across the Detroit River, were shuttering windows and beefing up
police presence in anticipation of protests.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in both cities will have riot gear, and Windsor
police will get gas masks. Across the street from the OAS
conference site, the CIBC Bank covered its windows but planned to
be open Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the OAS permanent council has asked the foreign
ministers heading to Canada to consider possible action against
Peru, where President Alberto Fujimori was the sole candidate in
last week's election run-off because his opponent, Alejandro
Toledo, boycotted what he believed was an unfair process.
</P>
<P>
   The head of an OAS observer mission at the election, Eduardo
Stein, said Peruvian authorities surprised the mission by
introducing new computer software for the vote count just days
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Stein asked for a delay in the voting so that he could test the
software, but was turned down. The OAS mission then left Peru
before the run-off vote.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian officials have accused the OAS mission of failing to
remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said Thursday that Washington wanted ''as
vigorous a response as possible'' from the OAS foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers were unlikely to take strong action, such
as imposing sanctions, because some nations fear setting a
precedent of OAS intervention.

<HEADLINE> Emissions test snags cost official his job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Division of Motor Vehicles official in
charge of New Jersey's problem-plagued emissions testing program
has quit.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Passeri stepped down recently from his $95,000-per-year job
as executive director of the state's Clean Air Program.
</P>
<P>
   News of his resignation came as state officials admit they're at
least a month away from fixing the emissions testing system, which
was supposed to be back in full operation by last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Top state officials refused comment on Passeri's resignation,
and he could not be reached for comment, The Star-Ledger of Newark
reported for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anyone had asked for Passeri's resignation, his
immediate supervisor, DMV director Dick Kamin said, ''I think that
kind of question should be put to the commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein refused to comment
on the resignation, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union, said Passeri is being made
a scapegoat for the Whitman administration's failure on the issue,
which has angered thousands of motorists, some of whom had to
endure lines of up to four hours when the tougher new test debuted
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like he's going to be the clear victim in a process
that began long before he became employed by the state,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Passeri was responsible for coordinating the inspections program
overhaul with Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, the Pasadena,
Ca., company New Jersey hired to run its inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, designed to more accurately measure tailpipe
pollution, was plagued by problems and breakdowns since it was
instituted last winter. Equipment failed or froze up in cold
weather, and employees struggled to operate the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported Passeri ignored a consultant's warnings
before the new system was instituted and continually defended it,
even as it broke down.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as April 11, Passeri wrote a memo defending the
state's ongoing work with Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, would
not comment on Passeri's resignation, other than to say his
responsibilities have been transferred to Al Ari, an assistant
transportation commissioner.
</P>

   New Jersey also faces a June 30 deadline to meet federal clean
air standards, a goal it is not likely to meet. Although the state
runs the risk of losing substantial transit aid for failing to meet
the deadline, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
indicated it will grant an extension.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Reprieve Was Political  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six of 10 Americans say George W. Bush
approved his first reprieve in a Texas death penalty case for
political reasons, according to a new poll. Bush supporters were
about evenly split on his motivation for approving the reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor and likely Republican presidential nominee
says he approved a 30-day reprieve for Ricky McGinn so that
potential DNA evidence that might exonerate him could be reviewed,
although the U.S. Supreme Court had earlier denied McGinn's
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush makes decisions based on what's right, not on
public opinion polls or politics,'' Bush campaign spokesman Ray
Sullivan said Saturday. ''He believes it's right to allow DNA
evidence to be reviewed in the context of all the evidence if it's
relevant to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row.''
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 Bush supporters said the decision was for political
reasons, while about the same number felt he did it based on the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek poll released Saturday indicated that Americans
overwhelmingly favor states permitting DNA testing in all death row
cases where it might prove an inmate's innocence or guilt, with 95
percent taking that stand. Almost that many agreed with a federal
requirement for all states to adopt such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans overwhelmingly support use of DNA testing when
it could prove an inmate's innocence, the death penalty is still
supported by three-fourths of the public. When asked what crimes
warrant the death penalty, four in 10 said only those inmates
convicted of the most brutal murders, mass murders and serial
killings. Only a fifth of those questioned opposed the death
penalty in all cases. A third of death penalty supporters say the
main reason they support it is because they believe it deters
others from committing violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential race remains close, according to the Newsweek
poll of 750 adults taken Thursday and Friday. Republican Bush was
at 44 percent and Democrat Al Gore at 43 percent. The error margin
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was ahead in several national polls in recent weeks, but
three polls in the last week had the race virtually even, including
two polls of likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is substantially ahead in the crucial race for electoral
votes, however. He leads in almost 20 states with more than
two-thirds of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
Gore is ahead in fewer than 10 states with less than half the votes
he would need to win.

<HEADLINE> Queen, Camilla Parker Bowles Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- After years of resistance, Queen Elizabeth II
relented Saturday and met socially with Prince Charles' companion
Camilla Parker Bowles at a private party.
</P>
<P>
   The queen had known Mrs. Parker Bowles many years before the
breakup of Prince Charles' marriage to Princess Diana. But because
the monarch is head of the Church of England, she reportedly has
avoided socializing with Parker Bowles out of concern that she
would appear to endorse a relationship that began in adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Public anger toward Parker Bowles appears to have subsided in
the nearly three years since Princess Diana's death, and the couple
are seen together with increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after a Sky TV report of the meeting of the
queen and Parker Bowles, Buckingham Palace confirmed the two women
were at Highgrove, the prince's country home in western England,
for a 60th birthday party for ex-King Constantine of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Sky said an unidentified source at Prince Charles' St. James's
Palace office had described the prince as ''pleased and grateful''
that the queen had at last decided to meet with his longtime
companion and that the meeting was ''characterized by warmth and
friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Early editions of The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid that
broke the story on its Web site Saturday, said the queen approached
Parker Bowles in the drawing room at Highgrove and that they
chatted for 10 minutes. The queen then went on to meet the European
royals gathered for Constantine's party.
</P>
<P>
   The queen knew Parker Bowles before and during her marriage to
Andrew Parker Bowles, who has long been familiar in royal circles
and once held the ceremonial post of ''Silver-Stick-in-Waiting to
the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   But they have rarely met in public or private, and not since the
publicity that followed Princess Diana's revelation that the two
had had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Prince William, 17, and his 15-year-old brother Prince Harry
also were present.
</P>
<P>
   William met Parker Bowles nearly two years ago and he and Harry
reportedly get along well with her and her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles has been discreet but has made no secret of his
relationship, and the two went public with a much-photographed
appearance together in January 1999. In what appears to have been a
quiet campaign to win public acceptance, they have appeared
together in public with increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The News of the World's royalty editor Clive Goodman told Sky
News on Saturday that the meeting at Highgrove will be interpreted
as a ''first step on the long and complicated road to remarriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles has said he has no intention of remarrying.
Although experts have said there would be no constitutional problem
with such a marriage, it would present difficulties for his future
role as head of the Church of England, which opposes remarriage
after divorce.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have resumed their
talks on a permanent peace treaty, a Palestinian official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place Thursday night and early Friday morning
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He refused
to say where it was held.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, which were previously being held in the
Swedish capital Stockholm, were moved to an undisclosed location,
presumed to be in Israel or the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Taking part were the speaker of the Palestinian parliament,
Ahmed Qureia, and Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions are aimed at achieving a framework for the final
status agreement between the two sides. On the agenda are the
thorniest issues, such as the permanent borders, the future of the
Palestinian refugees and control of Jerusalem. Little progress has
been made on these issues in six months of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat accused each other last week of foot-dragging, saying the
other was not serious about reaching an agreement by a Sept. 13
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a meeting with Barak in Lisbon, President Clinton
acknowledged that ''tough work'' was ahead for both sides, but said
an agreement was ''within view.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due to arrive in the
Middle East by Monday for consultations with Arafat and Barak.
Arafat then will visit Washington for talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The President hopes to preside over the end the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, before the end of his term, at a Camp
David style summit with Arafat and Barak in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However he is not expected to convene the summit if he is not
sure that the agreement will be achieved. The decision on whether
to hold the summit is expected in the next few weeks.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Vladimir Putin dined on trout, goose and
spicy boar in a Kremlin summit dinner Saturday, with Clinton intrigued by the
new Russian president's suggestion he has relaxed his stern opposition to a
planned U.S. system to defend against missile attacks. But a senior
administration official, briefing reporters later, refused to specify whether
Putin demonstrated a willingness to go along with a modification of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct one, now being

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on Saturday criticized the
decision of the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor not to investigate allegations
that NATO committed war crimes during last year's air campaign against
Yugoslavia. A Russian parliamentary commission and lawyers working for
Yugoslavia had produced evidence to support charges that NATO committed war
crimes during its 78-day bombing campaign. However, chief prosecutor Carla del
Ponte told the Security Council on Friday that there was no basis for an
investigation into NATO's conduct, and that she was satisfied NATO had not
deliberately targeted civilians or illegal military areas.

Albany, is set to endorse Clinton's Republican rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, later in

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Islamic Leaders Cheered  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA TERENGGANU, Malaysia (AP) -- Nearly 2,000 people cheered
Malaysia's Islamic leaders at an opposition party rally Saturday,
sending a grim message to the country's longtime ruling premier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to sacrifice everything, including our lives,
to defend Islam against those who are corrupting it,'' opposition
leader Munir Zakaria told a crowd gathered in an indoor stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded with applause and cries of ''Allahu Akbar,''
Arabic for ''God is Great.''
</P>
<P>
   Munir's Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS, could pose a
serious threat to the 19-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Once little more than a small group of radical clerics, the
Islamic party stunned observers by winning the two northern states
in November elections and tripling its seats in the national
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the party -- which holds a majority in Kelantan and
Terengganu states -- have promised to seize more power in 2004
elections and replace the government it has criticized for not
being Islamic enough.
</P>
<P>
   In its two states, PAS has enforced strict Islamic codes not
found elsewhere in predominantly Muslim Malaysia, including a
restriction on alcohol, gambling and entertainment. The party has
also forced Muslim women to wear head scarves in public, often
against their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   While the party says its success stems from its conservative and
religious slant, others have attributed it to disaffection among
young Malays over the premier's harsh treatment of his former
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is now serving a six-year prison term for corruption, and
is on trial separately for alleged sodomy. His sacking and arrest
in September 1998 provoked violent street protests, which have
since subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The government -- led by Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization party -- has threatened to outlaw the flagrant use of
Islam for political gain. If proposed legislation is enacted, PAS
could be forced to drop the word Islam from its name.
</P>
<P>
   Some warned, though, that using federal and legislative muscle
to curb the Islamic could provoke a violent backlash in the
Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could lead to uneasiness in the country. We fear it could
lead to demonstrations and unrest,'' said Nasharuddin Mat Isa, the
party's secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's 14-party coalition controls more than two-thirds of
parliamentary seats.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Work On Fla. Fires  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Firefighters and the National Guard worked Saturday
trying to control several fires that burned thousands of acres
across Florida, while more than 20 smaller blazes smoldered
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   None of the wildfires presented a serious or immediate threat to
any homes or property and fire crews had several nearly contained,
said Eric Ford, an official with the Florida Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first of the year, 3,365 fires have burned nearly
120,000 acres throughout Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A wildfire that burned Saturday in the Bundy Lake area near
Jacksonville consumed 125 acres. Some homes were evacuated and a
few were slightly singed, Ford said. None, however, suffered
serious structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   A power line and some transformers were also damaged in the
Bundy Lake blaze, which started as an unauthorized brush burn-off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 90 percent contained as of right now,'' said Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Crews contained fires in Washington, Alachua, Putnam,
Okeechobee, Glades and Martin counties, but kept on battling
several larger fires around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Lake County, where 13 fires burned a 4,300-acre area west of
Orlando, crews only had 30 percent of the blaze under control.
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, firefighters worked to contain fires of 1,200
acres and 960 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, forest officials said the 11,200-acre ''Pumpkin''
fire northeast of Williams was 70 percent contained Saturday. While
they expect is to continue burning within control lines for weeks,
leaders were releasing more crews for work elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> FDA OK's Heart Clot-Busting Drug  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new clot-busting drug approved by federal
regulators can reduce the time it takes to treat heart attack
victims from 90 minutes to five seconds, using a single swift
injection to dissolve clots that choke off the heart's blood
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Tenecteplase, made by Genentech Inc., won Food and Drug
Administration approval on Friday and will be made widely available
as soon as possible to treat the nation's biggest killer, company
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech also makes TPA under the brand name Activase,
currently the standard medicine for treating heart clots. Both of
the drugs dissolve blockages in a similar fashion, preventing
further permanent damage, said Dr. Christopher Granger of Duke
University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A major drawback of TPA, though, is that it must be given as a
continuous 90-minute infusion. Tenecteplase, to be sold under the
name TNKase, can be administered through one quick, single
injection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Early administration of these drugs is very important to
saving lives,'' said Granger, who oversaw clinical research into
the drug. ''Anything that simplifies approach may help in achieving
the earliest treatment possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Betsy Rosenberg refused to say how much the
new drug would cost, saying that pricing would be announced next
week. TPA costs about $2,200 per dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Tenecteplase was tested on 17,000 patients in a clinical trial,
resulting in a mortality rate of 6.2 percent. The mortality rate
for TPA is also 6.2 percent. As with all such treatments for heart
clots, the most significant side effect in the tenecteplase study
was brain hemorrhaging and stroke, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   However, patients who took tenecteplase were less likely to
suffer non-intracranical bleeding, and less likely to need blood
transfusions, Granger said.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of tenecteplase over TPA is that the new drug
is more specific for treatment of clot in the coronary artery, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug ''would certainly be much easier to administer and
the speed with which it can be administered can accelerate the
triage of heart patients in an emergency room,'' said Dr. Hal
Barron, director of cardiovascular clinical research for Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Heart attacks strike more than 1.1 million people each year in
the United States, causing nearly 500,000 deaths.

<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- A Belgian backpacker
hiking in midday heat died on a backcountry trail in the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The man and three companions were on a three-day hike of the
Tonto Trail when he began having problems Friday. The other
backpackers hiked to the Colorado River and asked a commercial
rafting group to call for help about 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers arrived by helicopter and declared the man dead at the
scene. The cause and circumstances of his death are being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The other backpackers told rangers they had difficulty locating
water and changed their itinerary to reach the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonto Trail traverses a large plateau about 2,000 feet above
the river on the south wall of the canyon. It is exposed with
little protection from the sun. Daytime high temperatures have been
over 100 degrees in the area.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Voter Turnout May Be Low  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Financial unrest and disappointment
with politicians could discourage many Romanians from showing up at
the polls and picking new municipal leaders Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread poverty and corruption were likely to cost the five
ruling coalition parties votes in the election, which is considered
a dress rehearsal for parliamentary and presidential elections in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some 17 million Romanians are eligible to vote Sunday for new
leaders in 3,000 towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   But with many voters saying they don't believe politicians are
willing to help improve dire living conditions, turnout could be
low. The average monthly salary is $90, and inflation is expected
to be 27 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about voter apathy, newspapers and TV stations urged
people Saturday to cast ballots. But economic woes triggered by the
recent collapse of the country's biggest investment fund could keep
people from voting.

<P>
   Thousands of investors have taken to the streets, some vowing
not to vote to express dissatisfaction with authorities they say
have not protected them from shaky investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the National Fund for Investment protested Saturday
in the cities of Brasov, Ploiesti and Galati and Baia Mare,
demanding their money back. The fund stopped operating last week
for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not voting tomorrow,'' said Adriana Petrescu, 46, a
general manager at a private pesticide company. ''Nothing here
changes. There is just corruption and self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandru Mihai, a 52-year-old legal adviser, seemed just as
jaded: ''I don't trust anyone anymore. (Politicians) are all out
for themselves, and they don't care about people's problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused the party of former President Ion
Iliescu of orchestrating the financial chaos this week to increase
its share of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy -- which was leading opinion
polls ahead of Sunday's race -- denied the government's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 foreign and local observers are to monitor the vote.
Run-off elections will be held in two weeks to fill posts if no
candidate receives a 50 percent majority Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lincoln Papers Sell For $104,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Two letters written by President Lincoln sold
for $104,000 at auction Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Trocano, a spokeswoman for Dargate Auction Galleries in
Pittsburgh, said one letter, which sold for $54,000, was Lincoln's
appointment of former Ohio governor and presidential campaign rival
Salmon P. Chase to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The other, which sold for $50,000, was a handwritten note
summoning Chase to Washington for advice after South Carolina left
the Union in 1860, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters came from two descendants of Chase's attorney,
Trocano said.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't identify the descendants or the buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Another letter, to Chase from Union Gen. William Tecumseh
Sherman, sold for $26,000. In the letter, Sherman advised Chase to
delay allowing blacks to vote after the Civil War because he feared
the war would resume.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Station Won't Show Film  </HEADLINE>
DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A private television station canceled
its telecast of ''Bombay,'' a popular Tamil-language movie set
during Hindu-Muslim riots in India -- after local groups complained
it could fuel religious clashes, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which ran into problems with India's censors and
religious groups before its 1996 release, depicts a romance between
a Hindu man and a Muslim woman during the 1993 religious riots in
India's financial capital, Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   The Swarnavahini TV channel in Colombo had shown weeks of
previews ahead of Friday's planned broadcast, but canceled it after
receiving a request from the Culture Ministry, the station's
program director S.D. Premaratne said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Muslim leaders, including a minister, had feared the
film would lead to religious clashes in Sri Lanka, he said. The
island nation's Sinhalese majority are mostly Buddhists, while its
Tamils are predominantly Hindus and its Moors Muslim. The Tamils
and the Moors both speak Tamil.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, Tamil rebels have fought the government to establish
a separate homeland in the island's north and east.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the riots that erupted throughout India
after Hindu fundamentalists in December 1992 razed an ancient
mosque in the town of Ayodhya. The riots left 2,000 people dead,
most of them Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respected the concerns raised and decided against showing
the movie,'' Premaratne said. However, he noted that the movie was
shown a few months ago on another private television channel
without any problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident three years ago, Sri Lanka refused to
allow the filming of ''Midnight's Children,'' based on the novel by
Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim lawmakers objected to the filming, saying Rushdie had
offended Muslims worldwide with his novel ''The Satanic Verses.''

<HEADLINE> Belize Hijacking Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA GORDA, Belize (AP) -- The three men came aboard dressed
like poor Guatemalan farmers, in dusty derby hats, striped work
shirts and black boots. But the simple cotton satchels they carried
were filled with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't ask any questions then because we never do,'' said
Reynaldo Guerrero, a co-owner of the charter boat the men hijacked
Tuesday, leaving five people dead, three injured and his
24-year-old nephew still missing somewhere in the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never had any reason to suspect anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero waited anxiously Friday for the arrival of a
crop-duster to scour a 30-plus-square-mile stretch of ocean along
the Guatemala-Belize border. He still hoped to find his nephew, the
boat's captain Julio Requena Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In a town not accustomed to crime, police in this low-crime town
still don't know the identity of the hijackers or why they attacked
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Mariestela,'' with seven passengers and a crew of two, was
about 20 minutes into its 75-mile voyage across the Gulf of
Honduras -- from Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, to Punta Gorda, Belize --
when the shooting started. Five people were killed and the others
jumped over the side and were later rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Requena was one of the first to be shot, but jumped off the boat
in an effort to swim to safety, his 21-year-old sister Claudia
Requena said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an excellent swimmer and he's very athletic, so we still
hope he's alive out there,'' she said. ''But now, after all this
time, we really just want to find him, in whatever condition he
happens to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   In this coastal village's only paved street, 300 mourners
flooded into the town's Roman Catholic church to mourn 59-year-old
Alice Ireheta.
</P>
<P>
   Ireheta, a mother of five who owned a local grocery store and
was eagerly awaiting the birth of her first grandchild, had been on
her way home from Puerto Barrios, where she had spent the morning
volunteering at a local church.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother was such a kind and caring person,'' Ireheta's
daughter Minerva said, fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   The country's lead investigator Bernard Lino said he still
didn't know why the men had attacked the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have begun saying that this was probably drug-related,
that these men were into cocaine and needed a boat. But we have
been unable to confirm or deny that,'' said Lino, who traveled 100
miles south from the Belizean capital of Belmopan.
</P>
<P>
   Lino said the hijackers are believed to be Guatemalan because
they boarded the boat bound for Belize with ''trip passes,'' which
allow Guatemalan citizens to cross between the two port cities
without a passport.
</P>
<P>
   He said tracking them down could be difficult. Guatemalan
authorities recovered the boat abandoned on the Sarstoon River on
Friday night, and nobody knows where the hijackers went from there.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of places for them to hide out there on the
water,'' Lino said. ''We just don't know how long we could be
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Police presume they got onto another boat -- something that could
work in the police's favor since travel by small boat on the gulf's
choppy waters is no easy proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Crime in Punta Gorda is low. But on the other side of the gulf,
in steamy 30,000-inhabitant Puerto Barrios, many of the inhabitants
have become more desensitized to violence.
</P>
<P>
   On the main highway, which winds and curves its way 164 miles
southeast from the crime-ridden sprawl of Guatemala City, parked
police cars watch the road every 40 miles, in an attempt to deter
the hijacking of passenger buses which has become common.
</P>
<P>
   No such patrols keep watch over the waters between Guatemala and
Belize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they should do that,'' said Efrain Sagastome, a
fisherman and fruit exporter, as he loaded soap from El Salvador,
plastic containers from Honduras and chocolate from Pennsylvania
onto his 12-foot skiff.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look like it, but these can be very dangerous
waters.''

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have resumed their talks on a

place Thursday night and early Friday morning said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He refused to say where it was held. The negotiations,
which were previously being held in the Swedish capital Stockholm, were moved to
an undisclosed location, presumed to be in Israel or the Palestinian areas.

Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct one, now being

   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on Saturday criticized the
decision of the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor not to investigate allegations
that NATO committed war crimes during last year's air campaign against
Yugoslavia. A Russian parliamentary commission and lawyers working for
Yugoslavia had produced evidence to support charges that NATO committed war
crimes during its 78-day bombing campaign. However, chief prosecutor Carla del
Ponte told the Security Council on Friday that there was no basis for an
investigation into NATO's conduct, and that she was satisfied NATO had not
deliberately targeted civilians or illegal military areas.

   GREENBELT, Md. (AP) -- NASA engineers picked a remote patch of the Pacific

wealth of data for astronomers over the past nine years. Engineers at the
Goddard Space Flight Center started Tuesday to send signals to the Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory to perform a series of rocket firings to drop the satellite into
the ocean. If NASA operations go as planned, the satellite was expected to hit
the Pacific between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT Sunday. The satellite changed
astronomers view of the heavens after providing proof the whole universe was
bathed in gamma rays, an energetic form of light invisible to the eye and hardly
detectable on Earth.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Meet in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Vladimir Putin were
''serious and focused'' in Kremlin discussions Saturday night, with
Clinton intrigued by the new Russian president's suggestion he has
relaxed his stern opposition to a planned U.S. system to defend
against missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters later,
refused to specify whether Putin demonstrated a willingness to go
along with a modification of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct
one, now being tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say anything whatsoever with regard to
details on the substance that characterize either side's
position,'' said the official, who declined to be further
identified. ''This is a very serious and focused beginning of a set
of conversations that are going to continue through the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting -- the leaders' first since Putin took office -- was
described as friendly, though the presidents did not address each
other as ''Bill'' and ''Vladimir.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an easy-going nature to the conversation,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency quoted Putin's deputy chief of staff as
saying the two leaders discussed arms control and the situation in
the Caucasus and the Balkans during dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, nearing the end of a weeklong European tour, flew here
from a skull session in Berlin with the leaders of more than a
dozen nations. They talked about one of Clinton's favorite topics --
forging a ''Third Way'' of governance, a course between liberalism
and conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin talked for two hours and 45 minutes,
continuing even when they broke before dessert to tour the personal
residence of the Kremlin. Putin took Clinton to see his book-lined
study, a small chapel, and his workout room. He spoke an occasional
phrase in English, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents were joined at dinner by only two aides, Strobe
Talbott, Clinton's envoy to Russia, and Sergei Prikhodko, deputy
chief of Putin's staff. On the menu: cabbage soup and cold spicy
wild boar, baked stag ham, trout and goose with red berry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner came a jazz concert. Band leader Oleg Lundstrem
brought along a saxophone just in case Clinton felt like making
some music, too.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the summit, Putin said in an NBC-TV interview that
the ABM treaty must be preserved, calling that a condition for
further nuclear arms reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same interview, he said he sees the potential missile
threat from states like North Korea. Putin suggested that a
different system, within the ABM treaty, could intercept missiles
near liftoff and protect Europe and Russia as well as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are new threats arising that we must address but our
proposal is to answer them together,'' the Russian president said.
''And these proposals in our view have prospects. ... I think we,
on that point, will have a substantive and useful dialogue with
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The American official said this was discussed, too, but he
withheld details.
</P>
<P>
   They also discussed international economics, the situation in
the Balkans, the strategic nuclear relationship between the United
States and Russia and Russia's war against rebellious Chechnya,
where fighting has flared anew. Rebel fighters have attacked
Russian troops across Chechnya and Russian warplanes bombarded the
southern mountains in the latest outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   But the most sensitive topic was the planned American missile
defense system -- a scaled-down version of Ronald Reagan's ''Star
Wars'' idea in the early 1980s, but intended to defend against
missile attacks from such states as North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed U.S. system would begin with 100 anti-missile
missiles in Alaska, to knock out attackers in space. Such a system
is barred by the ABM treaty. It was drafted in the era of East-West
mutual deterrence to assure both sides that neither would lose its
power to retaliate if hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is important is that President Putin is signaling that he
is open to discussions,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said in Berlin on Saturday, reflecting on Putin's ambiguous
comments.
</P>
<P>
   She told German journalists it was interesting that Putin seemed
to see some risk from North Korea and that he suggested ''we should
look at it together.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton and Putin will meet for more than six hours
and deliver statements on their conclusions. The president also
plans to field questions from Russians in a call-in radio show in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton will become the first American president to
address the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, before
he bids Putin goodbye, pays a courtesy call on former President
Boris Yeltsin and leaves for Kiev, Ukraine, and home.

<HEADLINE> Liberals back Hillary Clinton; Conservatives opt for Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, labeled a far-left
liberal by critics, accepted the backing of New York's Liberal
Party on Saturday while her Republican Senate rival Rick Lazio,
dubbed a right-wing conservative by the first lady, embraced the
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, the Conservatives opened their session with an
invocation from the party treasurer, Jim Gay, in which he called
for ''the defeat of evil'' and then identified that as ''the
candidate of the Democratic and Liberal parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also came out swinging. While not mentioning his opponent
by name, he told the Conservatives he believed ''this is a job that
I must earn, not one that you are handed because of your last
name.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is one thing we have learned over these last several
years, it is this: character counts; integrity matters; and the
truth is the foundation upon which our democracy exists,'' added
the little-known congressman from Long Island in coming the closest
yet to raising the specter of the Clinton scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in New York City and out from under the shadow of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the leaders of the Liberal Party met at a
Manhattan hotel to unanimously bless Clinton's candidacy and
directly take on the issue of her being a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a New Yorker is a matter of spirit, not a matter of
origin,'' said Martin Begun, a Liberal party vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the history of this party,'' said Clinton, standing
next to party leader Raymond Harding, who called himself ''a close
friend'' of Giuliani -- until recently Clinton's Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements could spell the difference in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, the advantage would appear to go to Lazio, who
became the GOP's candidate after the New York City mayor withdrew
from the race last month to battle prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party had 171,496 members while the Liberal
Party had 92,074 members as of March, according to the latest
figures from the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   More important may be the votes the parties can produce at the
polls. In losing his bid for a fourth Senate term in 1998,
Republican Alfonse D'Amato collected more than 250,000 votes on the
Conservative Party line. Democratic winner Charles Schumer nabbed
just over 50,000 votes on the Liberal line.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long predicted he
could turn out at least 350,000 votes for Lazio this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy about getting the Conservative Party
nomination,'' Lazio said. ''I'll take that deal any day.''
</P>
<P>
   No Republican seeking statewide office in New York has won
without Conservative Party support since 1974. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York
without Liberal Party backing since it was founded more than 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the endorsements served to highlight the favorite negative
themes emanating from each campaign. The first lady has been
portraying Lazio as a right-wing buddy of former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich while Lazio has denounced Clinton as the candidate of the
''far left.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Saturday that Clinton's acceptance of the Liberal
Party backing ''speaks to who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady declined to characterize Lazio's embrace of the
Conservative Party, but campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson later
said, ''It is unsurprising that Rick Lazio has picked up the
Conservative Party endorsement given his opposition to common sense
gun-control measures and his support for restricting a woman's
right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The path was cleared for Clinton to get the Liberal Party nod
after Giuliani quit the Senate race last month to battle prostate
cancer. One of Giuliani's closest political advisers has been
Harding. He quickly lined up with Clinton after the mayor withdrew
from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's departure also opened the way for the Republican and
Conservative parties to restore their traditional partnership in
statewide races. Long had refused to get behind Giuliani because of
the mayor's strong support for abortion rights and his closeness to
the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio has said he is an abortion rights supporter, he has
repeatedly voted to cut off federal Medicaid money to pay for poor
women's abortions and favors a ban on what critics call
''partial-birth abortion.'' That was enough to win Long's support.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio's support for abortion rights in general has caused
the anti-abortion Right to Life Party to go its own way in the
Senate race, a situation that could cost Lazio some votes.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the Conservative Party leaders, the backing for Lazio
was not unanimous Saturday because of the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pro-life ... and I don't believe he's as conservative as
they say he is,'' explained Tom Clark of Nassau County on Long
Island as he cast the lone vote against Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in an interview with CNN after attending the
Conservative Party convention, Lazio said he believed the
anti-abortion plank of the national GOP's platform should be
removed, a position also being pushed by New York Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it needs to come out. I think we need to stay silent
on the issue. It's a divisive issue,'' Lazio said. ''I think our
main thrust should be on changing the culture as opposed to
criminalizing abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lazio said he would not be bothered if George W.
Bush selects a staunchly anti-abortion running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also told CNN that he favors a 12-year term limit for
senators and he reiterated his decision not to take campaign money
from the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party backing can be critical in New York elections.
Three-term Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo was beaten by
Republican George Pataki in the 1994 governor's race on the
strength of the 328,695 votes he received on the Conservative Party
line.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Independence Party, the state arm of the national
Reform Party, will hold its state nominating convention on Monday
in Albany. On Saturday, Clinton said she would not attend the
convention or seek the party's backing because of the possibility
conservative presidential candidate Pat Buchanan would be at the
top of its ticket. Lazio, while criticizing Buchanan, has said he
is willing to run on the line even if Buchanan is also on the
ticket. Lazio aides said Saturday they weren't certain if he would
attend the Independence Party convention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Locked in a tight race where every vote
could count, Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted the backing of New
York's Liberal Party on Saturday while her Republican Senate rival
Rick Lazio was embraced by the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   However support for Lazio, who favors abortion rights for women,
was not unanimous because of his views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pro-life ... and I don't believe he's as conservative as
they say he is,'' explained Tom Clark of Nassau County as he cast
the lone vote against Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN after attending the Conservative Party
convention, Lazio said he believed the anti-abortion plank of the
national GOP's platform should be removed, a position also being
pushed by New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it needs to come out ... It's a divisive issue,''
Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the leaders of the Liberal Party met at a Manhattan
hotel to bless Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a New Yorker is a matter of spirit, not a matter of
origin,'' said Martin Begun, a Liberal party vice-chair.
</P>
<P>
   He cited famed New Yorkers who, like Clinton, were born out of
state, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was born in
Tulsa, Okla., and whose Democratic seat she is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party backing can be critical in New York elections.
Three-term Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo was beaten by
Republican George Pataki in the 1994 governor's race on the
strength of the 328,695 votes he received on the Conservative Party
line
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count votes they receive on third-party ballot lines.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican seeking statewide office in New York has won
without Conservative Party support since 1974. At the same time, no
Democrat has been elected governor or U.S. senator in New York
without Liberal Party backing since it was founded more than 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Billing themselves the nation's longest existing third party,
the Liberals have in the past backed New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and other candidates of various political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the history of this party,'' said Clinton, standing
next to party boss Ray Harding, who called himself ''a close
friend'' of Giuliani -- until recently Clinton's main opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Conservative Party leadership handed its backing to
the little-known congressman from Long Island at a nominating
convention in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a job that I must earn, not one that you are handed
because of your last name,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The developments could spell the difference in a close race. By
the numbers, the advantage would appear to go to Lazio, who became
the GOP's candidate after the New York City mayor withdrew from the
race last month to battle prostate cancer. Recent polls show
Clinton and Lazio in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party had 171,496 members while the Liberal
Party had 92,074 members as of March, according to the latest
figures from the state Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   More important may be the votes the parties can produce at the
polls. In losing his bid for a fourth Senate term in 1998,
Republican Alfonse D'Amato collected more than 250,000 votes on the
Conservative Party line. Democratic winner Charles Schumer nabbed
just over 50,000 votes on the Liberal line.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long predicted he
could turn out at least 350,000 votes for Lazio this year.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements also highlighted the favorite negative themes
of each campaign. The first lady has been portraying Lazio as a
right-wing buddy of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich while Lazio
has denounced Clinton as the candidate of the ''far left.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan, Perot Factions Tussle  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Patrick Buchanan and his supporters told
Reform Party veterans in California that his White House bid would
save Ross Perot's group from destroying itself.
</P>
<P>
   But state party leaders weren't feeling conciliatory Saturday,
moving toward splitting from the national party this fall and deny
Buchanan ballot access in the nation's largest state.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party in Minnesota has already broken ties with the
national party and other state parties are considering the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're not united, we can't reach out and get those
conservative Republicans, we can't get those union Democrats, we
can't get those folks who voted for Ross Perot and have walked away
from politics,'' Buchanan told about 400 people in attendance at
the state's Reform Party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Perot, a Texas billionaire, said the price of
being rescued by Buchanan-- accepting his conservative social
positions -- is too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not rescuing us; it may be just the opposite,'' said Bob
Ferrario of Los Gatos, Calif., who is attending the California
convention. ''He just wants to use it as a platform for his social
philosophy, but that's not what we're about. We're centrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan promised to do his best to unite the party if he
receives the nomination at the convention Aug. 10-13 in Long Beach.
He appealed for an end to bickering or risk harming the party's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we win this battle and we've got the delegates, I would ask
people even if they disagree: What's good is it going to do then to
keep arguing and damage our cause?'' Buchanan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who bolted the GOP in October after being overshadowed
by other candidates for the third straight presidential election,
would receive $12.6 million in federal funding if he is nominated
by the Reform Party at its August convention. A state-by-state
drive to secure delegates has made him the leader among some 10
candidates for the nomination, though he has been unable to break
roughly 4 percent in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   Perot received 19 percent in the 1992 presidential election and
8 percent in 1996. Unless the bickering stops, Buchanan said, the
party won't achieve those results.
</P>
<P>
   Some state and national party leaders would rather take that
chance than accept Buchanan, his staunch anti-abortion positions
and his rejection of any running mates that are homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, eight of 13 members of the state party's
governing board approved a resolution that said the state
organization would split from the national party after the
convention, unless Buchanan agrees:
</P>
<P>
   --to ''affirm'' the party's practice of electing a vice
presidential candidate at the national convention, rather than
leaving it up to the presidential candidate
</P>
<P>
   --to apply no ''litmus tests'' to any running mate
</P>
<P>
   --to make no attempt to change the national party's platform to
reflect his social issues
</P>
<P>
   Asked during a question-and-answer period to respond to each
point, Buchanan said cryptically that while the convention
''obviously'' picks the vice presidential hopeful, ''my running
mate will be pro-life.'' He has said in the past that he would not
run on the same ticket as anyone who favors aborton rights.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan did not respond to the question about litmus tests, but
he said he would not try to add his social views to the party
platform this year.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has said that if he were nominated to the top of the
ticket, he would also be the head of the party and would expect the
organization to reflect his views.
</P>
<P>
   His vague answers meant the state board of directors likely
would submit the resolution Sunday on breaking free on Sunday to
the roughly 180 state delegates for approval.
</P>
<P>
   John Hagelin and Charles Collins, other Reform presidential
candidates, also spoke and promised to unite the party by keeping
their focus away from social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Though the convention voted to exclude about 60 Buchanan
supporters from the proceedings over the weekend, his supporters
were a voluble presence at the Furama Hotel. They jumped to their
feet, screaming, ''Go Pat Go,'' when he entered the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Jackson took solace in her candidate's style.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every good party needs a good leader,'' said Lois Jackson, a
retired teacher from San Diego. ''If it can be rescued, he's the
only one who can do it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot is watching from the sidelines in Dallas - for now. He has
made clear to those close to him that he has no intention of
attending a convention at which Buchanan is nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrario acknowledged Buchanan isn't the only cause for the
volatile state of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were fighting, we had no charismatic leader, so we were
vulnerable to a takeover by someone like Buchanan,'' he said.
''It's partly the party's own fault.''

<HEADLINE> Report shows surge in alcohol arrests on college campuses  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcohol-related arrests on college campuses surged 24.3 percent
in 1998, the largest jump in seven years, according to a survey by
The Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and crime experts attributed the
increase to more heavy drinking among college students coupled with
better reporting and tougher enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alcohol abuse is the No. 1 problem on every college campus in
this country, and I don't care how big they are or how small they
are,'' said police Capt. Dale Burke of the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The university's 39,700-student Madison campus reported the most
liquor law violations -- 792 -- of any of the 481 four-year
institutions surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Sunday, showed an 11 percent increase in
college campus arrests for drug violations and an 11.3 percent
increase in arrests for forcible sex offenses, as well as smaller
increases in arrests for weapons violations, assault, arson and
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tuttle, a policy scientist and past public safety director
at the University of Delaware, warned against reading too much into
the statistics. He noted that while the numbers are required to be
published in some form under federal law, the Department of
Education will not begin uniform reporting until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor law arrests, for example, are supposed to include
citations. But in the past, some universities reported only
instances in which a person was taken into custody, Tuttle said.
Now that more schools understand the definition, the number of
reported arrests may rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle also pointed to increased enforcement as a possible
explanation for the jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think more institutions are seeing the courts as a way of
dealing with these problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts noted that while enforcement is up, so are
reports of hard-core drinking by college students.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released this year by the Harvard School of Public
Health found 22.7 percent of the college student population
reported frequent binge drinking in 1999, up from 19.8 percent in
1993 and 20.9 percent in 1997. The survey included 14,000 students
at 119 colleges.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent binge drinker was defined as a man who drank at least
five drinks in a row, or a woman who drank four, at least three or
more times in the two weeks before the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wechsler, a social psychologist and Harvard researcher who
led the study, said that until the past decade, alcohol abuse was
the ''little secret'' of colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colleges do have traditions where drinking is part of their
culture, and that needs to be changed,'' Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Tony Kleibecker of the Michigan State University Police
and Burke of the University of Wisconsin said many alcohol arrests
come after football games or special events such as concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, with 42,600 students, ranked second in the
survey in 1998 alcohol arrests with 655, and first in weapons
violations with 49. Thirty of the weapons arrests were misdemeanors
involving small knives or clubs, Kleibecker said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the University of California at
Berkeley was second in weapons violations with 34 on a campus of
30,300 students, followed by the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte with 26 on its 16,500-student campus, and the University
of North Carolina at Greensboro with 23 on its 12,530-student
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley also led the survey's list in drug arrests with 280,
followed by Rutgers University at New Brunswick with 138 on a
campus of 34,420; North Carolina at Greensboro with 132; and the
University of Arizona with 123 a campus of 33,740.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Adan Tejada of the UC Berkeley police force said the numbers
reflect the fact that Berkeley is in the middle of a city and a
block away from People's Park, the famously freewheeling area that
has long attracted drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of these things are happening south of
campus,'' Tejada said. ''We're not talking about central campus
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found 20 murders and one manslaughter case reported
in 1998, compared with 18 murders and two manslaughter cases in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of robbery, burglary and motor vehicle theft declined
from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Michigan State
University, the schools listed in the survey with the highest
numbers of alcohol arrests in 1998 were the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities with 606 on a campus of 45,400; Western
Michigan University with 405 on a campus of 26,130; and Berkeley
with 382.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol often plays a role in the other crimes, particularly sex
offenses, said Nancy Schulte, coordinator of drug education
services at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, colleges are beefing up alcohol and drug
awareness programs. They need to be asking themselves, ''How am I
vulnerable?'' she said.

Poll: Bush Reprieve Was Political
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six of 10 Americans say George W. Bush approved his first
reprieve in a Texas death penalty case for political reasons, according to a new
poll. Bush supporters were about evenly split on his motivation for approving
the reprieve. The Texas governor and likely Republican presidential nominee says
he approved a 30-day reprieve for Ricky McGinn so that potential DNA evidence
that might exonerate him could be reviewed, although the U.S. Supreme Court had
earlier denied McGinn's appeals.

new Russian president's suggestion he has relaxed his stern opposition to a
planned U.S. system to defend against missile attacks. But a senior
administration official, briefing reporters later, refused to specify whether
Putin demonstrated a willingness to go along with a modification of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct one, now being
tested.

seconds, using a single swift injection to dissolve clots that choke off the

that NATO committed war crimes during last year's air campaign against
Yugoslavia. A Russian parliamentary commission and lawyers working for
Yugoslavia had produced evidence to support charges that NATO committed war
crimes during its 78-day bombing campaign. However, chief prosecutor Carla del
Ponte told the Security Council on Friday that there was no basis for an
investigation into NATO's conduct, and that she was satisfied NATO had not
deliberately targeted civilians or illegal military areas.

eight dissidents said the government was ''absolutely wrong'' to crush the seven

<HEADLINE> Muslims on Trial in Southern Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) -- The trial began Saturday of 39 Muslims
charged with threatening a priest, looting a church and destroying
Coptic Christian homes and businesses in some of Egypt's worst
religious violence in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The trial centers on clashes between Muslims and Coptic
Christians that erupted Jan. 2 in the southern village of Dar
el-Salam. Five Copts were injured in the violence and 156 stores,
homes, pharmacies and offices belonging to Copts were burned or
looted.
</P>
<P>
   The violence had spread to Dar el-Salam from the nearby town of
el-Kusheh, where 23 people died -- mostly Christians -- after riots
erupted following an argument between a Muslim customer and a
Christian shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors on Saturday told the Sohag Criminal Court that it
had forensic and ballistic reports as well as town council reports
proving the suspects -- who include 12 aged 16 and 17 -- were guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The defense countered that the reports only showed that the
actions were committed, but did not prove that the suspects were
the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The court adjourned until July 3 and ordered that a government
social worker examine the 12 minors to see whether they should be
tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the suspects are being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are accused of stealing money and documents at
gunpoint from a priest at the Mary Guirges Church in Dar el-Salam.
They are also accused of robbing five Coptic Christians and beating
them with sticks. Other charges include arson, looting and
destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's Christians, who are mostly Orthodox Copts, comprise 10
percent of the country's 64 million people and have generally lived
peacefully with the overwhelmingly Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
   In another ruling Saturday, the Supreme Constitutional Court
said that the Law of Civil Associations -- which has been criticized
as curbing human rights groups' activities -- was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The law, passed one year ago by Egypt's lower house, gave the
Ministry of Social Affairs the power to disband boards of
directors, nullify their decisions and object to the civil groups'
funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said Saturday the law was never presented for
approval to the Shura Council, or upper house, in accordance with
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the law bypassed the administrative court, which is
supposed to resolve cases against civil bodies as well as
government officials and organizations, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has branded human rights groups unpatriotic,
saying they are determined to paint Egypt as undemocratic.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Election Council Named  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TOOTHAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- One week after Venezuela's election
council resigned amid accusations of incompetence, a new council
was named Saturday whose members were chosen in part for their lack
of political ties.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the five-member board by Venezuela's interim
legislature came after a high court suspended last Sunday's
national elections, citing technical glitches that threatened the
transparency of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice -- the country's
highest court -- and mounting pressure from both pro-government and
opposition parties led to the resignation of the election council.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of elections comes at a critical time for this
South American nation of 23 million people. Politically, the
country has been in limbo since President Hugo Chavez pushed
through a new constitution last year and dissolved the congress.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans were slated to vote for more than 6,000 offices as
called for by the new constitution. It requires the
''re-legitimization'' of most public offices including the
presidency, congress, governorships and most local posts.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of the new council was a response to calls for a more
transparent process. The selection of previous council members was
widely criticized since they were hand-picked by Chavez's political
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the new council were chosen for their management
skills, technical capacity, and lack of political ties. The new
members were chosen from a list of close to 350 candidates who were
nominated by Venezuela's civil organizations, including academic
and professional associations.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Jaua, vice president of the temporary congress, said he
hoped the new council will help restore public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people who have never had political ties and will
generate the confidence that the country requires,'' said Jaua.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Santana, a representative of Queremos Elegir, one of two
group's who asked the high court to suspend national elections,
said the new council's first job will be to clean up the
institution and rid it of all the ''political ties.''
</P>
<P>
   A new election date was expected to be announced next week.

<HEADLINE> Democratic candidates hit urban areas to get out the vote  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) -- Jon Corzine started at the head of the
parade but within minutes few could keep up, not the drum corps,
not classic cars, not even the son of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
called in to rally voters for Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillionaire Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate seemed
to sprint from handshake to handshake, once jogging across the
street through marchers to greet an elderly woman walking alone
with a cane. Residents cheered his name, promised support and some
joked about autographs.
</P>
<P>
   As Corzine coasted through Montclair's African American Day
Parade on Saturday, supporters strolled behind, reminding any who
would listen they were there for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're even going to bring Martin Luther King's son because we
need all the votes we can,'' shouted Assemblywoman Nia Gill,
D-Essex.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the last weekend before the primary, both
Democratic candidates targeted urban areas across the state,
reminding all who would listen that Tuesday is the day they need
voters the most.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Jim Florio began the day at a bagel shop in
Livingston before stops in Secaucus, Harrison, Elizabeth and
Trenton by mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Statehouse, Florio introduced himself and
wife Lucinda over and over again to people at Trenton's Heritage
Days. With each greeting, Florio reminded potential voters he was
once governor and now he wants to be senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about energizing people,'' Florio said. His plan was
to spend the weekend in urban areas, surrounded by crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing to do is to get them to come out and
vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine started in Montclair and planned a lengthy tour of
Newark's North Ward and then to Trenton and back up to a rally in
Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III planned to accompany Corzine at each
point. When the two met eight months ago at a fund-raising dinner
in Atlanta, King said he decided to support Corzine, a former
chairman of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard the ideas he was espousing, about health care,
about education, about inclusion, I felt he was the kind of
candidate I would want to see in the U.S. Senate,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine supporters repeatedly said money is not an issue -- not
even the $33 million he plans to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see all the other guys doing that. He's going to need it for
sure, but right now he's spending his own money,'' said Sam Pinkard
of Montclair.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Frager planned to vote for Corzine no matter what he
eventually shells out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a problem with that,'' she said. ''What he's
saying is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Anthony Austin said he did have one problem
with Corzine's millions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wanted to get elected that bad, why not spend $100
million if he's got $400 million,'' Austin said as he watched
Corzine speedwalk along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's backers often greeted him emotionally. They reminisced
from his term as governor and even talked about his $2.8 billion
tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he's doing today should have been done all over
Trenton,'' Mai-Tai McDonald said as she and her granddaughter
snacked in Mill Hill Park.
</P>
<P>
   Florio had just walked past, asking ''for your consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have the wrong impression of him,'' McDonald
said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican City Flooded With Sewage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Thousands of residents of the capital's
sprawling Chalco suburb spent a third day inundated in sewer water
Saturday, as authorities promised to seal the banks of an open
sewage canal that flooded their homes earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The flood, in which heavy rains forced the foul-smelling canal
to break its banks Thursday, has proved an embarrassment to
Mexico's ruling party, which has touted its efforts on behalf of
this low-income suburb just east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, who has tirelessly toured disaster
zones in recent years, stayed away from Chalco, where 4,700 people
were forced from their homes by several feet of fetid of fetid
floodwaters. Instead, he gave a speech on education in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Government employees spread quicklime around the area as pumps
worked futilely to lower the level of the contaminated water, which
has become a health risk.
</P>
<P>
   Residents told local media that contact with the water has begun
to cause skin irritations. Piles of dead sheep and dogs have also
begun to appear in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The flood continued to block the main highway out of Mexico City
to the east, and vehicles were forced to make an hours-long detour.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they would begin to seal the breech Saturday
with cement, allowing the waters to gradually recede. The National
Water Commission, which is responsible for the canal, said it would
reinforce the waterway's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City pumps much of its sewage, untreated, through former
river beds. Residents of Chalco accused the water authority -- part
of the federal government -- of not providing proper maintenance for
the canal.

<HEADLINE> 70,000 Rally for Elian in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A day after a massive march demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, a reported 70,000 people rallied in
eastern Cuba, demanding the boy be repatriated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''We raise our voices so our enemies can hear us: Bring back
Elian!'' Madelin Gonzalez, one of a dozen speakers, shouted from
the stage in Banes, in the eastern province of Holguin.
</P>
<P>
   The rally followed a massive march in Havana on Friday by a
reported half-million women angered by the latest delay in Elian's
return to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. appellate court panel sided Thursday with Elian's father,
saying that immigration officials were entitled to deny an asylum
hearing for the boy. But under the ruling, Elian must remain in the
United States for two weeks to give his Miami relatives a chance to
appeal, and then another week after that.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans had hoped the child would return home with his father
immediately after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others died in November when their boat
sank during a journey from Cuba to the United States. Two men on a
fishing trip rescued Elian off the Florida coast after finding him
floating on an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives were given temporary custody of Elian,
who immediately became the subject of an international tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Gonzalez traveled to the United States on April 6 in
hopes of reclaiming his son and returning with him to the island,
but the Miami relatives refused to turn the child over to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were reunited on April 22 after Elian was taken
forcibly from the Miami relatives' home during an armed federal
raid. Elian has since lived with his father in the Washington area
while awaiting the decision.

<HEADLINE> LAPD Chief's Granddaughter Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a pink-trimmed casket covered with roses,
the granddaughter of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks was mourned
Saturday by hundreds. Meanwhile, a dozen detectives continued
searching for her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the intended target wasn't the chief's
granddaughter, but a passenger in 20-year-old Lori Gonzalez's car.
</P>
<P>
   During the funeral, held in an auditorium large enough to
accommodate the 1,400 mourners, Mayor Richard Riordan read messages
from several lawmakers, including President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''People across America have been shocked and saddened that yet
another one of our young people has lost her life to gun
violence,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, who hadn't spoken about the shooting, sat stiffly in the
front row, occasionally smiling at comments during the service.
Afterward, he helped to carry her casket.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very, very sad day for the family, and we'll relive
this incident forever,'' Parks said at a reception after the
funeral. ''I think the only joy in it is that we had her for these
(nearly) 21 years and we'll basically cherish every minute of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks declined to discuss the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not take any time off from work and said ''you
just have to keep living'' to cope with the death.
</P>
<P>
   A blanket of white and pink roses covered the coffin, flanked by
two dozen flower arrangements, including two shaped liked
six-pointed police badges. Two uniformed police officers sang
''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was a Sunday school teacher who worked two jobs,
attended Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, where she lived, and
did occasional missionary work in Tijuana, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   She was shot to death May 28 when a gunman opened fire as she
drove away from a fast-food restaurant. Police said the intended
target was a childhood friend inside the car who ducked and avoided
the bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times and Daily News of Los Angeles, citing
unidentified police sources, have said the 20-year-old friend is a
gang member with a felony record who was wounded by rivals in the
same area three weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Police have declined to discuss the investigation or possible
gang connections. Lt. Clay Farrell said Friday that ''discernible
progress'' was being made. Parks declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   During the eulogy, Bishop Charles E. Blake of West Angeles
Church of God in Christ blamed violent entertainment media and
culture for producing killers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a thousand movies, cartoons, comic strips and video games,
we imply that life is dispensable,'' Blake said. ''If we, out of
the agony of this moment, started to proclaim the message the life
is valuable, then Lori and every other victim would live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's father, Jose Gonzalez, said the family had received
cards, letters and email messages from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lori was a special, special girl, and we feel honored to have
had her for 20 years,'' Gonzalez said. ''It's sad that she had to
leave so soon.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kennedy Accepts Nomination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, evoking the
memory of his late brothers John and Robert, accepted the
Democratic nomination Saturday for a seventh six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand here today and think of my brothers,'' Kennedy told
the 2,100 delegates to the state party convention. ''I continue to
be guided by my brother John's ideals -- that we ask not what our
country can do for us, but what we can do for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little debate over the nomination, and Kennedy, a
senator since 1962, is heavily favored to win the November general
election. Republican Jack E. Robinson and Libertarian candidate
Carla Howell are challenging him.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour address, Kennedy, 68, touted his achievements in
the Senate and pledged to keep fighting on issues like education,
the environment and labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will win the battle to pass the patients' rights bill,'' he
said. ''We need decisions made by doctors, not by accountants of
HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of campaign finance, Kennedy said it is time to
enact reform ''once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's tell the HMOs and the NRA and other special interest
groups their contributions will not prevail,'' he said. ''Their
gold is fool's gold.''

<HEADLINE> William Simon, treasury secretary under Nixon, Ford, dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- William Edward Simon, secretary of the treasury
in the Nixon and Ford administrations and the ''energy czar''
credited with easing public fears during the 1970s oil crisis, died
Saturday, NBC reported. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Simon died of complications from pulmonary fibrosis, a lung
disease, in Santa Barbara, Calif., the network said.
</P>
<P>
   Named by President Nixon as his choice for deputy secretary of
the treasury on Dec, 6, 1972, Simon was sworn into office on Feb.
2, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed to chair the President's Oil Policy Committee within
weeks of his arrival in Washington, Simon had responsibility for
the oil import program and quickly became expert on the nation's
escalating energy problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Arab oil embargo in December 1973, Nixon
selected Simon as head of the Federal Energy Office. As ''energy
czar,'' he instituted a mandatory fuel allocation program and was
able to stem the rising tide of public hysteria, without resorting
to gasoline rationing, until the embargo was lifted in spring 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Simon continued to serve simultaneously as deputy secretary and
head of the FEO until George Shultz's resignation as treasury
secretary in April 1974. Nixon nominated Simon to replace him and
when Ford assumed the presidency in August 1974, Simon continued in
the post.
</P>
<P>
   As treasury secretary, Simon headed a 125,000-person department,
which collected the nation's taxes, paid its bills, managed its
accounts, printed its currency, and minted its coins. During his
tenure the $2 bill was reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
   He also had responsibility for various law enforcement agencies
that were part of the Treasury, including the U.S. Customs Service,
and the U.S. Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon left office at the end of the Ford administration in
January 1977, there was speculation he might run for the
governorship of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, however, returned to business, serving first as adviser
and consultant to such firms as Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, Inc. and
Blyth Eastman Dillon &AMP; Co., Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Later he formed his own investment firm, the Wesray Corporation.
He also wrote two books, both of which became best sellers: ''A
Time for Truth'' (1978) and ''A Time for Action'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who had served in the Army in Japan, graduated from
Lafayette College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and
Law in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in finance in 1952 with Union Securities,
becoming an assistant vice president and manager of the Municipal
Trading Department three years later. In 1957 he joined Weeden and
Company as vice president, a post he held until he joined Salomon
Brothers investment banking firm in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his service in the public and private sector,
Simon lent his support to a myriad of organizations, causes, and
philanthropies, including the U.S. Olympic Foundation Board of
Trustees, and president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the U.S. Olympic Committee for more than 30 years,
Simon oversaw the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles as president of
the USOC. He was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   1998, after having already donated an estimated $30 million to
various causes, he announced his intention to give away his entire
fortune, estimated at $350 million, to charitable organizations,
among them AIDS hospices and low-income educational groups.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promises Repairs to Tenant  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL WEST
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tracy Mayberry thought Vice President Al
Gore was a slumlord, until Gore called her Saturday and promised to
repair overflowing toilets and backed-up sinks in the apartment her
family rents from him.
</P>
<P>
   Mayberry and her family pay $400 a month to rent the
four-bedroom house within sight of Gore's home in Carthage, about
50 miles east of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, I was really upset with him. I considered him a
slumlord,'' she said Saturday. ''Right now, my opinion varies. If
he'll uphold his end of the bargain, that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated complaints to Gore's property managers, Mayberry
said she was told her family -- including her disabled husband, a
mentally retarded daughter and another daughter with a seizure
disorder -- were being evicted. They live on $1,536 a month in
Social Security from her husband's disability.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Mayberry contacted a Nashville television station,
WTVF-TV, which aired a story on her situation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, Gore was on the phone to Mayberry,
promising to fix the problems and pay for a new place for the
family to stay. Republicans were already circulating the TV story
to national news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he'd heard I'd called him a slumlord, and I said I
did. I said if you want to run for president, you ought to behave
like a landlord should,'' Mayberry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He agreed with me. He said he's going to come in and do a
complete renovation ... He kept apologizing. He said he's not what
you'd call a hands-on landlord. I said I understand he's got a lot
of obligations being vice president and campaigning. But I said
I've got a lot of obligations to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Doug Hattaway said Gore was not aware of the house's
condition until his staff was contacted by WTVF. Plumbing repairs
would be so extensive the water would be turned off for quite some
time, and the family likely would need to leave while the work was
done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Mayberrys are on a month-to-month lease, the property
managers had asked the family to vacate the home while the repairs
were made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should emphasize for the record they're not being evicted,''
he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore overruled his property managers and instructed his Carthage
lawyer to find a place for the family to stay. They will not have
to pay rent while the repairs are made, Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
issued a statement saying the Mayberry situation demonstrated a
''lack of compassion'' by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Left to his own devices, these are the decisions Al Gore
always seems to end up making,'' Nicholson said.

<HEADLINE> Seattle's Piniella Believes In Mesa  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Although Jose Mesa hasn't pitched for the Seattle
Mariners since his disastrous eighth inning in Tampa Bay last
Sunday, he'll be back on the mound soon.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said before Saturday night's game between
the Mariners and San Diego Padres that he still has confidence in
the team's former closer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been working with our pitching coach with altering his
delivery,'' Piniella said. ''Bryan (Price) told me yesterday he was
ready for game action again. So we'll get him back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, 34, has been the target of boos at Safeco Field this
season. His horrendous performance in Tampa Bay's 11-run eighth
inning in Seattle's 14-4 loss last weekend, when he gave up seven
hits and eventually was ejected for throwing at Mike DeFelice, led
to speculation this week that the Mariners might release the
veteran right-hander, who is in the final year of a two-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners think Mesa can help them in their bid for the
AL West title.
</P>
<P>
   And Piniella denied he was holding Mesa out of games at Safeco
for public relations purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to get him the right opportunity,'' Piniella said.
''I've been trying to find him the right spot. Certainly, I'd pitch
him at home. We'll pitch him at home or away. I'm just trying to
get him a nice spot to get him in. I've just been giving him a
little time to digest what the pitching coach has been trying to
get across.''
</P>
<P>
   After tying the Mariners' record with 33 saves in 38
opportunities last season, Mesa lost his closer's job to Japan's
Kazuhiro Sasaki in spring training. In 20 games this season, he has
an 8.14 ERA and a 2-4 record in 24 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mesa recorded a major league-high 46 saves in 48
opportunities for Cleveland, setting a franchise record for saves
in a single season for the Indians. He has 137 career saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had a lot of success in baseball,'' Piniella said of
Mesa, who played for Cleveland from 1992-98. ''Yes, your confidence
can wane. But with one good game, we can get him back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, Seattle's first-year pitching coach, said he's moved Mesa
from the left to right side of the rubber in an effort to deceive
hitters and improve his control. Mesa still has a menacing fastball
that averages 92-96 mph with a top of 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants the ball and he wants to turn this around,'' Price
said. ''I think he's confident that good things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said the boos that Mesa has been subjected to at Safeco
have been painful.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to anticipate them until he turns it around,'' Price
said. ''But he can get the people back on his side. He can get them
to embrace him.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Said Linked to Pan Am Bombing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Iranian defector says he has evidence that
Iran planned and financed the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   The defector, who says he is Ahmad Behbahani, coordinator of
Iran's terrorism operations for a decade or more, told CBS New's 60
Minutes that he has documents to prove his claims in an interview
scheduled to air Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA is debriefing Behbahani, now in protective custody in
Turkey, according to CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who have been accused of planting the bomb in the Pan Am
jet's cargo hold, are in the midst of their trial before Scottish
judges on a former U.S. Air base in the Netherlands. They have
pleaded innocent, blaming two Syrian-based Palestinian factions
instead.
</P>

   The explosion over Lockerbie killed 259 Pan Am passengers and 11
people on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Bob Hope's Condition Upgraded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Comedian Bob Hope was out of bed
and moving about his hospital room Saturday afternoon and his
condition was upgraded from critical to stable as he recovers from
gastrointestinal bleeding, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is progressing as his doctor predicted,'' said Lea Goodsell
of Eisenhower Regional Medical Center. She said Hope is recovering
quickly due to ''his overall good health and strength.''
</P>
<P>
   The 97-year-old entertainer is expected to remain in a critical
care unit overnight as a precaution, and his condition will be
reevaluated Sunday morning. The hospital is preparing a private
room. Hope is expected to return home later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Hope ate his favorite breakfast of oatmeal and fruit after an
uneventful night, Goodsell said. His wife, Delores, remained by his
bedside, reading and talking to her husband of 66 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was able to move from his bed to a chair, Goodsell said,
and is undergoing ''the standard physical therapy for someone who
has been confined to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting to see the essence of Bob Hope emerge from all
the treatments,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainer continued to receive faxes, e-mail and flowers
from friends and fans, and Delores Hope has shared some of them
with her husband, Goodsell said. Former President Ford and his
wife, Betty, who have a home in Rancho Mirage, have phoned Hope and
receive regular updates on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   One fax from a retired Army lieutenant colonel said that he
hoped his ''heartfelt thanks may serve to lift your spirits and
speed your route to recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The venerable entertainer was taken to Desert Regional Medical
Center in Palm Springs after waking up with abdominal pain
Thursday. He was later admitted to Eisenhower Regional with
gastrointestinal bleeding. It is not a life-threatening condition,
according to his doctor, and is not unusual for someone his age.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital sits on 100 acres that Hope donated in the 1960s
and is located on Bob Hope Drive.

70,000 Rally for Elian in Cuba
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A day after a massive march demanding the return of 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, a reported 70,000 people rallied in eastern Cuba, demanding the
boy be repatriated immediately. ''We raise our voices so our enemies can hear
us: Bring back Elian!'' Madelin Gonzalez, one of a dozen speakers, shouted from
the stage in Banes, in the eastern province of Holguin. The rally followed a
massive march in Havana on Friday by a reported half-million women angered by
the latest delay in Elian's return to his communist homeland.

   LOWELL, Mass. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, evoking the memory of his
late brothers John and Robert, accepted the Democratic nomination today for a
seventh six-year term. ''I stand here today and think of my brothers,'' Kennedy

guided by my brother John's ideals -- that we ask not what our country can do
for us, but what we can do for our country.'' In a half-hour address, Kennedy,

LAPD Chief's Granddaughter Mourned
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a pink-trimmed casket covered with roses, the
granddaughter of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks was mourned today by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a dozen detectives continued searching for her killer. Police believe
the intended target wasn't the chief's granddaughter, but a passenger in
20-year-old Lori Gonzalez's car. During the funeral, held in an auditorium large
enough to accommodate the 1,400 mourners, Mayor Richard Riordan read messages
from several lawmakers, including President Clinton.

Israel, Palestinians Resume Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have resumed their talks on a
permanent peace treaty, a Palestinian official said Saturday. The meeting took
place Thursday night and early Friday morning said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He refused to say where it was held. The negotiations,
which were previously being held in the Swedish capital Stockholm, were moved to
an undisclosed location, presumed to be in Israel or the Palestinian areas.

Clinton Backed by NY Liberal Party

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Locked in a tight race where every vote could count,
Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted the backing of New York's Liberal Party tonight
while her Republican Senate rival Rick Lazio was embraced by the Conservative
Party. However support for Lazio, who favors abortion rights for women, was not
unanimous because of his views on the subject. ''I'm pro-life ... and I don't
believe he's as conservative as they say he is,'' explained Tom Clark of Nassau
County as he cast the lone vote against Lazio.

Clinton, Putin Meet in Moscow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Clinton and Vladimir Putin dined on trout, goose and
spicy boar in a Kremlin summit dinner Saturday, with Clinton intrigued by the
new Russian president's suggestion he has relaxed his stern opposition to a
planned U.S. system to defend against missile attacks. But a senior
administration official, briefing reporters later, refused to specify whether
Putin demonstrated a willingness to go along with a modification of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that Clinton would need to build such a defense.
Clinton will not decide until fall whether to try to construct one, now being
tested.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Matt Stairs hit a three-run homer in the
seventh inning and drove in four runs as the Oakland Athletics
overcame a pair of homers by Barry Bonds to beat the San Francisco
Giants 9-7 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds homered in the first and fifth innings, giving him the
major league lead with 22, one more than Mark McGwire. Bonds has
two multihomer games this season and 44 in his career, tied for
12th on that list with Willie McCovey and Mike Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   With 467 homers, Bonds is 20th on the career list, eight behind
Stan Musial and Willie Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which won Friday's opener of the interleague series,
extended its winning streak to four.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe presented the lineup card dressed in a suit
and straw hat in honor of Connie Mack, selected as the Athletics'
manager of the century on Saturday. Both teams wore replicas of
their uniforms in 1911, when the Philadelphia A's beat the New York
Giants 4-3 in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   With San Francisco leading 5-4, Olmedo Saenz walked leading off
the seventh. John Jaha, playing in his first major league game
since April 24, singled with two outs and Stairs homered off Alan
Embree.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam walked Ramon Martinez with the bases loaded in the
eighth as the Giants closed within a run, but Randy Velarde hit a
two-run homer in the bottom half off John Johnstone to make it 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jones (1-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings of hitless relief, and
Jason Isringhausen got three outs for his 13th save in 16 chances,
allowing an RBI double to Jeff Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Tim Hudson, unbeaten in eight starts since April 20 in
Cleveland, allowed five runs and seven hits in six innings. Bonds'
first homer ended Hudson's 16-inning scoreless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Kirk Rueter, winless in seven starts since
beating Arizona on April 22, allowed four runs, five hits and five
walks in 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, playing because of an injury to Rich Aurilia, had
three RBIs, including a solo homer in the fifth and an RBI single
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz and Ben Grieve each drove in runs with a sacrifice flies,
and Stairs and Miguel Tejada each singled home a run in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants 1B J.T. Snow was scratched because of stomach flu.
... Giants C Doug Mirabelli was scratched because of irritation in
his right eye and was taken to a hospital. ... Jaha, who had been
sidelined with a left shoulder strain, was activated before the
game. ... Oakland 3B Adam Piatt was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento
of the Pacific Coast League. ... Giants OF Ellis Burks was held out
of the lineup with sore knees. ... Aurilia missed his third game
due to a strained left hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Highland Gold Wins L.A. Handicap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Highland Gold, an 8-1 long shot after
finishing a distant second to Mr. Doubledown two weeks ago at
Golden Gate Fields, won the $107,100 Los Angeles Handicap on
Saturday at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden for the first time by Chris McCarron, Highland Gold
closed strongly to beat Mellow Fellow by 1\ lengths. The
Kentucky-bred son of Slew o' Gold covered six furlongs in 1:09 and
paid $20.40, $8.40 and $5.20.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Highland Gold's first since 1998 and the $64,260
winner's purse raised his career earnings to $217,805 in 16 starts
for co-owners Jerry Hellendorfer and George Todardo.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow Fellow, ridden by Martin Pedroza, edged Your Halo by a
nose for second and paid $9.00 and $6.80.
</P>
<P>
   Your Halo, ridden by Garrett Gomez, paid $5.00 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez filed a protest against Highland Gold for interference at
the start of the race, however stewards denied the claim, saying
that last-place finisher Old Topper was responsible instead of
Highland Gold.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Twelve people were killed when teen-agers
brought a discarded missile into a crowded displaced persons camp
and the device exploded, state radio RNA reported Saturday. Another
52 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The blast Friday was the latest deadly incident caused by
discarded weapons from Angola's protracted civil war. Unmarked
minefields regularly cause deaths among civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at a camp near Malanje, about 190 miles
east of the capital, Luanda, RNA reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several teen-agers reportedly were playing with the missile when
it went off. They were killed immediately and others were
hospitalized with shrapnel wounds, according to RNA. No further
information was available.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan government has been fighting UNITA rebels in a
two-decade civil war. Some 2 million people have been driven from
their homes by the fighting.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A United Airlines flight from Chicago to Las Vegas
was diverted to Denver on Saturday after a group of flight
attendants complained of being dizzy and lightheaded.
</P>
<P>
   A United spokesman said five flight attendants were taken to
University Hospital, but a hospital spokeswoman said six patients
were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 297 passengers or pilots reported any symptoms and
no problems were found with the plane, the spokesman said. The
cause of the dizziness was not known.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane landed in Denver, the attendants were replaced
by another group. Flight 1047 continued to Las Vegas and arrived
more than two hours behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   United has been in contract negotiations with its pilots, but
the airline spokesman said Saturday's problems did not appear to be
related to any labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Another United plane, Flight 1227, which took off from Dulles
International Airport in Washington, landed at Lambert Airport in
St. Louis at about 12:30 p.m. CDT after pilots reported an engine
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed safely and all 327 people on board were
unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Friends Battle For Stanley Cup  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Growing up in a small Canadian town in Nova Scotia
about 20 years ago, Jon Sim and Colin White were like most young
boys playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In their wildest dreams, they hoped that one day they would be
playing for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The variable the two nearly lifelong friends never expected was
that they would live out their dream, playing against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Sim is actually reliving the dream, playing in his second
straight Cup final as a forward with the defending champion Dallas
Stars. White is getting his first chance to put his name on the Cup
as a rookie defenseman with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really weird, especially coming from a small town,''
White said Saturday before Game 3 of the best-of-seven series. ''I
don't know if there was anyone in the Stanley Cup finals or even
played in the NHL from there. There probably was, but Jon took the
Cup home last year and that was the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I will this year, but we're just taking it one game
at a time,'' said the 22-year-old White, 2{ months younger than
Sim.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening two games of the series, Sim and White have come
together and their friendship was forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Both players finished their checks. There was no trash talking
among friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We both keep our mouths shut,'' White said. ''When it's all
said and done, there will be plenty to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sim said it has been fun seeing White on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy for him,'' Sim said. ''We've played each other quite
a bit, and all the bumping and grinding against each other is kind
of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   White said that while growing up in New Glasgow, a town of
10,000, there was no comparing the two players who were coached by
Sim's father. The 5-foot-10 Sim was a skilled scorer. The 6-4,
215-pound White was a banger on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always the top player on the team,'' White said. ''He
was the team leader back then and I'm sure he'll have that
responsibility someday here.''
</P>
<P>
   White said the one constant is that back home their parents will
be rooting for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pretty much grew up in each other's household,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sim brought the Stanley Cup home last summer, White's
parents saw hockey's most prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't home,'' White said. ''I was down in New Jersey trying
to make the team so I really didn't get to see it. My family went
over to see it and it was shared around the town.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or the other, the Cup is going back to New Glasgow this
summer.

	   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- William Edward Simon, secretary of
the treasury in the Nixon and Ford administrations and the ''energy
czar'' credited with easing public fears during the 1970s oil
crisis, died Saturday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Simon died from complications of pulmonary fibrosis, said his
daughter, Mary Streep. ''His heart valve just gave out.''
</P>
<P>
   Named by President Nixon as his choice for deputy secretary of
the treasury on Dec, 6, 1972, Simon was sworn into office on Feb.
2, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed to chair the President's Oil Policy Committee within
weeks of his arrival in Washington, Simon had responsibility for
the oil import program and quickly became expert on the nation's
escalating energy problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Arab oil embargo in December 1973, Nixon
selected Simon as head of the Federal Energy Office. As ''energy
czar,'' he instituted a mandatory fuel allocation program and was
able to stem the rising tide of public hysteria, without resorting
to gasoline rationing, until the embargo was lifted in spring 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Simon continued to serve simultaneously as deputy secretary and
head of the FEO until George Shultz's resignation as treasury
secretary in April 1974. Nixon nominated Simon to replace him and
when Ford assumed the presidency in August 1974, Simon continued in
the post.
</P>
<P>
   As treasury secretary, Simon headed a 125,000-person department,
which collected the nation's taxes, paid its bills, managed its
accounts, printed its currency, and minted its coins. During his
tenure the $2 bill was reintroduced.
</P>
<P>
   He also had responsibility for various law enforcement agencies
that were part of the Treasury, including the U.S. Customs Service,
and the U.S. Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon left office at the end of the Ford administration in
January 1977, there was speculation he might run for the
governorship of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, however, returned to business, serving first as adviser
and consultant to such firms as Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, Inc. and
Blyth Eastman Dillon &AMP; Co., Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Later he formed his own investment firm, the Wesray Corporation.
He also wrote two books, both of which became best sellers: ''A
Time for Truth'' (1978) and ''A Time for Action'' (1980).
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who had served in the Army in Japan, graduated from
Lafayette College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and
Law in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in finance in 1952 with Union Securities,
becoming an assistant vice president and manager of the Municipal
Trading Department three years later. In 1957 he joined Weeden and
Company as vice president, a post he held until he joined Salomon
Brothers investment banking firm in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his service in the public and private sector,
Simon lent his support to a myriad of organizations, causes, and
philanthropies, including the U.S. Olympic Foundation Board of
Trustees, and president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the U.S. Olympic Committee for more than 30 years,
Simon oversaw the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles as president of
the USOC. He was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, after having already donated an estimated $30 million
to various causes, he announced his intention to give away his
entire fortune, estimated at $350 million, to charitable
organizations, among them AIDS hospices and low-income educational
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Saturday, New Jersey Gov. Christie
Whitman said the death of Simon, who was born in Paterson, N.J.,
''will give people around the world a chance to reflect on a man of
great stature who will be missed by all.''

<HEADLINE> Park Leads Kathy Ireland LPGA Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURRELLS INLET, S.C. (AP) -- South Korea's Grace Park shot a
2-under-par 70 on Saturday to maintain a one-stroke lead after the
third round of the Kathy Ireland Greens.com Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Park, the 21-year-old former Arizona State star in her first
season on the LPGA tour, had a 12-under 204 total on Wachesaw
Plantation's East course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like where I am and I don't feel any pressure,'' Park said.
''I guess I have been in this position before, just not here on the
LPGA Tour. I am the rookie coming up and I am not really scared of
anyone person behind me. I have no fear. I am just going to play
the game and hope that it is there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, the 1998 U.S. Amateur champion, was even on the front
nine, offsetting birdies on Nos. 3 and 6 with bogeys on Nos. 5 and
8. She birdied Nos. 10 and 17 to reach 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't play all that great, but I think I had the best
putting day yet,'' said Park, who had only 24 putts. ''The back was
not so good out there putting, but there were so many good ones on
the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster and Pat Hurst, each seeking their second victory of
the season, shot 68s to share second place at 205.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think that you just have to stay patient out there on
this course and you will be in good shape,'' said Inkster, a
five-time winner last year who won the Longs Drug Challenge in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst won the Electrolux USA Championship three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shots on to the greens are just setting up good for the
birdie opportunities and I have really been able to capitalize on
some for them,'' Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle McGann (70), Cristie Kerr (71) and Kristal Parker (72)
followed at 207, and Dottie Pepper (68), England's Karen Stupples
(69) and Sweden's Liselotte Neumann (72) were next at 209.
</P>
<P>
   Parker closed with a triple-bogey 7.
</P>
<P>
   She received a free drop after hitting her drive near a drainage
ditch, but hit her second shot into the trees to the right of the
green. She then hit a root with her third shot, imbedding the ball
in the ground. After taking a penalty stroke for the unplayable
lie, she chipped onto the green and two-putted for 7.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Chmura: I Will Be Released  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Green Bay tight end Mark Chmura, facing trial
on charges he sexually assaulted his 17-year-old baby sitter, said
the team has told him he will be released.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I am saddened to announce that after eight wonderful
seasons, my tenure with the Green Bay Packers will be over,''
Chmura said Saturday during a news conference at attorney Gerald
Boyle's office. His lawyers said the formal release will come
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has always been a dream of mine to end my playing career
with the Green Bay Packers. Unfortunately, it does not appear that
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Chmura had sex with the girl without her consent
in a bathroom at his friend Robert Gessert's Hartland home after a
night of drinking at a post-prom party. The teen was once a baby
sitter for Chmura's two children.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Packers general manager Ron Wolf called Chmura's friend and
attorney John Drana on Wednesday to inform him of the team's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf made no reference to the criminal case, Drana said.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, 31, signed a five-year, $15 million contract in 1998.
The deal included a $3 million signing bonus. By releasing him
after June 1, the Packers gain $900,000 in salary cap room that
could be used to sign free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, his (Wolf's) word was, 'We have certain guidelines
we live by. I don't make them. Mark doesn't make them. We need the
salary cap room,''' Drana said.
</P>
<P>
   Packers officials did not immediately return calls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura was near tears and his voice quivered as he read a
statement during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Wolf and Packers president Bob Harlan and apologized
to Packers fans for the ''mess that has been brought upon you.'' He
asked them to withhold judgment until he can present his case.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the greatest fans in all of sport, it has been a true honor
to wear the green and gold on your behalf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura, nicknamed ''Chewy,'' became one of the game's elite
tight ends during the Packers' run to consecutive Super Bowl
appearances in 1997 and 1998. He was drafted out of Boston College
in the sixth round in 1992 and made the Pro Bowl three times.
</P>
<P>
   He missed all but two games last season with a neck injury that
caused partial paralysis in his arms and threatened to end his
career. He had planned to play in the upcoming season and
participated in the team's first mini-camp in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers took tight end Bubba Franks with their first-round
draft pick less that a week after Chmura's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Packers center Frank Winters, one of Chmura's closest friends on
the team, watched from behind a line of television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a tough time,'' Winters said. ''I'm just
trying to be there and support him. He's doing a lot better than he
did when I first talked to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Drana said Chmura wants to play football again but he wouldn't
comment on whether any teams have expressed interest. Boyle, who
must keep track of Chmura's whereabouts as a condition of bail,
said he would allow Chmura to leave Wisconsin if another team wants
him.
</P>
<P>
   Chmura's agent Eric Metz said Saturday night that no team could
contact him until Chmura is officially released by the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a retirement speech,'' Drana said, although he and
Boyle said Chmura hasn't been able to rehabilitate his neck since
the allegations broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every ounce of my energy has been spent to rid myself and my
family of these untruthful allegations,'' Chmura said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said Chmura, listed at 6-foot-5 and 255 pounds in the
Packers' media guide, has lost 20 pounds since he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like a serious illness,'' Boyle said. ''You can't get
your mind off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura is charged with third-degree sexual assault for allegedly
having sex with the girl. He could face 10 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year-old woman said Gessert fondled her while they were in
a hot tub. Gessert, 43, is charged with third- and fourth-degree
sexual assault and also has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are due back in court June 23 to enter a plea. No trial
date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Saturday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Tigers-Cubs:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT: Days don't get much better than Saturday was for Jeff
Weaver. He pitched the Tigers to a victory, and he played at
Wrigley Field. ''When I heard I was starting at Wrigley, I was
fired up about it,'' he said. ''It was fun. The sun was out, the
wind was blowing in -- you can't ask for a better day in Chicago. I
wish every park was like this. With the history and the fans so
enthusiastic, it gets you really pumped up to pitch here.'' ... The
Tigers' victory was their first at Wrigley Field since Oct. 10,
1945, when they beat the Cubs 9-3 in Game 7 of the World Series.
... Juan Gonzalez, nursing a strained left foot, went 1-for-4 with
an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: SS Ricky Gutierrez, on the DL since May 25 with a
separated right shoulder, might be back for next weekend's
Cubs-White Sox series. ''It's going to be close,'' manager Don
Baylor said. ''We're looking at Friday, it could be Sunday.''
Gutierrez has only thrown soft toss, but he'll start taking
grounders in the next day or so. That will give Baylor a better
idea of when Gutierrez will be ready to go. ''I'm not going to put
him on the field until he's ready to throw from the hole,'' Baylor
said. ... Sammy Sosa homered at Wrigley Field for the first time
since May 10 -- a span of 42 at-bats at home. ''Don't remind me,''
Sosa said, smiling. ''Every player goes through that. I still
believe in myself.'' ... Cubs relievers allowed a run Saturday for
the first time in more than eight games -- a span of 18 innings.
Orioles-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Orioles manager Mike Hargrove will miss the final two
games of the series in Montreal to attend his son Andy's high
school graduation in Cleveland. Bench coach Jeff Newman will
substitute for Hargrove on Saturday night and Sunday. ... The
Orioles are 12-24 since April 22 when they were a season-high six
games over .500. ... Albert Belle had hit safely in 26 of his last
29 games entering Saturday night's game, going 37-for-111 (.333)
over that stretch. ... SS Mike Bordick has started in all of
Baltimore's 53 games.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: 2B Jose Vidro missed his first start of the season
Saturday night due to a sprained ligament in his right middle
finger. Vidro, who injured his finger two weeks ago while diving
back to first base, received a cortisone shot before the game and
is expected to miss three games. ... RF Vladimir Guerrero and 1B
Lee Stevens are the only remaining Expos to have started each of
Montreal's 52 games. ... RHP starter Mike Thurman was also given a
cortisone shot in his injured right elbow Saturday. Thurman is
currently on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis for the
second time this season.
Blue Jays-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Craig Grebeck, a former Marlins player, is hitless in
his last four games and is 1-for-23 (.043) in his last six. ...
Shannon Stewart is batting .471, with two home runs and nine RBIs
in his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: RHP Alex Fernandez, on the DL since May 18 due to a
strained ligament in his right elbow and a sore rotator cuff in his
right shoulder, was in Birmingham, Ala., Thursday to be examined by
Dr. James Andrews. The examination confirmed that there was no
ligament tear. Since the inflammation in his elbow hasn't
completely subsided, however, Fernandez was instructed not to throw
for at least two more weeks. ... LF Cliff Floyd, best known for his
offensive skills, has made several spectacular defensive plays
recently, including a leaping catch that kept Toronto from tying
Friday's series opener in the ninth inning. ''He's getting to the
point now where you're more surprised when he doesn't catch
those,'' CF Preston Wilson said.
Royals-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals made several roster moves before
Saturday's game. They recalled RHP Jeff D'Amico from Triple-A Omaha
and activated OF Todd Dunwoody from the DL. To clear roster spots,
OF Mark Quinn was optioned to Omaha and C Jorge Fabregas was
designated for assignment. ... One night after getting a
season-high 19 hits in Boston, the Royals got only four on Friday
against the Pirates. ... Pittsburgh native Jason Rakers always
wanted to pitch at Three Rivers Stadium. On Friday, he did, but
gave up five runs in the eighth inning and let a 4-3 deficit get
out of reach. Rakers got in trouble by walking the first two
hitters, then was the victim of some well-placed hits. ''He's a
control pitcher so the two walks were very uncharacteristic,''
manager Tony Muser said. ''Nerves were undoubtedly a factor as
Rakers' parents and friends were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: How did interim manager Rick Renick celebrate
Friday's win? ''I went home and went to bed,'' Renick said. He
filled in for Gene Lamont, who was in Florida for his daughter's
high school graduation. The win goes on Lamont's record, even
though he was more than 1,000 miles away because of the baseball
policy on keeping stats for managers. ... 3B Aramis Ramirez has hit
.383 in 30 games since he was sent to Triple-A Nashville. His
recall to the Pirates is not imminent, though. The organization
wants to see some adjustments in Ramirez's swing that will let him
drive the ball with more authority. In his absence, the club is
getting by with a combination of veteran utility players, Luis Sojo
and Mike Banjamin.
Devil Rays-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays began the night 0-10 in games started
by opposing left-handers. LHP Al Leiter started for the Mets. ...
Fred McGriff needed two hits to reach No. 2,000 in his career. He
hit his 400th home run Friday night. ... LF Greg Vaughn was back in
the starting lineup for the first time since leaving a game May 26
with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: C Mike Piazza was back in the starting lineup for the
first time since being cut on the forehead by Gary Sheffield's
backswing Wednesday night in Los Angeles. Piazza spent part of
Friday at a hospital getting a CAT scan after feeling groggy. For
the first time this season, Piazza was wearing the hockey-style
catcher's mask, which affords more protection. He wore it a few
times last season. ... IF-OF Lenny Harris joined the Mets, a day
after they got him from Arizona for LHP Bill Pulsipher. Harris was
popular when he played for the Mets in 1998, and was all smiles as
he renewed acquaintances. He was given the former locker of another
talkative player no longer with the team -- Rickey Henderson. To
make room for Harris, the Mets optioned C Vance Wilson to Triple-A
Norfolk.
Red Sox-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The condition of Pedro Martinez's strained left ribcage
remained the same and the two-time Cy Young award winner is
expected to make his next start on June 8 when Boston hosts
Cleveland in a makeup game. ... 2B Jeff Frye has batted in every
spot in the order except fourth this season. ... The Red Sox
optioned RHP John Wasdin to Triple-A Pawtucket and recalled RHP Rob
Stanifer. Wasdin was 0-2 with a 4.56 ERA in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 3B Scott Rolen, who sprained his left ankle on May
23, is responding to treatment and expected to return to the lineup
on June 9. ... LHP Scott Aldred, who has a tear in his right
shoulder, will likely have season-ending surgery within the next
week.
Twins-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Midre Cummings is more than halfway to the team
record for pinch-hits in a season. His two-run single Friday night
made him 10-for-22. The team record is 19 by Chip Hale in 1996. ...
The rest of the team is 5-for-33 pinch-hitting this season. ...
Sean Bergman gave up a first-inning homer to Barry Larkin on
Saturday, the sixth he'd allowed to right-handed hitters this
season. He's also given up six to left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Michael Tucker, in a 9-for-11 spurt, was in left
field for a second straight day in place of Dmitri Young, in a
5-for-40 slump. ... Barry Larkin's first-inning homer Saturday was
only his second hit in 16 at-bats. ... The Reds are one of only
three teams without a complete game (San Diego and Kansas City are
the other two).
Yankees-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: C Jorge Posada took a foul ball off his right knee in
the second inning and had to leave the game. X-rays were negative
and Posada was listed as day-to-day. Paul O'Neill also had to leave
in the sixth because of soreness in his lower right leg. He was
replaced by Shane Spencer. ... Derek Jeter tied his career high
with four hits, the 11th time he has done it. The SS had a chance
to break the mark but walked in the seventh and the ninth. He had
reached base seven straight times since Friday, with five hits and
two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Manager Bobby Cox missed the game to attend the high
school graduation of his daughter Skyla. He was replaced by bench
coach Pat Corrales. ... 3B coach Ned Yost arrived at the clubhouse
in a coat and tie after attending the graduation of his son, Ned
Yost IV. The teen-ager, a baseball star at suburban Lassiter High,
will attend the University of Georgia next season. ... Relief
pitcher Greg McMichael said it will be at least four weeks before
he throws again, not two weeks as the team reported Friday.
McMichael, who went on the DL retroactive to May 28, has a slight
tear in his right rotator cuff, a similar injury to the one that
required surgery in October. The team hopes surgery will not be
required this time. ... Fernando Lunar had his first RBI with a
groundout.
White Sox-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: There is a reason the Chicago White Sox are winning
this season. ''Chemistry,'' Frank Thomas said. ''It's as simple as
that. We've got 25 guys here defending the house and if somebody
breaks in we'll fight them together. We have 25 guys here that love
each other. Everyone picks up each other. I've been on a lot of
ballclubs, but this one here I have a special feeling about.''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Shane Reynolds allowed only one earned run in taking
his second straight loss on Friday, but that's been happening to
him all season. He's allowed two or fewer earned runs in eight of
his 12 starts and the Astros are 3-5 in those eight games. ''It's
kind of unbelievable,'' he said. ''We're in a place right now where
a lot of us haven't ever been. The ball's just not bouncing our
way. Nobody likes this. It's just something we've got to work on.''
Indians-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Jim Thome and Manny Ramirez, who's on the DL with a
strained left hamstring, are moving up the team's career home run
list. Entering Saturday night's game, they were tied for sixth at
211. Andre Thornton is fifth at 214. ... The Indians had used 19
pitchers, including five rookies. That figure does not include
Scott Sanders, who started a rainout against Detroit May 18. ...
The three hits the Indians got against Darryl Kile and two
relievers Friday were a season low. ... The Indians are considering
trying Russell Branyan, called up from Triple-A Buffalo on Tuesday,
in right or left field. Manager Charlie Manuel doesn't think it
would take Branyan, a third baseman in the minors, to adapt.
Branyan hit .253 with 16 homers and 46 RBis in 41 games at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Fernando Vina had his right elbow wrapped in the
clubhouse before Saturday night's game, the spot where he got hit
by a pitch for the major league-leading 13th time the night before.
He led the AL with 25 hit by pitches in 1998. ''I don't move out of
the way, I hold my ground,'' Vina said. ''Sometimes that's smart
and sometimes it's not smart. You've got to be careful because it
can knock you out for a while.'' ... An official scoring change
removed an error from Vina, who ranged far to his right to glove
Jim Thome's smash in the sixth, but then bobbled the ball. ''In my
eyes, I went a long ways to even get in front of that ball,'' said
Vina, who has one error and had a 59-game errorless streak stopped
last month. ''Most guys don't even get in front of that, and he
didn't hit a 20-hopper.'' ... The Cardinals failed to homer Friday
night for only the eighth time in 54 games. They lead the majors
with 100 homers, 11 more than runnerup Toronto.
Diamondbacks-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Arizona had lost three consecutive one-run games on the
road before Friday's 5-4 victory over the Rangers. ... The
Diamondbacks have not lost more than three games in a row since
June 20-23 last year when they lost four in a row. ... Friday's
starter Brian Anderson has faced 115 batters without allowing a
walk. He also had a stretch of 156 batters in his last six starts
of 1998. ... LHP Bill Pulsipher, who Arizona acquired from the Mets
on Friday in a trade for Lenny Harris, was designated for
assignment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Texas put CF Ruben Mateo on the 15-day DL after the
rookie broke his right leg in Friday's game. He will miss the rest
of the season after a rod was surgically inserted in his femur. ...
Manager Johnny Oates said Gabe Kapler, still nursing a quadriceps
injury, will likely play center in Mateo's absence. ... The Rangers
purchased the contract of OF Scott Podsednik from Tulsa of the
Texas League Saturday. His stay will be short as Texas plans to
bring up a pitcher Monday to fill injured Darren Oliver's spot in
the rotation.
Padres-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: With two hits Friday night against the Seattle
Mariners, Tony Gwynn raised his career batting average as a DH to
.205. In nine career games as a DH, Gwynn was 8-for-39 with four
doubles and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: RHP Jose Mesa hasn't pitched for the Mariners since his
disastrous eighth inning in Tampa Bay last Sunday, but he will
soon. Manager Lou Piniella said before Saturday night's game
between Seattle and San Diego that he still has confidence in the
Mariners' former closer. ''He's been working with our pitching
coach with altering his delivery,'' Piniella said. ''Bryan (Price)
told me yesterday he was ready for game action again. So we'll get
him back in there.''
Giants-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Ellis Burks was held out of Saturday's game
because of sore knees. ''He's a little sore today,'' Giants manager
Dusty Baker said. ''I also didn't like the matchup and wanted more
left-handed bats in the lineup.'' ... 1B J.T. Snow was scratched
from the starting lineup with the stomach flu. ... C Doug Mirabelli
was also scratched from the lineup with irritation in his right
eye. He was taken to San Francisco's St. Francis Hospital to be
examined by the team eye doctor. ... With Friday night's 5-4 loss
to the A's, the Giants fell to 3-12 in one-run games. ''I woke up
mad this morning,'' Baker said. ''I'm tired of losing one-run
games. I'm sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's presented their all-Century team before
Saturday's game. The Manager of the Century, Connie Mack, was
represented by his daughter Ruth Mack-Clark, 86, who made her first
trip to the Coliseum for the presentation. She said her father
would probably like the current home run pace. ''He'd be happy to
have them hit home runs,'' said Mack-Clark. ''I'm sure he would
like it.'' Mack-Clark used to drive her father to and from the
ballpark and ''learned a lot about baseball. He taught me how to
keep score and he'd write 'K' for a strikeout because it was like a
knockout, and he was a big boxing fan too.'' Mack-Clark said
current A's first baseman Jason Giambi reminded her of former
Philadelphia A's slugger Jimmie Foxx, another member of the
all-Century team. ... Rickey Henderson was named Player of the
Century for the A's and was scheduled to attend the presentation,
but a bad back forced him to cancel plans. ... The A's activated DH
John Jaha from the 15-day DL before the game and sent 3B Adam Piatt
to Triple-A Sacramento of the PCL.
Dodgers-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers placed OF Geronimo Berroa on the 15-day
DL with a bruised left foot and designated left-handed reliever
Trever Miller for assignment. They also purchased the contract of
left-hander Onan Masaoka from Triple-A Albuquerque. ... Going into
Saturday's game against Anaheim, the Dodgers were the only NL team
with five players who have at least nine homers -- Gary Sheffield
(15), Eric Karros (15), Todd Hundley (13), Shawn Green (10), and
Kevin Elster (9).
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: SS Kevin Stocker, just acquired from Tampa Bay, dropped
a popup for an error on the first ball he handled. Stocker had made
seven errors in his last three games with Tampa Bay, and has 12
this season. ... Going into Saturday's game against the Dodgers,
the Angels led the AL in team batting at .292 after ranking last in
the league in 1999 at .256.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Rockies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Tom Goodwin is on pace to steal a club-record 64
bases. The mark is held by Eric Young (53). ... Colorado
left-handed relievers have been outstanding. Brian Bohanon, Mike
Myers and Gabe White are a combined 8-0 with a 1.57 ERA out of the
bullpen. ... Utility INF Aaron Ledesma turned 29 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Milwaukee called up Santiago Perez from Triple-A
Indianapolis to take the roster spot of Mark Loretta, who went on
the 15-day disabled list Friday with a broken bone in his left
foot. Perez was batting .291 with two homers and 18 RBIs for the
Indians. Loretta has never been on the major league disabled list.
He had played an average of 142 games a year in his first three
full major league seasons. ... The Brewers are the wildest team in
the majors. They average 5.21 walks per game; second is Cincinnati
at 4.72.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Mateo Out For Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers placed center fielder
Ruben Mateo on the 15-day disabled list Saturday, a day after the
rookie broke his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo had surgery Friday night to have a rod placed in his femur
and will miss the rest of the season. He missed the final two
months of last season after surgery to repair a broken bone in his
left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was real quiet, but he seemed to be doing well,'' said
Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who visited Mateo at the hospital
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us to win tonight, wished us good luck,'' Oates said.
''What a great kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers filled Mateo's spot by purchasing the contract of
outfielder Scott Podsednik from Tulsa of the Texas League, but his
stay will be shortlived.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Podsednik will be sent back down Monday when Texas
brings up a pitcher to fill Darren Oliver's spot in the rotation.
Oliver was scheduled to start Monday against the Dodgers, but will
rest after complaining of soreness in his left shoulder. He is
slated to return June 11 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also transferred left-hander Justin Thompson from the 15-
to the 60-day disabled list. He is out for the season following
shoulder surgery last month.

<HEADLINE> Williams Wins NCAA 100 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Florida's Bernard Williams still has the
edge over Auburn's Coby Miller at 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who beat the more heralded Miller in the Southeastern
Conference meet last month, did it again in the NCAA Championships
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, last year's Pan American Games gold medalist, blasted
out of the blocks first and never was caught, finishing in 10.03
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who beat Williams by 0.01 seconds in Friday night's
semifinals at 9.98, the second-fastest time in the world this year,
wound up second in the final at 10.14.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's Terrence Trammell, the NCAA indoor champion in
the 60 dash and 60 hurdles, and winner of the 110 hurdles 50
minutes before the sprint final, fell short in an attempt for
another sweep. He finished seventh in the 100 at 10.30.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's Angela Williams completed a sprint sweep
for the unrelated Williams' by winning the women's 100 at 11.12,
the fastest by a collegian this season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke out quickly and was in command all the way,
beating LSU's Peta-Gaye Dowdie by 0.11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I would have to get out good,'' Williams, last year's
Pan American Games gold medalist, said after winning her second
straight NCAA title. ''... I knew Peta-Gaye would be coming up on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 110 hurdles, Trammell, competing despite a
troublesome left hamstring, won his second straight title, beating
Indiana State's Aubrey Herring at 13.43.
</P>
<P>
   Trammell, the world leader at 13.30 -- which he has run twice -
and Herring, the Missouri Valley Conference champion, came to the
final hurdle virtually even. But Trammell came off with more
acceleration and won the race to the finish. Herring was second at
13.49.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Bates helped propel LSU into contention in the women's
team race, winning the women's 100 hurdles with a career-best
12.85. In winning, Bates, the 1999 NCAA indoor champion, beat
Houston's Joyce Adams, the outdoor long jump champion, and Ohio
State's Donica Merriman, who set the stadium record of 12.83 in
Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was first out of the blocks and maintained an advantage
the rest of the way. Adams finished second at 12.91 and Merriman,
who was late out of the blocks, was third at 12.92.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was very confident moments before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was at the starting blocks and I was just seeing my
race, I had this feeling I was going to win,'' she said. ''Right
there, I claimed it.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was at the seventh hurdle, I knew I had her (Merriman).
It was this overwhelming feeling in my body. Instead of running
through the finish line, I just threw my hands up. I'm glad she
didn't catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Avard Moncur charged into the lead coming off the final
turn and went to a four-meter victory over Florida's Geno White in
the men's 400 at 44.72, matching the third-fastest in the world and
setting a school record. Oklahoma's Michael Blackwood, the world
leader at 44.69, never was seriously in contention and finished
fifth at 45.11.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Barber, last year's runner-up in the women's 400, led a 1-2
South Carolina finish this time. Barber, the women's national
collegiate track athlete of the year, took the lead at the halfway
point and beat teammate Demetria Washington by about nine meters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, UTEP freshman Angeliki Tsiolakoudi, the latest in a
line of Greek athletes recruited by UTEP, won the women's javelin
at 197 feet, 8 inches, tying her collegiate record ... sort of.
</P>
<P>
   While the distance was the same in feet and inches that
Tsiolakoudi's best throw measured May 6 in El Paso, Texas, there
was a two-centimeter difference in the metric measurement.
Saturday's metric distance was 60.24, last month's 60.26. The
conversion is the same for both.

<HEADLINE> GOP candidates seek attention, support, after debates showing some contrasts </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The Republican candidates for U.S. Senate
are hitting the streets and mailboxes this weekend and, in the case
of the two perceived front-runners, the TV airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is an effort to wake voters up about Tuesday's primary,
to win recognition, to denounce each other and -- perhaps toughest
of all -- to swim against the tide of Democrat Jon Corzine's $33
million spending spree as he tries to win the primary on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard to get heard through all of that,'' said state Sen.
William Gormley, R-Atlantic, one of the GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley's chief GOP opponent, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley
Heights, agreed: ''His spending is obscene. There is no other way
to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, however, is not intimidated by Corzine
himself as a potential November opponent should he defeat former
Gov. Jim Florio Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican chairman, Garabed Haytaian, said Corzine's
lavish ads have detailed an ultra-liberal agenda for giant federal
programs that are budget-busters and will make easy targets for the
GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all is said and done, we don't have to do a whole lot of
opposition research on those guys. They'll have done it for us,''
Haytaian said.
</P>
<P>
   Also chasing the GOP nomination are Essex County executive Jim
Treffinger and Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin. Treffinger
is a former Democrat now veering to the right of the frontrunners,
and Sabrin, who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1997,
outflanks them all on the conservative wing, with backing from the
anti-abortion and gun-owner lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley stand as the perceived front-runners by
virtue of their moderate views, their county endorsements, in which
Franks has an edge, and their money, in which Gormley has an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger has joined the leaders by raising more than $1
million and has firm support in Essex and Passaic counties, but
political analysts said he has made little headway outside that
base.
</P>
<P>
   All three are recognized members of the Republican Party and so
have tried to dismiss Sabrin as a renegade outsider with extremist
views. Sabrin has spent much of the primary campaign downplaying
positions he took in the 1997 gubernatorial campaign with regard to
the national libertarian platform, which opposes criminal laws
against drug use, prostitution and other ''victimless'' crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sabrin still holds the libertarian view that
individual communities should decide whether activities such as
prostitution are legal or illegal -- but he doesn't espouse that
opinion unless asked.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has been after Gormley over his links to Florio, to
Democratic tax increases and to casino money, and Gormley has been
after Franks over his hesitation on New Jersey's ban on
semi-automatic rifles and on the Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And Treffinger and Sabrin have been at each other sharply in the
contest for conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But through the course of five debates, Franks, Gormley and
Treffinger were parallel more often than not, differing mostly in
their appeal for credibility. Sabrin, the odd man out on
organizational support, was often the odd man out on ideology as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Five debates over the past four weeks did highlight some
distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger and Gormley attacked Franks for his support of a
House bill giving land owners the right to sue in federal court
when local regulations impair the resale value of their property.
They said it would diminish local authority to manage land use.
Franks said it was a fairness issue.
</P>
<P>
   Franks last week said he had opposed New Jersey's semi-automatic
weapons ban because it took away guns that had been lawfully
purchased. Gormley and Treffinger supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley opposed school vouchers. Franks said they were a good
idea but the federal government should not have a hand in it.
Treffinger supported federal school vouchers in troubled school
districts, claiming they would actually save tax dollars because
private school tuition is cheaper than the per-pupil cost in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin denounced his three Republican opponents as hypocritical
for opposing the medical procedure opponents call ''partial birth
abortion'' while sanctioning other forms of abortion. It also hard
to recall any Republican candidate more dedicated to gun rights
than Sabrin, who believes a well-armed citizenry would reduce
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sabrin made provocative remarks in each of the GOP's
five debates. Before a live audience at the Jewish Community Center
of West Orange last week, Sabrin said he was so troubled by the
overgrowth of federal bureaucracy, he feared the nation was headed
toward totalitarianism comparable to the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knew Hitler was coming? But he did come,'' Sabrin said,
and several in the audience gasped at the analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin also denounced affirmative action as a form of ''racial
profiling,'' and he said NATO air strikes against the Serbs were
criminal. ''We actually killed more people with our own bombs than
the Serbians killed in Kosovo,'' he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Rose Art Says Talc Not in Crayons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Rose Art, the second-leading maker of crayons in
the United States, said it no longer uses talc as a strengthening
agent in its crayons.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported last month that Rose Art
and other crayons contained asbestos, presumably from talc.
Saturday, the newspaper said Rose Art crayons purchased and tested
Friday contained no cancer-causing asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier tests of 32 of 40 crayons by Rose Art, Crayola and Prang
brands found tremolite and anthophyllite asbestos, the newspaper
had said. Lab analysts said the asbestos may have been introduced
in the talc, a mineral that helps bind crayons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know whether there is asbestos or not in the talc, but
I do know that we no longer used talc in our crayons,'' said Rose
Art president Lawrence Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said the company stopped using talc 15 months ago not
because of health concerns but because ''it made a better, smoother
drawing crayon.''
</P>
<P>
   Crayola and Prang have said there is no asbestos in their
crayons.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission will release
findings of its crayon analysis late next week, spokesman Russ
Rader said.

<HEADLINE> Reds 9, Twins 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin and Ken Griffey Jr., raised on
Big Red Machine lore, homered Saturday as Cincinnati beat the
Minnesota Twins 9-3 on a night dedicated to past champions.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette also hit a home run as the modern-day Reds donned
double-knit uniforms and low-stirrup socks to honor their 1975
World Series champions -- and then did that team proud.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle (5-0) remained unbeaten since last Aug. 30, a span
of 19 starts, by giving up four hits in seven innings. He also
singled with the bases loaded to spark the go-ahead rally in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds introduced their 1975 World Series championship team
along the first baseline before the game and inducted manager
Sparky Anderson and shortstop Davey Concepcion into their Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ovations and the banners were for Pete Rose, who was
barred from the festivities because of his lifetime ban for
gambling. When the '75 team took its positions on the field, Larkin
-- a Cincinnati native -- jogged to Rose's unoccupied spot at third
and placed a single red rose on the base.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin again revved up the 45,617 fans by hitting a two-run
homer in the bottom of the first off Sean Bergman (3-4), who had
another rough outing. Bergman gave up seven runs in four innings,
pushing his earned run average to 9.59.
</P>
<P>
   After the Twins pulled ahead 3-2 in the third on Jay Canizaro's
first homer of the season, Neagle helped the Reds go ahead to stay
in the fourth. Bergman walked the bases loaded and Neagle tied it
with a two-out infield single up the middle. Pokey Reese's single
made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, whose father, Ken Sr., was introduced as part of the
'75 team, ended his 0-for-18 slump with an opposite-field homer
leading off the fifth. Griffey has 15 homers and 39 RBIs to go with
his .210 average.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette hit the next pitch for his third homer in three games
and his eighth overall, ending Bergman's outing. It was the first
time that Griffey and Bichette have hit consecutive homers.
</P>
<P>
   While Griffey has slumped, Bichette has become the Reds' hottest
hitter, going 12-for-26 during a seven-game streak. Bichette is
8-for-12 in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin also drove in a run in the sixth with his first triple of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle made his 200th career start and his first against the
team that drafted him in the third round in June 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Since a 5-2 loss to Atlanta last Aug. 25, Neagle has gone 11-0
in 19 starts with a 2.95 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, a National Leaguer the past four seasons, doubled and
struck out, leaving Twins pitchers with a hit in each of their
first two interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Twins pitchers went 1-for-18 with eight strikeouts in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota's Matt Lawton batted against Dennys Reyes, who
hit him in the face last June 8, shattering his right cheek and eye
socket. Lawton grounded out in the eighth. ... The Twins have
homered in eight consecutive games for the first time since June
13-21, 1997. ... Shortstop Cristian Guzman bounced a throw to first
to retire Larkin on a groundout in the third, a move that
Concepcion perfected on turf. Concepcion purposely skipped his
ceremonial first pitch to Johnny Bench on one hop before the game.
... The Reds improved to 4-4 on a 12-game homestand that is their
longest of the season.

<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Ted Chronopoulos and John Harkes scored in
the final 20 minutes as the New England Revolution beat the Miami
Fusion 2-0 Saturday night to retain sole possession of first place
in the Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   Chronopolous broke a scoreless tie in the 72nd minute, netting
his fourth goal of the season off Imad Baba's cross. Harkes, a
late-game substitution, clinched victory in the first minute of
injury time by scoring off Mauricio Ramos' free kick.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams had battled to 1-1 ties in their two previous
meetings this season, and a Miami victory Saturday would have left
both teams with 19 standings points. Instead, New England (6-4-4)
has 22 points to 16 for Miami (4-5-4).
</P>
<P>
   New England dominated the first half, outshooting the Fusion 7-0
and gaining a 6-2 advantage in corner kicks, but couldn't put the
ball in the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's Walde Harris and Brian Dunseth both missed
scoring chances in the final five minutes of the first half while
Johnny Torres put a shot off the top of the right crossbar 10
minutes after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Jeff Causey, who has played every minute of every
match this season for New England, made one save for his second
shutout of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Miami played without midfielder Pablo Mastroeni, who was serving
a red-card accumulation suspension.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Make New Demands  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fijian coup leader George Speight resumed
meetings Sunday with the country's military rulers to discuss his
latest demands for the release of more than 30 hostages being held
in the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting outside the Fijian capital of Suva was the first
chance the two sides have had to discuss a nine-point plan Speight
issued Friday for ending the crisis. The plan, however, appeared to
push a peaceful resolution further away than at any time since he
and six gunmen stormed parliament on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   After saying Friday he would free the hostages over the weekend,
Speight on Saturday accused the military, which has assumed power
in recent days, of dealing in bad faith. He set out his new
demands, ruling out freedom for the hostages -- including deposed
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and most of his government -- until
the military transfers its government powers to Fiji's influential
tribal chiefs in this Pacific Ocean nation 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview recorded Saturday with an Australian television
current affairs show, Speight gave an indication of why he had the
confidence to repeatedly issue new demands during negotiations to
end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on Channel Nine's ''Sunday'' program if he thought
the army would tire of the standoff and move against the
hostage-takers, Speight said: ''The army will never attack Fijians.
Never.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had offered his four female hostages freedom on
Saturday but they refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked the ladies today ... if they wished to go home today,
or sometime this weekend,'' Speight said. ''And they chose not to.
They want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who claims to be acting on behalf of Fiji's indigenous
majority, accused the country's new military regime of wrecking a
plan to end the hostage crisis and lashed out against Fijians of
Indian ancestry -- including the ousted prime minister -- as ''our
common enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman said the government of Commodore Frank
Bainimarama had been consistent in dealing with Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman accused Speight of prolonging the crisis, now in
its third week, by making fresh demands.
</P>
<P>
   Speight also issued a demand that would seem unthinkable to the
many Fijians who hold their chiefs in high regard -- telling the
Great Council of Chiefs that it would have to name Speight ally
Ratu Jope Seniloli as president. He would then choose a government,
presumably including Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Speight threw Fiji into turmoil on May 19, storming parliament
along with six gunmen and taking the government hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The military eventually took charge, declared martial law and
threw out a constitution that granted equal rights to Fiji's ethnic
Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, among those still held in the parliamentary complex,
had been the first ethnic Indian to serve as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new round of disagreements, Speight said Saturday he
wants to keep negotiating with Bainimarama, the military ruler,
also an ethnic Fijian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want Fijians fighting Fijians -- our common enemy is
the Indians,'' Speight said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ethnic Fijians agree.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people, many of them indigenous, turned out at a rally
in western Fiji on Saturday to express support for Chaudhry's
government and to condemn Speight.
</P>
<P>
   The west is Fiji's economic heart, with most of the sugarcane
fields, some small gold mines and the better tourist resorts.
</P>
<P>
   A tribal chief, Ratu Sairusi Naganigavoka, told the crowd that
if Speight takes control of Suva, the capital to the east, then
western Fiji should break away.
</P>
<P>
   Military roadblocks have cut off supplies to the parliamentary
complex where the hostages are held, and Speight's men have been
coming out to rob nearby homes, plunder garden crops and kill
cattle. There have been frequent skirmishes between Speight
supporters and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Nations including the United States, Australia and New Zealand
have threatened to impose economic sanctions if Fiji doesn't return
to democratic rule.

<HEADLINE> Thief Stole British Defense laptop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A thief stole the laptop computer of the
government minister in charge of Britain's nuclear policy, but it
did not contain defense information, the Ministry of Defense said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry was responding to a report in the Sunday People
tabloid that the computer had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The incident March 25 was one of a series of laptop losses from
government and military officials that prompted a review of
security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the thief smashed a window at the home of armed
forces minister John Spellar in Bromley, southern England, and took
the laptop but did not touch the two red official government boxes
in the house that contained defense information.
</P>
<P>
   ''No attempt was made to open or remove them,'' a ministry
spokesman said on customary terms of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer held only information about the legislator's
electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Spellar is in charge of nuclear policy and has responsibility
for the military's role in Northern Ireland, and defense
intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, a laptop containing training information for
MI6, the spy agency responsible for foreign intelligence, was lost
by an intelligence officer and recovered by police two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, a second laptop with classified material on
Northern Ireland was snatched from a security service officer at
London's Paddington Station when the officer put it down to buy a
train ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, a naval officer lost his computer and his personal
luggage after boarding a train at Paddington station. It did not
contain classified information, the spokesman said.

   The ministry was responding to a report in the Sunday People
tabloid that the computer had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The incident March 25 was one of a series of laptop losses from
government and military officials that prompted a review of
security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the thief smashed a window at the home of armed
forces minister John Spellar in Bromley, southern England, and took
the laptop but did not touch the two red official government boxes
in the house that contained defense information.
</P>
<P>
   ''No attempt was made to open or remove them,'' a ministry
spokesman said on customary terms of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer held only information about the legislator's
electoral constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Spellar is in charge of nuclear policy and has responsibility
for the military's role in Northern Ireland, and defense
intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, a laptop containing training information for
MI6, the spy agency responsible for foreign intelligence, was lost
by an intelligence officer and recovered by police two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, a second laptop with classified material on
Northern Ireland was snatched from a security service officer at
London's Paddington Station when the officer put it down to buy a
train ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, a naval officer lost his computer and his personal
luggage after boarding a train at Paddington station. It did not
contain classified information, the spokesman said.

   MONTREAL (AP) -- Geoff Blum matched his career high with three
RBIs, including a two-run homer, and Vladimir Guerrero hit his 16th
home run as the Montreal Expos beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-4
Saturday night for their fourth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore lost its 19th straight game in Canada despite a
two-run homer by Albert Belle and back-to-back homers in the fourth
by B.J. Surhoff and Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, starting at second base in place of injured Jose Vidro,
hit an RBI double in the third and homered in the fifth off Pat
Rapp (4-3) to raise Montreal's record at Olympic Stadium to 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter T.J. Tucker, called up from Double-A Harrisburg to
make an emergency start, allowed four runs and six hits in four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal reliever Felipe Lira (1-0) didn't allow a run despite
facing seven batters in one-plus innings for his first NL win. Lira
allowed two hits and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline pitched the ninth for his third straight save and
fourth in five chances, send Baltimore to its fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro missed his first start of the season due to a sprained
ligament in his right middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal raised its record to 28-23 in interleague play,
including 18-7 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Belle homered for the second straight game, a two-run shot in
the third, his eighth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker got an infield single in his first major league at-bat
leading off the third and scored on Peter Bergeron's triple as
Montreal closed to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff's homer tied it in the fourth and Johnson's homer put
Baltimore ahead 4-3. Blum's second homer of the season gave the
Expos a 5-4 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit a solo homer in the seventh off Al Reyes and
Orlando Cabrera connected in the eighth off Mike Trombley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Orioles manager Mike Hargrove missed the game and will also
miss Sunday's series finale in order to attend his son Andy's high
school graduation in Cleveland. Bench coach Jeff Newman is
substituting for Hargrove. ... The Orioles are 12-25 since April
22, when they were a season-high six games over .500. ... Belle has
hit safely in 27 of his last 30 games, going 38-for-115 (.330) over
that stretch. ... SS Mike Bordick has started each of Baltimore's
53 games. ... Blum drove in three runs last Sept. 15 at Los
Angeles. ... Vidro, who injured his finger two weeks ago while
diving back to first base, received a cortisone shot before the
game and is expected to miss three games. ... RHP starter Mike
Thurman was given a cortisone shot in his injured right elbow
Saturday. Thurman is on the 15-day disabled list because of
tendinitis for the second time this season.

<HEADLINE> Shock 77, Monarchs 74  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Detroit rookie Edwina Brown scored
three of her nine points in the final minute to help the Shock open
the season with a 77-74 victory over the Sacramento Monarchs on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith had 24 points and eight rebounds for the
Monarchs (1-1), who consider themselves a threat to dethrone
Houston as WNBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs, who never led in the second half, had a chance to
take a one-point lead, but Ruthie Bolton-Holifield missed two free
throws with 1:24 remaining, allowing Detroit to cling to a 72-71
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's Ticha Penicheiro drove the lane with 34.7 seconds
left, but was denied by the Shock's Dominique Canty.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs got yet another chance when, following a timeout,
Detroit's Elena Tornikidou threw the ball away on the inbounds
play.
</P>
<P>
   But Canty got the best of Penicheiro on another attempt to drive
the lane, this time knocking the ball away. Tornikidou came up with
the loose ball and Brown, a first-round draft pick out of Texas,
sank two free throws for a three-point lead with 18.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Tornikidou, who led Detroit with 18 points, made two free throws
for a 76-71 lead with 8.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Penicheiro made it a two-point game again with on a 3-pointer
with 2.2 seconds remaining, but Brown hit a free throw with 1.2
left to ice it for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs, who were sluggish in the first half of their
opening victory against the expansion Seattle Storm on Wednesday,
fell behind early in the first half of this game, too.
</P>
<P>
   Astou Ndiaye-Diatta pulled down eight rebounds, helping Detroit
to a 19-15 edge in rebounds in the first 20 minutes. That helped
the Shock, who outrebounded Sacramento 34-26 for the game, to a
15-9 edge in fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   With Tornikidou directing the floor game and scoring 12 points,
mostly in transition, the Shock opened a 10-point lead late in the
half and led 45-37 at the break. It also helped that Detroit made
10 free throws while the Monarchs, who didn't get to the line until
the final minute of the half, made only two.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento came to life to start the second half, however.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, the WNBA's most valuable player last season, scored
four points as the Monarchs opened the half with a 10-4 burst,
closing the gap to 49-47 with 16:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs tied it 51-51 on a jumper by Bolton-Holifield less
than two minutes later.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal homered twice and drove in
five runs as the Philadelphia Phillies sent the Boston Red Sox to
their fourth straight loss, 9-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Pedro Martinez scratched because of a sore left ribcage,
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield (1-4) made his third start of the
season for Boston, which matched its longest losing streak of the
season. Wakefield gave up all six runs -- four earned -- and seven
hits in 4 2-3 innings and Boston dropped to 5-7 against
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal had an RBI single in the third, a solo homer in the
sixth and a three-run shot in the eighth off Rob Stanifer.
Lieberthal, who has seven homers this year, had his first
multihomer game of the season, the fifth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf (5-3), coming off a six-hitter against Los Angeles, struck
out nine in seven innings, allowing two runs, three hits and four
walks. He gave up Carl Everett's RBI single in the fourth, and
Nomar Garciaparra's leadoff homer in the sixth .
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's homer was the 100th of his career. He is 12-for-20
in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia went ahead in the first inning when Lieberthal's
one-out grounder went right through the legs of third baseman
Wilton Veras, allowing Kevin Sefcik to score from second on the
error.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia made it 3-0 in the third after Doug Glanville led
off with a single and stole second, and Bobby Abreu reached on a
passed ball as he struck out and the knuckleball eluded catcher
Jason Varitek. Lieberthal and Pat Burrell followed with RBI
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik hit a sacrifice fly in the fourth for a 4-1 lead. After
Lieberthal's homer in the sixth,
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies made it 4-1 in the fourth with a sacrifice fly by
Sefcik, and added two more runs in the sixth on Lieberthal's first
homer and a bases-loaded walk by Glanville.
</P>
<P>
   Boston scored an unearned run in the eighth off Chris Brock on
consecutive errors by shortstop Desi Relaford and Everett's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lieberthal had six RBIs at Montreal on May 19, 1999. ...
Frye was 0-for-4, snapping his 12-game hitting streak. ...
Lieberthal has thrown out four of the last six runners attempting
to steal.

<HEADLINE> Mets 1, Devil Rays 0  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Leiter and three relievers handed Tampa Bay
its first shutout of the season, and the New York Mets took
advantage of a misplayed fly ball to beat the Devil Rays 1-0
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had not been blanked in 85 games -- the longest
streak in the major leagues -- since Cleveland's Charles Nagy and
Mike Jackson did it last Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn, who got lost on a fly ball in left field to account
for the lone run, took a called third strike from Armando Benitez,
ending the game with runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is 0-for-6 with six strikeouts against Benitez. On Friday
night, the Mets closer fanned Vaughn with two on to finish a 5-3
win.
</P>
<P>
   While Leiter (6-1) wound up with the win, Steve Trachsel (3-6)
took the hard-luck loss.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo doubled to start the fourth inning and was still
on second base two outs later when Todd Zeile lofted a high,
catchable fly near the line.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn angled in, then circled around and headed back toward the
wall. He could only watch helplessly as it hit near the bottom of
the fence for an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, starting for the first time since leaving a game May 26
because of a strained right hamstring, stood and stared at a replay
on the scoreboard. He could not blame interleague play for the
misplay -- he roamed the outfield at Shea Stadium while with
Cincinnati and San Diego in the past 3{ years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, with Mike Piazza back in the starting lineup, won for
the sixth time in eight games. Piazza was forced to leave Wednesday
night's game after his head was bloodied by Gary Sheffield's
backswing at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who sustained a slight concussion and needed a stitch,
came out wearing a hockey-style catcher's mask for the first time
this season. He used it a few times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays lost for the 15th time in 20 games, and dropped
to 9-27 in interleague play. They also fell to 0-11 this year when
facing a left-handed starter.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter gave up four singles and worked around five walks, four
of them to Vaughn, in 6 2-3 innings. He struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Dennis Cook ended the seventh by retiring Fred McGriff,
looking for his 2,000th career hit, on a grounder with runners on
first and second.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched a perfect eighth and Benitez finished for
his 15th save in 16 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel lost his fourth straight start, giving up six hits in
seven innings. He is 1-6 in 10 interleague starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: IF-OF Lenny Harris reported to the Mets, a day after they
got him from Arizona for pitcher Bill Pulsipher. Harris, given the
locker formerly used by Rickey Henderson, pinch hit in the seventh
and lined out, stranding runners at first and second. ... Matt
Franco made his first start of the season in left field for the
Mets and caught the only fly ball hit to him. He left after six
innings for defensive replacement Joe McEwing. ... Devil Rays
starters have won only twice in the last 21 games.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' El Duquecito Impresses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- El Duquecito had an impressive debut.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban defector Adrian Hernandez retired his first 12 hitters --
eight on strikeouts -- en route to a three-hit, 13-strikeout
performance over 6 2-3 innings in his U.S. pro debut Saturday night
for the Class=A Tampa Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very good,'' said Hernandez through an interpreter.
''It felt very good to put on the Yankee uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa's 5-1 win over the Fort Myers Miracle in the Florida
State League, the 25-year-old pitcher didn't allow a runner until
Dustan Mohr's leadoff single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle ended Hernandez's shutout bid in the seventh on a
wild pitch. He waved toward the Legends Field crowd of 1,869 as he
departed to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt real emotional when I left the game,'' Hernandez said.
''I like pitching in front of all the people. I'm going to work
real hard for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who walked one, threw 60 of 93 pitches for strikes.
He said he has not been told where is next start will take place,
however, he expects to join Double-A Norwich in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez defected from Cuba on Jan. 2 by sneaking aboard a
plane to Costa Rica. Before Saturday, he had been pitching for the
Yankees' extended spring training team in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year old right-hander said in early April that he had
agreed to a four-year contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is nicknamed El Duquecito because his pitching motion
is similar to that of Orlando Hernandez, another Cuban defector.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque started for the Yankees on Friday night against the
Atlanta Braves. The two are not related but both pitched for Cuba's
top team, Havana Industriales.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tampa Yankees C Michel Hernandez -- who caught Adrian
Hernandez Saturday night -- also defected from Cuba. ... Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner was among the team officials attending
the game. ... In his first U.S. pro start on April. 16, 1998,
Orlando Hernandez allowed two hits and struck out seven in five
shutout innings, in an 11-4 win for the Tampa Yankees against
Kissimmee.

outside the Fijian capital of Suva was the first chance the two sides have had

<HEADLINE> Storm systems leaves thousands without power, cleaning up  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Utility crews and homeowners worked Saturday to clean
up the
damage of a storm system that spawned funnel clouds, downed trees
and knocked out power to tens of thousands across Connecticut.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several accidents were blamed on the storms that moved through
the state Friday evening, including one that killed a 35-year-old
woman in Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dawn Addario, of Southbury, was driving a pickup
truck on Route 67 near the Oxford line about 9 a.m. Saturday when a
tree fell on her vehicle. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities workers, with the aid of 37 crews from
Boston Edison, were working to restore power to the more than
65,000 homes that lost electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of damage,'' said NU spokesman Terrence
McIntosh, adding police in the Fairfield County town of Newtown
alone reported 77 utility poles down. ''That's what's going to take
the most time.''
</P>
<P>
   Danbury, Bethel and Ridgefield also were hard hit with more than
30 percent of homes losing power. As of late Saturday, 19,558
outages remained.

   ''You couldn't see out the window,'' Julie Ball, of East Granby,
told WFSB-TV after reporting hail the size of quarters Friday.
''You couldn't see anything but storm.''
</P>
<P>
   A tornado warning was issued for the Winsted area just before 6
p.m. Friday and funnel clouds were reported in Cheshire, Old
Saybrook and Granby.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Weather Service said no tornadoes touched down
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''A funnel cloud is just a cloud that is rotating,'' said
meteorologist Charlie Foley. ''A tornado is a funnel cloud that
dips to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that contact with the ground that produces devastating
damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cheshire, police Lt. Frank Bradley said damage was isolated
to the northeastern section of town, where trees blocked roads and
the lawns of homes were strewn with tree limbs and debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty bad,'' he said. ''I don't know exactly what hit up
there, but it did significant damage.''

<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- The fifth time was a charm for Melissa Ann
Jeka, Miss Allegheny Valley, who won the Miss Pennsylvania
competition Saturday evening at Lehigh University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm elated,'' said Jeka, 23, of Warminster, Bucks County, who
had entered the Miss Pennsylvania pageant four times before and had
made it to the finals each year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year she was second runner-up, her highest finish before
donning the crown before 800 people as the 2000 winner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the culmination of many tries, and many years of hard
work,'' said Jeka, who will compete in the Miss America competition
on October 14 in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, who also receives a $5,000 scholarship, will sign a
contract at a 10 a.m. breakfast on Sunday morning at a Holiday Inn
in Fogelsville. She said she is not sure what is in store but
promised to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's a job, and I'm going to treat it like a job,'' she
said.''This is a dream come true, so I plan to soak up every bit of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner, who graduated from Archbishop Wood High School and
attended Penn State, danced modern &AMP; classical ballet during the
talent portion of the contest. She hopes to go into public
relations but dreams of dancing on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Jeka wants to use her influence to discourage kids from smoking
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up was Kira Delgado, 23, of Levittown, Miss
Neshaminy, who is studying elementary education at West Chester
University and hopes to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Jeka placed first in Thursday swimsuit competition, while
Delgado won Thursday's talent and Friday's swimsuit competition.
</P>
<P>
   Misty Dawn Clymer, Miss Penn State, was the second runner-up.
Autumn Marisa, Miss Armstrong County, and Nikesha Moore, Miss
Central Pennsylvania, rounded out the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Jeka will try to fill the shoes of 1999-2000 Miss Pennsylvania,
Susan Spafford of Erie, who became the second runner up in Miss
America last year. Spafford's finish was the highest for a
Pennsylvania contestant since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The competition featured 26 contestants, ranging in age from 17
to 24, who qualified during smaller local competitions. Eight
graduated from college in May. All receive at least $200 for
competing.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants compete in four categories: private interview,
swimsuit, evening wear and talent. Each contestant also selects a
platform statement on a social issue. Spafford chose to promote
music education in public schools.

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire broke up Bartolo Colon's no-hit
bid with a seventh-inning single but the Cleveland Indians, behind
home runs from David Justice and Richie Sexson, beat the St. Louis
Cardinals 4-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (6-2) matched his season high with 12 strikeouts and is
4-1 since a stint on the disabled list caused by a pulled muscle.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Jim Edmonds leading off the seventh, then allowed
McGwire's single up the middle, and RBI singles by J.D. Drew and
pinch-hitter Thomas Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Colon allowed just two runners in the first six innings: Edmonds
on a two-out walk in the first and Placido Polanco on Colon's
fielding error with two outs in the fifth. In all, he gave up three
hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay worked the ninth for his 11th save in 13 chances,
sending the Cardinals to their third loss in four games. With
runners at the corners and two outs, Eric Davis fouled out to the
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Stephenson (8-1) allowed four runs and seven hits in
five-plus innings, striking out six. He was attempting to become
the first Cardinals starter since Daffy Dean in 1934 to start a
season 9-0 and the first since Joe Magrane in August 1989 to pitch
three straight complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took a 3-0 lead in the third, ending Stephenson's
18-inning scoreless streak when Roberto Alomar hit an RBI single
and Justice hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson snapped an 0-for-18 slump when homered leading off the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kenny Lofton, who scored the game's first run after a
first-inning double, snapped an 0-for-13 slump. He's 4-for-5 for
his career against Stephenson. ... The Indians are an AL-best 29-22
since interleague play began in 1997. ... The Cardinals have never
been victims of a no-hitter at Busch Stadium, which opened in 1966.
... Stephenson is 14-4 in two seasons with St. Louis. ... Colon
struck out 12 on May 17 against Detroit. ... The teams combined for
25 strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes in the Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A bomb exploded early Sunday outside
the arrival area at Manila's international airport, badly damaging
a public toilet but causing no injuries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, the fifth in the capital area in recent weeks,
dug a crater in the sidewalk outside the women's toilet and ripped
apart its walls. Two women suspects were being interrogated, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred in an area some distance from the main
terminal where passengers are met by relatives and picked up by
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were no signs of shrapnel, indicating that the
bomb was not designed to kill or injure large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   A string of recent explosions in Manila and other parts of the
country have been blamed by police on Muslim rebels who are under
attack by the military in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six Muslims were arrested last week and charged with
involvement in bomb blasts at two Manila shopping malls that killed
one person and injured at least 24 others.
</P>
<P>
   However, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said it was too early
to link the airport explosion with the Muslim insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The military has overrun more than a dozen camps of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   A separate, smaller Muslim rebel group, the Abu Sayyaf, is
holding 21 mostly foreign hostages on the remote island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a grenade exploded outside a Catholic cathedral in
Jolo, causing no injuries and little damage, police said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Chad Curtis hit a two-run homer and
Kenny Rogers pitched six solid innings as the Texas Rangers beat
the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was 0-for-15 when starting in right field before driving
a shot to center in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (5-5) scattered four hits and struck out five. He has
lasted at least six innings in all 11 starts this season and has
allowed three or fewer earned runs in his last four.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 14th save. He has
converted 11 straight chances, a team record.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to ruin the major league debut of Nelson
Figueroa (0-1), who was called up from Triple-A Tucson on Friday.
Figueroa, the 14th pitcher to start a game in Arizona history,
allowed four earned runs on seven hits in 6 1-3 innings. He struck
out two and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, who finished 3-for-4, drove in a run with a single
up the middle in the fourth inning, and Curtis followed with his
seventh home run to make it 3-1 for Texas. Ivan Rodriguez kept the
no-out rally going by reaching on Arizona third baseman Matt
Williams' error, but then was caught trying to steal third.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez twice reached on errors by Williams, who came into the
game with no miscues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley Frias and Jay Bell had consecutive doubles in the third
inning for Arizona's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers retired nine of the next 10 batters before opening the
seventh inning with a four-pitch walk to Williams, followed by a
single by Steve Finley. Turner Ward then hit a run-scoring single
off reliever Tim Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored its final run in the seventh, on Rusty Greer's
groundout to first in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Luis Gonzalez made it 4-3 in the eighth with a
run-scoring double off Crabtree.
Notes: The Rangers' Jason McDonald broke an 0-for-16 slump with a
single to right in the third inning. He finished 2-for-4. ...
Williams has 12 errors the last two seasons, and five have been in
Texas. ... Bell's walk in the sixth inning was his 40th in 55
games. Bell set the team record with 82 last season.
