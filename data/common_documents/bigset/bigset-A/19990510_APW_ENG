<HEADLINE> Brazil's Bebeto May Join MetroStars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Former Brazilian World Cup star  
Bebeto might be headed to Major League Soccer's New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars, his agent said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bebeto is keen to go,'' agent Leo Rabello said. ``I am  
negotiating with a MetroStars representative and he may join them 
in July after the Rio state soccer championship ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabello said the 35-year-old forward wants a two-year contract.  
Under MLS' single-entity ownership structure, all players sign 
contracts with the league, which then assigns them to teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I'd like to say that a player of Bebeto's stature  
is signed and coming to MLS, there are no official negotiations 
that I know of at the present time,'' league spokesman Dan 
Courtemanche said. ``Certainly someone from the MetroStars could 
have talked to Bebeto. Those discussions happen all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bebeto has been booed by some fans of Botafogo, which has  
struggled in this year's state championships. But the team is doing 
far better in the Brazilian Cup and needs just a tie with Atletico 
Parana on Wednesday to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bebeto was quoted as saying Monday that he had received an  
``excellent offer'' from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to think about it calmly, but first I want to give  
Botafogo the Brazil Cup,'' he told the Jornal Do Brasil. 
</P>
<P>
	Bebeto played for Brazil in the last three World Cups.

<HEADLINE> China Cancels US Symphony Concerts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China canceled two concerts by the Boston  
Symphony Orchestra in Beijing, saying the ``barbarous'' NATO 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia ruined the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra planned four performances in Japan and two  
performances in China to celebrate Seiji Ozawa's 25th anniversary 
as music director. Ozawa is Japanese and was born in northeastern 
China when the area was occupied by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	After a performance today in Osaka, Japan, the orchestra had  
been scheduled to perform in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Premier Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin were scheduled to 
attend the concert Thursday in the Great Hall of the People. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're terribly disappointed,'' Boston Symphony Orchestra  
spokeswoman Caroline Smedvig said in Japan. ``We'd planned this for 
a very long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators hurled rocks and debris today into the U.S.  
Embassy in China, trapping American diplomats inside their compound 
in a third day of protests against the bombing, which U.S. 
officials said was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese media reported three people were killed when NATO  
missiles struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on Saturday. More 
than 20 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Performing Arts Agency, the government promoter, said  
in a letter addressed to Ozawa and dated Sunday that the NATO 
bombing made the concerts impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra provided a copy of the letter to The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This barbarous atrocity of NATO has evoked the utmost  
indignation of the Chinese government and people,'' said the letter 
signed by Zhang Yu, general director of China Performing Arts 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``has decided to postpone hosting the tour,'' the  
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smedvig said the orchestra would return to the United States  
on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Queen Amidala Missed 1st Star Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Natalie Portman was far from a ``Star Wars'' fan  
when she landed the role of Queen Amidala in the latest 
installment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born in Israel and I lived there for my first three

	Portman plays a queen who resists invasion of her country in  
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Sunday that she plays a ``strong female character  
that's really good for girls. She has this unembarrassed 
idealism.'' 
</P>

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Washington has no plans to support drug  
crop substitution programs in rebel-controlled areas of Colombia, 
the deputy U.S. drug czar said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's largest guerrilla group is proposing such a project.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that the alternative development is carried out  
in an area that is under government control,'' Thomas Umberg told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. support for a project to wean Colombian peasants off the  
cultivation of coca, the raw material of cocaine, in a 
Switzerland-sized demilitarized zone depends upon the return of 
government troops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Andres Pastrana cleared the southern region of troops  
six months ago to facilitate peace talks with the country's most 
powerful rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, 
or FARC. Last week, government and rebel negotiators agreed on an 
agenda and Pastrana has extended the troop pullout for an undefined 
period.

	LA REALIDAD, Mexico (AP) -- Southern Mexico's Zapatista rebels  
ended a jungle meeting with more than 2,000 supporters Monday after 
asking them to take part in other social struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the Zapatista National Liberation Army urged  
organizers of their national referendum, held in March, to organize 
as supporters of student, worker and farmer struggles ``beyond 
recognition of Indian rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea apparently is to build links to other Mexican protest  
movements. But the meeting ended without a firm statement on the 
results of the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapatista supporters say 3 million people across Mexico cast  
ballots in the unofficial referendum, 95 percent of them expressing 
support for Zapatista positions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a move to build support for the movement, whose rebellion  
against the government has been stalled by a cease-fire since two 
weeks after it started on Jan. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks have been stalled since 1996 over a dispute with the  
government over how to enact constitutional reforms guaranteeing 
Indian rights in Mexico.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela has accepted a proposal by  
Colombia's largest rebel group to take part in that nation's peace 
talks, Venezuela's foreign minister said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia announced Sunday that  
it wants to form an international commission to help advance talks 
aimed at ending Colombia's three-decade civil war. Representatives 
from Venezuela, Mexico, Spain and Costa Rica would make up the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said President  
Hugo Chavez would name Venezuela's representatives this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela hosted two meetings earlier this year between  
Colombian government officials and leaders of the country's 
second-largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- There are reasons to blame the  
pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the 1992 Israeli Embassy bombing, 
Argentina's high court said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Supreme Court of Justice said the court  
believes the attack ``was organized and carried out by the 
terrorist group Islamic Jihad,'' the local news agency Diarios y 
Noticias reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has long contended that Iranian groups were behind that  
attack and a 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center that killed 
95 people. Iran has repeatedly denied involvement. No suspects have 
been detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The court statement also said its evidence pointed to an  
explosion originating outside the embassy, and not within the 
embassy as some earlier reports suggested. The attack killed 29 
people.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- Officials evacuated three small  
villages near the base of the Volcano of Fire Monday in 
west-central Mexico after it blasted out ash and glowing rock. 
</P>
<P>
	The crater, one of three at the Colima Volcano complex, has been  
intermittently active over recent months, sometimes shoving out 
slow-moving lava as well as ash and rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalisco state officials said they had evacuated 160 people from  
the villages of Juan Barragan, Los Machos and El Acostadero after 
the eruption.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan authorities said Monday  
they will ask Colombia to protect truck drivers who are waging a 
strike along the border and paralyzing commerce between the 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers in the Venezuelan state Tachira charge that Colombian  
drivers are taking away their business and that operating in 
Colombia is too dangerous because of leftist rebels and other armed 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is elemental that Venezuelan drivers be given protection.  
They should enjoy the same protection that Colombian drivers get in 
Venezuela,'' said Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck drivers say regulations implemented by the Andean  
Community trade block have allowed Colombian drivers to monopolize 
transport between the two countries. The Colombians pick up food 
and goods in Colombia and then transport them throughout Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan drivers want the opportunity to pick up goods  
themselves in Cucuta, a city on the Colombian side of the border.

<HEADLINE>  Apple Unveils New PowerBook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. interim CEO Steve  
Jobs gave computer programmers a taste of the future Monday, 
unveiling a faster and more powerful PowerBook laptop for 
professionals, new speech recognition software and a deal to sell 
the popular iMac desktop computers at Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a better time to be a Mac  
developer,'' Jobs told more than 2,500 programmers at Apple's 
annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The new PowerBook G3 is 20 percent thinner and almost two pounds  
lighter than its predecessor. The top models, selling for $3,500, 
come with DVD players and batteries that last up to 5 hours, 
allowing users to watch entire movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said that Dragon Systems Inc. is creating  
Macintosh-compatible products based on Dragon NaturallySpeaking, 
the top-selling retail speech recognition software. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragon Systems Janet Baker said their company has received many  
requests for a Macintosh version. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heinz Berendes, a researcher at the National  
Institutes of Health who did groundbreaking work on the safety of 
contraception, died Thursday of prostate cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	A pediatrician and epidemiologist, Berendes joined NIH in 1961.  
Early in his career, he directed the Collaborative Perinatal 
Project, the largest effort of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	He also conducted studies on perinatal health in the Middle  
East, the Far East and in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1972 to 1979, Berendes ran the NIH's contraceptive  
evaluation branch, studying the safety of various means of 
contraception. More recently, he worked on projects aimed at 
improving the care of women and newborns in developing nations.

                           *Dirk Bogarde    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Dirk Bogarde, the British actor who starred in  
more than 70 films and captured the hearts of many women in the 
1950s, died of a heart attack Saturday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The British film star, who achieved his greatest fame in ``Death  
in Venice,'' suffered a stroke in 1996 and had been under 24-hour 
nursing care since last May. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to England from military service in World War II and  
joined a small theater group. Soon, he landed roles in the 
lighthearted ``Doctor in the House'' series, and by the 1950s had 
become a matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
	Screaming audiences mobbed him at public appearances. The  
attention soon led to bigger roles in movies such as ``A Tale of 
Two Cities,'' in which he played Sidney Carton, and other films 
such as ``Darling'' and ``The Servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, Bogarde sought a quieter life and retreated to  
a 15th century farmhouse in France. He began a second career, 
producing several novels and a series of autobiographical works, 
including ``For The Time Being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1986, he  
reluctantly returned to England, where he became an enthusiastic 
supporter of voluntary euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992.

                         *Robret T. Forsyth    	
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Robert T. Forsyth, a veteran reporter,  
editor and political consultant who took a lead role in negotiating 
journalists' union contracts, died Saturday of causes related to 
cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular Forsyth, an aggressive, unabashed liberal who began  
his newspaper career in the 1960s at the Spokane Daily Chronicle, 
had battled cancer of the lymph glands for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stint with The Associated Press in San Francisco in  
1970, Forsyth worked for six years as a reporter and editor at the 
now-defunct Sacramento Union. He covered major stories of the day, 
including the attempted assassination of President Ford and the 
Patricia Hearst kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	He became active in the Newspaper Guild and helped negotiate  
labor agreements at both the Union and The Sacramento Bee for 
journalists and advertising sales people. In 1976, he took a leave 
of absence from the Union and traveled the country as an 
international representative of the guild. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth joined the Bee in 1978 and worked as a reporter,  
assistant city editor and city editor. He left the Bee in 1985 to 
work as a press secretary for Sen. David Roberti, the president pro 
tem of the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Forsyth went to work as press spokesman for former San  
Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan. After a year, he returned to 
Sacramento where he became a consultant to trade associations 
representing trial and workers' compensation attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a daughter, two sons, a stepson and two  
grandchildren.

	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- James J. Humes, the lead  
pathologist at President Kennedy's autopsy and a target of 
conspiracy theorists, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes was chief pathologist at Bethesda Naval Hospital when  
Kennedy's body was flown there for an autopsy. The pathology team 
concluded Kennedy was killed by two bullets fired from behind -- a 
finding disputed to this day. 
</P>
<P>
	Humes stood by his work in his most famous case. Aside from  
testimony before government panels, he rarely spoke of the autopsy 
and gave only one interview published in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the conspiracy theories ``general idiocy'' and ``a  
tragedy.''

	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Dana Plato, who like her fellow ``Diff'rent  
Strokes'' child co-stars had seen legal troubles since the show was 
canceled, died Saturday of apparant drug overdose. She was 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato apparently took the painkiller Loritab along with  
Valium. Police said the death appeared accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran  
from 1978 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in 1991 for robbing a Las Vegas video store,  
and was placed on five years' probation. In 1992 she was given an 
additional five years' probation for forging prescriptions for 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's recent career had included mainly low-budget films  
such as 1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different 
Strokes: A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video 
softcore tale about a sexual threesome.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Still Short of Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force is blaming Mother  
Nature for its latest satellite mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	A military Global Positioning System satellite got rained on  
over the weekend, even though it was in a protective room at the 
launch pad. As a result, the flight is on indefinite hold until 
workers can repair any damage. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest in a series of problems at Cape Canaveral Air  
Station and has prompted the Air Force to convene a review board. 
</P>
<P>
	The GPS satellite had been scheduled for launch as early as this  
weekend aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket. It will be removed later 
this week from the rocket and inspected for damage. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the mishap, the satellite was shrouded atop the  
rocket. Lightning forced technicians to interrupt their routine 
tests and evacuate the pad. When they returned, they discovered 
rain had leaked onto the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Brig. Gen. Randy Starbuck, who's in charge of the  
launch facility, said workers will take their time in checking the 
satellite. ``We are not in a hurry to launch rockets here,'' he 
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay is expected to be at least a couple weeks and probably  
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Air Force launched two satellites into useless  
orbits aboard Titan IV rockets. The rocket line, made by Lockheed 
Martin Corp., had been grounded since a midair explosion last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	And just last week, a Boeing Delta III rocket placed an Orion  
communication satellite into the wrong orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground controllers for satellite maker Hughes Space and  
Communications Co. used on-board thrusters Friday night to raise 
the low end of the lopsided orbit from 98 miles to 262 miles. But 
the Orion satellite was still far short of the intended 
22,300-mile-high altitude and chances of it ever getting there are 
slim. 
</P>
<P>
	``They accomplished what they wanted to accomplish, which was to  
get it out of the Earth's atmosphere,'' said Hughes spokesman Emery 
Wilson. ``At this time, we're kind of waiting for our customer to 
decide what they would like us to do with the satellite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Loral Space and Communications, John McCarthy,  
said Monday that the company is looking at all the options. Loral 
had hoped to expand service in Asia and the Pacific with the 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second failure in as many launches for the new Delta  
III, a bigger, upgraded version of the Delta II. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural flight last August ended in an explosion 71  
seconds after liftoff. This time, the rocket's second stage fired 
for only one second before abruptly shutting down 22 minutes into 
the flight.

fans would recognize from their youth. It was a scene that could 
keep baseball commissioner Bud Selig awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, baseball's banned career hits leader, was back on a  
diamond with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to outfielders for the Sacramento Steelheads of  
the Western Baseball League on Monday as part of his role as 
special instructor for the newly created team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major leaguers. ``I'm 58 years old -- 
I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a black long-sleeved shirt Monday, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists the stint as special instructor is not an  
effort to generate public support for his bid to overturn the ban, 
will get paid about $50,000 to work with players averaging $1,250 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him. I'm 34 and I wish I  
could be 20 again and hear that speech,'' said catcher Tim 
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year and hopes his stint in Sacramento is 
a springboard to another big league job. ``He's an idol. He a god. 
You see a lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 
4,000 hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is banned from going on the field and clubhouses of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., but Monday's appearance was the first time he's 
actually worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, said he was unaware of the  
Rockford speech but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it 
would appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he'd like to return to the majors as a manager  
someday, in large part because ``the pay is good,'' and believes 
Selig eventually will give him another chance. But he couldn't 
resist taking a swipe at major league officials for the recent 
series between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is a great country for getting second  
opportunities, though sometimes it takes a while. The fans want me 
back,'' he said. ``Do fans want Bud Selig sitting next to (Fidel) 
Castro? Ask the fans in south Florida now.''

<HEADLINE> BSO Cancels China Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fearful of growing instability in China after  
NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra has reportedly canceled two concerts in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra planned four performances in Japan and two  
performances in China to celebrate Seiji Ozawa's 25th anniversary 
as music director. 
</P>
<P>
	After a final performance scheduled for tonight in Osaka, Japan,  
the BSO was to perform Wednesday and Thursday in Beijing, with the 
second performance attended by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and 
President Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
	But Makoto Morita, a spokesman for Osaka's Festival Hall, where  
the symphony was to play tonight, said Sunday the trip to China was 
canceled because of instability in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to orchestra officials in Boston were not  
immediately returned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media reported three people were killed when NATO  
missiles struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on Saturday. More 
than 20 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, demonstrators hurled rocks and debris into the U.S.  
Embassy in China, trapping American diplomats inside their compound 
in a second day of protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Morita said the symphony's schedule after the Osaka performance  
was uncertain, but tour officials would look into additional 
performances in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear when the BSO would return to the United States.

<HEADLINE> CIA Error Blamed for Bombing Mixup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A CIA error that was based on faulty  
information and then went undetected in subsequent checks led to 
the mistaken NATO targeting and bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, a U.S. official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
intended target, the Yugoslav Federal Directorate of Supply and 
Procurement, was chosen by the CIA. Other organizations, including 
NATO, the U.S. European Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff, 
reviewed and approved it, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This went through all these hoops, but for whatever reason it  
was not detected,'' the official said of the mistake. The Chinese 
Embassy is several hundred yards away from the Yugoslav government 
supply office. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the target planning in the allied air campaign is done  
by NATO, the U.S. European Command and the Pentagon, with the CIA 
playing a smaller role, the official said. CIA officials are still 
reviewing their own published and clandestine sources to determine 
how they misidentified the embassy, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post quoted a senior NATO official in Monday  
editions as saying ``the tragic and embarrassing truth is that our 
maps simply did not show the Chinese Embassy anywhere in that 
vicinity.'' The official was not further identified. The paper said 
the current Chinese Embassy was opened three or four years ago and 
that the old one was several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and President Clinton offered further apologies Sunday for  
the bombing, but no further information about how the mistake 
occurred or who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House  
intelligence committee, said the bombing shows that America's 
intelligence capabilities are stretched too thin and that such 
mistakes will happen as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say it's a reaping of the harvest of the underinvestment in  
our intelligence capabilities,'' Goss said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goss's Senate counterpart, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., agreed:  
``We've been doing defense, which intelligence is part and parcel 
of, on the cheap for about 13 straight years, and now you're seeing 
the fruits of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking about $29 billion for intelligence  
programs in the 2000 budget, an increase of about 9 percent. But 
critics say that proposed increase comes after years in which 
intelligence spending has effectively declined. Only a small 
portion of that budget goes to the CIA: much is for spy satellites 
and military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton apologized to the Chinese on Saturday, and again Sunday  
in a message to the Chinese president, and Defense Secretary 
William Cohen and CIA Director George Tenet issued a joint 
statement late Saturday night acknowledging that ``faulty 
information'' was behind the error. 
</P>
<P>
	They stressed that ``a review of our procedures has convinced us  
that this was an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA had no additional comment on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Wesley Clark, said on ABC's  
``This Week'' that there have been 18,000 bombing runs in the 
seven-week campaign but fewer than a dozen instances of hitting 
civilians or weapons going astray. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was ``the most precise, effective and collateral  
damage-free air operation that has ever been conducted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the embassy bombing has further strained already tense  
relations between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Saturday night with Li  
Zhaoxing, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, to express 
regrets and seek assurances that U.S. embassy staff in Beijing, 
which has been under siege from thousands of Chinese demonstrators 
protesting the bombing, be protected. The State Department also has 
issued an advisory cautioning Americans against travel in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on Sunday also warned the Chinese government not to  
seek political advantage from the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that the Chinese are orchestrating this for some  
political reason,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ``Meet 
the Press.'' ``It should stop immediately and it can have long-term 
repercussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, appearing on ABC and  
CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said the bombing could be a ``temporary 
setback'' in diplomatic efforts to end the military campaign, but 
``it doesn't seem to me in light of where the Chinese have been 
that they would veto a peace settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering said someone would have to be ``certifiably looney''  
to believe that NATO purposely targeted the Chinese embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Li, the Chinese ambassador, who also appeared on ABC,  
condemned what he said was an effort to ``whitewash the atrocity'' 
The attack, which he said killed three and wounded 20, ``is no 
ordinary incident. It is a horrifying atrocity.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Criticizes Large Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McLean, Va. (AP) -- Calling the launch of a national campaign  
against violence at the White House Monday an ``extraordinary 
gathering,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that schools today 
have gotten so big that students can get lost in the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way that children can be made to feel special and  
valued, that they can be given the attention and support they need, 
and especially if they are vulnerable or susceptible to the culture 
and therefore more likely to be prone toward aggression that 
anybody will ever notice,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said that to her, one of the saddest comments after  
the Littleton, Colo., massacre was made by the principal of 
Columbine High School, who said he never heard about the ``trench 
coat mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well how could he? Those were just a small group of kids in a  
very large institution,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a speech at The 
Madeira School, a private girls' high school in suburban 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now most of our schools are no longer communities, and  
too many kids are passing through them anonymously. ... So we are 
going to have to change the way we think about, how we build and 
construct and organize our schools,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was ``proud'' of the discussion on youth  
violence Monday at the White House. She said that as the bombing of 
a federal building in Oklahoma City ``took the sting out of so much 
of the irresponsible anti-government rhetoric, after Littleton, it 
is very hard to cartoon one another. ... Because the truth is that 
we do have some hard questions to ask ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady quoted one of the gun manufacturers at the  
meeting who said he ``would support some of the president's 
proposals for sensible gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He said 'you know, we are parents too, we think people do have  
to exercise responsibility, but we can do more to make it easier 
for parents to keep guns safely away from children,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Mrs. Clinton said, gun control activist Sarah Brady  
said she was ``honored to be in a room with the gun manufacturers, 
because for the first time people were not hurling invectives at 
one another but trying to decide what is it we can do to make it 
easier to make sure that guns have safety locks, for example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that the television networks and other media  
companies that attended ``are finally facing up to the fact that 
they cannot escape their share of the responsibility for this 
culture in which we live.'' This shows, she said, ``some cracks in 
the walls of deniability, and that in itself is a big step 
forward.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest Cops in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters gathered at City  
Hall today to denounce a decision not to prosecute four police 
officers who shot to death a 19-year-old black woman who was in 
sitting in a car with a gun in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Riverside County district attorney last week  
has angered supporters of the woman, Tyisha Miller, a victim they 
say of police racism and brutality. Today's protesters included 
members of her family and religious leaders such as the Rev. Al 
Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters denounced police and called for civil disobedience,  
but organizers urged everyone to keep calm and avoid clashes with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to riot or to disrupt. We're hear to  
demonstrate and to protest,'' the Rev. Ron Gibson told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	By morning, about 600 people had gathered at City Hall and in a  
park across the street, some of them holding signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need the white man to give me my rights. I have my  
rights,'' shouted Nathan Smith, a protester from Los Angeles. ``No 
justice, no peace'' was scrawled in red on a green combat helmet he 
was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	About six police officers stood at the entrance of City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Miller was killed on the early morning of Dec. 28, 1998. The  
officers had responded to a 911 call from the woman's cousin, who 
reported Ms. Miller was unconscious with a handgun on her lap in 
her car at a gas station. The officers broke into the car to take 
the weapon away from her. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they fired 23 shots at her only after she sat up and  
reached for the gun, but family members and activists claim her 
killing was racially motivated. Ms. Miller was black and the four 
officers are white. 
</P>
<P>
	The Police Department has been on special alert since District  
Attorney Grover Trask announced Thursday that the officers would 
not be prosecuted. Trask said a four-month investigation showed 
that while the officers may have made mistakes, their actions did 
not warrant charges.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Workers File Bias Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of current and former employees of  
Bell Atlantic Corp. filed a $100 million federal lawsuit against 
the company Monday, charging that a racially hostile environment 
led to the suicides of three employees who worked at a company 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court alleges that company  
executives did not do enough to stem the discrimination allegations 
lodged by 10 plaintiffs against two men who were supervisors at the 
garage the suicide victims worked at. The three workers, all black 
males, died between 1994 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged harassment by white supervisors Thomas Flaherty and  
Nick Pomponio, who were named as defendants in the lawsuit, was so 
harsh that some workers considered ``taking the law into their own 
hands,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But (they) opted to endure the suffering instead, believing  
that Bell Atlantic would take the action it promised to take (to 
investigate complaints and take corrective action),'' court 
documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Flaherty and Pomponio have since been transferred out of  
the garage, plaintiffs' attorney John Hermina said. Flaherty, 
reached by phone, referred comment to corporate attorneys, and a 
number the company provided for Pomponio was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Rasmussen, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman in Arlington, Va.,  
said Hermina had tried to file a similar lawsuit in federal court 
in Washington seeking class-action status but a judge ``denied 
their claim of a pattern of discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rasmussen declined to comment specifically on the  
Philadelphia lawsuit because she had not seen it, but said, 
``Discrimination is totally unacceptable in the workplace at Bell 
Atlantic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit charges the company with racial discrimination and  
retaliation, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bell Atlantic knew this was going on,'' Hermina said. ``It's a  
culture of neglect, because apparently Bell Atlantic felt that 
these African-American employees don't matter.''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Warned About Gld coins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If consumers believe they should buy gold or  
silver coins to protect themselves against possible Year 2000 
problems, they should be well informed before doing so, groups 
representing coin and paper money experts are warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and federal regulators have been warning the public to  
be wary of new investment scams playing on fears that banks won't 
be able to handle the millennial date change. Some con artists have 
tried to persuade people to take their money out of banks to avoid 
computer foulups, then turn it over to be invested with them in 
gold, silver, small-company stocks or other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade groups said Monday that potential investors in coins  
should be aware of three key factors: the cost per ounce of 
precious metals, the delivery time for the coins and the difference 
between bullion value and collector value. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of bullion coins fluctuates in tandem with gold or  
silver prices, while collector coins have an additional value based 
on historical supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't know your bullion coins, you'd better know your  
bullion coin dealer,'' said Richard Schwary, president of the 
Professional Numismatists Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that guild members, who study and collect coins, must  
follow a code of ethics and agree to binding arbitration to settle 
disputes with customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The group issued an advisory along with the American Numismatic  
Association and the Industry Council for Tangible Assets, whose 
members are experts on paper money. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwary said American Eagle coins generally have higher retail  
prices than comparable Canadian Maple Leaf coins or South African 
Krugerrands. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some older U.S. coins may be readily available in  
circulated condition for a ``modest'' premium over the value of 
their gold or silver content, but the same coins in pristine 
condition may have a significantly higher value, sometimes 
thousands of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	If immediate delivery of coins is not possible once you have  
bought them, Schwary advised, get specific confirmation of the 
delivery date in writing from the seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased demand has caused the U.S. Mint and its distributors  
to have delays in delivering coins, and retail buyers may encounter 
delays of several weeks or more, he said. 
</P>
<P>

Guild's membership directory and a guide titled ``What You Should 
Know Before You Buy Rare Coins'' by writing to Robert Brueggeman, 
PNG executive director, 3950 Concordia Lane, Fallbrook, Calif.

<HEADLINE> U S West Plans Phone-Computer Hybrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West plans later this year to become the  
first phone company to sell two new telephone-computer hybrids that 
feature one-button dialing to the Internet and other simplified 
ways to use the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The plug-in WebTouch phones made by Alcatel of France will be  
available this fall and U S West will offer wireless service for 
Qualcomm's Thin Phone by the end of the year, the Denver-based 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new phones, versions of which are also expected from rivals  
such as Lucent Technologies and Motorola, operate much the same way 
as a personal computer uses a modem to dial the user's Internet 
service, but reduces the process to one step. There's no waiting to 
boot up a PC or open a software program. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the phones don't speed up the actual connection or  
provide a dial-less, direct link to the Internet like so-called DSL 
and broadband cable lines that are becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West didn't say how much it would charge for the Alcatel  
phone, which is widely expected to sell for several hundred 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Qualcomm phone, which is expected to hit the market this  
month, will cost $99. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a provider of phone service in 14 western and  
midwestern states, said the simplicity of the two phones will 
eliminate a key barrier for people who are too intimidated by 
computers to roam the Internet or send e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the Internet for the rest of us,'' said Solomon  
Trujillo, president and chief executive of U S West. ``Today, half 
of all Americans still aren't on the Internet because it's either 
too complicated or too expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also stressed that technophiles will take to the new  
phones because they can be toted around the house or to other 
locations more easily than a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will be able to use the Web phone in any room with a  
phone jack,'' the company said in a press release. ``With this 
feature, customers preparing dinner can follow recipes on line and 
do-it-yourself mechanics can track on-line automotive tips while 
working in the garage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel's WebTouch phone has a touch-sensitive color screen, a  
pull-out keyboard and programmable buttons like those on a car 
radio for quick access to favorite Web sites with news, weather 
updates, stock quotes and other interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm's wireless ``Thin Phone,'' is due on the market this  
month, perhaps a half year before the new U S West.net service will 
be available. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West said it may strike similar deals to provide wireless  
service to new Web phones expected from Qualcomm rivals like 
Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson.

<HEADLINE> Home-Equity Lender To Settle Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- One of the nation's largest home-equity lenders  
has agreed to settle two lawsuits by implementing a new mortgage 
policy that will lower annual interest rates for clients who make 
monthly payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates First Capital Corp., also known as The Associates,  
agreed to the move after meeting with Boston-based Neighborhood 
Assistance Corporation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the two class-action lawsuits were filed Friday on  
behalf of two dozen plaintiffs in Massachusetts and California, 
about 2,000 Massachusetts borrowers could be affected by the new 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will absolutely restructure this $300 billion industry of  
sub-prime lending,'' said Bruce Marks, executive director of 
Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. ``It's a 
significant victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sub-prime lending industry provides high-interest loans to  
people who have debt or bad credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came to a meeting of the minds,'' Joseph Stroop, The  
Associates' spokesman, told The Boston Globe from the company's 
headquarters in Irving, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lending specialists said consumers may not save huge amounts of  
money, but the deal comes at a time when sub-prime lenders have 
been increasingly criticized for taking advantage of the 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Massachusetts plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged that  
loans from The Associates bankrupted them after the company 
surprised them with ``balloon payments,'' which are huge lump sums 
due halfway through the loan. The borrowers said they were told 
they would have to refinance the loan at an even higher monthly 
rate to avoid the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Some also allege that The Associates failed to report their  
positive payments to credit bureaus, keeping them chained to their 
bad credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroop said the company stopped charging ``balloon payments''  
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, each new loan would automatically be  
refinanced at a lower rate three times in its first three years. 
The rate would drop by 0.5 percent at the close of the first year, 
an additional 0.75 percent the following and 1 percent the last.

<HEADLINE> Monica Pops Up on 'Saturday Night' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At one time, it might have been a Monica  
Lewinsky fantasy: living in a Malibu beach house with ex-President 
Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was just a skit on ``Saturday Night Live.'' The  
former White House intern told jokes at the expense of Clinton and 
her ex-friend, Linda Tripp, during an appearance on the NBC comedy 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also in a second segment, dispensing advice on phone sex  
and affairs with older men along with actor Tim Meadows, who 
portrayed a '70s style ``ladies' man'' conducting a telephone 
call-in show. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had tried to keep Ms. Lewinsky's appearance on the show a  
secret. But word slipped out when she was seen during the week in 
the ``Saturday Night Live'' studio for rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malibu beach house skit was actually depicted as Clinton's  
dream. Actor Darrell Hammond, who impersonates Clinton, wore a 
white bathrobe and was tempted by an offer of a lunch date with two 
prostitutes by Meadows, playing Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky entered the beach house, coming home from work, and  
Clinton asked how her day went. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone gets so mad at me when I turn the wrong letters,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton tried to make her feel better with a gift -- a copy of  
``Leaves of Grass'' by Walt Whitman. Ms. Lewinsky pointed out he'd 
given her that book before. 
</P>
<P>
	She then balked at Clinton's request to have lunch with Jordan.  
``Come on, baby,'' he said. ``Don't you trust me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, in your dreams, you big creep,'' Ms. Lewinsky replied,  
echoing the nickname she gave Clinton in tape recordings of her 
conversations with Linda Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadows introduced Ms. Lewinsky during the second skit as  
someone ``who has done more to educate this country in the ways of 
love than anybody else on this planet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told one advice-seeker it's not a good idea to have an  
affair with her much older boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, people in the office will start gossiping,'' she said,  
``and the next thing you know your face is all over Arabic 
newspapers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another caller wanted to know if she should have phone sex. ``I  
had phone sex with this one guy,'' Ms. Lewinsky said. ``His name 
doesn't really matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't we just call him William Howard Taft?'' Meadows  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor John Goodman, who has portrayed Tripp in past shows,  
called as that character to seek Ms. Lewinsky's forgiveness. ``No 
way,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Amy Fisher Released From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBION, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher walked out of prison Monday after  
serving nearly seven years for shooting her lover's wife in the 
head in a case that once dominated tabloid headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher, known as the ``Long Island Lolita'' in tabloid  
headlines and television movies, wore sunglasses, kept her head 
bowed and did not answer questions as she walked past reporters and 
photographers outside the Albion Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by her mother and attorney Bruce Barket, Ms. Fisher  
got into a van and later boarded a charter flight from Rochester to 
Farmingdale, Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's obviously extremely happy and thankful to the people who  
brought this about,'' Barket said, including shooting victim Mary 
Jo Buttafuoco, who helped win an early release for Ms. Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've all placed a significant amount of trust in her and  
she's not going to let them down,'' Barket said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barket said Ms. Fisher would be living in the New York City area  
and would work in a fashion-industry job. She will be on parole 
until 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher's story sparked a fountain of stories at the time of  
the shooting. She was portrayed as a scheming, spurned, teen-age 
temptress who seduced Mrs. Buttafuoco's husband and brazenly 
blasted the rival for his love on the Buttafuoco front doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher pleaded guilty in 1992 to assault for shooting Mrs.  
Buttafuoco and was sentenced to five-to-15 years in prison. Ms. 
Fisher, now 24, was a 17-year-old high school senior when the 
shooting happened. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge agreed last month to a shorter prison sentence for Ms.  
Fisher, making her eligible for release if the state Parole Board 
agreed. The board voted 2-1 last week to grant her release. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Buttafuoco, 37 when she was shot, survived and forgave Ms.  
Fisher in court last month. The two had corresponded for several 
months and Mrs. Buttafuoco helped get Ms. Fisher's sentenced 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Fisher had been having an affair with Joey Buttafuoco, the  
38-year-old owner of an auto body shop. He pleaded guilty to 
statutory rape and served six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In a $220 million lawsuit that was dropped in February, Ms.  
Fisher claimed she was raped by five corrections officers at 
Albion. U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara wrote that the lawsuit 
``reads more like a cheap dime store novel or a script for a 
tabloid television show than a pleading in a federal lawsuit.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec, Committee Member Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An IOC member under investigation in  
the Olympic bribery scandal met today with a committee leader, who 
said he had no orders to fire his embattled colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an IOC vice president from Australia, met today  
with compatriot Phil Coles, who has been urged to resign from the 
board of the Sydney Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he briefed his colleague on the investigations into  
Coles' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be quite unusual for me to come out here, an  
investigation having been set up, to tell Phil Coles what he should 
do and what he shouldn't do,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly didn't arrive in Sydney with a message from Juan  
Antonio Samaranch advising Phil Coles to resign from either SOCOG 
or the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said there is no plot to oust Coles, although he  
acknowledged Coles may be guilty of the ``possibility of a 
continuous pattern of misjudgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no persons, I know of no information that suggests  
there is a conspiracy against Phil Coles -- and I told him that,'' 
Gosper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Sports Minister Jackie Kelly said Coles had been  
urged by every ``sportsman, sports coach, sportswoman and sports 
administrator to go. ... His time has come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has stepped aside from SOCOG pending the IOC  
investigations but he expects to be cleared and to return to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly's demand for Coles' resignation follows months of pressure  
from SOCOG president Michael Knight and a similar request this 
month by chief executive Sandy Hollway. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position has not changed,'' Coles said. ``I have to appear  
before the (IOC) and Mr. Gosper has no role to play in that. The 
(IOC) meeting will take place and I'll present my case and I'll be 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, speaking during a pay television interview recorded  
before Monday's meeting but aired after it, said he was upset with 
the ``hurtful vilification of me and those around me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You lay awake at night thinking what have I done to deserve  
this. All I wanted to do was bring the games back to Australia. We 
finally got the games here and I sometimes wonder if it was all 
worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I don't think I'd ever go and try to bid to win the  
games again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad reflection but living through this experience and  
the accusations and controversies and jealousies, I don't think 
that's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC announced last week it had deferred until June a  
decision on an investigation into whether Coles accepted expensive 
jewelry from a businessman associated with Athens' failed 1996 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC earlier had reprimanded Coles for accepting excessive  
hospitality and travel from the successful 2002 Salt Lake City bid 
team and warned that any further indiscretion would result in 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week it was revealed that 400 pages of documents containing  
his candid assessments of IOC voters were passed on to the Salt 
Lake City bid team. Coles denied giving the documents to Salt Lake 
City.

<HEADLINE> East-West Railroad Link Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROMONTORY SUMMIT, Utah (AP) -- There's not much at this former  
railroad depot: a mile or two of track through the windswept desert 
leading nowhere, a few old locomotives that will never run. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet this desolate spot was celebrated 130 years ago as the final  
link connecting East and West, the starting point for a nation now 
bound by a ribbon of iron. 
</P>
<P>
	It was here that Congress decided the western line laid by the  
Central Pacific company and the eastern tracks put down by Union 
Pacific should be linked to make a 1,776-mile rail line. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:47 p.m. today -- the exact moment the final spike of gold  
was driven in May 10, 1869 -- a replica was to be hammered into 
place, celebrating the lost promise of train travel here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the silliest place to connect the tracks,'' said Bruce  
Powell, superintendent of Golden Spike National Park, which stages 
the annual re-enactment. The decision, he said, was driven by a 
combination of happenstance and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The two rail companies were racing cross-country, one from San  
Francisco and the other from the Missouri River, driving their 
mostly Irish and Chinese workers to lay down track as fast as they 
could. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushing to capture the busy but untapped market in Salt Lake  
City, the two rail lines actually passed each other in northern 
Utah, laying almost 200 miles of parallel track as little as 10 
feet apart in some spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The politicians, fearful of having to subsidize two railroads,  
stepped in. Congress finally mandated the location where the two 
rivals should bury the spike. 
</P>
<P>
	That spot was Promontory Summit. With both competitors'  
locomotives facing each other, the final bolt was driven in as the 
country listened on via the brand-new transcontinental telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, the area was virtually empty. The tent city the  
workers built along the track never turned into a real town, the 
way others did across the West. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after the first golden spike ceremony, the central rail  
connection moved to Ogden, about 45 miles southeast. In 1901, the 
Central Pacific's main engines were scrapped for iron; Union 
Pacific's went two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1904, a rail trestle across the end of the Great Salt  
Lake cut more than 40 miles of the north-south route and made the 
Promontory Summit line a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things change in the industry,'' said Powell. ``It's been  
changing for 130 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rail link was completed six years ahead of schedule at an  
estimated cost of $500 million. Thousands died, although no exact 
figures were kept. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Amtrak rail passengers make the New York-to-San Francisco  
run in about 70 hours. In 1869, it took seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	When visitors who have come to witness the ceremony today leave  
here, however, they won't take the train. The only route home is 
via the highway.

<HEADLINE> YPF Board OKs Repsol's $13.44B Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)-- YPF SA's board has endorsed the  
$13.44 billion cash acquisition offer proposed by Spanish energy 
giant Repsol SA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offer in cash by Repsol assures the just and equal  
treatment for all shareholders,'' YPF chairman Robrto Monti said in 
a filing to the Buenos Aires stock exchange on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always have maintained a philosophy based on creating  
value, and it is the board's opinion, to which I adhere, that the 
offer by Repsol offers the best alternative of value for our 
shareholders in the current conditions of the market,'' Monti 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol has offered to acquire the 85 percent of YPF it doesn't  
already own at $44.78 per American depositary share. 
</P>
<P>
	In YPF's filing, the Argentine oil giant said a review of the  
Repsol offer -- performed by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. -- 
called that offer ``reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	YPF added that Repsol chairman Alfonso Cortina, who was named to  
YPF's 12-member board in April, did not participate in the 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol's offer runs from May 24 through June 23 and is  
conditioned on Repsol obtaining a majority ownership of YPF. If the 
deal between the two former state-owned oil companies goes through, 
Repsol said it hopes to achieve double-digit earnings growth 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Repsol acquired 14.99 percent of YPF from the  
Argentine government for $2.01 billion. The Spanish company has 
strengths in crude oil refining and marketing of final products. 
</P>
<P>
	YPF owns and operates three refineries, and owns 2,253 service  
stations in Argentina. It specializes in oil production and 
exploration. It earned $1.1 billion on revenue of $5.5 billion in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Gives `SNL' Best Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky's appearance on ``Saturday Night  
Live'' over the weekend gave the show its best ratings this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBC comedy drew an average audience of 10.3 million viewers,  
based on Nielsen Media Research's measurement of 46 major markets. 
It drew higher ratings than any other network show on Saturday, 
including prime-time program, Nielsen said on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the numbers hold up when national ratings are out later this  
week, it will be the highest-rated ``Saturday Night Live'' episode 
since Dec. 13, 1997, when Helen Hunt was guest host. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky appeared in two skits on Saturday's program, which  
also featured guest host Cuba Gooding Jr. and Latin music sensation 
Ricky Martin.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavians Play on Despite War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's volleyball and soccer teams are trying to find ways  
to play despite war in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The world volleyball federation ruled Monday the country can  
play abroad, but it cannot hold international competitions while 
there is fighting in Kosovo or other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In principle, Yugoslavia is not suspended,'' federation  
president Ruben Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday in Luxembourg, the European Volleyball Confederation  
had suspended Yugoslavia from competition until June 15 because of 
safety concerns for athletes, officials and spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	Acosta said his group will send coaches, nets and more than 500  
volleyballs to Kosovo refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia next 
month to teach youngsters the sport. He said three coaches will 
remain in each area for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	European soccer's governing body said Yugoslavia is eligible for  
the European 2000 Championship but cannot play games at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia will resume qualifying play June 5 in Dublin against  
Ireland. Yugoslavia's game June 9 against Malta will be played at a 
neutral site. The Yugoslav soccer federation has until Wednesday to 
suggest a place. 
</P>
<P>
	A UEFA committee handling the rescheduling of Euro 2000 games  
involving Balkan countries plans to review developments in the 
war-torn area on May 25-26 during a meeting in Barcelona, Spain.

<HEADLINE> Service Targets Web Credit Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Web merchants stung by credit-card fraud are  
getting help in identifying potentially risky transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	HNC Software Inc. of San Diego, which tracks activity in more  
than 260 million credit card accounts, is unveiling a service to 
combat the growing problem of credit card fraud on the Internet, 
The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	HNC will assign a ``score'' to each transaction that indicates  
the probability for fraud. Internet merchants will then set 
thresholds for their systems to accept or reject a transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the service called eFalcon, Web merchants help HNC  
build a profile of the credit card user, by providing information 
about what products were ordered over the Internet and what Web 
pages the user viewed on the merchant's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what transactions you've made. We have a profile of  
you and what you look like and what your charging pattern is,'' 
Allen Jost, HNC's vice president of business development, told the 
newspaper. ``We have more transaction data than anybody in the 
world and we use them to build rich profiles on each client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HNC said the information is kept confidential and not used for  
cross-marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding Web transactions, HNC increases its database to  
improve the accuracy of its predictions. HNC plans to collect a fee 
of a ``few pennies'' for each transaction, the newspaper said.

<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Two players expected to be mainstays for  
Ohio State next season -- sophomore forward Jon Sanderson and 
7-foot-3 junior college recruit Aleksandar Radojevic -- will not be 
with the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim O'Brien and athletic director Andy Geiger issued a  
statement late Monday afternoon that Sanderson, who started every 
regular season game last year, has decided to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic, a native of Montenegro who played last season at  
Barton County (Kan.) Community College, was ruled ineligible by the 
NCAA for playing four games and a total of 19 minutes for a 
Yugoslavian professional team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which lost to eventual national champion Connecticut  
in the Final Four, returns its top two scorers, Michael Redd and 
Scoonie Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson, a 6-7 native of Lexington, averaged 5.4 points and  
3.4 rebounds last season as the Buckeyes went to the Final Four. He 
was replaced in the starting lineup by freshman guard Brian Brown 
in the NCAA tournament, however, with O'Brien citing matchup 
advantages by going with a smaller lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I have made a decision that it would be in my  
best interest to leave Ohio State and pursue my basketball career 
and education elsewhere,'' he said in the statement. ``I will 
forever be thankful for the privilege of being a Buckeye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson said he had not decided where he will transfer.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said, ``We wish Jon nothing but success.''  
</P>
<P>
	Radojevic was considered one of the top junior college centers  
in the nation. He helped Barton County to the junior college 
national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA ruled he cannot play for any member institution.  
Radojevic, who had considered going to the NBA prior to signing 
with Ohio State, will probably make himself available for the NBA 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alek signed a professional contract with a club team in  
Yugoslavia,'' Geiger said. ``Ohio State and the NCAA learned of his 
situation and Ohio State appealed to the NCAA for reinstatement. 
Ohio State recommended a 10-game penalty because Radojevic received 
$13,000 in compensation. We are disappointed with the NCAA's 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Executed Veteran Buried With Honors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAREHAM, Mass. (AP) -- A decorated Vietnam veteran who was  
executed in California last week for murdering an elderly woman was 
laid to rest with military honors in his hometown Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of sobbing friends, family and veterans attended the  
ceremony for Manuel Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, who received a Purple Heart on death row, was executed  
by injection on May 4 -- a day after his 50th birthday -- at San 
Quentin prison in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wash away the sins of our brother Manny in the blood of Jesus  
Christ,'' the Roman Catholic Rev. Thomas Frechette prayed over 
Babbitt's casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, who served with the Marines through the bloody 77-day  
siege of Khe Sanh in 1968, was sentenced to die for killing Leah 
Schendel in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke into her Sacramento, Calif., apartment and hammering  
her with punches that broke her dentures and split the skin on her 
forehead to the bone. Her heart later gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's supporters said he was out of his mind the night he  
attacked the 78-year-old woman, believing himself back in combat in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors said Babbitt killed the woman during a robbery.  
Babbitt also was convicted of the robbery and attempted rape of 
another woman the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	A mattress had been pulled over the top half of Schendel's body,  
a tea kettle placed on her pelvis and a leather strap tied around 
her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said Babbitt's use of the strap was like a  
soldier tagging battlefield dead, and that his efforts to cover the 
body evoke the combat practice of covering the dead with whatever 
materials are at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every combat vet lives with those demons, trained demons, that  
would have a human being destroy another human being in war,'' said 
Ervin L. Russell, a Babbitt friend and a veteran who wore 
camouflage fatigues to the service. ``In many cases, the 
destruction falls upon the veterans themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's supporters said he had been troubled by mental illness  
since his youth, and he cracked under the pressure of the siege of 
Khe Sanh. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt received a Purple Heart in prison for wounds suffered at  
Khe Sanh. The rare death row ceremony infuriated Mrs. Schendel's 
family, who demanded -- and got -- legislation banning another such 
presentation in California. 
</P>
<P>
	A local detachment of uniformed veterans gave Babbitt full  
military honors, featuring a flag-draped casket, a rifle salute and 
a bugler who played ``Taps.'' About 75 people attended the ceremony 
in Wareham, about 44 miles southeast of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Any veteran who received an honorable discharge is eligible for  
burial with military honors, said Jack Soraghan, a spokesman for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, fears that Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh might  
be buried in a military cemetery prompted President Clinton to sign 
a law prohibiting people convicted of capital crimes from being 
buried in such cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Flynt Obscenity Trial Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Potential jurors at Larry Flynt's obscenity  
trial were warned Monday that they may have to watch as much as 40 
hours of sexually explicit videos and were asked whether they could 
frankly discuss the material with strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, the publisher of Hustler magazine, sat quietly at the  
defense table with his eyes closed as jury selection began. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother, Jimmy, 52, are charged with pandering  
obscenity, disseminating material harmful to a juvenile, conspiracy 
and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the alleged sale of an explicit video to a  
14-year-old boy at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store, which Jimmy 
Flynt manages. Each brother could get 24 years in prison and 
$65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt said his attorneys hadn't decided whether he would  
testify. The trial is expected to last four or five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Patrick Dinkelacker readily dismissed 18 prospective  
jurors, including the mother of the county prosecutor, who said 
they might face a personal or financial hardship by serving on the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinkelacker gave the remaining 47 jury candidates detailed  
questionnaires that warned about the explicit nature of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt said he hoped for a jury of ``people with an open mind and  
who really believe in their individual rights and civil liberties, 
and that they have the right to view and read whatever they want 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Flynt was convicted of pandering obscenity for selling  
Hustler magazine. He served six days of a 7- to 25-year sentence 
and was released pending appeal, and the conviction was overturned 
in 1979.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chronicle Publishing Co. said Monday it has  
hired an investment firm to evaluate its holdings, which include 
the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chronicle and its rival, the San Francisco Examiner, have  
long been the subject of rumors that have one paper buying out the 
other or the two papers merging. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Chronicle Publishing said it hired Donaldson  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette of New York to review and evaluate the company's 
financial, business and strategic plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the company's board nor its shareholders have made any  
decisions pertaining to potential future actions,'' Chief Executive 
Officer John B. Sias said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sias did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	Chronicle Publishing is privately held. It owns the Chronicle,  
the Bloomington Pantagraph in Illinois and the Worcester Telegram &AMP; 
Gazette in Massachusetts. It owns television stations KRON in San 
Francisco; KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Its holdings also include a Web site and two book publishing  
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning Chronicle and the afternoon Examiner are published  
under a joint operating agreement in which they share business 
operations but have separate and competing editorial departments. 
The papers split profits under the agreement, which expires in 
2005.

<HEADLINE> McCain Campaigns in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's outspoken backing of the  
NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo has won him increasing support 
among New Hampshire Republicans. But as they get a closer look, GOP 
voters may find they disagree with the presidential candidate on an 
array of other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking his party, the Arizona Republican supports more gun  
control, campaign finance reform -- including a ban on corporate 
contributions -- and greater regulation of health maintenance 
organizations. He also bashes the big tobacco companies, who have 
returned the favor by portraying him in television ads as an 
advocate of higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, 62, told a group of businesspeople Monday that unlimited  
``soft money'' contributions by businesses to political parties 
give corporations an undue influence over legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is comprehensive finance reform, including a ban on  
both labor union and corporate donations to candidates, he told 
about 140 people at a ``Politics and Eggs'' breakfast sponsored by 
the New Hampshire Business and Industry Association, the New 
England Council and several major corporations. . 
</P>
<P>
	``I would support no campaign finance reform that did not  
require that every union member give their permission before the 
union spends money on politics,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the good news. The bad news is I would also require  
that every stockholder give their permission'' before businesses 
could make political contributions, said McCain, cosponsor of a 
campaign finance bill that died in the Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On tobacco, McCain said his position has ``gotten me a lot of  
name recognition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is his support for the bombing campaign against  
Yugoslavia and push for tougher action, including the use of ground 
forces if necessary, that has put him in the public eye recently. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's background as a Navy fighter pilot and prisoner during  
the Vietnam War gives him more credibility on Kosovo than the other 
candidates, said Kedar Gupta, a GT Equipment Technologies executive 
and Democrat who attended the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a straightforward guy -- he's paid his dues,'' Gupta said.  
``John McCain is the one person ... who understands fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent poll done by the University of New Hampshire for CNN  
and WMUR-TV found 14 percent of likely Republican voters would 
support McCain if the election were held now. That put McCain in a 
statistical dead heat for second place with Elizabeth Dole, who 
drew 16 percent. The same poll found 37 percent favored Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush, while the other candidates got 7 percent or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Smith, director of the UNH Survey Center, said Monday  
that McCain's gains in the polls came mostly from voters who think 
the United States should send ground forces into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain has managed to distinguish himself by his support  
of the military campaign in Kosovo,'' Smith said. However, McCain 
has an uphill battle to gain the name recognition that helps Bush 
and Dole, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other question is whether McCain will be able to expand his  
base of support, or whether his popularity will decline when the 
Kosovo crisis wanes, said Bruce Berke, a Statehouse lobbyist and 
supporter of U.S. Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, polls show the public backs the NATO bombing campaign in  
Kosovo. If that support should disappear, the effect on McCain's 
campaign remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo has enabled him to be front and center on an issue that  
is front and center with this nation,'' Berke said. ``I think once 
you do get beyond Kosovo, a lot of the decisions he is taking and 
has taken are difficult issues for success in Republican 
primaries.''

<HEADLINE> Gold Continues To Slide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures continued their sharp descent Monday on the New  
York Mercantile Exchange amid fears world governments, which 
control about 25 percent of world supply, will begin a selling 
frenzy in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa futures tumbled.  
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell 1.9 percent as market participants continued to react  
nervously to the United Kingdom's announcement last week that some 
415 metric tons from its 715 metric-ton stockpile will be sold off 
in coming years as the government moves into better-yielding bond 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's decision caused a measure of calm because officials  
made an announcement before taking action, but investors are 
worried other governments will begin dumping their reserves without 
notice in a bid to make the biggest profits before others join in. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, central banks in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium,  
Argentina and Australia have sold some of their holdings -- all 
without prior warning. There are fears now that other European 
countries and the new European central bank will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for June delivery fell $5.30 to $278.40 an ounce. Gold  
posted a 20-year low last August of $271.60 an ounce and could test 
that mark in coming days, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures fell sharply on the Board of Trade of the City of  
New York, caught in a tug-of-war between expectations for ample 
supplies and heavy buying at recent lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast, which accounts for about 40 percent of the world's  
cocoa supply, is expected to have a bumper midyear harvest after 
final numbers are tallied, pressuring prices already sensitive to 
ample world supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Port arrivals are coming during the traditional off-season for  
buying cocoa, used in making candy. But some manufacturers have 
taken the opportunity to buy when prices tumble, helping buoy a 
fundamentally weak market. 
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa finished down $30 to $973 a ton after falling as low  
earlier as $950 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gained on the Chicago Board of Trade as  
investors covered positions ahead of the late-afternoon release of 
farmer planting progress reports, which were expected to show 
continued behind-average fieldwork as a result of recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprise, however, the U.S. Agriculture Department figures  
show several days of clear skies allowed farmers to catch up on 
their planting. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said 55 percent of intended corn acreage was  
planted by last week, up from the 52 percent average and only 3 
percent below levels at the same time a year ago. And 12 percent of 
soybeans were planted, up 1 percent from the five-year average, but 
down 2 percent from year-ago levels that produced a record crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for corn in particular also gained amid forecasts  
for rain in parts of the Midwest later this week, which could 
further delay plantings as the window of opportunity rapidly 
closes. That could mean fewer acres planted to corn this year, a 
prospect that would help reduce supplies just as world demand is 
expected to show some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	July corn rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose  
1 1/2 cents to $4.79 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Machine Tool Production Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in March rose 44  
percent from the previous month, but declined 48 percent from the 
year-ago March, according to a study by two industry groups 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies spent an estimated $479 million for machine tools in  
March, the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the 
American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said in a joint 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	That easily surpassed the revised estimate of $333 million spent  
in February but fell short of the estimated $914 million spent in 
March 1998, the groups said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first three months of 1999, spending totaled $1.2  
billion, down 45 percent from the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the pickup in March orders over February is positive, it  
closes a quarter still significantly off last year's pace,'' said 
Don F. Carlson, AMT president. ``It does not signal a turnaround in 
the machine tool market. Expectations remain that the second half 
of the year will yield stronger results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator  
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics are compiled from figures submitted by companies  
participating in the U.S. Machine Tool Consumption report.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Progressing Before Spinoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the  
auto-parts manufacturer soon to be independent from General Motors 
Corp., has no more money-losing plants, is getting cooperation from 
its unions to cut costs and is winning more non-GM business, its 
chairman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world's largest parts-maker, Delphi also plans to be a  
major player in the industry's consolidation through an aggressive 
acquisition drive, J.T. Battenberg III told reporters before 
departing on a worldwide roadshow to raise his company's profile 
among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi was once a disparate collection of parts operations that,  
with parent GM, was near bankruptcy in the early 1990s. Though it 
lost $93 million last year because of several one-time costs, 
Delphi earned $284 million in the first quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is cutting Delphi loose to focus on its core business:  
building cars and trucks. Delphi executives say they expect their 
business to grow as other automakers no longer have to fear working 
with a supplier owned by their biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's evidence that's already happening, even though the  
spinoff won't be completed until May 28. In the first quarter, 
Delphi won $4 billion in new contracts with GM and a surprising $2 
billion worth of non-GM contracts. Delphi stock price increased 18 
percent in its first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock has performed well,'' said analyst Jonathan Lawrence  
of Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``They're certainly winning business, and 
that's picked up since their announcement of the spinoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., and Battenberg will face their  
first big test come summer when they will work out details of a new 
contract with the company's largest union, the United Auto Workers. 
Talks already are under way with some UAW locals and Battenberg 
said there has been progress. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's  
North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million. Both 
companies are trying to repair their long-contentious relationship 
with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg declined to comment in detail on that relationship  
but said he was in ``personal touch'' with UAW leaders. Though 
company insiders say UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has been 
cooperative, publicly he has criticized the spinoff and urged GM to 
retain 51 percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi-UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial  
contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit 
of DaimlerChrysler AG. The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi's 
hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM's hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi no longer has any plants that are unprofitable, in some  
cases because its unions agreed to relax restrictive work rules, 
Battenberg said. In Kokomo, Ind., for example, the UAW agreed to 
work rule changes to allow the electronics plant to operate 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg said Delphi plans to focus on acquiring companies  
that can supply future technology, especially in the area of 
high-tech electronics as computers and satellite telecommunications 
become more integrated into the design of car and truck interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at Delphi becoming an electronics company that makes  
products for vehicles, which is a lot more attractive than a 
traditional auto-parts company,'' Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Delphi has been trimming its work force through  
attrition, the company may end up adding workers if it meets its 
goals to increase new business, Battenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, Delphi will debut a $1 million TV-and-print  
advertising campaign to coincide with the Indianapolis 500 auto 
race. The campaign and 20-city roadshow are intended to make Delphi 
a brand known outside the auto industry.

<HEADLINE> 'The Mummy' Wraps Up No. 1 Spot / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy'' took advantage of a pre-''Star  
Wars'' box office drought to wrap up this year's biggest opening 
weekend with $44.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The cat-burglar caper ``Entrapment'' slipped to second with  
$12.2 million and cyberspace adventure ``The Matrix'' was third 
with $6 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With lukewarm reviews, many expected ``The Mummy'' -- a special  
effects-filled story of an ancient Egyptian priest who returns from 
the dead -- to do mediocre business before dropping out of sight 
when the ``Star Wars'' prequel opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it probably did three times as much business as  
people were expecting,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a Reel Source Inc. 
movie analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other films have been just hanging around the box office, but  
this had that kind of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' appeal,'' he said. 
``When you finally get a release like this, everybody goes wild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With most studios giving a wide berth to the opening of ``Star  
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' Universal Pictures' daring 
move to open ``The Mummy'' just 12 days earlier may pay off if 
word-of-mouth is favorable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' -- which also had the best non-summer opening ever  
-- was an impressive showing for star Brendan Fraser and easily beat 
his previous high opening of $16.5 million for ``George of the 
Jungle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first five days of 'Star Wars' will be sold out, so 'The  
Mummy' may actually benefit by being the only alternative,'' 
Bucksbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also opening in wide release this weekend was the high school  
student government satire ``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon 
as a compulsive do-gooder and Matthew Broderick as a frumpy civics 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The film opened in only a handful of theaters three weeks ago  
and rode a wave of positive reviews to fifth place this weekend 
with $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' crossed the $100 million mark this week,  
earning $1.8 million for seventh place. It has grossed a total of 
$100.9 million in 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend ticket sales were 12.2 percent higher than the same  
weekend last year, when ``Deep Impact'' debuted as ``City of 
Angels'' and ``Titanic'' began to slip. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Mummy,'' $44.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Astros Put Henry on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros pitcher Doug Henry is expected to  
miss 6-8 weeks after being placed on the 15-day disabled list 
following Monday night's game because of bone chips in his right 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry will undergo arthroscopic surgery Wednesday at Methodist  
Hospital in Houston. Dr. Tom Mehlhoff will remove three large bone 
spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I pitched, every pitch I threw hurt so I went in  
and told him (manager Larry Dierker) about it,'' Henry said after 
the Astros beat Pittsburgh 6-0. ``I want to be there when the 
season ends. If I can get it done and get the pain taken care of, I 
think I can be here when this team wins it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry is 0-1 with a 6.35 ERA in eight games.  
</P>
<P>
	The Astros purchased the contract of right-hander Jeff McCurry  
from Triple-A New Orleans. In 11 relief appearances for the 
Zephyrs, he had a 5.40 ERA with seven saves and an 0-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	McCurry was expected to be in uniform for Tuesday night's game  
against Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Adopting Bank Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the urging of Senate Banking Committee head  
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, federal regulators are taking action to help 
keep politics out of bank examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four major bank-regulatory agencies are adopting or making  
more formal existing policies barring bank examiners from 
discussing politics with bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm issued a statement Monday saying the agencies' actions  
will ensure that bank inspections ``are free from political issues 
or considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The examination process can be trying enough for a banker  
without injecting the poison of political pressure,'' Gramm said. 
``These new policies should help prevent abuses by making sure that 
both (government) examiners and bankers are aware that exams should 
be above board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm is a fierce critic of the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act,  
which requires banks to make loans to the poor and minorities in 
the areas in which they operate. As Congress drafts sweeping 
legislation to overhaul the financial services laws, Gramm has 
tried to keep the government's community-lending ratings for banks 
from becoming a standard for allowing them to merge with other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	His action has put him at odds with the Clinton administration,  
which has threatened to veto a financial services bill passed by 
the Senate last week on grounds it would hurt the community lending 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said the agencies took the action in response to his  
having recently criticized the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, part of the Treasury Department, for allowing its 
examiners to solicit positive ``political'' statements from bankers 
about the community lending law. 
</P>
<P>
	After the comptroller's office issued a formal directive to its  
employees prohibiting political communications, Gramm said, the 
other three agencies told him they planned to follow suit. They are 
the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and 
the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, told Gramm in a letter last  
week that the agency had a long-standing unwritten, informal policy 
of ``carefully avoiding any form of political communications by 
examiners'' with banks or their affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC has had no problems in this area for more than 60  
years, Ms. Tanoue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Gramm's request last month, the agency made the  
policy formal and distributed it to employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Federal Reserve recently formalized its  
75-year-old policy of avoiding any form of political communications 
with banks, a spokesman for the central bank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Fulwider, a thrift office spokesman, said the agency  
planned to issue such guidelines to employees within the next few 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Looking Into Partnerships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. Monday confirmed that  
it has been holding periodic talks with European aerospace 
companies, including Airbus Industrie, to explore possible 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the past couple of years we've had talks with Airbus,  
that's nothing new,'' said Jerry Langheim, a Lockheed Martin 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times reported Sunday that executives from Airbus  
Industrie and Lockheed Martin have been talking about an alliance, 
including the possibility of a Lockheed partnership in Airbus' 
proposed superjet, the A-3XX. Another scenario had Lockheed joining 
in a military transport plane Airbus has been planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Langheim said Lockheed does not intend to make any  
announcements, nor does it intend to invest in Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Monday, Lockheed Martin said senior  
managers talk periodically with counterparts from European 
aerospace companies ``about the possibilities of working together 
on programs of mutual interest, such as new military airlifters or 
as a subcontractor for components of Airbus commercial airliners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said an alliance could be beneficial to both sides.  
</P>
<P>
	``Airbus really needs more partnerships if it's going to develop  
new product,'' said Richard Aboulafia, director of aviation at Teal 
Group Corp. ``Lockheed needs to grow its aeronautical sector if 
it's to grow as well.''

<HEADLINE>  Morgan Group Recommended in A's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A group headed by Hall of Famer Joe  
Morgan and former Oakland Athletics executive Andy Dolich received 
a recommendation from city and county leaders Monday in their bid 
to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-1 vote rejected commissioner Bud Selig's suggestion that  
bids from two groups be forwarded to major league owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group is led by San Mateo lawyer Michael Lazarus and  
includes former pitcher Steve Stone, now a broadcaster for the 
Chicago Cubs; and Bob Watson, a former A's coach and a former 
general manager of the Houston Astros and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just decided the community doesn't want to do it,'' Alameda  
County Supervisor Gail Steele said of Selig's idea. ``I might have 
played the chess game differently but everybody involved wanted to 
play it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgan group is backed by Bob Piccinini, chairman of  
Modesto-based Save Mart Foods, who provided the $12 million 
deposit. The other group is backed by Arizona banker Lyle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation was made by the Oakland Alameda County  
Coliseum Authority, which consists of two supervisors and two 
councilmen. Final approval of the purchaser rests with major league 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the City Council cast an advisory vote recommending the  
Morgan-Dolich group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement worked out in October with current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, the authority had until 
Tuesday to forward recommendations to the baseball on who should 
buy the A's for about $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement with Schott and Hofmann, the Athletics  
agreed to stay in Oakland through the 2001 season, with a right to 
extend their lease on a year-to-year basis through 2004. When 
Schott and Hofmann bought the A's for $85 million in 1995, they 
signed a nine-year lease at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners of the A's will be required to keep the team in  
Oakland through at least 2004.

<HEADLINE> Unions Battle Over Honda Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- After nearly 20 years with no union,  
workers at Honda's U.S. auto plants now have two unions in a 
dispute over who should represent them. 
</P>
<P>
	If the workers approve a union, it would be the first at any  
solely Japanese-owned auto plant in the United States. There are 
unions in plants that are joint ventures of Japanese and U.S. 
companies or that make models for both. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda boasts of a team atmosphere at its plants, where all  
employees -- from management to people on the assembly line -- are 
known as associates. 
</P>
<P>
	And some workers at the plants are strongly anti-union, and a  
couple hundred loyal employees demonstrated against a union last 
week in the streets of this central Ohio city of 10,000 people, 
about 30 miles northwest of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a time and a place for everything. I just don't think  
the time is now,'' said Michael Ferguson, a 27-year-old who makes 
brakes at plant in Anna. ``It would be a different story if people 
were upset on a daily basis about the same thing and nothing was 
being done. But that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-union workers say they're upset over working conditions and  
retirement plans. They also allege Honda gives temporary workers -- 
who make around half the $20-per-hour permanent associates' average 
-- day shifts preferred by permanent workers. Honda denies the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Auto Workers petitioned the National Labor Relations  
Board in 1985 and 1989, but never reached the point where workers 
voted on whether to join a union. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters officials say frustrated Honda workers came to them  
after getting nowhere with the United Auto Workers. But the UAW is 
disputing whether the Teamsters belong in an auto plant, and filed 
a complaint April 27 with the AFL-CIO seeking exclusive rights to 
organize the Honda plants in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters Local 413 in Columbus says it has about 3,000  
signatures from Honda workers, more than the 30 percent needed for 
the NLRB to approve a vote. The local says about 8,000 of the 
13,200 employees in the state would be represented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided we were going to bring attention to these people,''  
said Zeke Totten, an organizer with Local 413. ``We didn't estimate 
we'd get more than 1,000 cards, maybe 2,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the UAW and the Teamsters are members of the AFL-CIO, and  
the labor federation will try to resolve the dispute over 
representation with mediation or arbitration, if necessary, 
spokeswoman Lane Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW has refused to comment on the union turf dispute, and  
Honda is not taking any position on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda began producing motorcycles in Marysville in 1979 and over  
the years added two auto plants and an engine plant in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda announced last week that it would build its third U.S.  
auto production plant in eastern Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Honda sent out a letter advising workers to ``think  
twice before signing'' a union authorization card. Spokesman Roger 
Lambert said employees were asking questions about the Teamsters' 
push. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect everyone's right to say how they feel. It's one of  
the things we encourage here,'' Lambert said. ``We haven't changed 
and we won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Sullivan, a 33-year-old motorcycle welder at the plant in  
Marysville, says accidents at work have led to surgeries on his 
ankle, wrist and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he that when he started with Honda 15 years ago as an  
assembly-line worker just out of high school, he was happy to have 
a full-time job at a growing plant and saw no need for a union 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's among the workers talking to the Teamsters.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're an 18-year-old kid it seems easy. You're not  
thinking about making it until you're 65,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Linkous, a 13-year Honda veteran who was among those  
pushing for UAW representation in the 1980s, said Sullivan's 
sentiments are typical. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the young people (who didn't favor a union before)  
are now old people. The work force has now been beat in the 
ground,'' said Linkous, who works at the Marysville auto plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's spokesman, Lambert, said the company's plants are among  
the safest in the auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Tough Times for St. Louis Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A sure sign the closer is in trouble is if he's  
warming up in the second inning and pitching in blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the situation Juan Acevedo of the St. Louis Cardinals  
found himself in Saturday night. There was absolutely nothing on 
the line when he entered a 7-0 game in the sixth inning and worked 
two low-key scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has humbled me,'' Acevedo said. ``Not that I wasn't  
humble before, but this really has humbled me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo was Mr. Automatic the second half of last season when  
the Cardinals converted the former starter and he responded with 15 
saves in 16 opportunities. As Mark McGwire put the finishing 
touches on his record 70-homer season, Acevedo didn't allow a run 
in his final 16 outings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately he's been automatic trouble. Allowing seven earned runs  
in 3 2-3 innings in four outings led to his middle-inning stint 
Saturday. In that span he had two blown saves, a loss and a victory 
he didn't deserve. 
</P>
<P>
	He's seeing the flip side of the life of a closer and learning  
to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reporter kept asking me in spring training how I was going  
to be able to bounce back from something like this, and I laughed 
at him,'' Acevedo said. ``I really never thought this would happen 
to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa hoped it wouldn't, but knew a setback  
probably was inevitable because of the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the toughest three outs in baseball,'' La Russa  
said. ``You know what they did for eight innings. You watch the 
game and you know how much the club invested in it, and it's all on 
your shoulders. I mean, it's a hellacious job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After one of those miserable performances, Acevedo worked out  
his frustrations by rearranging the furniture in his apartment. 
After spoiling seven shutout innings by Darren Oliver Friday night, 
allowing the Pittsburgh Pirates to score two runs and tie the 
score, he got a pep talk from his brother on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo's biggest problem is a lack of confidence in his slider  
and curveball. His reluctance to throw the offspeed stuff has made 
him predictable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you lose the feel for the breaking ball because the role  
you're playing is so critical, anyone would have the tendency not 
to want to get hurt with it,'' pitching coach Dave Duncan said. 
``So you avoid using it. He's pretty much been fastball, fastball, 
fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hence, the remedial work. For at least the next few days, the  
Cardinals likely will try Ricky Bottalico and Scott Radinsky in the 
closer role as Acevedo works out his problems. Among the 
adjustments are a new grip for the curve and slider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go back out there, that's the only way you get over  
it,'' Acevedo said. ``I would understand if they want to go to 
Ricky or Rad more often now in the ninth, but I'm not worried about 
that. I just want to get my stuff back together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acevedo believes one of his problems is he's in perfect health.  
Last year he battled elbow woes, frequenting an acupuncturist for 
relief, but his stuff hasn't been the same since the pain went 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great and I think that's part of the problem,'' Acevedo  
said. ``Last year I always had that achy elbow or forearm and I was 
in one of those zones that was unbelievable. Somehow, I've got to 
get back to that zone.''

<HEADLINE> Loyal Son Who Wants To Be President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- As the loyal son, George W. Bush was aboard  
for the unhappy ride when his father lost the White House in 1992 -- 
a rough year but an instructive one, he recalls now. 
</P>
<P>
	There's less stress, he says, in running himself. Although he is  
just beginning his active presidential campaign, he is leading the 
polls as an undeclared candidate for the 2000 Republican 
nomination. The tense times are coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big difference between being the loyal son who went  
to the wall for his dad, as opposed to being the person who's 
looking to lead,'' the Texas governor said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, the political relationship between the George Bush who  
was president and the George Bush who would like to be is more than 
circumspect. They seldom appear together. When they did, briefly, 
two weeks ago at coincidental events in Dallas, there were 
photographs, no questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president has made one fund-raising appearance for  
his son, in Phoenix, invitation-only, remarks unrecorded. When he 
spoke at a Republican National Committee fund-raising dinner in 
Washington on April 28, he didn't mention Gov. Bush. ``I believe it 
is essential that we put a Republican in the White House,'' he 
said. ``We have good people who are running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, he is for the one with his name. ``He says that if  
you choose to go for it, I'll be with you, son,'' Bush said in an 
ABC interview Monday. ``And as importantly, my mother has said if 
you go for it, I'll be with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should George W. make it in 2000, the Bushs would be the only  
father-son presidents since John Adams, the second, and John Quincy 
Adams, the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bush is readying his campaign with his own team. There may  
be back channel contacts for advice from veterans who served in his 
father's administration, but publicly, only one is a top Bush 
advisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Condoleeza Rice, provost at Stanford University, served at the  
National Security Council for President Bush. She is on Gov. Bush's 
exploratory campaign committee, and advises him on foreign policy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Name recognition was a major plus for Bush when he upset a  
Democrat to win election as governor of Texas in 1994. The asset is 
indelible, and he has his own record in office, plus a landslide 
re-election in 1998, to run on now. His sensitivity about claiming 
an inheritance from his father's presidency shows when a questioner 
mentions the Bush-Colin Powell doctrine that framed the use of U.S. 
troops in the Persian Gulf War. Answering, Bush gently amends that 
to make it the Powell doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	A question about the contrast between the uptight Bush of the  
1992 campaign and the seemingly more relaxed Bush of this one 
brings a moment of reflection on then and now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw my Dad losing,'' Bush said. ``It was a very difficult  
time. And it's hard for me to share what it means for me to see 
somebody who's given me the greatest gift of all, which is 
unconditional love, going down the tubes. And it hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And can he really be more relaxed about his own fortunes?  
</P>
<P>
	``I am. I am. This is a different level of intensity ...  
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-two was a rough year. It was a difficult year.''  
</P>
<P>
	It is said in a softened voice, but with a trace of bitterness  
at ``people who should have been his allies and his strong 
supporters'' but turned away when they saw the president's 
prospects slumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I learned a lot about Washington and loyalty,'' Bush  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``... I've just got a better appreciation of what to expect.  
Some people will be for me because they think I'd be a good 
president, a good man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people will be for me because they think it's in their  
best interests -- and I've learned to discern the difference,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that will make for a more honest candidate.'' He  
catches himself because he isn't supposed to be one yet. 
``Operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody loves a winner,'' he said. ``You learn the character  
of people when things are not so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things are good now, of course. Bush is the GOP leader. The  
polls are promising. There's campaign money in the bank, and more 
coming every day. 
</P>
<P>
	But there will inevitably be difficult times, too. Times to test  
the strength of the early endorsements Bush is reaping. 
</P>
<P>
	And to test the candidate himself.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Linebacker Jamir Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Outside linebacker Jamir Miller, who led the  
Arizona Cardinals last year with 150 tackles, agreed Monday to a 
$1.3 million, one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns, The 
Tribune reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix, said Miller  
will sign with the expansion team this week after agent Leigh 
Steinberg and the Browns finalize the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal reportedly includes incentives that could raise the  
total to $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns told the Tribune late Monday that they had not yet  
been notified of Miller's acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one-year contract allows Jamir to be in a situation where  
he'll certainly start and showcase himself, and if the experience 
in Cleveland ends up being a great one, that will lead them to 
renegotiate before the year's up,'' Steinberg said. ``If for 
whatever reason he's unsure, he'll become an unrestricted free 
agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller rejected a $6 million, two-year offer from the Cardinals  
in March, when he was with another agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a timing and pacing in free agency that obviously got  
off the track somehow because the nature of major deals in free 
agency is that they come in the beginning,'' Steinberg told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals prepared for Miller's expected departure by  
signing free-agent Rob Fredrickson and drafting Florida linebacker 
Johnny Rutledge in the second round last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet neither has the size of the 6-foot-5, 260-pound Miller, a  
first-round draft pick in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 25, is the second Cardinal to leave for the Browns,  
joining left tackle Lomas Brown.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Targets Nervous School Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Eleven students are suspended for putting a  
satirical essay on their personal Web site. A teen-ager is sent to 
the police station for wearing black clothing. A student is 
interrogated about the chemistry book he's carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, American Civil Liberties Union offices say  
they're being swamped by complaints that nervous school officials 
are trampling students' constitutional rights since the April 20 
shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to have become a witch hunt. I'm sure we've gotten  
hundreds of phone calls,'' said Ann Beeson, a staff attorney at the 
ACLU's national headquarters in New York. ``Most school officials 
are not aware or not focusing on the fact that students are 
citizens, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Daniels of the ACLU in Ohio said the most serious of more  
than two dozen complaints to his office involved 11 students from 
Brimfield, a small town about 30 miles southeast of Cleveland. The 
students had a Web site for the Gothic subculture of youths who 
wear black, listen to rocker Marilyn Manson and think a lot about 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Colorado gunmen embraced some Goth trappings but also  
exhibited racist attitudes and violence that most in the Goth world 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site, filled with images of dragons and castles and dark  
poetry, had been created months before the Littleton shootings but 
was updated with comment on the massacre. The students called 
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fellow ``freaks'' and 
sarcastically praised them. 
</P>
<P>
	One statement read: ``I wonder how long it'll be before we're  
allowed to wear our trenchcoats anymore. You know those screwed up 
kids in Colorado were wearing them, so that means I will also kill 
someone, and so will all my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timm Mackley, the school district's superintendent, said the Web  
site was obscene and had a threatening tone. He suspended the 
students, but the ACLU successfully fought their expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students were engaging in protected speech, off campus,''  
Daniels said. ``The school says they can punish them for that type 
of speech and behavior. What's next? Regulating conversations off 
campus?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A consultant on school security cautioned that while there may  
be some overreaction, heightened awareness now may be uncovering 
real threats that predate Littleton, as well as ``spinoff-type 
incidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep getting asked the question, `Is Littleton a wake-up  
call?' My question is, are we going to hit the snooze button and go 
to sleep?'' said Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety 
and Security Services in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Firm, fair and consistent enforcement of school rules and the  
law'' is the only recourse for school administrators, Trump said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU officials said most of the complaints they're hearing deal  
with teens getting in trouble for wearing trenchcoats or dressing 
in black. Some other cases: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 13-year-old Arizona boy was given in-school detention for  
carrying an electronics magazine with ads for guns. The boy was 
arrested when he drew a cartoon showing the school blowing up. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A 14-year-old Pennsylvania girl was suspended for telling a  
teacher in a class conversation on the Littleton shootings that she 
could understand how someone who is teased endlessly could snap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An Illinois student was questioned by a psychiatrist for 1 1/2  
hours about the video games he plays and asked if he ever looks for 
bomb-making instructions on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really scares me. Anybody who doesn't fit into a specific  
category or dresses differently or is considered a nerd or a geek, 
all of a sudden they're a suspect. The students are losing their 
constitutional rights,'' said Andy Brumme, staff counsel for the 
ACLU in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme represented a 17-year-old North Augusta, S.C., student  
who was suspended for criticizing his principal and ROTC teachers 
at Midland Valley High School. On his personal Web page, he told 
ROTC teachers to ``eat feces and die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators had talked to the teen about the Web site  
before but didn't take action until after the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ludicrous to think that's a threat,'' Brumme said.  
``People are reacting instead of thinking.'' Brumme said the 
student had a good case but agreed to remove the criticism and 
apologize so he could graduate and go on to college this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brumme said he was considering filing a complaint after police  
searched three suburban Columbia high school students who were sent 
to the principal's office for wearing all black. He said one of the 
students was asked why he was carrying a chemistry book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are saying that school safety comes first and  
students' rights second. That's wrong,'' said Eleanor Eisenberg, 
executive director of the ACLU in Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Lifting Jobs Cause Most Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jobs that require heavy lifting are getting  
extra attention from safety officials because of high rates of 
injury and illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing homes, trucking companies and warehouses led a list of  
nearly 12,500 workplaces where the number of days lost to 
job-related health problems convinced the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to suggest bosses examine how they might keep 
their employees healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprises a lot of people that nursing home work is one of  
the most dangerous occupations in America -- more dangerous than 
working in a coal mine or a steel mill,'' said Andrew L. Stern, 
president of the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers on the receiving end of the special notices said they  
had been working on safety improvements for a long time, and noted 
they were targeted on the basis of 1997 data. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was two years ago,'' said Dan Springer, vice president of  
public relations for Beverly Enterprises Inc., an Arkansas-based 
nursing home chain. ``Over the course of the last couple years, 
recognizing the strain that is inherent in our business ... we've 
taken action to mitigate workplace injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Roughly three-quarters of the injuries, and probably more,  
that take place in a nursing home relative to workers' 
compensation, are back-related and that's due to the lifting of 
residents, primarily,'' Springer said. He said the company has 
invested $15 million in mechanical lifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has spent $5 million on training in the proper  
techniques for lifting patients who are unable to get out of a bed 
or chair unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
	United Parcel Service, which joined Beverly at the top of the  
list of companies receiving multiple OSHA notices, has spent nearly 
$1 billion since 1995 on improving health and safety programs, said 
spokesman Tom Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Days lost to disability have been on the decline at UPS,  
dropping by 7.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, Walsh 
said. He attributed that to a recent company effort to work with 
its unions to encourage safer work practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters union, which opposes UPS positions on the need for  
new safety standards, gives the company credit for recent efforts 
to improve safety. ``I do see some positive things that they're 
doing,'' said Lamont Byrd, the union's director of safety and 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSHA notification letters, mailed in late April, were the  
result of answers to a mandatory 1997 survey of workplaces. Sites 
were selected for the special letters based on the number of 
employee days reported lost to work-related illness or injury. The 
construction industry, which accounts for nearly half of all OSHA 
inspections, was exempted because of the temporary nature of its 
work sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is OSHA's most extensive effort to reduce workplace  
hazards since a federal appeals court blocked the use of the 
agency's cooperative compliance program, under which employers with 
the highest injury rates could reduce their odds of being inspected 
by voluntarily adopting a safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed with business groups who argued that  
the compliance program was coercive. OSHA has not decided whether 
to appeal that ruling, but in the new round of notifications it 
struck a far more conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA recognizes that an elevated lost workday illness and  
injury rate does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in 
safety and health on the part of your business,'' its letter said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise, Ending Two-Session Skid / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices reversed a two-session skid on  
Monday as investors looked to take advantage of the highest yields 
since last June. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors scooped up bonds, which now have some of the highest  
yields in nearly a year. But the gains were limited in advance of 
Treasury sales of $15 billion of five-year notes on Tuesday and $12 
billion of 10-year notes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices were higher Monday in the broader market as well.  
Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose between 1/32 point 
and 3/32 point. Intermediate maturities rose 1/16 point, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.59 percent as the  
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from late Friday to 4.47 
percent. Six-month yields were 4.68 percent, as the discount rose 
0.01 percentage point from late Friday to 4.51 percent. One-year 
yields were 4.74 percent as the discount fell by 0.02 percentage 
point from late Friday to 4.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, remained unchanged at 4.69 percent from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 122 11/16. The average 
yield to maturity slipped to 5.33 percent from 5.37 late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Louima Cross-Examined in Cop Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Haitian immigrant who says he was brutalized  
by police in a stationhouse bathroom admitted he lied about some of 
his story Monday but blamed medication, a faulty memory and bad 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was under medication,'' Abner Louima said when confronted  
with past comments contradicting his testimony from last week. 
``And my memory, it wasn't clear like it is now, today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation that police sodomized Louima with a broomstick  
shocked the community. Along with this year's police shooting of an 
unarmed African immigrant, it has strained relations between the 
Police Department and the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	During Louima's second day on the stand in the trial of five  
white police officers, defense attorney Marvyn Kornberg suggested 
Louima changed his story to support a lawsuit suit filed on his 
behalf by O.J. Simpson ``Dream Team'' lawyers Johnnie Cochran Jr., 
Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. 
</P>
<P>
	``Has your memory gotten better since you retained Mr. Cochran,  
Mr. Scheck and Mr. Neufeld in a $155 million lawsuit?'' Kornberg 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' Louima replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg, who represents Officer Justin Volpe, cross-examined  
Louima in a booming voice. The witness sometimes responded with 
long pauses and blank stares. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg noted that Louima, while in the hospital in 1997, gave  
a statement to a grand jury saying no other officer held him down 
as Volpe allegedly sodomized him with a broken broomstick. Last 
week, Louima testified that an officer restrained him by grabbing 
the chain of his handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, 32, had also identified Volpe as the officer who hit him  
in the head with a police radio -- contradicting grand jury 
testimony in which he couldn't identify the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness insisted his trial testimony was more accurate  
because ``I've had more time to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Louima left the stand to demonstrate the position  
he was in at the time of the alleged bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't on my knees,'' he said, leaning over. ``My feet was  
down ... Like I was close to down, but I wasn't completely on the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louima also said he took the advice of some fellow Haitian  
immigrants and lied when he said that an officer had said ``it's 
Giuliani time'' -- a reference to the law-and-order policies of 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``You lied under oath to the grand jury, didn't you?'' Kornberg  
pressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' Louima replied quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	Louima was hospitalized with severe internal injuries after the  
incident, which prompted demonstrations against police brutality. 
In opening statements, Kornberg suggested the injuries may have 
come from homosexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe is among four officers charged with beating Louima because  
they believed -- mistakenly -- he had sucker-punched Volpe in a melee 
outside a Brooklyn nightclub in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe and Officer Charles Schwarz are also charged with the  
bathroom attack. A fifth officer is charged with covering up the 
assault.

<HEADLINE> `The Mummy' Takes In $44 Million / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy,'' a remake of the 1932 Boris  
Karloff classic, survived mixed reviews to set a record for the 
biggest movie opening ever outside summer, grossing $43.4 million 
over Mother's Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening ranked 9th among the top 10 all-time weekends,  
according to final figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal Studios President Ron Meyer said he had expected a  
debut closer to $30 million for the horror and special-effects film 
starring Brendan Fraser. The remake was Universal's third-largest 
opening, exceeded only by ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' ($90.2 
million) and ``Jurassic Park'' ($47 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Other top films in North America over the Mother's Day weekend  
included ``Entrapment,'' the Sean Connery cat-burglar adventure, 
dropping to No. 2 with a take of $12.3 million in its second 
weekend of release. The Keanu Reeves sci-fi movie ``The Matrix'' 
was third with $5.9 million in its sixth weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick,  
was fourth with $3.2 million, followed by ``Never Been Kissed'' at 
$3 million and ``Analyze This'' $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Matrix'' leads 1999 films with $138.5 million, and  
``Analyze This'' with Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal passed the 
$100 million mark after 10 weeks in theaters.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Mixed; Dow Down 24.06 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, with blue chips  
slipping after reaching record levels last week and the Nasdaq 
composite climbing on renewed buying of Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was off 24.06 11,007.53. The  
blue chip index was down as much as 65 points in early trading 
before climbing into positive territory and then retreating a 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow rose 84.77 to close at 11,031.59, its second  
record high close for the week and the second time it finished 
above 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 3.82 at 1,341.18, but the Nasdaq composite index 
was up 22.44 at 2,526.06, largely on the strength of Internet 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue-chip stocks fell in a reversal of last week's trading  
pattern, in which investors were selling technology shares and 
buying those of economically sensitive, or cyclical, companies. 
Today, they were doing the opposite, pushing down such deep 
cyclical names as GM, down 1 1/16 at 85 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	One exception was aluminum stocks, which rose after a Credit  
Suisse First Boston upgraded Kaiser Aluminum. Kaiser's stock was up 
7/16 at 8 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclicals fell even as bond prices rose after Yugoslavia's army  
announced a partial withdrawal of military and police forces from 
Kosovo. The 30-year Treasury bond was up 3/8 point, while its yield 
fell to 5.78 percent from 5.81 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, worries about interest rates prompted stock market  
investors to sell. Higher rates usually means lower corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future direction of interest rates is still a concern to  
stock investors, which is why today's drop in bond yields didn't 
bolster stocks, said Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at 
Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, merger news moved some stocks. HSBC Holdings PLC is  
buying Republic National Bank of New York and an affiliated banking 
company for about $10.3 billion in cash. Under the agreement, HSBC 
will pay $72 a share for Republic New York Corp. and Safra Republic 
Holdings SA. Republic's stock was down 1 13/16 at 68 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chevron Corp. is discussing a purchase of Texaco Inc. for  
about $42 billion in stock, The Wall Street Journal reported today.

combination faces enormous hurdles. Chevron, a Dow stock, was up 
13/16 at 95 11/16, while Texaco rose 5/16 to 67 9/16.

<HEADLINE> Faulty Pump, Seal Blamed in Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Investigators hauled a sunken tourist  
boat from the bottom of Lake Hamilton in hopes of learning why a 
drive-shaft seal and bilge-pump hose failed, sending 13 passengers 
to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II-vintage vessel sank in less than a minute May  
1. A Navy salvage team brought it to the surface Sunday and then to 
land. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony was to begin today in the Marine Safety Board inquiry,  
to be conducted where the boat was taken -- the Air National Guard 
Armory at the Hot Springs airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person scheduled to testify was the Coast Guard  
inspector who deemed the boat safe in a February inspection, said 
Capt. Glenn Anderson, leader of the Coast Guard investigation. 
Testimony from survivors, the boat driver and its owner also are on 
tap. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting its own 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting their first up-close look at the Miss Majestic tourist  
boat -- called a duck because it traveled on both land and water -- 
investigators noted 28 life jackets were still on board, as was a 
life ring. Eight of the 21 people aboard survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jackets did not serve their purpose,'' Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson observed that a seal on the drive shaft that propels  
the vehicle's wheels for operations on land was pushed forward on 
the shaft by about 3 inches, opening a hole in the bottom of the 
boat. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, sections of a rubber bilge-pump hose that  
was supposed to have carried water out of the boat became separated 
from a metal section. A clamp that normally would hold the sections 
together still was attached to the rubber hose. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination meant that, once water began flooding the bottom  
of the vessel's hull, the bilge pump circulated the water back into 
the boat, instead of outside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of details all go wrong together for a casualty like  
this,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to find out why the parts failed. Investigators  
on Sunday looked the boat over but mechanics did not dismantle any 
parts. That will come later, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as was the case Sunday, representatives of the boat's  
owner, Don Bridges, will be on hand so there will be no question 
later of how evidence was handled, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, officials said the driver of the boat, Elizabeth  
Helmbrecht, told them she had taken the vessel in for repairs two 
days before the accident because a seal around a drive shaft was 
leaking. The fatal trip was the first for the boat since then, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat sank about seven minutes into its voyage.

<HEADLINE>  Pete Rose Back with Independent Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- It was a scene millions of baseball  
fans would recognize from their youth. It was a scene that could 
keep baseball commissioner Bud Selig awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Rose, baseball's banned career hits leader, was back on a  
diamond with a bat in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose hit fungoes to outfielders for the Sacramento Steelheads of  
the Western Baseball League on Monday as part of his role as 
special instructor for the newly created team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can still hit, I just can't run. I still have good  
hand-to-eye coordination,'' said Rose, who slammed liners and sharp 
grounders toward the aspiring major leaguers. ``I'm 58 years old -- 
I don't look it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, indeed, looks pretty good. He has gotten heavier and is  
slowed by aching knees. But he is tanned and fit, and retains the 
intense gaze and peripatetic style that were among his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a black long-sleeved shirt Monday, along with designer  
sunglasses and a Steelheads cap. In addition to working with the 
players and giving them a 75-minute inspirational speech Monday, 
Rose will be back May 28 to toss out the ceremonial first pitch at 
Sacramento's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who insists the stint as special instructor is not an  
effort to generate public support for his bid to overturn the ban, 
will get paid about $50,000 to work with players averaging $1,250 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just to help Sacramento. This is not to help Pete  
Rose. This is fun,'' he said. ``I don't go to bed every night and 
pray I can go to the Hall of Fame. I can't live my life in the 
past. Life goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, a 17-time All-Star and the NL MVP in 1973, agreed in  
August 1989 to accept a lifetime ban after commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti concluded Rose bet on games involving the Cincinnati Reds 
while he was their manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose served five months at a federal prison after pleading  
guilty in April 1990 to two counts of filing false income tax 
returns by failing to report $354,968 in income from autograph 
appearances, memorabilia sales and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The career leader in hits with 4,256 and games with 3,562 is  
ineligible for the Hall of Fame as long as the ban is in effect. 
Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but has not 
received a response from Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 14 people banned for life by baseball for gambling  
has been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was scheduled to give a 15-minute pep talk to the  
Steelheads, but ended up giving a 75-minute speech while standing 
near the pitcher's mound at Sacramento City College's Union 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible to sit and listen to him. I'm 34 and I wish I  
could be 20 again and hear that speech,'' said catcher Tim 
McIntosh, a former major leaguer who went to spring training with 
the New York Yankees this year and hopes his stint in Sacramento is 
a springboard to another big league job. ``He's an idol. He a god. 
You see a lot of guys coming through the clubhouse, but he's got 
4,000 hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose is banned from going on the field and clubhouses of any  
major league team, or any minor league team in organized baseball. 
The Western Baseball League is independent and not covered by those 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he gave a speech to Reds minor leaguers last week in  
Rockford, Ill., but Monday's appearance was the first time he's 
actually worked with players since the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig's spokesman, Rich Levin, was unaware of the Rockford  
speech but said if Rose spoke with Reds minor leaguers, it would 
appear to violate the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden said one of the team's minor  
league officials was in Rockford when Rose visited and had been 
reminded of the terms of Rose's ban. Rockford general manager Bruce 
Keiter also was informed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden was unaware of any speech Rose may have made to the minor  
leaguers. Keiter did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no violations to our knowledge while he was  
there,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads players said they know about the ban, but appreciated  
hearing from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't idolize Pete Rose, but I respect his accomplishments.  
I loved watching him play,'' said pitcher Ryan Bowen, who played 
for the Houston Astros and Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelheads owner Bruce Portner said he went looking for a  
controversial figure to create a buzz around his expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it's for publicity. It helps keep Sacramento in the  
nation's eyes as a baseball town. Remember, there's been no 
professional baseball here for 25 years,'' Portner said. ``Let's 
face it, he's Pete Rose. He's banned but also a legend in 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose said he'd like to return to the majors as a manager  
someday, in large part because ``the pay is good,'' and believes 
Selig eventually will give him another chance. But he couldn't 
resist taking a swipe at major league officials for the recent 
series between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is a great country for getting second  
opportunities, though sometimes it takes a while. The fans want me 
back,'' he said. ``Do fans want Bud Selig sitting next to (Fidel) 
Castro? Ask the fans in south Florida now.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Activate Closer Gordon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox closer Tom Gordon, who has  
converted a major league-record 46 straight save chances, was 
activated from the 15-day disabled list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon last pitched April 17 against Tampa Bay when he walked  
off the mound in the ninth inning with what was diagnosed as a 
``strained elbow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who has converted his first three save situations this  
season to extend his record, had not allowed an earned run in five 
games before the injury. He has recorded 11 outs in the five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flash is back,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said before the  
game, referring to the right-hander's nickname. ``He's our 
closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon experienced pain in his elbow during spring training and  
missed the first two weeks of games. 
</P>
<P>
	During is absence, the Red Sox tried a few closers, the last was  
knuckleballer Tim Wakefield, who converted his only two chances. 
Derek Lowe and Kip Gross also had opportunities, going just 
2-for-4. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Gordon, the Red Sox optioned infielder Donnie  
Sadler to Pawtucket after Sunday's game.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices declined in morning trading  
Tuesday as investors locked in profits following recent rapid 
advances. The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 137.39 points, or 0.81 percent,  
moving to 16,839.62 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, 
the average gained 30.49 points, or 0.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.49 yen at late morning, down 0.37 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo and also just below its level of 120.50 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors took profits Tuesday morning,  
keeping the Nikkei below 17,000. The Nikkei index surged to close 
at 17,300.61 points on Thursday -- its highest close since Oct. 24, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nikkei's 17,000 level prompts selling, but the downside is  
seen solid,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, deputy general manager at Nikko 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese blue chips were mixed following the sluggish  
performance of their U.S. counterparts on Wall Street and the yen's 
rise against the dollar Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 11.16 points, or 0.81 percent, to 1,362.70. 
The TOPIX closed up 5.44 points, or 0.40 percent, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on news late Monday  
that the Yugoslav army had announced a partial withdrawal of 
military and police forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades, however, remained in a narrow range in the absence of  
fresh incentives, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.96 yen, up from  
129.38 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.330  
percent from Monday's close of 1.335 percent, driving its price up 
to 104.18 yen from 104.13 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovars Protest Refugee Beatings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STENKOVEC, Macedonia (AP) -- Chanting ``NATO, NATO!'' angry  
Kosovo Albanians protested the alleged beating of two refugees 
today by Macedonian police and demanded that NATO take control of 
the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. refugee workers persuaded the estimated 2,000 ethnic  
Albanians to disperse after promising them that NATO 
representatives would meet at an undetermined time with a small 
refugee delegation to discuss their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said the spontaneous protest, which lasted less  
than an hour, was a sign of how tensions are building in the camps 
among traumatized refugees driven from their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble at Stenkovec I camp, which houses about 23,000  
people, came after two refugees said they were seized by Macedonia 
police earlier in the day and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the refugees, Milaim Gashi, said he was relaxing beside a  
camp fence talking to relatives when the police came, took him and 
a friend to the station and roughed him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had enough of massacres and beatings,'' said Milaim  
Kastrati, a Kosovo refugee leading the protest. ``We don't want the 
Macedonian police to beat us up now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One police officer, who refused to give his name, said the two  
were detained because they were ``doing something'' to the fence, a 
strand of yellow tape similar to that used to seal off crime 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp manager for the U.N. refugee agency, Aurvasi Patel,  
quoted police as saying the men were trampling on the fence. Police 
said they responded with ``normal police procedure,'' taking him to 
the station and searching him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told (the refugees) we would make sure their case goes to  
the highest level if they disperse and we told them if it's a 
delegation, NATO will speak to the delegation,'' Patel said. ``But 
NATO won't be here to patrol every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camps, which were constructed by NATO troops and then handed  
over to Macedonian authorities, house ethnic Albanian refugees who 
fled Serb authorities in Kosovo after NATO launched its bombing 
campaign March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters want NATO to retake control of the camps.  
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's government is concerned that the influx of about  
228,000 ethnic Albanians will upset the delicate balance between 
Macedonians and Albanians in this former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High  
Commissioner for Refugees, warned that the Macedonian tent cities 
were ``on the verge of rioting'' because of overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have fled Kosovo, a  
province in southern Serbia. Most of the refugees have gone to 
Albania, which has been more receptive to them than mostly Slavic 
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovars Protest Refugee Beatings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STENKOVEC, Macedonia (AP) -- Chanting ``NATO, NATO!'' angry  
Kosovo Albanians protested the alleged beating of two refugees 
today by Macedonian police and demanded that NATO take control of 
the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. refugee workers persuaded the estimated 2,000 ethnic  
Albanians to disperse after promising them that NATO 
representatives would meet at an undetermined time with a small 
refugee delegation to discuss their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said the spontaneous protest, which lasted less  
than an hour, was a sign of how tensions are building in the camps 
among traumatized refugees driven from their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble at Stenkovec I camp, which houses about 23,000  
people, came after two refugees said they were seized by Macedonia 
police earlier in the day and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the refugees, Milaim Gashi, said he was relaxing beside a  
camp fence talking to relatives when the police came, took him and 
a friend to the station and roughed him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had enough of massacres and beatings,'' said Milaim  
Kastrati, a Kosovo refugee leading the protest. ``We don't want the 
Macedonian police to beat us up now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One police officer, who refused to give his name, said the two  
were detained because they were ``doing something'' to the fence, a 
strand of yellow tape similar to that used to seal off crime 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp manager for the U.N. refugee agency, Aurvasi Patel,  
quoted police as saying the men were trampling on the fence. Police 
said they responded with ``normal police procedure,'' taking him to 
the station and searching him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told (the refugees) we would make sure their case goes to  
the highest level if they disperse and we told them if it's a 
delegation, NATO will speak to the delegation,'' Patel said. ``But 
NATO won't be here to patrol every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The camps, which were constructed by NATO troops and then handed  
over to Macedonian authorities, house ethnic Albanian refugees who 
fled Serb authorities in Kosovo after NATO launched its bombing 
campaign March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters want NATO to retake control of the camps.  
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's government is concerned that the influx of about  
228,000 ethnic Albanians will upset the delicate balance between 
Macedonians and Albanians in this former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High  
Commissioner for Refugees, warned that the Macedonian tent cities 
were ``on the verge of rioting'' because of overcrowded conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 700,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have fled Kosovo, a  
province in southern Serbia. Most of the refugees have gone to 
Albania, which has been more receptive to them than mostly Slavic 
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Duval vs. Woods in Made-for-TV Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	David Duval and Tiger Woods have spent the past two months  
denying a rivalry. An 18-hole exhibition between them on prime-time 
television probably won't change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't determine the best players,'' Duval said Monday  
during a conference call to announce the ``Showdown at Sherwood,'' 
which ABC Sports will televise live Aug. 2 at Sherwood Country Club 
in Thousand Oaks, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't heat up whatever rivalry there might be because  
it's a one-day match,'' he said. ``It's not the U.S. Open or the 
Masters, it's not Sunday when you go head-to-head. It's a great way 
to gain more exposure to the game through what might be 
nontraditional golf fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, No. 1 in the world for 41 consecutive weeks until Duval  
unseated him after The Players Championship, compared the 
exhibition to challenge matches once played between Arnold Palmer 
and Gary Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance where David and I can compete head-to-head, beat  
each other's brains out, walk away and say it was great for the 
game of golf,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purse will be $1.5 million, with $1.1 million going to the  
winner. Each player will donate $100,000 to The First Tee program, 
and an additional $100,000 to the charity of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports president Howard Katz said the match, which will be  
shown from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT, will preempt summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will surpass what we normally get in that time  
period,'' Katz said. ``It's not the British Open. We're not going 
to prove who the world's greatest player is. We want to entertain 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What could help an otherwise made-for-TV event are the players.  
Woods gave golf a huge lift when he became the first player of 
color to win the Masters in 1997, and did so with such an 
astonishing, record-breaking performance that he became the top 
icon in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has won only twice on tour since July 1997, and Duval has  
risen to the top of the rankings with equally dominant play. Not 
only did Duval shoot the first Sunday 59 in tour history to win the 
Bob Hope Classic, he became the first player in 25 years to win 
four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a much-anticipated Sunday showdown between them didn't  
materialize at Augusta National and has never happened in their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless that happens in the U.S. Open or British Open or any  
other event between now and August, fans will have to settle for a 
manufactured event with only pride at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to play against the world No. 1, David Duval, is  
not only a fabulous treat for myself but for anyone watching the 
tournament,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he had reservations about playing the match, fearful  
that it would draw too much attention to them and not enough on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he and I could expose the game to a broader  
audience,'' Duval said. ``ABC came in and has given us the 
platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the PGA Tour cannot endorse the exhibition, it has agreed  
to give the players the television release they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``The popularity of David Duval and Tiger Woods and their recent  
competition for the No. 1 position has set up this contest as a 
very compelling viewing opportunity,'' said Henry Hughes, senior 
vice president chief of operations for the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval has been more successful the past two years, he does  
not have the ratings strength of Woods, which helped the PGA Tour 
negotiate a 40 percent increase in its new television contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval isn't even sure how many nongolf fans know who he is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tiger is obviously a very critical piece of this  
puzzle,'' Duval said. ``He has obviously drawn in a much broader 
audience than I conceivably ever well. He's had a lot of burdens to 
carry. To win as often as he has with all the outside issues is a 
wonderful achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be a golf star, but I think Tiger is a star,'' he  
said. ``He transcends the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players are hoping their exhibition will do that, too.

<HEADLINE> Playoffs Don't Faze Physical 76ers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Don't try to tell the Philadelphia 76ers  
what teams lacking postseason experience are supposed to do in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons they're up 1-0 in their best-of-5 Eastern  
Conference series with the Orlando Magic is because coach Larry 
Brown built his team with this time of the year in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody talks about how much people step up defensively and  
how aggressive the game is in the playoffs,'' said center Matt 
Geiger, who had 23 points and 10 rebounds in Philadelphia's 104-90 
victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's our style of play. That's why we won 28 games this  
year. And I think that's why we're going to do well in the 
playoffs. ... We really play a physical, aggressive style of 
basketball. That's why we had a lot of confidence coming in here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson scored 30 points and the 76ers limited Orlando to  
36 percent shooting while outrebounding the Magic 57-36 in the 
opener. To even the series Tuesday night, Orlando not only will 
have to contain the NBA scoring champion but find a way to keep 
Philadelphia from dominating the backboards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play our own style of basketball,'' Iverson said. ``I think  
our style of play is just defense. Simple as that. We feel like if 
we can't throw a rock in the ocean, defense can get us over the 
hump. That's how we approach games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magic coach Chuck Daly said he wasn't surprised by how well the  
76ers played in their first postseason game in eight years. He 
hopes his players now realize what they're up against in this 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suggested if you're feeling sorry for yourselves, there's  
not any sympathy out there. Not from the fans. Not from the 
opposing team,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to compete. Not on every other play, but every  
single play. ... I talked to them before the game about 
desperation, that a lot of their players haven't been to the 
playoffs. And if they have, it was a long time ago. So, you've got 
to play with more desperation on every possession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic vowed to do as much for the remainder of the series,  
which shifts to Philadelphia for Game 3 on Thursday night. Orlando 
has never won a playoff series after dropping the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really embarrassing,'' said Penny Hardaway, the Magic's  
four-time All-Star guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming in (Tuesday night), and it's war time. If we're  
going to go out, we're going go out playing hard. If they're going 
to push us in the back, let's push them in the back. If they're 
going to punch us, let's punch them. ... We played like it was a 
regular season game. They played it like it was a playoff game. 
They came in like they should have come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando used four different defenders, including Hardaway,  
against Iverson on Sunday. When Daly arrived at work Monday, he had 
a message from a fan claiming to have the answer to containing the 
scoring champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he returned the call out of curiosity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got all of his suggestions. They were pretty much a lot of  
the things that we see and already know,'' Daly said, adding that 
the one approach Orlando won't take is to concede Iverson his 
points while focusing on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw him get 39,'' Daly said, referring to April 25 when  
Iverson actually had 38 to pace a 17-point rout of the Magic in 
Philadelphia. ``They killed us.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 27.49 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today, responding to a drop  
in interest rates in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 27.49 at 11,059.08 . The  
Dow lost as much as 65 points in early trading before regaining 
ground. On Friday, the Dow rose 84.77 to close at 11,031.59, its 
second record high close for the week and the second time it 
finished above 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher at midday after a mixed  
morning. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.23 at 1,345.23, 
and the Nasdaq composite index was up 16.25 at 2,519.87, largely on 
the strength of Internet shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose after Yugoslavia's army announced a partial  
withdrawal of military and police forces from Kosovo. The 30-year 
Treasury bond was up 3/8 point, while its yield fell to 5.80 percent 
from 5.81 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, worries about interest rates prompted stock market  
investors to sell. Higher rates usually means lower corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, merger news moved some stocks. HSBC Holdings PLC is  
buying Republic National Bank of New York and an affiliated banking 
company for about $10.3 billion in cash. Under the agreement, HSBC 
will pay $72 a share for Republic New York Corp. and Safra Republic 
Holdings SA. Republic's stock was down 1 13/16 at 68 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chevron Corp. is discussing buying Texaco Inc. for about $42  
billion in stock, The Wall Street Journal reported today. The 
newspaper, citing unidentified people familiar with the talks, said 
the companies are not close to an agreement and that a combination 
faces enormous hurdles. Chevron, a Dow stock, was up 9/16 at 95 
7/16, while Texaco rose 13/16 to 68 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were higher on reports that USA Networks will  
abandon its bid to acquire Lycos after concluding it can't win 
approval from Lycos shareholders. Lycos shares were up 8 9/16 at 98 
1/16, and USA Networks rose 3/8 to 35 1/4. Shares of CMGI Inc., a 
holding company that has about a 20 percent stake in Lycos, was up 
7 3/8 at 228 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, two manufacturing groups jointly reported that  
spending on machine tools in March rose 44 percent from the 
previous month, but declined 48 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator  
of the strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall 
economy. Don F. Carlson, president of the Association for 
Manufacturing Technology, said his group expects stronger results 
in the second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues overtook decliners by 1,429 to 1,204 on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 348.2 million shares, 
down from Friday's pace of 380.18.

	Tenn. Jury Sides With Tobacco Cos.  
</P>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of the nation's largest tobacco  
companies were cleared today of liability in the deaths of three 
smokers whose families claimed the companies' cigarettes were 
responsible. All three had lung cancer. The Shelby County Circuit 
Court jury returned its verdict during the fourth day of 
deliberations in the case against Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. The smokers' 
families claimed the companies knowingly sold a dangerous product 
and tried to cover up the risks. They were seeking more than 
$431,000 for medical bills and unspecified punitive damages. In 
similar cases this year a San Francisco woman with inoperable lung 
cancer was awarded $26.5 million and the family of a Portland, 
Ore., man who died of lung cancer was awarded $81 million.

	EU Urged To Reconsider US Beef Ban  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American leaders made a last-minute attempt  
today to persuade the European Union to end a 10-year ban on 
hormone-treated U.S. beef. The EU faces in four days a deadline to 
end the ban or face U.S. trade retaliation. Thursday is the 
deadline set by the World Trade Organization for the union to lift 
the hormone-treated meat ban. In its ruling a year ago, the WTO 
said the ban is illegal and is not supported by the proper risk 
analysis. The Clinton administration has threatened to impose 100 
percent tariffs on more than $900 million worth of European 
products to retaliate for the ban.

partnerships. ``That's nothing new,'' said Jerry Langheim, a 
Lockheed Martin spokesman. The Seattle Times reported yesterday 
that executives from Airbus Industrie and Lockheed Martin have been 
talking about an alliance, including the possibility of a Lockheed 
partnership in Airbus' proposed superjet, the A-3XX. Langheim said 
Lockheed does not intend to make any announcements, nor does it 
intend to invest in Airbus. Lockheed shares were at 42 7/8, down 1.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is joining forces with Web directory service  
Snap.com and Xoom.com, an electronic commerce site, to form a new 
Internet company in an attempt to broaden its online presence. 
Under the deal announced today, the new company, NBC Internet or 
NBCi, will operate under the Snap name online but will include 
content from NBC and the trademark peacock brand. NBC will own 
about half of the new venture and is contributing several of its 
online properties, including NBC.com and Videoseeker.com. NBC is 
also contributing a 10 percent ownership stake in CNBC.com, the 
parent of Snap, to the new venture. Xoom.com shareholders will own 
about a third of the company, and CNET will own about 13 percent. 
NBCi will be a publicly traded company. Stock of NBC's parent 
General Electric was down 1 3/16 at 108. 3/4 today; Xoom.com was up 
6 3/4 at 81 7/8.

	Comcast Earns $73M on Cable Growth  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Comcast Corp., the third-largest cable  
operator in the country, earned $73.5 million in the latest quarter 
on strong growth in its cable operations. The earnings, which 
worked out to 12 cents per share, were ahead of analyst 
expectations and compared with a loss of $86 million, or 11 cents 
per share, for the first quarter of 1998. Revenues for the quarter 
ending March 31 rose 9.5 percent to $1.37 billion from $1.25 
billion. Growth in Comcast's digital cable and high speed Internet 
access businesses helped boost operating cash flow by 38 percent. 
Comcast shares were at 37 7/8, up 1 3/4

percent from 2.3 percent. The long-term prime rate is a benchmark 
for other bank loans. Lower rates on home mortgages and automobile 
and small business loans could follow the cut. The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and The Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. said they would lower the 
rate beginning tomorrow.

	Chevron May Buy Texaco  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chevron Corp. reportedly is discussing buying  
Texaco Inc. for about $42 billion in stock in a deal that would 
unite the nation's third and fourth biggest energy companies. But 
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the companies aren't 
near an agreement and said a combination faces enormous hurdles. 
Large oil companies have been rushing to unite because of falling 
oil prices and the need to cut costs. However, industry analysts 
say a Chevron-Texaco merger would make less sense than other recent 
oil company mergers because both companies have been cutting costs 
on their own and Texaco last year formed a refining partnership 
with Shell Oil, which would present a regulatory stumbling block. 
Chevron shares were at 96 1/8, up 1 3/8. Texaco shares were at 65 7/8, down 
1 3/8.

<HEADLINE>  Pilot Sentenced in Italy Ski Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot who was acquitted of  
manslaughter in the Italian cable car tragedy was sentenced to six 
months in prison and dismissed from the corps Monday for helping 
destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., became the  
first crewman to go to prison in connection with the accident that 
killed 20 people. Because the dismissal takes effect upon his 
release from prison, he was also ordered to forfeit all pay and 
allowances, including those for food and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have gotten as much as 10 years behind bars from the  
military jury that convicted him last week of obstructing justice 
and conspiracy for his actions after the 1998 accident, in which 
his plane sliced through a ski cable in the Italian Alps.

	Ashby stood at attention when the sentence was read by the  
jury's foreman. There was no sound in the courtroom after the judge 
warned Ashby's family against outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby showed no emotion as he left the courthouse with his  
family and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commanding general of Marine Forces  
Atlantic, rejected a request from defense attorney Frank Spinner 
for a deferral of the sentence. Ashby was taken to the brig at Camp 
Lejeune late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner, who said he would appeal the conviction and the  
sentence, seemed especially unhappy with the prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe that this is a case that called for  
confinement,'' he said. ``We do think that the (jurors) had to 
consider the fact that there are people who died in this tragic 
incident. And we are concerned that they let that override their 
objectivity ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	The news of the jail term came too late for the widely watched  
dinner-hour TV news in Italy, and there was no immediate public 
reaction to the sentencing. Italians reacted with outrage after 
Ashby was cleared of manslaughter in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked the jury to sentence Ashby to two years in  
prison and throw him out of the service. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Ashby testified that he took the video out of  
his EA-6B Prowler anti-radar jet after the accident and later gave 
it to his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, at Schweitzer's 
request. Schweitzer said he burned the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer had maintained that the tape, shot just  
before their jet entered the valley where it clipped the cable, 
contained no incriminating information. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that the two got rid of the tape to block the  
investigation of the tragedy and that the footage might have shed 
light on the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to  
obstruction and conspiracy and was ordered dismissed from the 
Marine Corps. The Marines dropped manslaughter charges against 
Schweitzer after Ashby's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare the sentence for Capt. Schweitzer, who was  
the one who actually destroyed the tape, with the sentence Capt. 
Ashby received, it's hard to understand the disparity,'' Spinner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with  
manslaughter soon after the accident, but those charges were 
dismissed.

<HEADLINE>  Pilot Sentenced in Italy Ski Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot who was acquitted of  
manslaughter in the Italian cable car tragedy was sentenced to six 
months in prison and dismissed from the corps Monday for helping 
destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., became the  
first crewman to go to prison in connection with the accident that 
killed 20 people. Because the dismissal takes effect upon his 
release from prison, he was also ordered to forfeit all pay and 
allowances, including those for food and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have gotten as much as 10 years behind bars from the  
military jury that convicted him last week of obstructing justice 
and conspiracy for his actions after the 1998 accident, in which 
his plane sliced through a ski cable in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby stood at attention when the sentence was read by the  
jury's foreman. There was no sound in the courtroom after the judge 
warned Ashby's family against outbursts. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Mother Sentenced for Stomping Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- A woman who pleaded guilty last year to  
stomping death her stepdaughter 38 years ago was sentenced Monday 
to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Rae Morgan, 57, who now lives in Texas, was living in a  
rural Mascoutah farmhouse with her husband in 1961 when his 
4-year-old daughter, Michelle Morgan, died. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Scott Air Force Base, where the girl was pronounced  
dead, considered the death child abuse, but civil authorities took 
no action at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The reopened investigation into Michelle's death began in 1994  
when her brother, George, a Missouri prison inmate, wrote a letter 
seeking clarification of his sister's death certificate. It said 
she died from viral pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	George Morgan, who was 8 at the time of the death, said he  
recalled watching his stepmother stomp on the girl's stomach in a 
fit of anger. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Mrs. Morgan told authorities that Michelle had  
fallen off a wood pile while chasing rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement reached last October, when Mrs. Morgan  
pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, St. Clair County 
Circuit Judge Jan V. Fiss could have sentenced her to no more than 
eight years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Speedway Sets Date for Formula One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For more than 80 years, the only race at the  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway was the 500. Next year, three of the 
world's major racing series will visit, all within a span of four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway announced Monday that the U.S. Grand Prix is set  
for Sept. 24, 2000, returning Formula One to the United States for 
the first time since 1991. FIA, the sport's international governing 
body, still must approve the date. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Grand Prix joins the IRL's Indy 500 and NASCAR's  
Brickyard 400 at the country's most famous track. The deal for the 
Formula One race was made in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``It re-emphasizes that Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the  
racing capital of the world, both in terms of the quality of the 
events here and the quantity of the crowds that attend and watch 
worldwide,'' speedway spokesman Fred Nation said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a crowd of about 200,000 is expected for the new race,  
which would make it the third-largest single-day sporting event in 
the world in attendance. The Indy 500, which will be run on May 28 
next year, annually draws up to 400,000 fans; the Brickyard 400, 
expected to be run on Aug. 5, 2000, drew about 320,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction already has begun to accommodate a 13-turn road  
course that uses part of the existing 2 1/2-mile oval and a new 
section that runs through the infield, along with 36 new pitside 
garages with suites atop them. The road course is expected to be 
finished by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The only current Formula One race in North America is the  
Canadian Grand Prix, held in Montreal in June. The last Formula One 
race in the United States was in Phoenix in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway president Tony George and Bernie Ecclestone, chief  
executive of Formula One Administration, which governs the 
international circuit, have agreed to a multiyear commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway's costs are expected to top $25 million, and  
Formula One will retain all television revenue from the event. 
Tickets go on sale in the fall.

	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Mark  
Tuinei injected heroin the night before he died last week,

documents, said Tuinei, 39, and Cowboys running back Nicky Sualua 
spent Wednesday night at a North Dallas apartment.

<HEADLINE> Fleet, BankBoston Make Appointments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston announced  
Monday key management appointments for the institution resulting 
from Fleet's planned acquisition of BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, Fleet Chairman and CEO Terrence Murray will be  
chairman and chief executive officer of the Fleet Boston 
Corporation, the nation's eighth largest bank with assets of $180 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston Chairman and CEO Chad Gifford will be president and  
chief operating officer. He will succeed Murray as CEO on Dec. 31, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene McQuade will remain as chief financial officer and will  
report to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes less than two months after the March 14  
announcement that Fleet would acquire BankBoston in a deal valued 
at about $16 billion. The deal is expected to close this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointments brought few surprises, said Thomas Theurkauf,  
an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization chart is a clean and sensible one, he said,  
with a good smattering of both Fleet and BankBoston personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think whenever you put a deal together it pays to make these  
decisions sooner rather than later,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closing of the deal is several months off. This clears the  
air of who's going to be in charge.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Issues Railroad Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Passenger railroads will have meet a new set  
of safety guidelines, based on the first-ever comprehensive list of 
federal passenger railroad standards announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, developed by the Federal Railroad Administration,  
spell out a variety of safety requirements that will have to be met 
by Amtrak, commuter railroads and other short-haul operators in 
metropolitan and suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those exempted are subway systems, while different rules  
will be crafted for tourist, excursion and historic railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	To date passenger railroads have operated under a loose knit set  
of federal rules. In many respects, they have been responsible for 
establishing their own safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules:  
</P>
<P>
	--Establish comprehensive structural standards for passenger rail  
equipment, including the type of crash impact that cars must 
withstand. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enhance fire standards.  
</P>
<P>
	--Outline specific requirements for passenger car emergency  
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Set standards for the inspection and testing of a car's  
mechanical components. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the railroad administration issued guidelines  
recommending test methods and performance standards for 
flammability and smoke emission characteristics of materials in 
passenger cars. Updated in 1989, the guidelines have been followed 
on a voluntary basis by passenger railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's announcement, they will now become law.  
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, the nation's only intercity passenger railroad, withheld  
immediate comment on the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just got this, so there are a number of areas we have to  
look into in terms of the impact it will have on Amtrak,'' said 
spokesman John Wolf.

<HEADLINE> US Launches Youth Violence Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- High school student Simonna Woodson believes  
the soon-to-be-launched White House campaign against youth violence 
will strike a chord with her peers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they had young people at the meeting and were  
listening to us and asking our opinion, I'm pretty sure that makes 
my peers sit up and listen,'' said Woodson, a 17-year-old junior at 
Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson joined President Clinton and about 60 of the nation's  
leading educators, officials, entertainers and gun advocates on 
Monday to brainstorm ways to reduce violence among youth. 
</P>
<P>
	As the group-- including poet Maya Angelou, America Online chief  
Steve Case and movie-industry lobbyist Jack Valenti -- left the 
White House, they spoke of unity and communal responsibility. 
Outside of instant commitments to limit youngsters access to 
violent video games on the Internet and proposals to strengthen 
existing gun laws and craft an advertising campaign against teen 
violence, participants hoped the most immediate outcome of Monday's 
three-hour closed-door session would be showing the nation's 
schools and the children in them that they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a general sensitivity to the fact that schools are  
where the children are, but that people outside schools are going 
to have to be involved in helping seriously,'' said Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley. ``It's not enough to say schools `you 
can take care of it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., applauded Clinton for  
holding the meeting and urged more discussions to ``figure out 
what's ailing our society and how we can correct it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some dissident voices, including the  
National Rifle Association, which was not invited to the White 
House event. The gun-owners' lobbying group ran newspaper ads 
accusing the government of failing to enforce laws already on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in  
Littleton, Colo., where two students killed 12 classmates and a 
teacher before shooting themselves, everything from easy access to 
guns to violent movies and video games to a general culture of 
cynicism has been blamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood and gunmakers had particularly felt the sting.  
</P>
<P>
	But Monday, actor Andrew Shue, former star of the racy nighttime  
soap opera ``Melrose Place'' said, ``There was no scapegoating at 
all in any form. You just can't point the finger at one thing. It's 
parenting. It's schools. It's the kind of leadership we have. It 
goes on and on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Gloria Estefan said the group's mission is not to censor  
music or anything else: ``Everyone is responsible. That was the 
consensus in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among results of the meeting:  
</P>
<P>
	-- AOL and the video game industry agreed to stop allowing  
children to buy violent video games over the Internet that they are 
too young to buy in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The American Shooting Sports Council, representing 350  
firearms manufacturers and distributors, endorsed a five-point 
administration gun-control plan, including background checks for 
firearms bought at gun shows and increasing the minimum age for 
buying a gun to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A nonprofit group will be chosen to direct a national campaign  
against youth violence modeled on previous campaigns to curb 
teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Surgeon General David Satcher will prepare a report on the  
causes of youth violence, the first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley said the meeting yielded school-based proposals including  
smaller classes, more teachers, and more guidance counselors. Vice 
president Al Gore said that in the home, families should address 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The painful lessons that children learn from seeing domestic  
violence ... are far more powerful in the impact on those children 
than the imagery they see in the media,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting comes three weeks after one of the worst school  
shootings in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's wife, Tipper, said Littleton ``was symbolic for so many  
of us and such a tragedy and a wake-up call'' but that ``there have 
been little massacres going on in our society for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, the Indianapolis student, believes the meeting was  
another kind of wake-up call: ``Students will realize that more 
people care about them. And maybe they won't resort to violent acts 
or other things that they do because they're trying to attract 
attention.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Wins NBA Sixth Man Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Darrell Armstrong hoisted the trophy and  
smiled for photographers. When he lowered the NBA's Sixth Man award 
back to the table, he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my weightlifting for today,'' the 6-foot-1, 180-pound  
guard said, flexing his arms. ``This thing is pretty heavy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-year pro who helped the Orlando Magic to the  
second-best record in the Eastern Conference was honored Monday as 
the league's best player who came off the bench in more games than 
he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a football placekicker in college who played in five  
different pro basketball leagues before finally catching on with 
the NBA, averaged career-highs in points (13.8), assists (6.7), 
rebounds (3.6), steals (2.16) and minutes per game (30) while 
appearing as a reserve in 35 of 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Magic in assists and fourth-quarter scoring (4.5) and  
made 161 of 178 shots from the foul line to rank third in the 
league in free-throw percentage (.904). 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at rosters at sixth and seventh men, there are a  
lot of very good ones in the league,'' general manager John Gabriel 
said. ``But there are few who can come in and create immediate 
change. Darrell has done that with us. He changes tempo. He changes 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 30, was undrafted in 1991 after finishing his college  
career at Fayetteville State where he was also a kicker on the 
football team. He played in the Global Basketball Association, 
Continental Basketball Association and United States Basketball 
League, as well as overseas in Cyprus and Spain before signing with 
the Magic in April 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	During one brief stretch when he was out of basketball, he  
worked in a yarn mill in North Carolina for $250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are days I'll never forget,'' said Armstrong, who signed  
a five-year, $18 million contract before this season. ``The long 
rides with 12 players packed in a van, sitting on top of luggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while this been a breakthrough year in terms of national  
exposure, he emerged as key player for the Magic last season when 
he was averaging 9.2 points and 4.9 assists before a torn rotator 
cuff in his right shoulder sidelined him after 48 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of people who doubted me, who didn't think  
I'd come back from the injury ... I didn't really know it was 
career-threatening,'' Armstrong said. ``After all that I've been 
through, it's easy to go out and play hard every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries to other key players forced Armstrong into the starting  
lineup late in the season. He had 18 points, six assists, five 
rebounds and two steals Sunday in Orlando's 104-90 loss to 
Philadelphia in the opening game of their first-round playoff 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys think you have to start to be effective, or that you  
have to get up a sweat before you play well,'' Armstrong said. 
``You can't wait on that. You've got to play right away. That's how 
I've always approached it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong received 85 out of a possible 118 votes from a panel  
of sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers finished second  
with 16 votes, and Indiana's Antonio Davis and Jalen Rose tied for 
third with five votes each.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Louisiana Bus Crash Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Marion Mancuso, at 81 years old, loved taking  
chartered bus trips to the casinos along Mississippi's coast with 
her retired friends. 
</P>
<P>
	They never won much, but half the fun was socializing and  
playing bingo during the 90-minute bus ride. This time, there were 
43 of them. And the woman her friends called ``Mae'' was one of the 
most enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can you say?'' asked Martha Hymel, a resident of the  
Place Dubourg retirement home where Mancuso lived. ``She said she 
was going to the casino even if she had to be rolled in a 
wheelchair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday -- Mother's Day -- their bus picked them up in a  
supermarket parking lot. A half-hour later, just as the bingo cards 
were being passed out, the bus suddenly lurched to one side. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it veered off Interstate 610, crashed through a guardrail  
and nose-dived into an embankment. Mae Mancuso was one of the 22 
who died. Fifteen others were still hospitalized Monday in what 
officials called the worst motor vehicle accident in New Orleans 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many questions, the hows and the whys,'' said Rose  
Garnet, whose 82-year-old mother, Florence Mathieu, another Place 
Dubourg resident, also died. ``We're just trying to get past 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen federal investigators were at the scene Monday, helping  
police interview potential witnesses and examining the mangled tour 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver and at least one motorist who saw the crash said  
a car cut the bus off right before the crash. But investigators 
said they probably would not determine the cause for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were in their 70s and 80s. Two were over 90.  
All but one were from the towns of LaPlace, Reserve and Edgard in 
St. John the Baptist Parish, about 25 miles west of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Marse, 73, and her husband, Arto, 74, made the casino  
trip about once a month from Reserve, said Nancy Desselle, their 
daughter. They rarely won more than $10, but they loved getting 
together with other people their age. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would play games on the bus,'' Ms. Desselle said. ``They  
looked forward to the trip as much as the casino, the friendliness 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another rider who died, Timothy Victor, was a 45-year-old  
bachelor who worked in construction and had been going on the trips 
for about a year, said his sister, Paulette Victor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd just go over for fun, play the slots,'' she said. ``Never  
won or lost much, it was just a time to see people and do something 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some friends and relatives of the victims gathered at a memorial  
service in the dining hall of the Place Dubourg home in LaPlace, 
which lost eight residents in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends who used walkers or wheelchairs to get into the dining  
hall remembered Ms. Mancuso as the ``little butterfly'' for the 
tireless way she went around the complex. Dolly Sposito, 60, was 
remembered for her doll collection and her love of bingo. 
</P>
<P>
	Between prayers, mourners sang hymns with downcast eyes as they  
wiped away tears with crumpled tissue paper. At the end of the 
Mass, some held hands and hugged as they prayed together a final 
time for friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Place Dubourg resident Isabel Dutreix recalled how one of the  
victims, her friend Dorothy Richard, 74, used to bring her pudding 
and a newspaper every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dutreix doesn't go on casino trips, but she and Miss  
Richard often played bingo together and would talk about splitting 
their jackpots if either won. Mrs. Dutreix couldn't wait to see 
Miss Richard on Sunday because she had such good news: She had won 
at bingo on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I would see her and I would share it with her,''  
Mrs. Dutreix said, her voice trailing off.

<HEADLINE> Disease Ruled Out in Plato's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Like her young ``Diff'rent Strokes''  
co-stars, Dana Plato had seen her share of troubles since the show 
was canceled. They finally ended not with the happiness she sought, 
but with the fatal drug overdose she feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato, 34, died Saturday after apparently taking the  
painkiller Loritab along with Valium while visiting the home of her 
fiance's parents. Dr. Fred Jordan, the state medical examiner, said 
an autopsy showed no evidence of injury or any significant natural 
disease. Toxicology studies are expected to take a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Kimberly Drummond on the NBC sitcom that ran  
from 1978 to 1984. Like co-stars Todd Bridges and Gary Coleman, she 
couldn't sustain the stardom the show brought her. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal problems began in 1991, when she was arrested for robbing  
a Las Vegas video store and was placed on five years' probation. In 
1992 she was given another five years' probation for forging 
prescriptions for Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hadn't gotten caught, it could have been the worst thing  
that happened to me because I could have died of a drug overdose,'' 
she said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Scott Singer said Sunday that Ms. Plato's death  
``appears to be an accidental overdose. We don't suspect suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato and her fiance, Robert Menchaca, 28, had stopped at  
his parents' home in Moore for Mother's Day. They were en route to 
Los Angeles from New York, where she had appeared on Howard Stern's 
radio program to help revive her career and deny the claims of a 
former roommate who said Ms. Plato was on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato said she had been sober for about 10 years, though she  
had taken painkillers when her wisdom teeth were removed four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer said Ms. Plato went to take a nap Saturday afternoon.  
Menchaca realized that evening that something was wrong, and his 
mother, a nurse, and brother tried unsuccessfully to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato's recent career had included mainly low-budget films  
such as 1992's ``Bikini Beach Race'' and the 1997 film ``Different 
Strokes: A Story of Jack and Jill ... and Jill,'' a direct-to-video 
softcore tale about a sexual threesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ``Diff'rent Strokes'' co-star Bridges, who played Willis,  
has been arrested several times. In 1990, he was acquitted of 
assault with a deadly weapon in the near-fatal shooting of a 
narcotics dealer in a Los Angeles drug den. 
</P>
<P>
	He once testified that he became depressed and turned to drugs  
after ``Diff'rent Strokes'' was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who played the lovable Arnold, pleaded no contest in  
February to disturbing the peace for punching an autograph-seeker 
in the eye. He was ordered to attend anger management classes, 
fined and given a suspended jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato has a 14-year-old son, Tyler Lambert of Tulsa, from a  
previous marriage.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Seeks End to Youth Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty days after the Colorado school  
shootings, President Clinton mobilized gunmakers and the 
entertainment industry on Monday for a national campaign against 
youth violence. ``We'll have to overcome the old ways of doing 
business,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The president challenged producers of violent movies, video  
games and CDs to consider the consequences of what they make. ``We 
cannot pretend that there is no impact on our culture and our 
children that is adverse if there is too much violence coming out 
of what they see and experience,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty opinion leaders -- from poet Maya Angelou and American  
Online chief Steve Case to singer Gloria Estefan and movie-industry 
lobbyist Jack Valenti -- came to the White House for three hours of 
closed-door talks with Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and Vice 
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare praise from a Republican, House Speaker Dennis Hastert  
applauded Clinton for holding the meeting and urged more 
discussions to ``figure out what's ailing our society and how we 
can correct it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participants included parents, teachers, kids, law enforcement  
officers and government leaders, along with officials from 
gunmakers Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Glock, Inc., and O.F. Mossberg &AMP; 
Sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody recognizes that they're part of the problem, they  
need to be part of the solution,'' AOL's Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Andrew Shue, former star of ``Melrose Place'' said,  
``There was no scapegoating at all in any form. In fact, everybody 
was completely on the same page, of putting aside their own 
interests and acting to make something happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a step hailed by Gore as a breakthrough, AOL and the video  
game industry agreed at the meeting to plug a loophole that allows 
children to buy violent video games over the Internet that they are 
too young to buy in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the American Shooting Sports Council, representing 350  
firearms manufacturers and distributors, endorsed a five-point 
administration plan for gun control, including background checks 
for firearms bought at gun shows and increasing the minimum age for 
buying a gun to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were dissident voices elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association -- angry at being excluded --  
bought newspaper ads accusing the government of failing to enforce 
laws already on the books. NRA executive vice president Wayne 
LaPierre said Clinton was ``dusting off every tired old gun-control 
bill that has been around his administration for the last six 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer demanded that the  
White House ``shame the entertainment industry'' and said that 
Clinton and Gore ``should stop taking Hollywood money. People in my 
party should stop, too.'' Clinton will see his movie-making pals at 
a $1.5 million Beverly Hills fund-raiser this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that there is more for each of us to do at home and at  
school, in Hollywood and in the heartland, and here in 
Washington,'' Clinton said. ``Every parent, every teacher, every 
leader has something more to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House meeting was called after the April 20 massacre  
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., where two students 
killed 12 classmates and a teacher before shooting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's wife, Tipper said Littleton ``was symbolic for so many of  
us and such a tragedy and a wake-up call'' but that ``there have 
been little massacres going on in our society for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The session was designed to lay the groundwork for a national  
campaign against youth violence, much like other campaigns to curb 
teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for welfare recipients. Clinton 
directed Surgeon General David Satcher to prepare a report on the 
causes of youth violence, the first in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Dickey, president of the American Medical Association,  
said there already is plenty of information about children and 
violence. ``It's pretty clear there are causes, particularly 
related to media exposure, increasing when they can get hands-on 
with video games, and the need for treatment of mental illness, 
especially depression in children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore praised ABC, CBS and most of the satellite and cable  
networks for participating in the voluntary V-chip rating system 
allowing parents to block sexually explicit or violent programs. 
But the vice president ``chided NBC for not taking part,'' White 
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed said. NBC uses less 
detailed ratings, but parents can still use them to block unwanted 
shows on TV sets containing the V-chip. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten percent of all public schools reported at least one serious  
violent crime in the 1996-97 school year. School deaths peaked in 
1992-93 at 55 fatalities. In contrast, the total for the current 
school year -- including the Columbine High School rampage -- is 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA said that in the last two years, federal authorities  
prosecuted only: 11 juveniles caught with guns; 11 adults who 
illegally provided guns to juveniles; and 37 felons who acquired 
guns through others. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel acknowledged that  
federal prosecution rates for gun violations have dipped but said 
it was misleading to look at those figures alone. Steel said 
looking at local and federal figures combined, authorities have 
actually increased their prosecutions of gun-toting criminals by 
nearly 25 percent since the beginning of the Clinton 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of impending violence spread on the computer Internet,  
meanwhile, cut attendance at several school districts in the 
Washington area Monday. Absenteeism in Montgomery County, Md., high 
schools was 36 percent -- six times normal -- and more than double 
the usual rate in Prince George's County, Md. Maryland public 
schools postponed standardized statewide tests.

<HEADLINE> Self-Serve Supermarkets at Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHBORO, Pa. (AP) -- Julie Lawson's two young children LOVE to  
go grocery shopping since their suburban Philadelphia supermarket 
installed automatic check-out machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Bud and 4-year-old Julia slide pop-tarts and  
tomatoes and milk cartons across a scanner, listen for the computer 
voice to announce the price then put their goodies into bags. All 
without the help of an employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have to drag these two around on errands, it's great  
to be able to do your own thing at your own pace,'' Mrs. Lawson 
said Monday at the SuperFresh in Richboro. ``They love it so much, 
they do not let me use the regular line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Self-serve checkouts are the latest in a tidal wave of  
automation that has already overtaken banking, investing and 
pumping gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto-checkout machines are in about 300 supermarkets around the  
country, most installed in the past few months. In addition, they 
are being tested in Wal-Mart and other department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows shoppers to take control of the check-out process,''  
said Michelle Logan, spokeswoman for Productivity Solutions Inc. of 
Jacksonville, Fla., the leading maker of automatic checkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-checkout works like a regular cashier, with a few  
anti-theft additions. The customer slides each item over a laser 
scanner, puts it on a conveyer belt -- which weighs each one -- then 
lets each roll under a camera that measures it. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighing and measuring prevents theft by comparing each item  
to computer information about everything in the store. The final 
bagging area also includes a scale, where the total weight must 
match the sum of the items purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers then get a receipt and pay a human cashier, though  
some of the newer auto-checkouts include a machine to take cash or 
use a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The system isn't foolproof. On a recent visit to a SuperFresh,  
customers had problems scanning a gallon of milk, a single bread 
roll (she looked in a check-out manual to find the cost), a 12-roll 
pack of paper towels (too big to fit under conveyer belt) and six 
ears of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't say there were six ears there, and the computer  
knows how much an average ear weighs so it was confused,'' employee 
Bill Hunter said, after rushing to the aid of the customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, shoppers were pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always use this. I'm always in a hurry and don't want to  
waste time waiting in line,'' shopper Alex Mathews of Richboro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marybeth Malloy of Churchville said the self-serve aisles may  
not be faster, since she's a slow scanner, but she said it feels 
faster. ``I hate standing in the line. This way, it at least feels 
like I'm doing something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Richboro store hasn't reduced employee hours because of the  
new machines, instead keeping more lanes open, store manager 
Charles Swartz said. The union representing store workers said they 
had been notified before the change, but they didn't object, saying 
it makes workers' jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the day goes faster,'' said Hunter, who preferred  
supervising four self-checkout aisles Monday to working at a 
regular cash register. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the machines will be used to make up shifts that are  
hard to staff or to fill vacancies at understaffed stores, said 
Andy Carrano, spokesman for Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., 
SuperFresh's parent company. A&AMP;P said the self-checkout aisles 
account for about 30 percent of business at the 50 test stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers should get used to dealing with a computer instead of  
a person, economist Jeremy Rifkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line here is that the cheapest worker in the world  
will not be as cheap as the technology coming on line to replace 
them,'' said Rifkin, who predicts automation will replace a 
majority of the 3.5 million supermarket workers nationwide by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some people aren't ready to give up human cashiers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a people person. I still enjoy when people check me out  
and help me,'' said Susan Wexler of Richboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, she was using the auto-checkout because, ``It's  
faster than waiting in long lines when they have only one cashier 
open.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Secretary Turns Artist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- He's the Artist Formerly Known as  
Treasury Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald T. Regan, 80, took the Palm Beach art scene by storm with  
a February show of paintings at Wally Findlay Galleries. Some 
pieces sold for as much as $6,000. Another show is planned for 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know. It defies the imagination,'' he said in Monday's Wall  
Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery wanted a three-year contract, but Regan would only  
agree to two. ``At this age, I don't even buy green bananas,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regan's brightly colored canvases feature lighthouses, historic  
buildings and seascapes. ``Believe it or not, I'm what they call 
`primitive,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, Regan donates his art to charity -- despite tax  
laws that bar a write-off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some damn fool at Treasury once said a guy could just scribble  
on paper and sell it for $5,000 and take a write-off,'' he said. 
``Guess who that was?''

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Keep the Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- The battered pews were salvaged from  
a ruined church. The muddy blue-and-white tent above the 
parishioners had been donated. 
</P>
<P>
	A bent and scratched sign welcomed an overflow crowd of  
worshippers Sunday who counted their blessings in the shadow of the 
twisted remains of Ridgecrest Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if God took your home, but a tornado did, and God  
will rebuild your life,'' Pastor Tom Duckett said. ``I know that 
the church is the people. A building is just a building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have been using bulldozers and chain saws to remove the  
debris that once was the Ridgecrest sanctuary. ``God One, Tornado 
Zero'' was written on one worker's hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridge Creek, a town of two churches, a school and 8,000  
scattered residents, doesn't even appear on a map. It was here that 
a tornado touched down May 3, plowed northward and killed at least 
41 statewide. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims died in the Bridge Creek area.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, women in dresses and others in donated jeans and  
T-shirts wore corsages for Mother's Day. ``Mamas, I'm glad you're 
here and your babies are safe,'' Duckett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Garretson rocked her 4-month-old daughter, Sydney. She and  
her husband, who works for the church, hid in a 5-foot-wide cellar 
while the twister destroyed their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to be reminded how lucky we are. We have our  
lives, friends who are helping us and God,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hugs lasted longer and the amens were louder during Sunday's  
two-hour service. A group of church members embraced a man whose 
wife was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of people missing was cut from four to one Sunday when  
two British tourists checked in with relatives and a local 
resident's wife realized her husband was mistakenly listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still missing is Tram Bui, a 23-year-old woman from Seminole.  
Ms. Bui was blown from underneath a highway overpass where she 
huddled with her family as the tornadoes struck. 
</P>
<P>
	The same powerful system of tornados that ripped across Oklahoma  
also slammed into Haysville, Kan., tearing apart the sanctuary of 
the First Christian Church and scattering hymn books throughout the 
rubble 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 members also gathered there Sunday to sing the very  
songs that the hymnals had been opened to as they fell amid the 
debris. Five people died in the Kansas storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Voices filled the hallways of Rex Elementary School with the  
sounds of the hymn ``Blessed Assurance.'' And near the end of 
services, parishioners gathered together in a large circle, held 
hands and sang ``Standing on the Promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, Pastor Alan Cox of the  
First Baptist Church tried to comfort about 2,000 people gathered 
for a communitywide worship service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all right to cry,'' he said. ``It's all right to hurt.  
It's all right to be confused. Hope will rebuild landmarks. Hope 
will outlive the broken hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Records Vital for Disaster Tax Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax relief, with some strings attached, is  
available to people who suffer financial losses in natural 
disasters like the Midwestern tornadoes. But tax advisers say it's 
crucial to keep adequate records -- and keep them in a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service allows federal income tax  
deductions for people whose homes and businesses are damaged or 
destroyed by tornado, hurricane, earthquake or certain floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Insured damage estimates from last week's tornadoes in Oklahoma  
alone have reached $1 billion, but insurance won't cover every 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	In such cases, proof is essential, and it's smart to plan ahead.  
For instance, the IRS could ask to see records such as receipts or 
canceled checks for household goods such as appliances, furniture 
and art. Even a videotape of a building's interior and contents can 
serve as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people are not going to go through every room and  
inventory everything in the house,'' IRS spokesman Don Roberts said 
Monday. ``If you have the videotape, you have that as a reminder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it doesn't do any good to keep these records if the  
home or business they're in is destroyed. One alternative is to 
store them in a safety deposit box or with a friend or relative 
someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
	The law permits tax deductions only for the ``fair market  
value'' of an item, not the full replacement cost or its 
sentimental value. This lands taxpayers without records in a murky 
area of estimating the worth of such things as used furniture or 
old wedding china. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to depend on the facts and circumstances a taxpayer  
presents and how well-documented the loss is,'' Roberts said of the 
IRS position in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other cautions: Deductions are permitted only when each  
separate loss is above $100, when the total combined loss for a 
single year exceeds 10 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted gross 
income and when any insurance claims were filed in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Luscombe, tax analyst at CCH Inc. of Riverwoods, Ill., said  
people who meet those thresholds should remember that deductions 
can be taken for property repairs as well as such items as 
destroyed trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Examples of costs that aren't deductible are rental cars,  
temporary housing, cleanup costs or personal injuries, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	If the loss happened in a federal disaster area declared by the  
president, the rules are somewhat different. The loss can be 
deducted in the most recent tax year -- even if April 15 has passed 
-- by filing an amended 1040 return, as long as deductions are 
itemized. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are special rules for small businesses in disaster  
areas that allow deferral of a gain on the purchase of replacement 
equipment, which lowers the income tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provides relief for businesses that are forced to suspend  
operations for a substantial time due to property damage,'' 
Luscombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Publications 547 and 584 provide more information on  
disasters and taxes.

<HEADLINE> 6 Die, 50 Hurt in Hawaii Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A large landslide at Sacred Falls State Park  
killed six people and injured more than 50 others Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The landslide in the popular hiking area occurred around 2:30  
p.m. near the pool at the base of the waterfall in the Koolau 
Mountains, about 30 miles north of Honolulu on the northeast side 
of the island of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Takamiya, plans and operations officer at Oahu Civil  
Defense, confirmed the number of deaths and injuries but had no 
details. He said 27 of the injured were taken to four hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told television station KHON they heard a low rumbling  
sound, then saw boulders and trees toppling over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lady standing in the middle of the rock clearing,  
and I guess she knew what it was,'' said injured hiker Stephen 
Michael. ``She said to run, get out of here. And everybody started 
taking off. And that's when the rocks started falling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really hard to see coming out of there,'' said Darren  
Fredricks of Florida. ``You just wanted to grab who you could and 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency crews used four-wheel drive vehicles to reach the  
scene of the slide, 3 miles from the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was in critical condition and three women were in  
guarded to fair condition among seven people taken to The Queen's 
Medical Center, said Cheryl Utendale, the hospital's administrative 
coordinator. She would give no more information. 
</P>
<P>
	Five or six of the 15 to 20 people taken to Kahuku Hospital were  
treated and released, said Carol Gonzales, the hospital's director 
of nursing. Of the rest, some were to be transferred and some were 
still being evaluated Sunday evening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two servicemen and a 10-year-old girl were treated at Tripler  
Army Medical Center and released, while two other servicemen were 
held for observation, Tripler spokeswoman Margaret Tippy said. 
</P>
<P>
	A man and woman underwent surgery at Kuakini Medical Center,  
while a 9-year-old boy was transferred to Kapiolani Medical Center 
for Women and Children, according to spokeswoman Donda Spiker.

<HEADLINE>  Marine Gets 6 Months in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot was sentenced today to  
six months in prison and dismissed from the corps for helping hide 
a videotape shot during a flight in which 20 people died when his 
jet clipped a gondola cable in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., also was  
ordered to forfeit all pay and allowance for his conviction last 
week on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to 
obstruct. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated about two hours today before issuing the  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sound in the courtroom as the verdict was read.  
Ashby, who stood at attention during the reading, is the first crew 
member to receive a prison sentence for last year's accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was convicted Friday of obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments earlier today, prosecutor Maj. Stu Couch  
told the jury of seven Marine officers that Ashby deserved two 
years in prison and dismissal, as well as forfeiture of pay and 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense attorney, Capt. Jon Shelburne, asked the jurors to put  
themselves in Ashby's position and recall mistakes they have made 
and ``wished you could go back and undo it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prison time was appropriate for people who commit rape or  
larceny but ``wasn't even in the ball park'' for Ashby, Shelburne 
said in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make mistakes,'' he said. ``We learn from our mistakes.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler anti-radar jet  
that cut the cable on Feb. 3, 1998, at Cavalese, Italy. Twenty 
people died when the gondola crashed 370 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted in March of 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter. The verdict enraged and embittered relatives of the 
victims, as well as Italian leaders, who said they would explore 
options in pursuing their own case against the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and was sentenced to 
dismissal from the service but no prison time. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took out the videotape, which was made earlier in 
the flight and was intended as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that he later gave it to Schweitzer at the  
navigator's request. Schweitzer said he later threw it into a 
bonfire because he was afraid his face was on the tape and could be 
used by Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that he helped get rid of the tape, Ashby  
denied he had a criminal intent -- impeding the investigation into 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with involuntary  
manslaughter soon after the accident but the charges were 
dismissed. One of those officers, Capt. Chandler Seagraves, told 
investigators about the tape after he was granted immunity from 
prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Sign Recchi to Five-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Right wing Mark Recchi signed a five-year  
contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday, team president and 
general manager Bob Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	``To continue to be a really good team and to have a chance of  
winning the Stanley Cup, we have to sign our top players and we 
consider Mark one of our top players,'' Clarke said. ``Mark had 
made it clear that he wanted to stay here in Philadelphia and we 
made it clear to Mark that we really wanted to keep him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, 31, had 16 goals and 37 assists in 71 games last season.  
He had four goals and two assists in 10 games after being acquired 
from the Montreal Canadiens on March 10 for right wing Dainius 
Zubrus. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Recchi's second tour with the Flyers as he played with  
them from 1991-92 through 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Flyers in scoring in each of his two full seasons  
with the team, posting a team-record 123 points during the 1992-93 
season and 107 points in 1993-94.

<HEADLINE> Innocent Plea in Internet Hoax Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man pleaded innocent Monday to federal  
charges that he fabricated an Internet news report to drive up the 
stock price of PairGain Technologies, a manufacturer of 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, a former PairGain engineer, was ordered to stand  
trial on July 6 on five counts of securities fraud. If found 
guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine. He 
remains free on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, 25, is accused of posting a fake report that suggested the  
Tustin, Calif.-based PairGain was about to be acquired by an 
Israeli company. The story was made up to look like it had been 
posted on a Bloomberg News Service Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax pushed PairGain stock up 31 percent, though it  
fell back when the company issued a statement denying such a deal 
was in the works. Prosecutors have said the hoax was carried out 
without the knowledge of company officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend that Hoke posted a bogus e-mail message  
about PairGain under the subject line ``Buyout News'' on a 
financial news message board operated by Yahoo Inc. The message 
contained a link to the bogus Bloomberg site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, a Raleigh, N.C., resident, has a history of online  
securities trading and had owned stock in the company as recently 
as January, according to a federal affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, however, does not allege Hoke was holding  
PairGain stock during the hoax. He worked for the company at the 
time of the posting but was later fired.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Preakness Decision Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bob Baffert intends to let the luck determine  
whether he runs fillies Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting in 
the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	If Monday's workout means anything, then Baffert's decision on  
Silverbulletday will be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
	After the filly covered five furlongs in an impressive 59  
seconds at Churchill Downs, Baffert said, ``I figured after she 
worked they'd have to put water on the track to cool it down. 
That's what you want to see coming into a race like the 
Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both fillies are entered in Friday's Black-Eyed Susan, where  
Silverbulletday drew the rail and Excellent Meeting received the 
fourth position. If they get anywhere near that kind of placement 
in Wednesday's Preakness draw, Baffert will saddle both for 
Saturday's middle jewel of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fate will decide whether we run or not,'' Baffert said.  
``These are two great fillies and I'm not going to waste a (start). 
I want to run to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday has won 10 of 11 career races, including the  
Kentucky Oaks. Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Kentucky Derby, was 
to work out this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, the trainer of First American pulled his horse  
from the Preakness, citing a pair of injuries. The colt, who took 
16th in the Derby, has been bothered by fluid in his lungs and 
developed a bone chip in his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed. When we decided to make this trip, we  
thought he would be in good shape,'' trainer Eduardo Caramori said. 
``The lung wasn't clear for the Derby and still isn't great, and 
the first sign that the ankle was bothering him came yesterday. 
With that combination, we have to pull out. You can't go into a big 
race at less than 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of First American leaves the stakes barn at  
Pimlico near empty. Although most of the entrants plan to arrive 
Wednesday, trainer Nick Zito shipped his two horses, Stephen Got 
Even and Adonis, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier for a trainer and his staff to stay in one  
place and ship in at the last minute,'' Zito conceded. ``I feel 
that if you come here and get used to the racetrack, it should mean 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His strategy worked to perfection in 1996, with upset winner  
Louis Quatorze. Zito is counting on similar results this year, even 
though both of his entrants finished far back in the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were right in '96 and hopefully we'll be right in '99,'' he  
said. ``If they do well Saturday, we'll be vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito was among the first arrivals at Pimlico three years ago,  
and his judgment appeared justified when Louis Quatorze charged 
past Skip Away and paid $19 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	If Stephen Got Even or Adonis win Saturday, it was also be  
considered a surprise. Stephen Got Even is coming off a 14th-place 
finish at the Derby, and Adonis took 17th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserved the right to be in the Derby. But they had  
traffic problems and didn't have the best of trips,'' Zito said. 
``Hopefully, they'll have better luck here.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Most Top Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro and most other  
major currencies Monday as news of a partial pullout of Yugoslavian 
troops from Kosovo stirred hopes that an end of the conflict may be 
approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0782 in late trading in New York, up  
from $1.0748 late Friday. The dollar slipped to 120.50 Japanese yen 
from 120.85 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro has been buffeted by changing expectations about the  
course of the NATO bombing of the southern Serb province. 
</P>
<P>
	The war has hurt the euro because of the risk of a broader war  
in Europe and the rising financial costs for European countries 
backing it. 
</P>
<P>
	But a settlement of the conflict would relieve some of those  
worries and take pressure off the euro, the currency since January 
of 11 European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's army announced Monday a partial withdrawal of  
military and police forces from Kosovo, saying it had completed its 
operations against ethnic Albanian rebels there. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO quickly said a partial withdrawal would not halt its  
bombing campaign, but President Clinton said he was ``encouraged by 
any good word.'' He repeated the alliance's demands for a complete 
Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo and deployment of an international 
security force there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton seems eager to wrap up this war,'' said Paul Podolsky,  
currency strategist for BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there is still confusion about Yugoslavian President  
Slobodan Milosevic's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bryson, an international economist for First Union National  
Bank in Charlotte, N.C., said the euro also got a lift from 
comments by German Finance Minister Hans Eichel who said Monday 
that the euro has potential to rise without any particular measures 
to support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters after a meeting of the 11 euro-zone  
finance ministers in Brussels, Eichel said the ministers felt the 
euro's relative weakness against the U.S. dollar was due to 
different growth rates between the U.S. and the euro zone. ``The 
growth gap can be narrowed in time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Monday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4899 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.4965; and 1.4613 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4575. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.6253 from $1.6308.  
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8139 German  
marks, down from 1.8198; 6.0827 French francs, down from 6.1013; 
and 1,795.33 Italian lire, down from 1,801.80.

	Today is Tuesday, May 11, the 131st day of 1999. There are 234

<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On May 11, 1946, the first packages from the relief agency CARE  
(Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe) arrived in Europe, 
at Le Havre, France. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:

	In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam to become

</P>
<P>
	In 1858, Minnesota became the 32nd state of the Union.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1910, Glacier National Park in Montana was established.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1944, Allied forces launched a major offensive in central  
Italy. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Violence Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he is not seeking a scapegoat for the  
Colorado high school shootings, President Clinton today convened a 
White House brainstorming session on how to reduce violence among 
youth. ``We are not here to place blame, but to shoulder 
responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the session began amid complaints from the gun and  
entertainment industries that they've already been targeted 
unfairly for blame. The National Rifle Association, uncompromising 
critic of gun control laws, was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with Vice  
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, sat down in the White House 
East Room with about 60 participants ranging from America Online's 
chief executive to poet Maya Angelou. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants the session to provide the groundwork for  
a national campaign on reducing youth violence, much like similar 
campaigns to curb teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for former 
welfare recipients. He also directed Surgeon General David Satcher 
to prepare a report on the causes of youth violence, the first in 
more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have asked you to come here to see what we can  
do together to give our children safer childhoods,'' Clinton said. 
``Let's leave here today resolved to be, all of us, part of this 
national campaign. I want us to have a good conversation about 
where we go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the main question before the group is determining  
why violence is repeatedly erupting in the nation's schools, most 
recently and most deadly in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	But gun advocates and participants from the entertainment  
industry say they are feeling more pressure than most, because of 
the newly intensified debate over the availability of weapons and 
whether violence among teen-agers is fomented by the images and 
language in movies, video games and song lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of two gun-manufacturing groups -- the National Shooting  
Sports Foundation and the American Shooting Sports Council -- met 
with White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed last week and 
planned to attend today's gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said today that the councils had agreed to support five  
administration proposals to keep guns out of the hands of young 
people. One measure would raise the age at which a person can buy a 
handgun from 18 to 21. Another would hold parents criminally 
responsible for making guns accessible to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found common ground on some commonsense measures,''  
Clinton said. ``I commend the gun manufacturers here today for 
taking that kind of responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, meanwhile, called a news conference to assert that the  
Clinton administration has failed to aggressively prosecute 
juveniles caught with guns and adults accused of providing them. 
Executive vice president Wayne LaPierre decried the conference, 
saying the NRA was left out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we wanted to be there because this mirror needs to be  
held up to the administration,'' LaPierre said. ``You can talk 
about the culture of violence for the next 10 years. Unless you 
start prosecution, you're never going to cut to the culture of 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of  
America, said the film industry shouldn't be singled out for blame. 
He said he supports having the U.S. surgeon general do an in-depth 
analysis of ``the why of violence'' to better understand all of the 
factors at play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe that church and home and school are the three  
places where children learn what is right and what is wrong, and 
that's where they build a strong moral shield,'' Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Valenti, entertainment industry representatives expected  
at today's meeting were the heads of the Recording Industry 
Association of America, the National Association of Broadcasters, 
the National Cable Television Association and the Interactive 
Digital Software Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a survey released today by the Kaiser Family  
Foundation showed 80 percent of parents said they'd heard of the TV 
ratings now in use, but only 39 percent of them said they had seen 
an explanation of them. Seventy-seven percent said they would block 
shows they don't want their children to watch if their television 
sets were equipped with such technology, while 20 percent said they 
would not. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, similar to one conducted last year, was based on  
telephone interviews of 1,001 parents from April 6-26 -- before and 
after the high school shootings in Littleton Colo. It had a margin 
or error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kaiser Family Foundation is a California research group  
interested in entertainment's impact on society.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Debates Its Ice Cream Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin may be America's Dairyland, but  
for ice cream makers it's not always the sweetest place to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin is one of only two states -- Hawaii is the other -- with  
laws governing ice cream container size. Ice cream here only can be 
sold in half-pints, pints, quarts and multiples of quarters, 
including half-gallons and gallons. 
</P>
<P>
	A state representative said Monday he wants to do away with the  
34-year-old restrictions to give packagers -- and consumers -- more 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``They felt constricted by this law here, and heck, we're the  
dairy state,'' said Phil Montgomery, R-Ashwaubenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Good Humor-Breyers, the nation's largest ice cream producer,  
sells ``Pints Plus,'' a 1 1/2-pint container, in other states, but 
can't sell that size in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the state Department of Agriculture, Trace and  
Consumer Protection aren't sure why the law was enacted in the 
first place, but speculated that it was done to make comparison 
shopping easier to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	If the law is rescinded, the state's retailers are ready to make  
room in their freezers, said Brandon Scholz, president of the 
Wisconsin Grocers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers like variety,'' Scholz said. ``They like to be able  
to pick and choose.''

	``Take Your Shoes Off'' (Rykodisc) -- The Robert Cray Band  
</P>
<P>
	Guitarist Robert Cray takes off his shoes, his socks and his  
blues man label for his debut on Rykodisc. The result is a 
soulfest. Cray assembled his band in a Nashville studio and 
produced a fine rhythm and blues record that showcases his sweet 
voice more than his playing. As if to give the record an extra 
measure of credence, Cray dips into the soul vaults to bring new 
life to Mack Rice's ``24-7 Man'' and ``Won't You Give Him (One More 
Chance),'' a 1964 hit for Soloman Burke. After 13 years with 
Mercury Records, Cray headed to the independent Rykodisc and used 
the occasion to give full voice to the soul roots that have always 
been a part of his music. His six originals are right at home with 
the soul covers.

	``Rising Son'' (Blind Pig) -- Big Bill Morganfield  

</P>
<P>
	Is blues a matter of heredity or environment? Are blues men born  
or made? 
</P>
<P>
	Such weighty questions are forced upon us by the debut recording  
of Big Bill Morganfield -- yes, THAT Morganfield, the mannish 
boy-child of the incomparable Muddy Waters, born McKinley 
Morganfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Does son sound like dad? Kind of. In style, some tracks have a  
Muddy resemblance. Big Bill's mumbling, good-time voice doesn't ask 
to be taken too seriously. In vocal tempo and guitar sound he does 
not compare to dad, but then no one ever has. 
</P>
<P>
	Big Bill is a self-assured performer, and his pedigree sprinkles  
magic on tracks like ``Screamin' and Crying'' and ``Champagne &AMP; 
Reefer,'' written by dad, now updated by son. 
</P>
<P>
	The best sample is Willie Dixon's ``The Same Thing,'' which Big  
Bill plays with the same melancholy, slapped-string tones his 
father used in his recording 45 years ago. It's also a good sample 
because with nods to his father's influence, Bill still presses his 
own sound and touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting back this CD some is the fact that blues is not at this  
stage anymore. Muddy Waters today would not play this way because 
his career was a constant progression. Therefore, the CD at moments 
can be stale. But Big Bill has given us more than a just novelty 
recording.

	``Borders'' (Red House Records) -- Cliff Eberhardt  

</P>
<P>
	Songwriter Cliff Eberhardt explores boundaries on his second  
record for Minnesota-based Red House Records. There's a rawness to 
his voice and a sparseness to his guitar playing that sharpens the 
emotion of his well-written lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lines,'' which pretty much defines the theme for the record,  
showcases some of his best writing. ``There's a line in the 
desert/There's a line in the sea/Between man and woman/Between you 
and me/Between hell and heaven/Between love and hurt/The line of 
temptation/The hem of your skirt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eberhardt also offers a haunting Civil War account of the  
ravages of battle on those with no reason to fight in ``The Wrong 
Side of the Line.'' ``I never knew Mason/I never knew Dixon/I never 
hurt no one/I never chose sides. I never dreamt that I'd be walking 
with strangers/Because I was born on the wrong side of the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are some quirky elements that mar ``Borders,'' such as the  
lyric bridge in ``Lines.'' But it's a heartfelt record sung with 
passion.

	``The Green Gate'' (J Seven Records) -- Phil DeGreg  

</P>
<P>
	Pianist and professor Phil DeGreg gets right to the point on  
this recording for Cincinnati-based J. Seven Records. DeGreg is an 
associate professor of jazz studies at the University of Cincinnati 
Conservatory of Music who also has played with the Woody Herman 
Orchestra, Slide Hampton, Stanley Turrentine and Eddie Harris. Here 
he leads a trio for most of the disc, playing straight-up jazz with 
confidence and authority. He has an easy grace and a strong sense 
of tradition. Four DeGreg compositions also showcase his writing. 
Tim Ries offers support on the tenor and soprano saxes as well as 
blowing some sweet solos to spice the mix.

	``Spirit -- A Journey in Dance, Drums &AMP; Song'' (Hollywood  
Records) -- Peter Buffett 

</P>
<P>
	Quite simply, this is a stunning recording. The compact disc is  
a recording of a live performance of composer/keyboardist Peter 
Buffett's celebration of Native American culture. The live show, 
first done in August, includes more than 80 performers, including 
20 dancers and a children's choir, who use rock music, movement, 
chants and songs to pay homage to Native American culture. 
</P>
<P>
	And while it is a celebration, the overall tone is of a  
civilization lost. Indeed, the third piece, ``Hidden Heritage,'' 
includes a recitation of tribes who have gone before. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Mirabal's flute work is particularly haunting throughout.  
A television presentation of the performance was broadcast by PBS 
nationwide in March and a live touring show is set to kick off in 
Chicago in October. Buffett is known for his score work for such 
films as ``Dances With Wolves'' and ``The Scarlet Letter,'' and 
television shows like CBS' ``500 Nations.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said NATO  
would press on with its air campaign, despite Yugoslavia's 
announcement today of a partial military withdrawal from Kosovo. 
Cohen said he would consider a pause if Yugoslavia indicated its 
acceptance of all the alliance's demands and made a 
``demonstrable'' start to a troop withdrawal. Meanwhile, NATO 
carried out daylight bombings on several towns in central and 
western Serbia, killing four civilians and smashing a factory in 
one 20-minute bombardment, Yugoslav media reported.

to the NATO air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
Intelligence officials briefed lawmakers behind closed doors, then 
met with reporters to explain how a B-2 stealth bomber came to drop 
a load of satellite-guided bombs on a plainly marked embassy 
compound well-known in Belgrade to diplomats and civilians alike.

punished. In addition, Chinese U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun made 
clear this afternoon that Beijing won't discuss any peace plan for

impeachment vote expected this week. The leaders of Russia's 
Communist Party, which has led the bid to impeach Yeltsin, met to 
discuss tactics for the impeachment debate scheduled to begin 
Thursday in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma. The 
current impeachment charges are the strongest yet. Still, the 
motion has little chance of success because even if the Duma 
approves it, Yeltsin cannot be ousted unless it also is passed by 
the upper house of parliament and the Supreme and Constitutional 
Courts.

<HEADLINE> Paper Tax Returns Challenge for IRS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- At row upon row of desks and tables spread  
over seven clamorous acres in a warehouse-like brick building, 
hundreds of IRS employees are working ``The Pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of workers tear open thousands of tax returns, sort the  
paper and checks into slots at worn wooden tables, stamp a number 
on each by hand and then manually enter the sensitive financial 
information into computers. 
</P>
<P>
	These 2,500 people will process an estimated 10 million returns  
here this year the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quieter room at this IRS Service Center just across the  
Ohio River from Cincinnati, in space the size of three side-by-side 
refrigerators, softly whirring computers do the same job with about 
6 million electronic returns. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no chance of a lost check, a mistaken keystroke or a  
return placed in the wrong wooden slot. Nobody has to try to read a 
taxpayer's handwriting in crayon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you can have less paper, there's much less chance of  
error,'' said John Cosgrave, chief information officer at the 
Internal Revenue Service. ``It's a very big plus not only for us 
but also for the taxpayer who will see better service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast between the Industrial Age paper processing that  
still dominates the IRS and the fledgling electronic method 
underscores the monumental technology challenges facing the 
nation's tax collector as it struggles to improve service. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the 21st Century, the IRS still stores the  
``Master Files'' for individuals and businesses on tape that can 
only be updated once a week, causing delays and other obstacles in 
retrieving information. Its mainframe computer hardware is state of 
the art, but it also uses a language dating to the early 1960s that 
is no longer taught at universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a house with various additions but no connecting hallways,  
the IRS has tried to overcome these shortcomings with new computers 
that don't always talk to the older ones. The agency has 84 
mainframes from four vendors, 1,500 midsize computers from 23 
vendors and 100,000 individual computers. There are 11 different 
e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Such deficiencies have a profound impact on taxpayers. For  
instance, someone seeking information by telephone about their tax 
account might be frustrated when an IRS employee can't find updated 
information, such as a payment mailed a week before. Or perhaps the 
employee can't answer a tax law question right away because the 
computers aren't linked to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cincinnati center, for example, IRS employee Sharon  
Darrell had to painstakingly negotiate through nine different 
computer systems -- each with its own password -- to answer questions 
for a professional tax preparer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only be into one system at a time,'' Darrell said.  
``When we get a new system, it will take the work less time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another limitation showed up earlier this year when the IRS  
tried to implement the new ``innocent spouse'' law, which ensures 
that husbands or wives won't be held liable for tax bills their 
partner is solely responsible for. The archaic tape ``Master 
Files'' at the Martinsburg, W. Va., computer center could not 
accommodate the law because it required that joint tax returns be 
split and tracked separately. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate file had to be created, meaning more cost and greater  
chance for error and delay. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti calls the current situation  
``fundamentally deficient'' and is embarking on a costly, long-term 
effort to replace the entire system and phase out the practice of 
keeping main taxpayer files on tape. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of false starts and billions of dollars wasted, the  
IRS last year awarded a contract to a consortium led by Computer 
Sciences Corp. to design a new system. Congress has put up $506 
million initially for the job, but it is expected to cost tens of 
billions of dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, all the new computers in the world can't change the  
limitations of paper tax returns. Of the 111.5 million individual 
returns received through April 23 nationwide, 82.5 million of them 
are the old-fashioned paper kind. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Cincinnati center and the other nine like it, employees  
often hired for tax season at modest wages must wade through stacks 
of returns. It's difficult to ``scan'' returns into computers 
because people fill them out on manual typewriters, with ballpoint 
pens, even in crayon. Returns are bound by hand into large 
envelopes and left sitting in dozens of carts as they await 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why IRS is pushing hard for electronic filing of  
returns, with the ambitious goal of 80 percent of all individual 
returns by 2007. This year, that figure will reach 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency hopes the combination of modernized mainframe  
computers and master files, better communication between the 
machines and employees who deal directly with taxpayers, and a 
majority of people filing electronically will gradually bring IRS 
into the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do right by taxpayers,'' said R. Wayne Hicks,  
acting district director in Cincinnati. ``Sometimes the technology 
doesn't allow our employees to do all they want. Any system that 
allows us to do that will be welcomed.''

<HEADLINE> Life Blamed for Stars' Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dana Plato and her fellow ``Diff'rent  
Strokes'' child stars Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges enjoyed a heady 
TV fame that ended more than a decade ago. It seems they've been 
paying for it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato, 34, died Saturday of an accidental drug overdose, one  
day after telling Howard Stern's radio show she was clean and 
sober. Bridges also has fought to overcome drug and legal problems; 
Coleman has been beset by legal and financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
	But to blame their Hollywood experience is wrong, Betty Bridges,  
Todd's mother, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media portrays it as the kids on the show being cursed. It  
had nothing to do with that. The show was a very positive 
experience,'' Ms. Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug problems faced by her son and Ms. Plato stemmed from  
their difficult home lives, not the pressures of early fame, she 
said. Bridges suffered when she and his father, now dead, got 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato had to cope with her mother's serious illness, Ms.  
Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son has said to me, `I would have these problems whether I  
was in the business or out of it,''' she said, adding: ``How many 
kids who are not in show business have a drug problem?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her son is ``really destroyed'' by Ms. Plato's death, Ms.  
Bridges said. ``But he's looking at this as a wake-up call for 
everybody. Not just for people in show business, but for 
everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Bridges, 34, was unavailable for an interview because he  
has an exclusive agreement with the TV show ``Inside Edition.'' Now 
married and with an infant son, he is working as a film 
director-producer and speaking out against drugs, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Bonaduce, 39, ``The Partridge Family'' star who overcame  
his own drug and career problems and re-emerged as a radio disc 
jockey, concurred that Hollywood is not to blame for a child star's 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to diminish the tragedy of Dana Plato's death, but the  
only difference is you know her name. People O.D. every day. There 
are a thousand reasons,'' Bonaduce said. 
</P>
<P>
	One observer disagreed. Dr. Carole Lieberman, a psychiatrist and  
longtime industry consultant, said the perils of early, short-lived 
Hollywood success can't be denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``When child stars are no longer getting attention as stars,  
they are so addicted to the spotlight that they find themselves 
acting out in negative ways to get attention,'' Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the cast of ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' the glory ride lasted  
from 1978 to 1986, when the show was a hit for NBC. Coleman, now 
31, and Bridges played two brothers from Harlem who went to live 
with their mother's wealthy employer (Conrad Bain) after she died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plato played Bain's teen-age daughter, Kimberly.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, while visiting the Oklahoma home of her fiance's  
parents, the actress died after apparently taking the painkiller 
Loritab along with Valium. Police said the death appeared to be an 
accidental overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	She also had run-ins with the law. In 1991, she was arrested for  
robbing a Las Vegas video store and was placed on five years' 
probation. In 1992 she was given another five years' probation for 
forging prescriptions for Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	Series star Coleman, whose growth was stunted by a congenital  
kidney disorder, fought a bitter legal battle with his parents over 
whether he was mentally fit to handle his own affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Coleman pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace  
after he punched an autograph-seeker he claimed insulted him. 
Coleman testified he had worked as a security guard after having 
trouble finding work in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges was involved in a long series of arrests ranging from  
carrying a concealed weapon to attempted murder. In the latter 
case, he was acquitted on attempted murder and assault charges in 
connection with the 1989 shooting of a crack dealer.

<HEADLINE> More Than 1,000 Attend Hess Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Jets owner Leon Hess was remembered  
Monday for his wisdom and compassion in a funeral service attended 
by more than 1,000 mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody truly incredible has left us,'' teary-eyed Dennis  
Byrd said after the service at the Park Avenue Synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, 85, died Friday of complications from a blood disease.  
</P>
<P>
	Byrd recalled that when he was temporarily paralyzed from a  
football injury in 1992, Hess visited him at the hospital every 
night and was ``like a family member coming by to impart a little 
wisdom. ... He turned the worst time of my life into a blessing for 
me and my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd was joined at the service by Jets coach Bill Parcells and  
former Jets coach Rich Kotite. Also attending were Hall of Fame 
quarterback Joe Namath, former quarterback Boomer Esiason as well 
as other players and NFL owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sens. Bill Bradley and Alfonse D'Amato, former New York  
Gov. Hugh Carey and hotel queen Leona Helmsley were also there. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, who stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer  
of Amerada Hess Corp. in 1995, was remembered by his children and 
grandchildren as a hardworking family man who had a passion for 
both the oil business and his beloved Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could always tell how the Jets were doing by the condition  
of his cigar,'' said his son, John, who succeeded him as CEO of 
Amerada Hess. ``If it was short and chewed up, they were losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess also was a hard-nosed businessman. Whenever he faced a  
difficult negotiation, he liked to recall an encounter over oil 
prices with Moammar Gadhafi. The Libyan strongman watched as an 
associate in fatigues removed a pistol from a holster and placed it 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't scare me,'' Hess said.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the Jets won the Super Bowl in 1969, the team struggled  
for years after that. 
</P>
<P>
	If oil was Hess' business, football was his passion. He wanted  
to get the team back to the Super Bowl and hired a procession of 
coaches in the effort. He brought in Kotite in 1995, saying, ``I'm 
80 years old. I want results now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Kotite failed to supply them, Hess went after Parcells, who  
got the Jets back to the AFC championship game last January. After 
they lost to Denver, the owner met the team at the airport in the 
middle of the night to thank the players for their effort. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his son, Hess is survived by his wife, Norma; two  
daughters, Connie Williams, a state representative in Pennsylvania, 
and Marlene Hess; and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess was the fourth major New York sports figure to die in the  
last six months. Weeb Ewbank, who coached the 1969 Jets, died in 
November, as did former Knicks coach Red Holzman. Baseball great 
Joe DiMaggio died in March.

<HEADLINE> Norsk Hydro Bids on Private Oil Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- State-controlled Norsk Hydro ASA offered  
$2.2 billion in stock on Monday for its smaller rival, Saga 
Petroleum ASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga is the country's third largest oil company, after  
state-owned Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro, in which the government 
has a 51 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, with interests in petroleum, light metals and  
fertilizers, is offering to swap one of its shares for three Saga 
Petroleum shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represented a 35 percent premium over Saga's closing  
price on Friday and its shares soared 31 percent Monday on the Oslo 
Stock Exchange, while Norsk Hydro shares rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga reported a pretax loss of $244 million for 1998, and was  
planning austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro is the largest company listed on the Oslo exchange.  
Its offer was contingent on 90 percent of Saga's shareholders 
accepting the deal by the end of June, and on government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga and Norsk Hydro already have many joint ownership interests  
in fields on the Norwegian continental shelf, and have parallel 
organizations in operations and support activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro employs about 40,000 people worldwide, while Saga  
has a staff of roughly 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to cut about 800 jobs if the takeover goes  
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga reported a pretax loss of $244 million for 1998, and was  
planning austerity measures.

<HEADLINE> Mint Glut Gums Up Wash. '99 Harvest / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- The sweet smell of success seems elusive  
this season for farmers facing a national glut of mint oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers and buyers around the country are holding 3 million to 4  
million pounds of mint oil, nearly the amount Washington produces 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montana's Flathead Valley alone, growers have half a million  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farmers are still trying to sell mint harvested in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't stand a downturn that lasts much longer than this one  
has,'' says Wes Ferguson of Harrah, who has been growing mint for 
34 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A small portion of his crop has been contracted for sale at $9 a  
pound, but he hasn't found buyers for the rest. Two years ago, his 
native spearmint sold for $11 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at $8 a pound, there are few takers. ``You'd have trouble  
selling it. Nobody wants it,'' says Rocky Lunde, director of the 
Mint Industry Research Council in Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington is the country's top producer of spearmint oil. It's  
also a major source of peppermint oil, second only to Oregon. The 
oil is used to flavor toothpaste, gum and mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
	When demand for mint was strong a few years ago, U.S. growers  
began to add acreage. At the same time, countries such as India, 
China and Argentina emerged as major competitors, often selling 
mint oil for half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the Asian financial crisis caused overseas demand to slow  
and inventories began to build. 
</P>
<P>
	I.P. Callison &AMP; Sons, a Chehalis mint buyer, has been turning  
sales away for two years. Its Sunnyside warehouse is full. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has ``a huge oversupply, three times bigger than  
anything we've seen before,'' says Les Toews, Callison's vice 
president for purchasing and field operations. ``We're in uncharted 
territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A little mint oil goes a long way and has a long shelf life. One  
55-gallon barrel makes 5.2 million sticks of chewing gum. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Officials at the state Department of  
Agriculture are looking for ways to bring back Connecticut's oyster 
industry after a parasite swept through shoreline shellfish beds, 
wiping out up to 90 percent of some recent crops. 
</P>
<P>
	State biologists have spent the last year canvassing shellfish  
beds to assess the damage and provide insight for the future. Among 
the tactics under consideration is development of a hatchery in 
Groton to spawn resistant seed oysters. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursery approach would mark a departure from centuries of  
Connecticut oystering. Other large, oyster-producing states such as 
Washington employ hatcheries on a broad scale, but Connecticut has 
historically relied solely the open waters of Long Island Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcheries can accelerate the oyster's three-year growing cycle.  
</P>
<P>
	The state also has been spawning seed oysters that survived in  
Clinton harbor last year and offering them to oystermen to 
replenish their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resistant oysters will spawn resistant seed,'' said Inke  
Sunila, a shellfish pathologist with the aquaculture bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The parasites, known as dermo and MSX, last created major  
problems in the sound in the mid-1980s, and the industry, with help 
from the state, spent several years rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	When MSX and dermo reappeared in late 1996, oystermen felt it  
immediately. Overall, the state's oyster harvest dropped from 
525,809 bushels in 1996 to 179,562 bushels in 1998, according to 
the latest figures. The yields are the lowest since 1988, when the 
earlier parasite infection subsided.

<HEADLINE> Charges May Be Made in Parrot Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Police want to charge the son of Wisconsin  
football coach Barry Alvarez in the death of a parrot that was 
placed in a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Alvarez, a 23-year-old senior, is accused of breaking into  
a fraternity brother's room and killing the bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Police recommend he be charged with burglary and mistreatment of  
an animal. Judy Schwaemle, deputy Dane County district attorney, 
said today she had not yet reviewed the case. 
</P>
<P>
	If charged and convicted on both counts, Alvarez faces a maximum  
fine of $20,000 and 12-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez surrendered Friday and was released that day on a $500  
signature bond. He pleaded no contest in April to first-offense 
drunken driving, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigma Chi fraternity members found the parrot last week in the  
microwave while the oven was operating, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Greenfield owned the parrot and said whoever killed  
``Iago'' may have done so because he was angry about an e-mail that 
was passed around the fraternity house. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I was ridiculing him in front of the whole  
fraternity,'' Greenfield told The Capital Times. But Greenfield 
said ``there's no excuse when you put somebody's pet in the 
microwave and fry it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield did not refer to Alvarez by name, but he said whoever  
killed his parrot had confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield said the bird had a vocabulary of about 20 words. He  
said he locked his room last Tuesday, but someone could have used a 
master key to get in. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwaemle said Alvarez was tentatively ordered to appear in  
court Thursday, pending the decision on whether to issue charges.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Once Pavol Demitra became accustomed to the  
playoff grind, his game took off again. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, the St. Louis Blues' leading scorer in the regular  
season, continued a postseason surge when he beat Ed Belfour in 
overtime for a 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I scored almost 90 points and all of a sudden, I'm  
struggling,'' Demitra said. ``But I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Blues, who cut their series deficit against the NHL  
regular-season champions to 2-1 heading into Game 4 Wednesday night 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait,'' Demitra said. ``I'm so excited, I wish we can  
play right away. I'm just so pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Western Conference series continues tonight with  
Detroit playing host Colorado and holding a 2-0 lead. In the East, 
Toronto visits Pittsburgh tonight, and Boston is at Buffalo on 
Wednesday night. Both of those series are tied 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra, who was 10th in the NHL with 89 points, has three goals  
and an assist in the last two games since making the adjustment to 
the tighter checking and close quarters of playoff competition. 
That represents half of his postseason output; before Monday, he 
was a team-worst minus-4. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, he was plus-2 and also scored his first points in a  
Blues' playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked harder in determination to come up with loose  
pucks and taking it to the net more,'' coach Joel Quenneville said. 
``And he's getting in place in the high-traffic areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demitra got to just such an area, outside the crease at the  
right side of the net, when he scored the winner at 2:43 of 
overtime off a feed from Geoff Courtnall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I'm on the ice with him, I feel I can score,''  
Demitra said. ``He fed me last year all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues' third goal also was a Demitra production. After  
avoiding a check from Richard Matvichuk, Demitra slipped the puck 
to rookie Jochen Hecht, who slid in a backhander for a 2-1 lead at 
4:52 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecht and Mike Eastwood, who also scored for the Blues, were  
unlikely offensive sources. Hecht had a team-leading 56 points with 
the Worcester Icecats of the AHL, but wasn't summoned until 
Saturday after they were eliminated from the playoffs. Eastwood, a 
faceoff specialist, has seven goals in 62 career playoff games and 
two points in 10 playoff games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of unsung heroes in the playoffs and we're  
getting that right now,'' Blues right wing Scott Young said. 
``That's why we've been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, the NHL regular-season champions with a  
franchise-record 114 points, missed a chance to put the Blues in a 
huge hole. Only two teams have recovered from a 3-0 series deficit, 
the last the New York Islanders in 1975 against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' team-record six-game playoff winning streak also came to  
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go 16-0,'' defenseman Derian Hatcher said.  
``You expect to lose a game here or there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull scored in his first postseason game in St. Louis  
since leaving the Blues after a decade of stardom last summer, and 
Darryl Sydor added his first of the playoffs for Dallas. A crowd of 
19,268, the Blues' first sellout of the playoffs, booed when Hull's 
name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues largely silenced Joe Nieuwendyk, who had an assist and  
only one shot. Nieuwendyk had two goals and an assist, including 
the game-winner in overtime, in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars may be without center Jere Lehtinen in Game 4.  
Lehtinen injured his right knee in the second period and is listed 
as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor forced the overtime with his first goal of the playoffs at  
9:08 of the third. Grant Fuhr got a glove on Pat Verbeek's drive 
from the slot, and Grant Marshall got his stick on the rebound 
before Sydor tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-minute high-sticking penalty on Blues captain Chris  
Pronger, who caught Hatcher in the face, helped the Stars get off 
to a fast start. Hull scored his second goal of the playoffs, and 
only Dallas' third in 33 power-play opportunities, with a shot from 
the left circle at 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues got off only three shots in the first period, but tied  
it on a fluky goal at 2:58 of the second. Ricard Persson flipped 
the puck end-over-end toward the net and it deflected off 
Eastwood's glove and Sergei Zubov's stick before eluding Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues outshot the Stars 24-18 in regulation and took the  
only four shots in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't shoot enough,'' Stars forward Jamie Langenbrunner  
said. ``Instead of putting it on net, we passed.''

<HEADLINE> NBC, Xoom.com, Snap.com Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC and two online partners are launching a new,  
publicly traded company that will combine most of the network's 
Internet operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company, NBC Internet or NBCi, will include the Snap Web  
directory and Xoom.com, a direct marketing service. The deal does 
not include MSNBC news, the network's 50-50 partnership with 
Microsoft Corp., but MSNBC will have prominent placement on the new 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The three partners are hoping to create a strong,  
general-interest site by combining the entertainment appeal and 
marketing capability of NBC, Web searching from Snap and expertise 
in online commerce from Xoom.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our broad-based Internet play,'' Tom Rogers, executive  
vice president of NBC, said in an interview. ``This is the one 
we're putting our shoulder and muscle behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main Web site will continue to operate under the name Snap!,  
but content from NBC and the network's trademark peacock logo will 
be prominently featured. The site will also combine material from 
the network's current Web site, NBC.com, and its Videoseeker.com 
video guide service. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Kitze, the chairman and co-founder of Xoom.com, said the  
companies hope to use the powerful capability of TV networks to 
reach viewers as a way to bolster the online business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that in the long run what will win in this business  
is an integrated media play, where the network takes viewers, 
drives those people to the Internet, where they'll use sites like 
Snap and commerce facilities like Xoom,'' Kitze said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	NBCi will buy $380 million in TV advertising from the network  
over the next four years, and expects to buy an additional $500 
million over the following six. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will start off owning 49 percent of the new company, with  
the option to increase its stake to 53 percent later. Xoom.com 
shareholders would own 34 percent and CNET 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's president and CEO Bob Wright will become chairman of the  
new company, and Kitze will become president. 
</P>
<P>
	By rolling most of its Internet assets into one package, NBC is  
hoping to take advantage of the seemingly endless enthusiasm among 
investors for companies whose business lies purely in the Internet. 
Officials said the transaction should be completed by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal sent the stocks of NBC's two online partners  
soaring Monday. Shares in Snap's parent company CNET rose $21.75 or 
19 percent to $135.50, while Xoom.com gained $6.75, or 9 percent, 
to $81.87 1/2. Both companies trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock of NBC's parent company, General Electric Co., slipped  
$1.18 3/4 or 1 percent to $108.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major TV networks have also made ventures into the online  
world, but this deal marks the first time that a network's main 
online operation will be a publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has taken stakes in several Internet startup companies,  
including Marketwatch.com, in exchange for promotion on its TV and 
radio networks. ABC's parent Walt Disney Co. has interests in the 
Go Network and the Infoseek Web portal.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Still Short of Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A communication satellite that was  
launched into a useless orbit last week was flying higher Monday, 
but was still far short of its intended orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of getting the Orion satellite to the desired  
22,300-mile altitude remained slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Another satellite, meanwhile, will remain grounded for at least  
a month because of rain that leaked onto it even though it was in a 
protective room at the launch pad. It was the latest in a series of 
mishaps at Cape Canaveral Air Station and has prompted the Air 
Force to convene a review board. 
</P>
<P>
	The military's Global Positioning System satellite had been  
scheduled for launch aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket as early as 
this weekend. It will be removed from the rocket and inspected for 
damage from Saturday's thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Orion, ground controllers for satellite maker Hughes  
Space and Communications Co. used on-board thrusters Friday night 
to raise the low end of the lopsided orbit from 98 miles to 262 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They accomplished what they wanted to accomplish, which was to  
get it out of the Earth's atmosphere,'' Hughes spokesman Emery 
Wilson said Monday. ``At this time, we're kind of waiting for our 
customer to decide what they would like us to do with the 
satellite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Loral Space and Communications, John McCarthy,  
said the company is looking at all the options. 
</P>
<P>
	The $230 million botched launch on May 4 was the second failure  
in a row for Boeing's new Delta III rocket, a bigger, upgraded 
version of the Delta II. The inaugural flight in August ended in an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the rocket's second stage fired for only one second  
before abruptly shutting down 22 minutes after liftoff. It should 
have fired for nearly three minutes. At the same time, the engine 
experienced a pressure spike and shudder.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Wins Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forward Debbie Keller, who claimed she was  
excluded from the U.S. women's soccer team in retaliation for a 
sexual harassment lawsuit, lost her case against the U.S. Soccer 
Federation on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbitrators Mark Crane, Dan Burns, Herbert Channick conveyed the  
decision orally, USSF general counsel John Collins said. A written 
decision may follow. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 witnesses testified during a hearing in Chicago  
last week, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a written decision, the exact findings of the  
arbitration panel were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no finding of retaliation by the federation, or she  
had not proved her allegation, which each means the same,'' Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller's Washington-based lawyer, Dane Butswinkas, did not  
return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this matter behind us, our players, coaches and  
administrative staff can continue to focus on the most important 
task at hand, which is winning the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup,'' 
USSF secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller, a two-time national player of the year, filed the $12  
million suit last Aug. 25 along with former North Carolina teammate 
Melissa Jennings, claiming coach Anson Dorrance made uninvited 
sexual advances and harassed her during and after her college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	A forward who played for the Tar Heels from 1993-96, Keller also  
named the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, school and 
athletic administrators and women's assistant coaches as defendants 
in the suit, which is awaiting trial. Dorrance, the only women's 
soccer coach North Carolina has ever had, is the former coach of 
the U.S. women's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller argued she was bypassed for the 26-player residency camp  
for the U.S. women's team in retaliation for the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 30, U.S. District Judge Ann Claire Williams transferred  
the suit from Illinois to Greensboro, N.C., but denied a dismissal 
motion by university lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Answers Sought in NYC 911 Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's 911 emergency response system  
has failed three times this year, including once in January, when a 
man requiring medical aid died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdowns have left city officials and Bell Atlantic, which  
maintains the network, pointing fingers and fumbling for answers. 
No one can say precisely what's gone wrong or guarantee the $200 
million system won't fail again. 
</P>
<P>
	While the January failure was blamed on a power outage -- and the  
failure of a backup system -- the two most recent instances, on 
April 28 and May 4, remain unexplained despite extensive tests of 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get to the cause of this, to find out, `What is  
it?''' said Bell Atlantic spokesman John Bonomo. ``We want to make 
sure the system is fail-safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a busy day, police operating 911 in New York City receive  
some 30,000 calls, dozens of which are life-and-death situations. 
</P>
<P>
	During the January service disruption, 41-year-old John Audy of  
Vermont, who was in Queens to celebrate his girlfriend's 40th 
birthday, suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend dialed 911 three times but got busy signals.  
Finally, she ran barefoot in 23-degree weather to a police station 
nearby. Audy died by the time help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two recent cases, some callers to 911 encountered up to  
30 seconds of silence before being connected to an operator. It is 
unclear how many hung up without waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	After the most recent shutdown, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the  
city's police commissioner said the phone company had taken the 
blame. But Bell Atlantic denied having told police the breakdowns 
were its fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department, which collects a small monthly surcharge  
on phone lines, has received $117 million since 1991 for a new 
back-up 911 facility and to pay for technological upgrades but has 
failed to find an adequate site in the city of 7.4 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The department did not respond to calls for comment.

<HEADLINE> Internet Co. Loses Playboy Logo Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Miami Beach company must stop using the Playboy  
name and the well-known rabbit head logo on its Internet sites, a 
federal judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises International Inc. had filed a  
federal complaint against Miami Beach-based Global Site Designs 
Inc., saying Global used the famous name and trademark for its own 
financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Edward B. Davis issued a temporary  
restraining order against Global and two employees last week. When 
no Global representatives showed up Monday for a hearing on the 
matter, Davis entered an injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy attorneys said Global's two sites were rip-offs of  
Playboy's own Web site, which prominently displays the trademark 
Playboy Online, and of Playboy's recent search for a Playmate for 
the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Global's Web sites announced a ``talent search,'' offering cash  
and prizes to women who sent in videos, photos and personal 
information. Global offered $100,000 and a Stingray Corvette to 
winners. The Web site charged a $20 processing fee to review model 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Global's Web sites, www.playboyonline.net and  
www.playmatesearch.net, have apparently been taken offline. 
Attempts to link with them Monday were unsuccessful,and a telephone 
call to Global was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy is still fighting other companies that use Playboy's  
name to sponsor unauthorized model searches, Francescani said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher Against Yen / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today in  
directionless trading in Tokyo, while strengthening against the 
euro amid increasing tension over the Yugoslav situation. Japanese 
stocks advanced slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.32  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also marginally higher than its 
late Friday New York level of 120.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.49 points,  
or 0.18 percent, closing the day's session at 16,977.01 points. On 
Friday, the average lost 354.09 points, or 2.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially showed its strength following mild U.S.  
jobs data released Friday. April's overall jobless rate of 4.3 
percent was only slightly above the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent 
reached in March, the U.S. Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. currency settled almost flat in Asian trading today  
as steady buying by Japanese investors and U.S. funds was offset by 
selling by Japanese trust banks and exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the market doesn't have a consensus on the dollar's  
direction from current levels, exporters and trust banks sold the 
dollar on rises,'' said Shigeru Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's upside was also limited by a remark by a top ruling  
party politician pointing toward additional economic stimulus, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Dow Jones Newswires if an extra session of Japan's  
Parliament is needed to discuss additional steps to stimulate the 
economy, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Yoshiro Mori 
said, ``That's common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.57 yen and 121.04 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was exposed to steady selling  
pressure against the dollar following NATO's bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Yugoslavia last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has expressed regret for the mistaken attack but pledged to  
pursue the bombing campaign until Yugoslavia accepts a plan to end 
the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell how the misguided bombing would affect the  
peace process. But the fact is certainly a euro-sell factor,'' said 
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 129.68 yen, down from 130.22 yen late  
Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices were supported by  
continued hopes that the government may come up with additional 
economic steps to stimulate the economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said Sunday that  
an extra budget to stimulate economic growth was ``one possible 
choice'' the government is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors, however, remain hesitant to buy stocks ahead of  
earnings announcements in coming weeks from Japanese companies for 
the fiscal year that ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.44 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,373.86. The 
TOPIX closed down 12.70 points, or 0.92 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.330 percent from 1.315 percent Friday, driving its 
price down to 104.18 yen from 104.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> YPF Board OKs Repsol's $13.44B Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP)-- The Argentine oil concern YPF SA  
has endorsed the $13.44 billion cash acquisition offer proposed by 
Spanish energy giant Repsol SA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offer in cash by Repsol assures the just and equal  
treatment for all shareholders,'' YPF chairman Roberto Monti said 
in a filing to the Buenos Aires stock exchange on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always have maintained a philosophy based on creating  
value, and it is the board's opinion, to which I adhere, that the 
offer by Repsol offers the best alternative of value for our 
shareholders in the current conditions of the market,'' Monti 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol has offered to acquire the 85 percent of YPF it doesn't  
already own at $44.78 per American depositary share. 
</P>
<P>
	In YPF's filing, the Argentine oil giant said a review of the  
Repsol offer -- performed by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. -- 
called that offer ``reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	YPF added that Repsol chairman Alfonso Cortina, who was named to  
YPF's 12-member board in April, did not participate in the 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Repsol's offer runs from May 24 through June 23 and is  
conditioned on Repsol obtaining a majority ownership of YPF. If the 
deal between the two former state-owned oil companies goes through, 
Repsol said it hopes to achieve double-digit earnings growth 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	YPF owns and operates three refineries, and owns 2,253 service  
stations in Argentina. It specializes in oil production and 
exploration. It earned $1.1 billion on revenue of $5.5 billion in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> $581M Awarded in Alleged Overcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A jury awards a jaw-dropping $581  
million to a family that claimed a finance company tried to cheat 
them out of $1,200 for two satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Is the verdict proof of a ``jackpot justice'' system in  
desperate need of repair? Or is it an instance of the only real way 
Alabama consumers can be protected from cheats? 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict -- possibly the largest in state history and almost  
certain to be reduced -- provided fresh ammunition to critics asking 
lawmakers this session to revamp the state legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly highlights the need for reform,'' Kathy Bowden of  
the Alabama Civil Justice Reform Committee said Monday. ``It's a 
BIG highlight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But trial lawyers say deterrence is the only protection for  
customers given Alabama's weak consumer protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the system is working now better than it ever has,''  
said plaintiff's attorney Tom Methvin of Montgomery. ``Jury awards 
like this serve a necessary interest in our society. They draw 
attention to a problem that needs attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As early as today, the Alabama Senate could consider bills that  
would limit punitive damages awards and make it more difficult to 
file ``frivolous'' lawsuits. A committee has approved the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Siegelman said Monday he would sign the bills.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to pass reasonable tort reform in Alabama, while at  
the same time protect consumers from unscrupulous conduct,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an Alabama jury a few years ago that awarded $4 million  
to a doctor who didn't like that the paint had been touched up on 
his new BMW. The Supreme Court struck down the award, and the 
doctor eventually got $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the current case, Barbara Carlisle and her parents, George  
and Velma Merriweather of Greensboro, sued Whirlpool Financial 
National Bank and Gulf Coast Electronics, contending the companies 
tried to gouge them for $612 each on the purchase of two $1,100 
satellite dishes sold door-to-door in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A sales person told the three they would have to pay $34 a month  
for three years, but the contract ran for 4 1/2 years, said Methvin, 
who represented the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard testimony that the company cheated thousands of  
people out of $8 million by getting them to sign credit card deals 
that required them to pay as much as 300 percent in interest, even 
though the advertised rate was only 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool Financial said any wrongdoing was committed by Gulf  
Coast Electronics, a Mobile retailer that financed dish sales 
through Whirlpool Financial. The verdict went against both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Once it learned of the allegations in the suit, Whirlpool  
Financial waived payment of the amount that was disputed by Ms. 
Carlisle and her parents, said Robert Spotswood, a lawyer for 
Whirlpool Corp., which sold Whirlpool Financial to TransAmerica 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The family lost nothing, Spotswood said, yet jurors in Hale  
County on Friday awarded them $975,000 to for mental anguish and 
$580 million to punish the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of Gulf Coast Electronics, Don Gantt Jr., said his  
company sold the family a good system at a fair price through a 
newspaper advertisement, and then installed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Carlisle nor the Merriweathers could be located by  
telephone for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Spotswood said the case will be appealed. And Methvin said he  
expects the verdict to be reduced to less than $1 million because 
of the Supreme Court's 1996 ruling in the BMW case.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- In high school, Derek Fisher was on the  
floor so often diving for loose balls that he earned the nickname 
``The Mop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher cleaned up for the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, making  
key defensive plays in the closing seconds of their 101-100 victory 
over the Houston Rockets in the opener of the first-round Western 
Conference series. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest play may have been a head-first dive onto the floor  
to grab a loose ball from Scottie Pippen with seven seconds 
remaining and Houston ahead by one point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy it, it gets my blood boiling,'' Fisher said of his  
on-court wrestling. ``I don't really think I'm playing that hard or 
playing that well if I don't get down there and dive on the loose 
balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also scored 20 points, one off his career best, and hit four  
3-pointers while picking up an assortment of scrapes and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wouldn't had the type of game he had, we would've  
lost,'' Glen Rice of the Lakers said after Monday's practice. 
``Offensively, he was explosive. Defensively, he was on every loose 
ball, stealing the ball from people. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to have guys like Derek Fisher, guys that are  
willing to get down there no matter what it takes, and get 
scratched up every now and then and ignite the defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of performance Fisher needed to make everyone  
forget the flashiness of ex-Laker Nick Van Exel and the steady 
shooting of Derek Harper, two veteran point guards whom Fisher 
wasn't supposed to be ahead of in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave my teammates and my coaching staff even more  
confidence that in big-game situations, I'm capable of stepping up 
and contributing,'' he said. ``Pretty much my entire athletic 
career, I've always had to prove that I was capable of playing with 
the best guys on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher took some of the Rockets by surprise, including Pippen.  
</P>
<P>
	``He played much better than we anticipated, much better than we  
wanted him to play,'' Pippen said. ``That sort of hurt us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher doesn't think the Rockets can adjust enough to affect his  
game Tuesday night when the best-of-5 series resumes at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way they're going to double off of Glen Rice and I  
don't think you want to double off of Kobe Bryant, either,'' he 
said. ``Throughout the series, they'll still continue to double off 
of me and just continue to try to make me make the shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley said Houston doesn't need to adjust anything.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see anything different other than us turning  
the ball over in crucial situations,'' he said. ``We just made a 
couple of mental errors. We played well enough to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich refused to get caught up in the  
Monday morning second-guessing of his team's final play, a 
pick-and-roll with rookie Cuttino Mobley driving to the basket only 
to have Shaquille O'Neal roar in from behind and swat the ball 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ball hit the floor, so did the Rockets' chance to win on  
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody starts talking about this one little play and that  
little play,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We did a lot of good things. We 
played good up until the last couple minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Rockets begrudged Mobley's drive at the buzzer,  
including their big three of Pippen, Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he did a good job. He went to the basket  
aggressive,'' Pippen said. ``If we have a chance to do it again, 
we'll probably give him the opportunity again. Cuttino is a heck of 
a player. We felt good about what we ran at the end of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich said being down one game doesn't make for a  
desperate situation, yet he admitted the pressure has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure was on them the first game, big-time. You got to  
hold serve. You lose that first one, then the visiting team has 
another shot at you,'' he said. ``(Being down 1-0) changes the 
psychology.''

<HEADLINE> Shopper Jailed for Attacking Clerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- An angry Christmas shopper whose attack on a  
department store clerk was captured on video got 10 days in jail 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miranda Smith, 21, also was fined $500, placed on probation for  
one year and ordered to attend an anger-management class. 
</P>
<P>
	She had pleaded guilty to assault and battery.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dec. 2 surveillance video from the Hudson's department store  
at Oakland Mall showed her step behind the sales counter, push the 
clerk, throw her to the ground and swing at her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Smith had been frustrated by what she perceived  
as poor service. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape showed Ms. Smith had been waiting for help from a busy  
sales clerk. When she asked for a different size dress, the clerk 
rolled her eyes and another clerk laughed. Ms. Smith attacked the 
second clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, Marcia Temerowski, asked for $5,000 in restitution.  
The judge did not immediately decide on the request.

<HEADLINE> Questions Before Buying Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Computers run on software, which is to say they run on money --  
yours. And a few moments of thought in the software store or on the 
net can save you some money. 
</P>
<P>
	Before you open your wallet, ask yourself some questions:  
</P>
<P>
	--1) Do I already own software that can handle this task? An  
example is a $19.99 effort called ``Secret Diary &AMP; More'' from 
Encore Software, Inc., of Los Angeles, Calif. Although it's nice 
enough, the central point of the software is a password-protected 
secret diary for girls age 7 and older, plus a stationery-maker, 
personal calendar and address book. 
</P>
<P>
	If you already own either Corel's WordPerfect, or Microsoft's  
Word, just show your daughter how to password protect her files and 
call it a day. (If she doesn't already know, that is. Mine had it 
figured early, I discovered while accidentally trying to open a 
file named ``josh.'') And the word processors will also handle 
fonts and borders for stationery, addresses and dates. 
</P>
<P>
	--2) Is it really easier to do this task without a computer?  
Intuit's Quicken has been keeping track of my checkbook for years 
and years. Now, with the advent of palm computers, real techies 
with $39.95 to burn can run Pocket Quicken on their Palm machines, 
enter transactions in the real world, and then synchronize them 
with the full version of Quicken on the desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	But those with less money and inclination to digitize everything  
can be just as synchronized by keeping track of checks on a note 
card shoved in a pocket along with credit-card slips and entering 
the data at home. 
</P>
<P>
	--3) Why am I upgrading? Software publishers upgrade constantly  
in an effort to generate revenue from both existing and new 
customers. Think twice before upgrading if you're happy with the 
existing product. Besides enriching the publisher, your rewards are 
likely to be small and may even be irritating if the upgrade 
changed commands and functions significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	--4) Will my machine run this program? Software publishers  
sometimes seem to be in a contest for hiding system requirements in 
tiny type on the bottom of the package. Find them before you buy. 
Also be wary of the mealy-mouthed ``minimum'' and ``recommended'' 
hardware configurations. Sure, the software will run on the 
``minimum'' configuration, but in about the same way as an 
80-year-old running uphill. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Regular readers saw an earlier rant about a DirecTV home  
satellite system that stopped working and the advice from Hughes 
Network Systems to do some tests with a voltage meter -- certainly a 
common bit of household equipment, right? Here's how things worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The meter was less than $20 at Radio Shack. And so, meter in  
hand, I determined that the receiver was indeed producing voltage -- 
but still no picture. Reported that to Hughes, was assigned Trouble 
Number 3154173 and given the number of a nearby service company. 
The service company asked for voltage checks at the ground block, 
the part of the cable outside the house that is grounded to prevent 
lightning strikes from blasting the equipment inside. Good voltage 
in and out. Reluctantly, the company agreed to an on-site visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A technician showed up, spent two hours, confirmed that it  
didn't work, and promised to call back. Never did. Never sent a 
bill, either, which is good -- it wouldn't have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally opened a phone book and selected a different satellite  
service company that showed up on time, correctly diagnosed a dead 
LNB and corrected the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Time involved: three weeks. Expense involved, including the  
meter, $285. Lesson learned: it would have been cheaper, and 
quicker, to buy a complete new system, now being offered in the New 
York metro area for $199, including installation. Ah, technology! 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Market Reacts to Chevron-Texaco Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors on Monday began discounting the  
possibility that Chevron Corp. might buy Texaco Inc. . 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chevron, which fell $2.93 3/4 Friday when reports of  
negotiations over a deal hit the market, bounced back $1.37 1/2 Monday 
to $96.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Texaco, which rose $5.06 1/4 
Friday, fell $1.37 1/2 Monday to $65.87 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of an acquiring company often fall as investors bet that  
the cost of the purchase will dilute profits. Those shares 
sometimes recover if market sentiment increases that the deal won't 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeover targets often rise as investors believe shares will be  
worth more in an acquisition than on the open market. Likewise, if 
the market believes the deal isn't imminent, those shares often 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the two are  
discussing a $42 billion stock deal that would unite the nation's 
third and fourth biggest energy companies 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper, citing unidentified people familar with the  
talks, said the companies aren't near an agreement and said a 
combination faces enormous hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Chevron, based in San Francisco, and Texaco, based  
in White Plains, N.Y., declined to comment on a deal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Large oil companies have been rushing to unite because of  
falling oil prices and the need to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., the nation's two  
biggest energy companies, plan to vote later this month on a 
merger. British Petroleum acquired Amoco Corp., then the fifth 
largest U.S. energy concern, last year and the combined company, BP 
Amoco, has agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron chairman Kenneth Derr and Texaco chief executive Peter  
Bijur both have said recently they don't need partners to be 
successful but would consider merging with other companies to 
increase cash flow or efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say a Chevron-Texaco merger would make less  
sense than other recent oil company mergers because both companies 
have been cutting costs on their own and Texaco last year formed a 
refining partnership with Shell Oil, which would present a 
regulatory stumbling block.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Group Recommended in A's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A group headed by Hall of Famer Joe  
Morgan and former Oakland Athletics executive Andy Dolich received 
a recommendation from city and county leaders Monday in their bid 
to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-1 vote rejected commissioner Bud Selig's suggestion that  
bids from two groups be forwarded to major league owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The other group is led by San Mateo lawyer Michael Lazarus and  
includes former pitcher Steve Stone, now a broadcaster for the 
Chicago Cubs; and Bob Watson, a former A's coach and a former 
general manager of the Houston Astros and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just decided the community doesn't want to do it,'' Alameda  
County Supervisor Gail Steele said of Selig's idea. ``I might have 
played the chess game differently but everybody involved wanted to 
play it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgan group is backed by Bob Piccinini, chairman of  
Modesto-based Save Mart Foods, who provided the $12 million 
deposit. The other group is backed by Arizona banker Lyle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation was made by the Oakland Alameda County  
Coliseum Authority, which consists of two supervisors and two 
councilmen. Final approval of the purchaser rests with major league 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the City Council cast an advisory vote recommending the  
Morgan-Dolich group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement worked out in October with current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, the authority had until 
Tuesday to forward recommendations to the baseball on who should 
buy the A's for about $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the agreement with Schott and Hofmann, the Athletics  
agreed to stay in Oakland through the 2001 season, with a right to 
extend their lease on a year-to-year basis through 2004. When 
Schott and Hofmann bought the A's for $85 million in 1995, they 
signed a nine-year lease at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The new owners of the A's will be required to keep the team in  
Oakland through at least 2004.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Has 3 HRs, Drives in 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra hit a pair of grand slams and a  
two-run homer, driving in 10 RBIs during Boston's game against 
Seattle on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hit his first home run of the season last  
Wednesday, hit his second career grand slam in the first inning off 
rookie Brett Hinchliffe, then hit another in the eighth off Eric 
Weaver for 12-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-run homer came off Hinchliffe in the third inning.  
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hit a grand slam against the Mariners on Sept.  
2, 1998, also hit a solo homer in Sunday's 4-2 win over Anaheim. He 
hit 35 home runs last year and has five this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 RBIs tied the Red Sox record, a mark last accomplished by  
Fred Lynn on June 18, 1975 at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	In his other at-bats, Garciaparra fouled out and walked.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Put Chapter 7 Worries Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sometime later this week, the Penguins' next  
game could be their last -- not just in these NHL playoffs, but in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	They would appreciate it if people quit reminding them.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are entangled in a scenario previously unseen in  
major U.S. pro sports, with the franchise's very fate being played 
out in bankruptcy court at the same time the team is in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey players are accustomed to regularly changing uniforms,  
cities and addresses, so the possibility they might leave 
Pittsburgh probably is more unnerving to their fans than it is to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps that's why coach Kevin Constantine got rather testy  
Monday when a TV station producer asked him yet again about the 
difficulties of running a team that may be out of money before it 
runs out of games to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be rude, but I'll say it for the 1,000th time,  
bankruptcy is not an issue,'' Constantine said. ``It shouldn't be, 
it can't be and it isn't. ... It doesn't affect the coaches or 
players. The playoffs are the only thing we're focused on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That can't be said for all of the Penguins' nervous employees.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will hold an emergency  
hearing Tuesday on the NHL's petition to move up the creditors' 
vote on prospective owner Mario Lemieux's reorganization plan from 
June 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL strongly supports Lemieux's bid, but wants the Penguins'  
situation to be sorted out by June 1 or the franchise likely will 
be disbanded or sold elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's bid is expected to get a financial boost when his  
group finalizes an agreement with Internet millionaire Mark Cuban 
to join up, according to sources close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban, who founded the Broadcast.com web site that carries pro  
and college sports, concerts and radio stations on the Internet, is 
a Mount Lebanon, Pa., native who wants to keep the Penguins in 
Pittsburgh. He and his partners recently sold Broadcast.com to 
Yahoo! for $6.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins star Jaromir Jagr said Monday he can't think of a  
better scenario: a well-funded ownership group led by Lemieux, the 
team's former star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves offense. He loves to have a winning team. He would do  
anything to win a Stanley Cup,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Jagr said he hasn't closely followed the case, and he  
learned the details only upon visiting briefly with Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about that stuff ... it's all about the lawyers  
and I don't understand that stuff,'' Jagr said. ``Mario explained a 
little bit about it, but I have no clue what is going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Jagr joked that if Lemieux became his boss, he would  
not renegotiate his $48 million contract. Part of the Penguins' 
current financial problems stem from the estimated $26 million in 
deferred salary owed Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two different kinds of owners: owners who are  
businessmen and owners who love the game, and I'd put Mario in that 
second category,'' Jagr said. ``Some of the owners, it's a game, 
but they just don't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a lot better for everybody (if Mario got the team)  
... The fans would start coming more. They don't know if the Pens 
are going to be here or not. Mario Lemieux could put the team in 
the right direction and turn the franchise around.''

<HEADLINE> Government Scrutinizes Risky Workplaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government safety watchdogs are beginning to  
pay special attention to workplaces with above-average rates of 
injury and illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 12,500 employers have been sent letters asking them to  
make job sites safer. The largest number of those notices went to 
nursing homes, trucking companies and warehouses -- places where 
heavy lifting is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``These employers must do better,'' Labor Secretary Alexis  
Herman said. ``Workers should not have to risk serious injury or 
illness or their lives for their livelihood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It surprises a lot of people that nursing home work is one of  
the most dangerous occupations in America -- more dangerous than 
working in a coal mine or a steel mill,'' said Andrew L. Stern, 
president of the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies that got the largest number of the special  
notifications recently from the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration said they've been improving workplace safety for 
years, and noted they were targeted based on 1997 data. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was two years ago,'' said Dan Springer, vice president of  
public relations for Beverly Enterprises Inc., an Arkansas-based 
nursing home chain. ``Over the course of the last couple years, 
recognizing the strain that is inherent in our business ... we've 
taken action to mitigate workplace injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Roughly three-quarters of the injuries, and probably more,  
that take place in a nursing home relative to workers' 
compensation, are back-related and that's due to the lifting of 
residents, primarily,'' Springer said. He said the company has 
invested $15 million in mechanical lifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has spent $5 million on training in the proper  
techniques for lifting patients who are unable to get out of a bed 
or chair unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
	United Parcel Service, which joined Beverly at the top of the  
list of companies receiving multiple OSHA notices, has spent nearly 
$1 billion since 1995 on improving health and safety programs, said 
spokesman Tom Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Days lost to disability have been on the decline at UPS, Walsh  
said, dropping by 7.5 percent in the first quarter of this year. He 
attributed that to a recent company effort to work with its unions 
to encourage safer work methods and habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters union, which opposes UPS positions on the need for  
new safety standards, gives the company credit for recent efforts 
to make workplaces safer. ``I do see some positive things that 
they're doing,'' said Lamont Byrd, the union's director of safety 
and health. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSHA notification letters, mailed in late April, were the  
result of answers to a mandatory 1997 survey of workplaces. Sites 
were selected for the special letters based on the number of 
employee days reported lost to work-related illness or injury. The 
construction industry, which accounts for nearly half of all OSHA 
inspections, was exempted because of the temporary nature of its 
work sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is OSHA's most extensive effort to reduce workplace  
hazards since a federal appeals court blocked the use of the 
agency's cooperative compliance program, under which employers with 
the highest injury rates could reduce their odds of being inspected 
by voluntarily adopting a safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court agreed with business groups who argued that  
the compliance program was coercive. OSHA has not decided whether 
to appeal that ruling, but in the new round of notifications it 
struck a far more conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA recognizes that an elevated lost workday illness and  
injury rate does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in 
safety and health on the part of your business,'' its letter said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher Against Yen / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen today in  
directionless trading in Tokyo, while strengthening against the 
euro amid increasing tension over the Yugoslav situation. Japanese 
stocks advanced slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.32  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also marginally higher than its 
late Friday New York level of 120.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.49 points,  
or 0.18 percent, closing the day's session at 16,977.01 points. On 
Friday, the average lost 354.09 points, or 2.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially showed its strength following mild U.S.  
jobs data released Friday. April's overall jobless rate of 4.3 
percent was only slightly above the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent 
reached in March, the U.S. Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. currency settled almost flat in Asian trading today  
as steady buying by Japanese investors and U.S. funds was offset by 
selling by Japanese trust banks and exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the market doesn't have a consensus on the dollar's  
direction from current levels, exporters and trust banks sold the 
dollar on rises,'' said Shigeru Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's upside was also limited by a remark by a top ruling  
party politician pointing toward additional economic stimulus, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Dow Jones Newswires if an extra session of Japan's  
Parliament is needed to discuss additional steps to stimulate the 
economy, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Yoshiro Mori 
said, ``That's common sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.57 yen and 121.04 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was exposed to steady selling  
pressure against the dollar following NATO's bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Yugoslavia last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has expressed regret for the mistaken attack but pledged to  
pursue the bombing campaign until Yugoslavia accepts a plan to end 
the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell how the misguided bombing would affect the  
peace process. But the fact is certainly a euro-sell factor,'' said 
Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 129.68 yen, down from 130.22 yen late  
Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices were supported by  
continued hopes that the government may come up with additional 
economic steps to stimulate the economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said Sunday that  
an extra budget to stimulate economic growth was ``one possible 
choice'' the government is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors, however, remain hesitant to buy stocks ahead of  
earnings announcements in coming weeks from Japanese companies for 
the fiscal year that ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.44 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,373.86. The 
TOPIX closed down 12.70 points, or 0.92 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.330 percent from 1.315 percent Friday, driving its 
price down to 104.18 yen from 104.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mixed; Dow Down 24.34 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mixed Monday in a choppy  
session that saw profit-taking in blue chips amid worries about 
higher interest rates. But traders showed a renewed interest in 
technology stocks, particularly Internet issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.34 to 11,007.25 after  
fluctuating between positive and negative territory throughout the 
session. On Friday, the Dow rose 84.77 to close at 11,031.59, its 
second record high close for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended mixed Monday. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index declined 4.70 to 1,340.30, but the Nasdaq 
composite rose 22.77 to 2,526.39, largely on the strength of 
Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold big-company stocks and growth stocks, which  
depend on lower interest rates, although yields actually declined 
in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury yield fell to 5.78 percent from 5.81  
percent late Friday, but it is still up more than 0.60 percentage 
point since April 20, and investors are concerned that it will 
continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury is auctioning $15 billion of 5-year bonds Tuesday  
and another $12 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday. The new supply 
could push yields higher, said Hugh Johnson, market strategist at 
First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising rates typically prompt some selling in financial services  
stocks and also in stocks trading at high prices relative to their 
earnings projections, Johnson said. Higher rates tend to eat into 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Big consumer products stocks closed lower, with Johnson &AMP;  
Johnson dropping 2 3/4 to 93 3/8 and Procter &AMP; Gamble down 11/16 at 90 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors bought the stocks of basic-materials companies,  
believing that those industries will benefit from higher prices. 
Kaiser Aluminum rose 1/2 point to 8 1/2 after Credit Suisse First Boston 
upgraded its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were higher on reports USA Networks will abandon  
its bid to acquire Lycos after concluding it can't win approval 
from Lycos shareholders. Lycos stock rose 15 3/4 to 105 1/4, while USA 
Networks eased 1/8 to 35 1/4. Shares of CMGI Inc., a holding company 
that has about a 20 percent stake in Lycos, advanced 16 11/16 to 
237 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, merger news moved other stocks. HSBC Holdings PLC is  
buying Republic National Bank of New York and an affiliated banking 
company for about $10.3 billion in cash. Under the agreement, HSBC 
will pay $72 a share for Republic New York and Safra Republic 
Holdings SA. Republic's stock fell 1 15/16 to 68 1/16 on the news, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	And Chevron Corp. is discussing a purchase of Texaco Inc. for  
about $42 billion in stock, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
Neither company would confirm the talks, and The Journal quoted 
sources close to the deal as saying it faces enormous hurdles. 
Chevron, a Dow stock, rose 1 3/8 to 96 1/4. Texaco fell 1 3/8 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where consoliated volume totaled 
940.51 million shares, down from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.90 to 639.34, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.21 to 787.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.74 to 441.85.  
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo rose 0.18  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt fell 1.73 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 index in London eased 0.11 percent, while the CAC in 
Paris added 1.34 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 'Gonzo' Pushes Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The numbers keep adding up for Luis Gonzalez,  
triplets at home and a 23-game hitting streak at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The man his teammates call ``Gonzo'' has been going crazy at the  
plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez kept the streak going Monday night with a soft single  
up the middle in the first inning against the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he hit a three-run home run on the first pitch he saw  
in the first inning against the New York Mets, then added a double 
and a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
	He has eight home runs, 24 RBIs and a team-high 16 walks. His  
batting average going into Monday night's game was .388, second 
only to Larry Walker's .395 in majors. He has struck out just five 
times in 98 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can hit,'' said teammate Matt Williams, off to a .354 start  
himself. ``He's got a real good idea about the strike zone. He does 
his homework on pitchers and he's got some real good ability. You 
put those three together, you're a good hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona got Gonzalez from Detroit for Karim Garcia in what could  
be the most one-sided trade of the offseason. Gonzalez, playing for 
his fourth team in his ninth major league season, said he's loved 
it with the Diamondbacks ``from the get-go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a slow starter out of the gate in April,'' he  
said, ``but I just feel good. It's been a fun year for me as far as 
having the triplets, working hard in the offseason, getting traded 
to this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of excitement was generated with this team with all the  
moves they made, and I was just excited to come here and be a part 
of it and it seems like everything just kind of snowballed. I'm 
just happy here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yes, those triplets. Last June, Gonzalez's wife, Christine,  
gave birth to Megan, Jacob and Alyssa. They've already made a few 
appearances in their father's arms in the clubhouse, where team 
policy permits players' children the run of the place. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez has become one of the clubhouse's most popular players.  
Because he is bilingual -- his parents were born in Cuba -- he's 
equally comfortable chatting with the Hispanic and the 
non-Hispanics on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a people person,'' he said, ``and this organization has  
been tremendous to me from day one. I think it's just the fact 
there are so many veteran guys who have been on different teams and 
have been through ups and downs in baseball. It's just a relaxed 
feeling here. If you look around, you've got all good guys. You've 
got no bad apples. The coaching staff and management have made me 
feel real comfortable from the first day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez has settled in as the No. 3 hitter in the order, just  
behind Jay Bell and just ahead of Williams, both off to big starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seem to fit real well between those two guys, and the way  
they've been swinging, it makes my job a lot easier,'' Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter said Gonzalez deserves most of the  
credit, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody in this clubhouse would tell you he's the  
one who's doing it,'' Showalter said. ``He's not missing good 
pitches when he gets them and he's hitting some tough pitches, too, 
for base hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez is a career .268 hitter, but he's had streaks before.  
Most notably, he had a 23-game streak for Houston in 1997, a mark 
that tied the Astros' team record and was the longest streak in the 
NL that year. That makes him only the eighth active player with two 
hitting streaks of 20 games or more. 
</P>
<P>
	He nearly saw his streak end Saturday, but singled in the ninth  
inning after Williams, according to Showalter, reminded him, ``Hey, 
Luis, you haven't got a hit yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little bit more at ease with it now,'' Gonzalez said.  
``In Houston while it was going on, I was a little uneasy about it. 
But as years go by, you learn to deal with things like that. I'm 
kind of having fun with it now because my teammates and everybody 
are pulling for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday, I was down to my last at-bat and the fans were  
cheering. You know, it's fun. I know it's going to end sooner or 
later, but it's fun while it lasts.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Criticized Over Flight 800 Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using hand-scribbled notes to support his  
claims, a Senate subcommittee chairman today accused the FBI of 
bottling up another agency's report saying mechanical failure 
caused the crash of TWA Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say that the FBI hindered the investigation and  
the public's and the families' right to know. And, in the process, 
in my view, the FBI risked public safety,'' said Sen. Charles 
Grassley. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Republican's assertion, which came at the start of a  
hearing on the investigation of the TWA crash, was based on 
contemporaneous notes taken by an official of the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which said the FBI had forbidden 
that agency from delivering its finding to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	But James Kallstrom, the former head of the FBI's New York  
office, denied today that the bureau had been overzealous in its 
pursuit of a terrorist cause of the explosion and crash of the 
Boeing 747 airliner in July 1996 off the coast of Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the massive, complex investigation conducted into this  
crash, if in the end the only criticism of the FBI is that we 
worked too hard, too long, and did too much, I will accept that 
criticism proudly,'' Kallstrom, now retired, said in a telephone 
interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the Senate hearing was a 24-page report by ATF.  
Released six months after the crash, it concluded mechanical 
failure was the cause. FBI officials said at the time that, with 
pieces of a mockup reconstruction of the plane not yet completed, 
it was too early to state a cause. 
</P>
<P>
	But others read different motives into the FBI's failure to  
endorse the report's findings early on, saying the agency clung to 
the belief that terrorists were behind the attack so that it could 
remain involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI didn't want to hear about anything but a missile or a  
bomb, because otherwise there was no FBI case,'' Grassley told The 
Washington Post. ``Their conduct was disturbing from the very 
beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on  
administrative oversight, which was holding today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB led the investigation into the Flight 800 crash. The  
FBI and ATF were part of a task force working with the NTSB. 
Witnesses were expected to provide testimony at the hearing that 
the FBI attempted to suppress the ATF report. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington today, FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said, ``We  
didn't sit on this report. It is dated Jan. 20; it got to 
(then-Assistant FBI Director) Jim Kallstrom on March 13. Where was 
it during those months? He forwarded it to Jim Hall at NTSB 
(National Transportation Safety Board) on March 17.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The theory seems to be that because ATF comes out with this  
analysis, we should have forgotten other tests we were conducting 
here and at China Lake, a Navy weapons testing center in 
California,'' Scafidi continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had witnesses who thought they saw a missile and had  
(television commentator) Pierre Salinger running around talking 
about possible missile attacks,'' he said. ``If we'd have stopped 
the investigation then, we'd have been called premature. We owed 
more than that to the families. Sure, there are turf battles, but 
somebody has to be the ultimate answer-provider. It's our 
professional obligation to answer every question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Kallstrom denied that the ATF report was suppressed, he  
did say he did not want it publicized. He said it would have been 
misleading to the public to imply that a conclusion had been drawn 
in the crash when one had not yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though I did not want the report because it was  
premature, as soon as I received it, I forwarded a copy to NTSB and 
to the terrorist task force,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report was a gross violation of the protocol of the  
investigation and totally unprofessional to issue a report before 
the investigation was done, but unfortunately that is the signature 
of ATF,'' Kallstrom added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said in the spring of 1997 that a mechanical malfunction  
caused the plane's center fuel tanks to blow up. Analyzing and 
testing wasn't completed until November 1997, when the FBI withdrew 
from the case, finding no evidence of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	All 230 people died when TWA Flight 800 crashed into the ocean  
off Long Island shortly after takeoff.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Charged in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry  
finally was charged Monday by Florida with possessing cocaine and 
soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder is scheduled to be arraigned May  
26, Assistant State Attorney Pam Bondi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who has a home in Tampa, was arrested April 14 a few  
miles from the Yankees' extended spring training camp. Police said 
he offered an undercover female officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also said Strawberry had 0.3 grams of cocaine wrapped in  
a $20 bill in his wallet. He was released on $6,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the cocaine did not belong to him. And while he  
acknowledged discussing sex with the undercover officer, he 
insisted he was joking and did not intend to meet her at a motel. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, has a long history of drug and alcohol problems  
and run-ins with the law, including a conviction on federal tax 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for 60 days in 1995 after testing positive for  
cocaine and another positive test would be cause for another 
suspension, several baseball officials have said since the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig put Strawberry on indefinite  
``administrative leave,'' in April, which isn't defined by 
baseball's rules but carries the same penalties as a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who signed a minor league contract while he  
recuperated from colon cancer surgery last October, can't 
participate in workouts or games with the Yankees or their farm 
teams until baseball's inquiry is completed.

<HEADLINE> Kid's Author Shel Silverstein Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Shel Silverstein, the author of such  
acclaimed children's books as ``A Light in the Attic'' and ``Where 
the Sidewalk Ends,'' was found dead at his home early Monday. He 
was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cleaning women discovered Silverstein in his bedroom. The  
cause of death was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no evidence of weapons or drugs,'' police spokeswoman  
Cynthia Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein 's books, which he illustrated with his own humorous  
images, are packed with colorful characters like walruses with 
braces and camels in brassieres. His poetry is light and irreverent 
and humored children and adults alike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a devastating loss,'' said his longtime friend and lawyer  
Sheldon Vidibor of Los Angeles. ``I'm numb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vidibor described him as ``the sweetest brightest man that I  
know, good to everybody, loyal, loving. He's a wonderful person, a 
wonderful human being. It goes without saying incredibly 
talented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein is best known for his children's poetry. His work  
includes ``The Giving Tree'' (1964), ``Falling Up'' (1996) ``Where 
the Sidewalk Ends'' (1981) ``A Light in the Attic'' (1981) ``The 
Missing Piece'' (1982) and ``The Missing Piece Meets the Big O'' 
(1982). 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein's characters in ``A Light in the Attic'' include  
Mrs. McTwitter, the Gink and the Dragon of Grindly Grun. Mrs. 
McTwitter is the baby sitter, who's ``a little bit crazy. She 
thinks a baby sitter's supposed to sit upon the baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quick-digesting Gink is a giant lizard who swallows some  
children, and the fire-breathing dragon complains that ``lunches 
aren't very much fun. For I like my damsels medium rare and they 
ALWAYS come out well done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giving Tree celebrates 35 years in publication this fall.  
Silverstein won numerous awards for his work including the Michigan 
Young Readers Award for ``Where the Sidewalk Ends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the poem ``Hug O' War,'' from ``Where the Sidewalk Ends,''  
Silverstein describes his favorite game: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather play at hug o' war,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone hugs  
</P>
<P>
	Instead of tugs,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone giggles  
</P>
<P>
	And rolls on the rug,  
</P>
<P>
	Where everyone kisses,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone grins,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone cuddles,  
</P>
<P>
	And everyone wins...''  
</P>
<P>
	Before turning to children's poetry, Silverstein wrote verse for  
adults only. His career began as a writer and cartoonist for 
Playboy magazine in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	He later served in the Army in Japan and Korea, where he was a  
cartoonist for the Pacific Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein also was a celebrated lyricist, publishing numerous  
songs including Johnny Cash's ``A Boy named Sue'' and Loretta 
Lynn's ``One's on the Way.'' He also wrote the folk songs 
``Unicorn'' and ``25 Minutes to Go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his 15-year-old son, Mathew.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Columbine Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A small fire destroyed a memorial site  
for victims of the Columbine High School shootings set up in nearby 
Clement Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A candle left burning near the shrine sparked the blaze Sunday,  
fire department spokeswoman Susan Brightmire said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was extinguished almost immediately, but not before posters  
and stuffed animals set out to remember those killed and injured 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more a sentimental loss,'' Brightmire said, adding that  
the blaze was contained to a 400-square-foot area. No one was 
injured and dozens of other memorial sites at the park were left 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve students and a teacher were killed in the April 20  
rampage by Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. It ended when 
they committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost three weeks, mourners have brought flowers, teddy  
bears, hand-scribbled notes and blue ribbons to makeshift memorial 
sites at the park, which is adjacent to the Columbine school. 
</P>
<P>
	Brightmire said there was a similar fire at the park a week ago,  
also apparently started by a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	Park personnel say most of the memorials in the park will be  
taken down. A permanent memorial is in the planning stages.

<HEADLINE> Manes Charged in Columbine Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was formally charged  
Monday with providing a pistol to students who used it in the 
Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes, a computer programmer, said nothing during the court  
hearing in which he was charged with providing a handgun to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	The felony carries a maximum six-year sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Manes remained free on bail.  
</P>
<P>
	A former Columbine student, Manes has admitted selling the  
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, 
who used it in the lunchtime attack, killing 12 students and a 
teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Robert Ransome said Manes did not know why the  
students wanted the gun and was horrified when he learned of the 
rampage.

	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- It's hard to fight Internet crime  
when you don't even have a solid idea about how much commerce there 
is -- or how much fraud actually occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials will be getting some needed  
assistance. The FBI and several anti-fraud groups announced Monday 
they are establishing an Internet Fraud Complaint Center and 
forming the Internet Fraud Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The center and the council will be modeled after the  
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, which collects health 
data and tracks health trends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to give law enforcement significant support in  
investigating these cases,'' said Richard Johnston, director of the 
National White Collar Crime Center, which is joining the FBI in 
developing the center in a private-public partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet crime-fighting effort was announced at the Economic  
Crime Summit conference at Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet crimes range from credit card fraud to pyramid scams to  
securities fraud. Authorities said they have no idea how much 
Internet commerce takes place -- estimates range from $9 billion to 
$108 billion -- and even less of a clue how much Internet fraud 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the mission of the Internet Fraud Council will be to  
give law enforcement a picture of how big Internet crime really is. 
The council, supported by the National Fraud Center, the National 
Coalition for the Prevention of Economic Crime and the National 
White Collar Crime Center, will also provide training against 
Internet fraud and create forecasts of fraudulent activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Fraud Center is a Horsham, Pa.-based fraud and risk  
management consulting firm. The National White Collar Crime Center 
is a federally funded research and consulting firm based in 
Richmond, Va. The privately financed National Coalition for the 
Prevention of Economic Crime is a research organization that aims 
to educate the private sector about economic fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint center will take information on its Web site from  
Internet crime victims. The center plans to link its Web site with 
law enforcement sites around the nation so victims can make 
reports. Those reports will allow the FBI to analyze trends and 
notify local law enforcement if action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	An address for the Web site has yet to be determined. The center  
is scheduled to open in late summer in a yet-to-be-selected 
location in West Virginia and will eventually employ 135 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of the Internet has changed the face of crime,  
authorities said at the conference. Internet criminals are 
increasingly well-educated and female. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are no longer constrained by borders and boundaries.  
They are as likely to commit crimes over the Internet from Bozeman, 
Mont., as from Manama, Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
	Because cyber-criminals can move about easily, it is even more  
crucial that law enforcement share information with each other, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyber-criminals don't have the financial limits of law  
enforcement and many upgrade their computer equipment and software 
every six months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criminals aren't saddled with taking the lowest bid when  
buying equipment,'' said Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
Commissioner Tim Moore. ``They don't have a lot of albatrosses 
around their neck.''

<HEADLINE> Vigra Rival Has Disappointing Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Schering-Plough proved with its top-selling  
antihistamine Claritin that it could overcome competitors that get 
a head start on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The pharmaceutical giant is hoping for the same success in the  
impotence pill market. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far it can't get out of the starting block.  
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough Corp. and partner Zonagen Inc. said Monday they  
will postpone completing the Food and Drug Administration review 
process for their experimental impotence pill Vasomax so they can 
have more time to show it works. As a result Vasomax won't be 
available for at least a year, Zonagen officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent stock in Zonagen, a tiny biotech company based  
outside Houston, plummeting nearly 50 percent Monday. Shares of 
Schering-Plough, a much bigger company whose stock isn't dependent 
on the drug, were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra, introduced by Pfizer Inc. in April 1998, had $788  
million in U.S. sales last year. The first pill to treat impotence 
became an instant success, and is the fastest selling new drug in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Viagra, at about $8 a pill, is expensive and competition  
could help drive down the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Zonagen, which is developing Vasomax, joined with  
Schering-Plough in November 1997. Zonagen, which has no drugs on 
the market, applied for FDA approval in July 1998, and approval was 
expected this summer. The drug is approved for use in Mexico under 
the brand name Z-Max. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we are disappointed with this delay, we believe that  
the additional data from Schering-Plough's studies are important to 
the long-term success of Vasomax,'' said Joseph S. Podolski, 
Zonagen's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Zonagen nor Schering-Plough would release the results of  
the tests that prompted the delay in the drug application. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said  
Zonagen's early studies show that Vasomax is not nearly as 
effective in producing an erection as Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the studies show Vasomax only effective about 40 percent  
of the time compared to about 70 percent for Viagra. ``This 
announcement is without doubt a most unwelcome surprise,'' Sweig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Podolski acknowledges some data shows Vasomax lacking against  
Viagra. But he contends there are many ways to measure success. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes that after the additional studies are completed  
the company will show that the drugs work similarly. 
</P>
<P>
	Podolski predicted that Vasomax will be proven safer than Viagra  
in men with heart trouble. Viagra is dangerous when taken by those 
who also take certain heart drugs such as nitroglycerin. Also, 
Vasomax works in about 15 to 30 minutes, about twice as quick as 
Viagra, Podolski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay in Vasomax will likely put its sponsors behind TAP  
Pharmaceuticals in the race to launch the first Viagra competitor 
</P>
<P>
	TAP, a joint venture between Abbott Laboratories and Japanese  
drugmaker Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. expects to seek federal 
approval for its anti-impotence pill Uprima in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, TAP presented data at a medical conference showing  
the largest dose of Uprima is 61 percent effective compared to 29 
percent for a dummy pill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Vasomax should not be considered out of the running.  
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has produced come-from-behind winners before.  
Claritin, introduced in the early 1990s, was not the first 
antihistamine on the market. But its fewer side effects and heavy 
promotional campaign helped the drug to quickly become the 
top-selling antihistamine.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybean Futures End Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn and soybean futures finished higher Monday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat ended mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans gained as investors covered positions ahead of  
the late-afternoon release of farmer planting progress reports, 
which were expected to show continued behind-average fieldwork as a 
result of recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for corn in particular also gained amid forecasts  
for rain in parts of the Midwest later this week, which could 
further delay plantings as the window of opportunity rapidly 
closes. That could mean fewer acres planted to corn this year, a 
prospect that would help reduce supplies just as world demand is 
expected to show some improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat ended mixed, pressured amid concerns the NATO bombing of  
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia would dim any hopes for new 
Chinese purchases. Prices were bolstered, however, after the U.S. 
Agriculture Department reported that wheat inspected for export 
totaled 26.23 million bushels, a figure higher than expectations 
and twice that of a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.64 a bushel; July corn  
rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 6 1/2 cents to $1.28 3/4 
a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 1/2 cents to $4.79 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .45 cent to 60.95 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .20 cent to 72.17 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .23 cent to 60.70 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose 1.30 
cents to 61.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacist Sentenced to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A white supremacist was sentenced to  
life in prison without parole Monday for killing an Arkansas family 
as part of a scheme to overthrow the federal government and set up 
a whites-only nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers said they would appeal Chevie Kehoe's conviction  
and sentence, but said they were satisfied he wasn't sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that the jury took a solemn approach to their  
duties, and this was a difficult decision, but mercy was shown to 
Chevie,'' said Kehoe lawyer Mark Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked that Kehoe be put to death for the 1996  
killings of Tilly gun dealer William Mueller, his wife Nancy and 
her 8-year-old daughter Sarah Powell. The three were suffocated 
with plastic bags, weighed down with rocks and tossed into a 
western Arkansas bayou during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the jury convicted Kehoe, of Colville, Wash., and  
co-defendant Danny Lee of Yukon, Okla., of racketeering, conspiracy 
and three counts of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said the two 26-year-olds were part of an  
enterprise, headed by Kehoe, that committed crimes to further the 
cause of setting up an Aryan People's Republic in the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors are to return Tuesday to hear testimony on a sentence for  
Lee.

<HEADLINE> Home-Equity Lender Settles Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Customers of the nation's largest home-equity  
lender who are paying 13 percent interest or more will be able to 
get automatic interest rate reductions on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates First Capital Corp. agreed to the cuts following a  
lawsuit by housing advocates who claimed the company was preying on 
poor, unsophisticated borrowers with bad credit histories. The 
company would not say how many borrowers would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irving, Texas-based company, which has come under regulatory  
scrutiny, said Monday it has also agreed to commit $100 million to 
a no-fee, no-down payment mortgage program run by Boston-based 
Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Marks, chief executive officer of the activist group,  
applauded the rate reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to revolutionize the subprime lending market,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subprime lending market serves customers with poor credit  
ratings. Marks said other companies that make loans to customers 
with less-than-pristine credit histories will be forced to follow 
suit, because Associates sets the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
	But an analyst said the market may be too fragmented for that  
prediction to come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether everyone else will follow, it's hard to judge. There's  
a lot of small brokers out there who do this, too, and they fall 
under the radar screen of the activists,'' said Joel Gomberg, an 
analyst with William Blair &AMP; Company in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Associates is the largest home equity lender, its  
market share is only about 4 percent. The company earned $1.2 
billion last year on $9.7 billion in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's a huge conciliation on the part of the  
company,'' said Gomberg. ``They're trying to work with these groups 
who are making a lot of noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. in  
New York, called Associated a bellwether company that could change 
standards for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lead steer in the industry,'' he said. ``It could  
trigger some changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lending practices of the subprime industry have been under  
scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade 
Commission. Neighborhood Assistance targeted the industry on a 
state level, helping 16 consumers file class-action suits Friday in 
California and Massachusetts against Associated. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits charged the company used aggressive tactics to  
convince existing customers to refinance with lower interest rates, 
only apply hefty financing fees that made monthly mortgage payments 
higher than before. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest rate reduction program, said Marks, eliminates the  
company's incentive to refinance. Interest rates will automatically 
go down by as much as 2.25 percentage points in three years for 
qualified borrowers who have kept current with their payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes good business sense for us,'' said David Sandor,  
Associates spokesman. ``It helps us retain customers and improve 
credit quality.''

<HEADLINE> Lucas Tried to Avoid Star Wars Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He describes himself as an independent filmmaker  
from San Francisco simply out to make a movie for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cecil B. DeMille made a little Bible story.  
</P>
<P>
	The man is George Lucas and his movie ``Star Wars: Episode I --  
The Phantom Menace,'' which opens later this month, already has 
fans camping out in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried very hard to not let the film be overhyped,'' Lucas  
insisted Sunday at a New York press conference. ``It kind of got 
out of control and got overhyped anyway. There's not much you can 
do about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas said a backlash by the critics is inevitable. Time  
Magazine critic Richard Corliss called the film ``a phantom movie, 
the merest hint of a terrific saga that the final two episodes of 
the new trilogy may reveal.'' And Daily News reviewer Jack Mathews 
on Sunday gave the film a lukewarm 2 1/2 stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the 'Star Wars' movies have gotten mostly bad  
reviews,'' Lucas said. ``They've mostly been trashed one way or 
another, especially by the major media. I certainly expect not to 
do well critically. I never have. You sort of accept this. When you 
get a situation like this where you have so much high expectation, 
you can't possibly live up to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the movie was more oriented to children than the first  
three, Lucas said: ``I don't think it's any more kid-friendly than 
the other films. This is a Saturday afternoon serial for children. 
People forget what the movies actually are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas deflected criticism that he has tried to control every  
aspect of the film, from distribution to production to the size of 
the theaters where it is shown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says I control everything. All I do is make the  
movie. I have an organization that oversees everything else,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged insisting on certain standards from theaters  
such as limiting the pre-film commercials and keeping the movie in 
a large room. ``I want to see that the audience has a good time and 
the film is shown the way it should be shown,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original ``Star Wars'' broke existing box-office records and  
won seven Academy Awards, but Lucas tried to paint himself as a 
Hollywood outsider completely dependent on merchandising spin-offs 
to pay for his films. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an independent filmmaker from San Francisco and I have had  
to make sure that I have exploited anything I possibly can,'' he 
said when asked about the avalanche of toys, books and video games 
inspired by ``The Phantom Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to say he doesn't expect to make money from the  
movie. Although Lucas downplayed expectations that its success 
could approach that of ``Titanic,'' which made $600 million and is 
the top-grossing movie of all time, he said he thought it would 
probably end up in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a contest ... It's a movie. I made it because I  
enjoy making movies. I really don't have any interest in being No. 
1,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His producer, Rick McCallum, said the movie cost $115 million to  
make, $5 million less than it was budgeted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas said he was thrilled with the technological advances that  
enabled his production team to create any creature or special 
effect he could envision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the one time I was able to sit down and let my  
imagination run wild,'' he said. ``I could dream up whatever I 
wanted and I was generally able to pull it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas confirmed he would be directing the next two installments,  
Episodes II and III. But he said there would not be any more ``Star 
Wars'' movies after that.

<HEADLINE> FBI Informant on Trial in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It has all the makings of a courtroom blockbuster  
-- an FBI informant who says he paid a $10,000 bribe to a powerful 
union leader, and a set of secretly made audio tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The twist is this: The informant, contractor William Russell, is  
the one on trial for fraud, obstruction and perjury, while the 
union leader is a key witness for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, 60, of Schaumburg had served as a confidential  
informant to the FBI on other occasions and was paid by the 
government on a full-time basis to help agents snare corrupt 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Russell had been a reliable informant for nine  
years when he volunteered to help snare Jerry O'Connor, head of the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in the Chicago 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1991, while his phone was wired with a tape  
recorder, Russell claimed O'Connor demanded a $12,000 payoff ``in 
tens, twenties and fifties'' for steering electrical contracting 
work to Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Russell, 60, faked the tape by enlisting an  
unknown accomplice to pose as O'Connor. Prosecutors said Russell 
was under pressure to provide evidence to back up his claim that 
the union leader wanted a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you ask for a payment in tens, twenties and fifties?''  
prosecutor David Buvinger asked O'Connor after playing the tape 
Monday for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not,'' O'Connor replied. Federal prosecutors believe  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell is heard on the tape telling the man identifying himself  
as O'Connor that he sounds terrible. The man then says he had ``a 
bad cold.'' He also keeps the conversation short, saying he doesn't 
have much time to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell had told agents the payoff amount was to be $10,000.  
When the voice says that he wants $12,000, Russell expresses 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal has changed,'' the man says gruffly.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys, who are expected to cross-examine O'Connor  
today, say the voice on the tape is indeed that of O'Connor and 
that Russell delivered the $10,000 to the labor leader in a Chicago 
union hall four days later. 
</P>
<P>
	But union representatives from Eau Claire, Wis., testified for  
the government that records from their meeting that night indicate 
O'Connor was there, speaking about union organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also presented expense account vouchers, gasoline  
credit-card receipts and union records to suggest that O'Connor was 
not only at the Eau Claire meeting but later spent the night in 
Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the assumption that Russell had passed the $10,000 in cash  
to O'Connor, the FBI launched a $173,000 undercover operation 
deigned to snare other union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was shut down without uncovering any corruption.

                           *Stewart Klein    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stewart Klein, a three-time Emmy Award-winner  
and a colorful movie and theater critic for New York's Fox Channel 
5 for more than 30 years, died Monday at age 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein, who was battling cancer, suffered a stroke.  
</P>
<P>
	Klein was with the station since 1967, and became part of the  
original on-air team of ``The 10 O'Clock News.'' He also 
contributed theater and movie reviews to ``Good Day New York,'' and 
``Fox Five Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1978, Klein won his first Emmy for a review of ``Sebastian,''  
a controversial film in Latin about St. Sebastian. Klein panned the 
film in Latin. The second Emmy came for his ``Ode To The Mets,'' in 
1986, to honor the World Series champs. His final Emmy, in 1994, 
was a lifetime achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, The Associated Press cited Klein for the year's best  
coverage of a breaking story, the death of director Gower Champion. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his debut in journalism as a copy boy for The  
Philadelphia Inquirer. He later joined the Daily Intelligencer as a 
reporter, and went on to the Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, Klein became news director for WCAU Radio in  
Philadelphia, then joined ABC News as a New York based reporter in 
1961. There he was a featured ``Flair Reports'' reporter along with 
Charles Osgood and Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Klein joined WNEW Radio in New York, and became a  
regular arts and entertainment critic. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son and three other children.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shirley Dinsdale Layburn, a ventriloquist who  
won an Emmy Award in 1949, the first year the awards were 
presented, died Sunday of cancer. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Layburn received her Emmy for Most Outstanding Television  
Personality. 
</P>
<P>
	Her show appeared on Paramount Studio's KTLA in Los Angeles and  
featured her and her puppet ``Judy Splinters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later had her own children's show on KNBH-NBC, followed by  
several other shows on ABC in New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	She later quit her television career and from 1973 to 1985 was  
the head of the Respiratory Therapy Department of John T. Mather 
Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Layburn, who was born in San Francisco, began her  
ventriloquism career at age 14 with her radio show, ``Judy in 
Wonderland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She later moved to Hollywood, where she and her puppet had  
appearances on radio shows along personalities such as Rudy Vallee, 
Eddie Cantor and Bob Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Layburn made her television debut in 1947 announcing shows  
and giving children birthday greetings on KTLA. Her appearances led 
to the weekly children's show, ``The Judy Splinters Show.''

elected to the New Jersey Senate and the longest-serving member of 
the upper house, died Sunday of cancer. She never disclosed her 
age; Democrats said she was about 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipman, who joined the state Senate more than 27 years ago, had  
championed the causes of women, minorities, children and small 
businesses. Bills she had proposed that became law included 
measures to increase the penalties for adults who patronize child 
prostitutes, and to expand the state's domestic violence laws to 
protect more victims and provide more services for children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipman was first elected to the state Senate in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
	In a 1989 forum on women and politics, Lipman recalled that when  
she was first elected, the Senate didn't even have rest room 
facilities for women.

<HEADLINE> Skydiving Plane Crash Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CELINA, Ohio (AP) -- A small plane that crashed into a field,  
killing the pilot and all five sky divers aboard, had taken off 10 
times that day, the operator of the skydiving club said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded good, just like it always did,'' said Robert  
Tangeman, who owns the plane and has operated the Grand Lake 
Skydiving Club for 10 years. Witnesses said the plane's engine 
sputtered and died soon after takeoff Sunday from Lakefield Airport 
in Montezuma. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board today was to visit the  
scene of the crash about a mile east of the airport. The Federal 
Aviation Administration also is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane experienced engine trouble after taking off from the  
airport, the State Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was over in four or five seconds, said dairy farmer  
Charles Schwieterman, who witnessed the crash and was the first 
person to reach the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane went into half a turn and went straight down head  
first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were the pilot, Preston E. Parrish II of Tipp City, and  
five skydivers. Tangeman said the sky divers were members of his 
club and jumped every weekend. He said the plane, a Cessna, was 
built in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwieterman and his son, Chuck, heard the plane overhead early  
Sunday evening about a mile from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed like he was trying to climb but the engine didn't  
sound right,'' Schwieterman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The engine started sputtering, then ``clonked completely out,''  
he said. He saw one sky diver jump out, but that person's chute 
opened only partway. 
</P>
<P>
	Celina is 27 miles southwest of Lima in west-central Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	The dead skydivers were identified as John Hoover, 43, Michelle  
Korsen, 43, and Arron Schroeder, 30, all of Fort Wayne, Ind.; Jack 
Haenichen, 31, of Ottawa, Ohio; and Keith Edwards, 40, of Marion, 
Ind.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel Rejects Steel Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. panel rejected punitive tariffs Monday  
on some stainless steel from six countries, ruling unanimously that 
foreign pricing practices have not hurt U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the steel in question, stainless round wire, is a  
relatively small product line, the ruling underscores the U.S. 
International Trade Commission's independence and suggests that it 
will not rubber-stamp cases from the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department determined earlier that Canada, India,  
Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan illegally dumped stainless 
round wire in U.S. markets at prices below production costs. Before 
Commerce could impose tariffs, the commission had to find that the 
dumping has hurt or threatens to harm U.S. producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ruled, on a 6-0 vote, that no injury or threat to  
U.S. industry resulted from the round-wire pricing. Commissioners 
did not discuss their reasoning during the meeting and refused 
comment afterward. A written opinion is due in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed in the negative finding of injury by the  
ITC,'' said George Kurisky, chairman of the U.S. Stainless Wire 
Action Committee, a coalition of domestic producers. ``We continue 
to believe that the data prove injury to a competitive and 
efficient American industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers have been intensifying pressure on the Senate to  
approve quotas on steel. The House has passed a quota bill, but the 
administration opposes it on the ground that trade cases filed with 
Commerce and the commission are adequate to combat last year's 
surge in low-priced steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Commerce found that Japan dumped a more common steel  
product, hot-rolled carbon steel. Japanese representatives 
denounced the ruling as politicized and looked to the trade 
commission for what they consider will be a more independent 
review. 
</P>
<P>
	Stainless steel round wire is used to produce springs, wire rope  
and fasteners in construction and other applications. It is a $300 
million-a-year domestic industry, and imports add another $100 
million, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce had proposed tariffs of as much as 36 percent on  
stainless round wire. Industry officials said they would review the 
commission's opinion before deciding whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The government already has imposed tariffs on other types of  
stainless steel, a specialty line, and has other cases pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports reached record levels in 1998 in the wake of the Asian  
economic crisis, which lowered demand for steel abroad and forced 
foreign producers to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade cases were filed by ACS Industries Inc. of Woonsocket,  
R.I.; Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of Dunkirk, N.Y.; Branford Wire 
&AMP; Manufacturing Co. of Mountain Home, N.C.; Carpenter Technology 
Corp. of Reading, Pa.; Handy &AMP; Herman Specialty Wire Group of 
Cockeysville, Md.; Industrial Alloys Inc. of Pomona, Calif.; Loos &AMP; 
Co. Inc. of Pomfret, Conn.; Sandvik Steel Co. of Clarks Summit, 
Pa.; Sumiden Wire Products Corp. of Stockton, Calif.; and Techalloy 
Co. Inc. of Mahwah, N.J.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Spending Eats at Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A multibillion-dollar package financing the  
Yugoslavia campaign is just one item nibbling away at federal 
surpluses. That's a worry for Republicans, who have promised 
repeatedly to shrink government and leave Social Security funds 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the Congressional Budget Office thinks the 1999  
surplus will be $111 billion, the biggest ever. All of it comes 
from Social Security, which is collecting more money than it spends 
each year to prepare for the baby boomers' coming retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	While this year's surplus is hardly in danger of vanishing, it  
is about to start shrinking, to the dismay of many conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great danger is there is no more fiscal discipline in  
Washington,'' said Marshall Wittman, congressional affairs director 
for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``The irony is that when 
we got to a balanced budget, Republicans lost the major brake we 
had on spending, which was the deficit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As early as this week, lawmakers may send President Clinton a  
measure to pay for the battle in the Balkans and other items. Its 
price tag of at least $9 billion is certain to come almost entirely 
from the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers want to add $1 billion to that bill for school  
safety and up to $4.3 billion for farmers. That measure seems 
likely to be attached to another bill bearing help for Central 
America for last autumn's Hurricane Mitch and for U.S. farmers, to 
which senators have added hundreds of millions to aid the oil, 
hard-rock mining and steel industries. 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, lawmakers and Clinton may dip even deeper into  
surpluses for 1999 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties say they want to spend more to improve education,  
fortify the military and boost troops' pay. Democrats want to add 
prescription coverage to Medicare, and others want to roll back 
Medicare savings imposed two years ago on hospitals and other 
health-care providers. And Republicans want a tax cut of about $800 
billion over the next decade, although they say none of it would be 
paid for from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	For many Republicans, using the surplus to pay for such  
proposals could wound their effort to represent themselves as 
protectors of Social Security, a major goal in this pre-election 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politically, the Republican Congress is creating a track  
record that can be used against them,'' warned Ron Utt, a senior 
fellow at Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Kosovo spending measure is not even the first chunk  
lawmakers have bitten from the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress and Clinton enacted a big package of so-called  
``emergency'' spending last fall, it was financed through the 
surplus, which the nonpartisan CBO estimates will trim this year's 
black ink by $17 billion. Without it, the latest projection for the 
1999 surplus would have been $128 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	That spending spree, however, upset many conservative voters,  
which Republicans say stoked their poor showing in last November's 
congressional elections. In reaction, many GOP leaders want to 
sharpen the party's conservative image by holding such raids on the 
surplus to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of conservative senators led by Senate Majority Whip Don  
Nickles, R-Okla., have been pushing to keep the Kosovo package 
close to the $6 billion Clinton requested. Their worry is that the 
more money Congress adds to it, the blurrier becomes the Republican 
message of protecting Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	That was underlined when conservative Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.,  
proposed paying for the Kosovo measure last week by cutting 
domestic programs across the board. He was defeated 322-101, but 
not before highlighting his party's sensitivity to eroding Social 
Security's surpluses just weeks after Congress approved a 
GOP-written budget pledging to leave that money alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is morally right to support our troops'' but not ``to take  
money from the Social Security system, to take money out of the 
very future that we say is our highest priority,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coburn proposal aimed a spotlight on a schism within the  
GOP, as more than half of House Republicans voted against his 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	That split illustrated how little taste many Republicans have  
for the domestic spending cuts he proposed, plus their belief that 
since Clinton also proposed paying for the fighting with the 
surplus, there would be scant political price to pay for doing just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can blame this one on Clinton without blinking hard,'' said  
Rich Galen, executive director of the Republican political action 
committee GOPAC.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Mixed; Corn, Soybeans Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures were mixed early today on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and soybeans moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured amid concerns the NATO bombing of  
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia would dim any hopes for new 
Chinese purchases. Prices were bolstered, however, after the U.S. 
Agriculture Department reported that wheat inspected for export 
totaled 26.23 million bushels, a figure higher than expectations 
and twice that of a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans were boosted by some private meteorologists'  
predictions for wet weather this week in parts of the Midwest, 
which could delay planting. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.62 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.22 1/2 a bushel; July soybeans rose 1 1/4 cents to $4.78 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while lean hogs were mostly lower and pork bellies were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .03 cent to 61.37 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .03 cent to 72 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .08 cent to 60.55 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .78 
cent to 60.65 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> GOP Trains Sites on Gore Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party, citing internal polls  
that suggest Vice President Al Gore is vulnerable in the Democratic 
primary, is turning its attention to Gore rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo written by David Israelite, the Republican National  
Committee's director of political and governmental affairs, says 
Gore's poll numbers are down and Bradley's are up. The memo to RNC 
chairman Jim Nicholson also says Gore's unfavorable rating ``is at 
a high 23 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on this most recent confirmation of what our earlier  
research has indicated, I have directed our research department to 
shift its focus to Bill Bradley a full 50 percent of the time. We 
will continue to monitor the situation,'' Israelite wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreed,'' Nicholson said in a handwritten reply. ``Do it!''  
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the May 4 memo was obtained Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination,  
Republicans are eager to portray him as a weak candidate. The memo 
may be part of that strategy, but it also reflects the results of 
some public opinion polls that showed a shrinking gap between Gore 
and Bradley, a former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore holds a lead of 20 or more percentage points in most  
polls, and at least one public survey suggests that the vice 
president has regained some of the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign dismissed the memo.  
</P>
<P>
	``This must be the RNC's version of trickle down negative  
politics,'' spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``It's too bad they can't 
spend some of those resources coming up with good policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether genuinely concerned or not about Bradley's chances, the  
RNC is starting to treat Bradley as a serious candidate: The 
party's spokesman attacked him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without looking in depth yet, I would say the fact that Bill  
Bradley's biggest accomplishment in the Senate was losing the fight 
against welfare reform is significant,'' said RNC communications 
director Cliff May. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has expressed concern about the impact welfare reform  
has on poor Americans. Gore supported President Clinton's decision 
to sign the 1996 welfare overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	May also noted that Bradley voted against President Reagan's  
nomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Greenspan 
is given high marks by Democrats and Republicans for his role in 
improving the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator had  
questioned Greenspan's international experience during the first 
confirmation hearing, but voted for Greenspan when he was 
re-nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``His worries have proven unfounded,'' Hauser said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with GOP pollsters still in the field last month, RNC chief  
of staff Tom Cole predicted that the party would train its sites on 
Bradley. The Israelite memo put the new policy in motion.

<HEADLINE> Veto Threatened on Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, the Clinton administration  
threatened Monday to veto a bill providing money for the conflict 
with Yugoslavia, aid for Central America and other items, citing a 
host of objections. Indications were, however, that such a 
confrontation would be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, administration officials had threatened to veto a  
stand-alone aid measure for Central America and U.S. farmers 
because it would cut domestic programs and add environmental and 
other items the White House opposes. They had complained about a 
separate bill in which the House more than doubled President 
Clinton's $6 billion request for the fight over Kosovo, but not 
threatened to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday, on the eve of meetings among House and Senate  
negotiators who plan to combine the two bills, White House 
officials warned that the new, blended legislation was in jeopardy 
of being rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of very troubling issues ... and the  
president's senior advisors would continue to recommend that he 
veto this legislation unless the objectionable provisions are 
resolved in a satisfactory manner,'' said a letter to House leaders 
by White House budget chief Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	Before, members of both parties had said privately that they  
don't think Clinton would veto the Kosovo package as long as it was 
kept at roughly the $13 billion range the House approved last week. 
They believe that with American troops in the field and with 
Clinton himself saying the Pentagon needs more money, he would be 
hard-pressed to reject such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an interview, Lew said of the defense package, ``It's  
important to scale it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extra money the House added was for U.S. military operations  
and installations around the world, and for a pay raise for troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Some GOP participants in the negotiations, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, have said they expect Republicans to pare the 
military package to roughly $10 billion. The likeliest item to be 
dropped is $1 billion the House added to modernize U.S. bases 
overseas, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really haven't settled anything yet,'' House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 16, Clinton requested nearly $1 billion to help Honduras  
and other Central American nations devastated by last autumn's 
deadly Hurricane Mitch. He later asked for $152 million to help 
U.S. farmers hurt by record-low prices for wheat, corn and other 
farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 23, the Senate approved a $2.5 billion bill for Central  
America and farmers, which included aid they had added for the U.S. 
steel, oil, gas and mining industries. The next day, the House 
approved a $1.3 billion version without the Senate add-ons. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration objections include Senate language that would bar  
the federal government from sharing in the $246 billion settlement 
states have won from the tobacco industry; delay increases in 
royalties oil companies pay for using federal lands; and postpone 
stricter requirements for hardrock mining on government property. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also objects to GOP plans to pay for the Central  
America aid with cuts in food stamps, along with money the U.S. 
uses to back loans by international lending agencies and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration prefers using this year's expected federal  
surplus. Many aides from both parties, however, believe a 
compromise will be reached on spending reductions.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Looking To Even Series  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Round One went to Tim Duncan.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Garnett aims to take Round Two when his Minnesota  
Timberwolves face the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night in the 
second game of their best-of-5 first-round Western Conference 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``A must win, if that's what you want to call it,'' Garnett  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won the series opener 99-86 Sunday led by Duncan's 26  
points and 12 rebounds and helped by 21 points from Avery Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Garnett was forceful in the first half, scoring 15 of his  
21 points, he ran out of steam and into foul trouble as Duncan got 
going in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett was scoreless in the final quarter, when the top-seeded  
Spurs opened up a comfortable double-digit lead and the 
eighth-seeded Timberwolves couldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``They kept double-teaming, but I split a couple of them. They  
didn't come as fast,'' Duncan said. ``A lot of things changed and I 
took advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett expects some differences Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to be a lot more aggressive,'' he said.  
``I'll try to stay aggressive for the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett, who turns 23 next week, and Duncan, who turned 23 last  
month, guarded each other much of the time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the game a hot-headed Garnett got in Duncan's face and  
did some intense talking to his fellow 7-footer. Duncan listened, 
then walked away laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just broke out like that, so I responded,'' Garnett said.  
Like Duncan, he didn't repeat the contents of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett insists his duel with Duncan is overblown.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to understand, I was playing Sean Elliott, I was  
playing David Robinson and I was still being me,'' Garnett said. 
``I think that matchup thing is more of a media thing than 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan seemed to agree, saying he makes little out of the  
``hype.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're both good players. We're both going to go out there and  
compete for our teams and do the best we can for our teams, and 
that's where it ends,'' Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But fans and even teammates are intrigued by the competition  
between the two talented players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great matchup. They can go back and forth and all the  
rest of us can go sit down and watch them sometimes,'' Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Spurs against the Timberwolves, but those guys are  
the two key components of each team,'' added Spurs guard Mario

played tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan, who gained some support for MVP honors toward the end of  
the regular season, and Robinson led the Spurs in a stretch run in 
which the Spurs captured the Midwest Division title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs and Timberwolves split their regular season series  
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
	When Minnesota was successful against San Antonio this season,  
it was because the Spurs were forced to rely on shots from players 
besides Robinson and Duncan, said Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
	So Johnson's point production Sunday wasn't a surprise. It was  
part of Minnesota's game plan. The tough part for the Timberwolves 
was that Duncan found a way to get the ball and score in the second 
half despite Minnesota's efforts, Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do some things to change up, because we see some areas  
where we can make some improvement,'' Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs aren't satisfied either. They're vowing to play better  
defense throughout Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy about the win but we know the next one's not going  
to be easy,'' Duncan said. ``We're going to go out there and try to 
play a better game.''

<HEADLINE> Appleby Returns to Avenel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POTOMAC, Md. (AP) -- Stuart Appleby, gazing at the 18th hole from  
the clubhouse patio, fidgeted with his wedding ring as he talked 
about his victory last year at the Kemper Open. It was the last 
time his wife would ever see him win. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was a last tournament that I could win for two or  
three years, this would certainly be the sweetest one, just to have 
the flush of memories again,'' the 28-year-old Australian said 
Monday as he visited the TPC at Avenel course, where he will defend 
his title May 27-30. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be one of the hardest ones to win because of the  
memories, too. But that's what Renay would love for me to do, just 
to do it all again. That's what she's been pushing me to do the 
last nine, 10 months. I just make sure I draw on the resources that 
don't get in my way and go out there and have fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renay Appleby was 25 when she was killed last July in a freak  
accident. She was crushed by a car while unloading luggage at a 
London train station after the British Open. The news stunned the 
golf world, and Stuart Appleby made a frail and emotional return in 
August at the PGA Championship, where he bravely discussed his 
wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has recovered physically -- he won the Houston  
Open earlier this month for his third career PGA Tour title -- but 
his emotions are far from healed. Golf is his therapy, but so is 
his openness about his feelings. Almost every answer Monday 
contained at least a passing reference to Renay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's like one room, you open the door and close  
the door and go into another. It's not as simple as that,'' Appleby 
said. ``You go into a transition, a slow process. It's like a wine. 
When does a wine become drinkable? Is it 12 months, two days? For 
me, when am I ready? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not back at my best. I'm far from that in a lot of ways.  
And I don't know how long it'll take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby, taking a few days off to heal a back injury, said golf  
has been therapeutic, something to fill the time, but it doesn't 
consume his life. Asked whether the next step in his promising 
career would be a victory in one of the four majors, he quickly 
reset the conversation back in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny, because the next step for me, in the last eight or  
nine months, hasn't been golf,'' Appleby said. ``Renay was the rest 
of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby said Renay is with him on the course, inspiring him and  
giving him patience because he sometimes finds he doesn't have any. 
His first victory after the accident was in front of her parents at 
the Coolum Classic in Australia in January, and he said he had to 
``try to be Renay, try to talk to myself'' to stay calm during the 
final round at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than in his immediate natural thoughts following the  
tragedy, Appleby said he never considered giving up golf. He keeps 
on, because Renay wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to believe there's a future,'' he said.

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joan Kennedy, the ex-wife of Sen. Edward M.  
Kennedy, was hospitalized after what was described as a mild heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, 62, fell ill Friday. She underwent tests at  
Massachusetts General Hospital and was scheduled Monday to have an

<HEADLINE> Survey: Jaguars Have Few Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- New Jaguar cars had the fewest defects and 1999  
Kia cars the most, according to a private report to automakers by 
J.D. Power and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's annual Initial Quality Study is a widely followed  
measure of vehicle quality. J.D. Power publicly released limited 
data from the report Wednesday, but not the full report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agoura, Calif.-based company said it based the results on  
41,004 owners of 1999-model vehicles. They were asked about 
problems found in the first 90 days of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press today obtained results from a confidential  
executive summary of the study which showed Jaguar had the fewest 
defects per 100 new vehicles -- 110. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael H. Dale, president of Jaguar North America, called the  
report ``very satisfying news.'' He said it was the payoff for the 
company's efforts to improve quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Buick was second at 114, followed by Infiniti (118), Acura  
(124), BMW (125), Lexus (131), Toyota (135), Honda (137), Cadillac 
(139) and Chrysler (148). 
</P>
<P>
	The average for all vehicles was 167 defects per 100 vehicles.  
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom, Kia had the most defects at 333 per 100 vehicles.  
Suzuki had 299, Isuzu 242, Jeep 234, Volkswagen 223, Daewoo 216, 
Land Rover 200, Mitsubishi 199, GMC 199 and Hyundai 194, according 
to the executive summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford vehicles had a defect rate of 169, Saturn 171, Oldsmobile  
174, Dodge 175, Mercury and Pontiac 185, and Chevrolet 192. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a story in today's USA Today, the J.D. Power survey  
also found that several newly redesigned vehicles had considerably 
more defects than the models they replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners reported that the new Honda Odyssey minivan had 64  
percent more defects than the van it replaced, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jeep Grand Cherokee had a defect increase of 29 percent, the  
GMC Sierra pickup had 23 percent more problems and Chevrolet's 
Silverado pickup 22 percent, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among newly redesigned cars, the Porsche 911 had 41 percent more  
defects than its predecessor, 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power declined to comment on the newspaper story.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the auto industry's computer-design technology, avoiding  
defects in the first production models of a new design ``continues 
to be a challenge,'' the story quoted the executive summary as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Power also found high levels of defects in other models  
that did not replace existing models, USA Today reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volvo S80 sedan had 40 percent more defects than the average  
for similar vehicles. And the Mercury Cougar sports coupe had 34 
percent more defects than the average for such vehicles, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Odyssey owners reported 220 problems per 100 vehicles;  
Porsche 911, 182 per 100; Jeep Grand Cherokee, 249 per 100; GMC 
Sierra, 232 per 100; and Chevrolet Silverado, 218 per 100, the 
story said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Art Garner told the newspaper that the new  
Odyssey had a rocky start. He said Honda has corrected the main 
problems, which were noisy brakes and confusion over how to operate 
the sliding side door.

<HEADLINE> Late Celtic Star's Widow Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Months after Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis  
collapsed and died on a practice court in July 1993, his pregnant 
widow went on television saying she did not blame his sudden death 
on the lead cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Dr. (Gilbert) Mudge is a wonderful person. I  
think that he's a very caring physician. I think that he's a very 
credible and capable physician,'' Donna Harris-Lewis said in an 
interview that aired on Boston's WBZ-TV in November 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis was confronted with those words Monday during her  
second full day of testimony in the malpractice suit she brought in 
1996 against Mudge and two other doctors who treated her husband 
before his death at 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's attorney, William Dailey Jr., has suggested that it  
wasn't until a 1995 Wall Street Journal article raised the 
possibility of cocaine use by Lewis that Harris-Lewis decided to 
sue. The article said Mudge warned Lewis that if he ``was still 
doing (cocaine), he has to stop, immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such drug use would threaten insurance and contract money  
Harris-Lewis received after her husband died, Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has denied Lewis ever used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	She sued Mudge, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and two doctors  
who consulted on the case, Mark Creager and Peter Friedman, 
claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated Lewis' condition. A third 
consultant settled with Harris-Lewis for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, who met Lewis after he collapsed during a playoff game in  
April 1993, initially agreed with a group of doctors who had 
diagnosed Lewis with a potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia. But 
after further tests, Mudge told Lewis he had a less serious 
neurological condition that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Lewis died while practicing jump shots at  
Brandeis University. Mudge has said lies about cocaine use kept him 
from making an accurate diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination Monday, Harris-Lewis denied Dailey's  
suggestion that she had tried to keep Mudge from talking to 
insurance officials after Lewis died. 
</P>
<P>
	``You knew if that (insurance) form had been filled out in a  
manner less than truthful, there could be a problem in recovering 
on the insurance,'' Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't worried about it,'' replied Harris-Lewis. She had  
several testy exchanges with the defense attorney, whose patience 
seemed to wear thin at times as Harris-Lewis asked him to repeat 
questions or gave indirect answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis scoffed at Dailey's suggestion that Lewis may have  
ignored his doctors' orders about exercise and medication in the 
months before his death. She said she drafted an exercise schedule 
for her husband -- approved by Mudge -- that included only three 
activities: weight lifting, stretching and tai chi. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dailey has said he has a witness who will testify she saw  
Lewis ``glistening with sweat'' while shooting baskets after his 
release from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey then produced pharmacy records that seemed to indicate  
there was a lapse of more than a week in Lewis' prescription of 
beta blockers, drugs that reduce the heart's workload, which he was 
supposed to take every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey also raised questions about Harris-Lewis' motivations,  
pointing to her request while Lewis was hospitalized for a meeting 
at Brigham and Women's Hospital with Celtics management. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey asked Harris-Lewis if she had called the meeting to  
discuss a contract extension for her husband. After several 
denials, Harris-Lewis admitted the extension ``was one of the 
subjects'' discussed at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis is suing to recover money Lewis would have made had  
he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 million to more 
than $100 million.

<HEADLINE> NATO Mulls Yugoslav Port Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- As oil continues to arrive in  
Yugoslavia, NATO generals and political leaders are wrestling with 
a plan to blockade its ports. The question is what to do about 
ships that refuse to stop or those that are found to be carrying 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top policy-making body, is  
hoping to get a look at its military planners' ideas for a naval 
blockade at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the major targets of the allied air operation has been  
Yugoslavia's oil refining and storage capacity. In nearly seven 
weeks of airstrikes, NATO has put the country's two refineries, at 
Novi Sad and Pancevo, out of commission and destroyed one-third of 
Yugoslavia's fuel storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander in Europe, says  
it is unconscionable to risk the lives of pilots to destroy these 
targets and then allow refined petroleum products to enter through 
the back door. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO leaders agreed at their summit last month in Washington on  
an oil blockade, which the alliance euphemistically calls a ``visit 
and search regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make it clear that all allies are committed to a  
visit and search regime,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. ``We are 
all committed to having one, and there will be one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where the allies differ is on how to enforce it.  
</P>
<P>
	Clark and many of the allies want a blockade with teeth allowing  
allied ships to fire on tankers that refuse to stop for inspection. 
Others, like France and Germany, want it to be voluntary, though 
they don't have an answer for what to do in the case of those 
defying a voluntary embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some countries are concerned about the legality of a blockade  
without an official declaration of war. Others, like Greece and 
Italy, worry about the scope, whether it should include the entire 
Adriatic Sea or just the waters around the ports of Bar and Kotor. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States argues that a blockade is justified under an  
existing embargo on war material to Yugoslavia. Others say, 
however, that without a declaration of war, only the United Nations 
could authorize a blockade. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-nation European Union has joined in a voluntary oil  
embargo and accepted that any ships flying member country flags can 
be stopped and inspected. Other countries have also joined in the 
voluntary effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, oil continues to flow in -- at least five ships in  
the past week, diplomats say. Those most likely to eschew an 
embargo include Iran, Iraq, Malta, even Russia. Nobody knows how 
much oil is getting in by sea, but it is estimated to be in the 
hundreds of thousands of barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats say they are certain a formula can be found that will  
allow all 19 NATO members to sign on. Just what that will be, 
however, is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The big problem is boarding a ship if the captain takes a  
belligerent attitude. A second problem is what to do with a ship 
found with prohibited war material. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Bosnian war, ships attempting to break the U.N.  
blockade were taken to a port and held. A similar practice against 
Yugoslavia could discourage ship owners in it purely for the money. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative is simply to destroy the ports from the air, but  
the two ports in question are in Montenegro, the smaller of the two 
republics that make up the Yugoslav federation. NATO has been 
treading lightly in Montenegro, which opposes the policies of 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montenegrins have been begging NATO not to strike Bar and  
Kotor because if they do, the Montenegrin economy will probably 
collapse. So far they have been spared, even though Yugoslav 
warships moored there fire almost nightly on NATO planes heading 
for targets in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> A Midsummer Night's Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As if ``Shakespeare in Love'' weren't enough to remind the world  
how much fun the Bard can be, along comes ``William Shakespeare's A 
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' With its strong ensemble cast, on-target 
performances and fast-paced dialogue from writer/director Michael 
Hoffman, this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy is sure to please. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman has taken a few liberties with the story. He moved it to  
northern Italy near the end of the 19th century, when, according to 
the prologue, ``Necklines are high. Parents are rigid. And marriage 
is seldom a matter of love.'' And a new invention called the 
bicycle has become the trendy way to tool around town. 
</P>
<P>
	But he adheres to the basic tale of two young couples who enter  
the woods one night and the bewitchment that befalls them. Helena 
(Calista Flockhart) loves Demetrius (Christian Bale). Demetrius 
loves Hermia (Anna Friel). Hermia loves Lysander (Dominic West) and 
the feeling is mutual, but Hermia's father has ordered her to marry 
Demetrius or spend the rest of her life as an unmarried woman. 
</P>
<P>
	All this happens as Theseus (David Strathairn), the duke, plans  
his own gala wedding to a lukewarm Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). A 
ragtag acting troupe led by Bottom the Weaver (a hilarious Kevin 
Kline) busily rehearse a play they hope to perform at the 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	These plans provide the perfect playground for Oberon, King of  
the Fairies (a scheming, smoldering Rupert Everett) and his impish 
minion, Puck (Stanley Tucci). Their idea of fun is messing with the 
mortals, and once the night is over, no one will be the same -- not 
even the Queen of the Fairies herself, Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer 
in shimmering body makeup and flowing golden locks). 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman's interpretation is the third major film adaptation of  
Shakespeare's work. It couldn't be more different from the 1935 
version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' with James Cagney as 
Bottom, Olivia DeHavilland as Hermia and Mickey Rooney as Puck. 
It's snappier and hipper, less dreamlike and ethereal. 
</P>
<P>
	And it takes a different approach than the exceptional Royal  
Shakespeare Co. production directed by Peter Hall in 1968. The cast 
featured David Warner, Diana Rigg and Judi Dench. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucci's Puck drunkenly hits on wood nymphs and urinates in  
public. When Oberon sends him on a mission, Puck procrastinates, 
noshing on grapes and just fooling around. When he finally gets 
moving, it's on a giant turtle, inching its way through the forest. 
His delivery is deadpan, drawing huge laughs from the slightest 
raised eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Kline, a master of physical comedy, offers a character who is  
frequently melodramatic and self-enthralled. But he also presents a 
sad, introspective side of Bottom, making him complex and 
endearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Flockhart is fiery and feisty as Helena, and gives one of the  
strongest performances of the film, though every once in a while 
she stomps, pouts and snarls in an Ally McBealish way. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as funny as the film itself is the play Bottom and his  
buddies perform at the duke's wedding, ``The Most Lamentable Comedy 
and Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe.'' One actor, cast as a 
talking brick wall, suffers such stage fright he forgets the title 
characters' names. As an over-the-top Pyramus, Bottom gets attacked 
on stage by a scruffy lap dog. Thisbe, the heroine, is portrayed by 
a man in a falsetto voice who looks like Marilyn Manson in drag. 
And when the actors fail to find a way to shine moonbeams on stage, 
a guy with a cigarette dangling from his mouth holds out a lantern 
at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, who also worked with Hoffman  
on ``One Fine Day,'' has created a visually alluring film. The 
characters frolic through expansive, rolling hills and a lush, dark 
forest. The costumes, especially those of Titania and her fairies, 
are glittering and elaborate. And a soundtrack with music by 
Mendelssohn, Puccini and Verdi punctuates the enchanted madness. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a Fox  
Searchlight release, was written, directed and produced by Hoffman 
and is rated PG-13.

Thursday or Friday in Texas after a rehabilitation assignment at 
the team's extended spring training camp in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken went on the disabled list for the first time in his  
career on April 18 because of nerve irritation in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's shown plenty of agility and ability already,'' Orioles  
manager Ray Miller said before Monday night's game against the 
Indians. ``It's just a matter of seeing some live pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old third baseman is in Sarasota, Fla. for workouts  
and practice games until Wednesday, when he will decide on a 
definite date for his return. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken worked out before Sunday's game against the Detroit  
Tigers, which the Orioles won 5-0, and said he felt ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 20, Ripken voluntarily ended his record consecutive  
games streak by sitting out the Orioles' final home game against 
the New York Yankees. It was the first game he missed since 
beginning his record streak of 2,632 games on May 30, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Willis Otanez started at third base Monday night for  
Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Makah Indians Hunt for Whale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seven Makah Indians in a cedar canoe began  
hunting for a gray whale on Monday -- the tribe's first attempt this 
spring to go on a traditional whale hunt that had been banned for 
70 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The whaling crew had intended only to go on a practice run in  
the Pacific Ocean near Neah Bay, said Keith Johnson, chairman of 
the Makah Whaling Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But protesters were following the crew's 32-foot canoe and their  
support boat, so the tribe issued a 10-day hunting permit that 
requires other vessels to stay at least 500 yards away. Under the 
tribe's arrangement with the Coast Guard, the Makah can declare the 
zone for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``So now we've got a whaling permit, so we're going hunting,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard detained two protesters and escorted their  
motorboat away. Jonathan Paul of the Sea Defense Alliance, an 
anti-whaling group, said no whales had been caught by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah, whose whaling tradition dates back centuries, were  
granted the right to whale under an 1855 treaty. The hunts stopped 
in the 1920s because commercial whaling had brought gray whales to 
the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	When grays were taken off the Endangered Species List in 1994,  
the tribe moved to resume the hunts. The federal government 
supported their bid before the International Whaling Commission, 
which has banned commercial whaling since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makah were allocated 20 whales through 2004 -- a maximum of  
five per year. They are prohibited from selling edible whale parts.

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynt Obscenity Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt's  
twice-delayed trial on obscenity charges could take three to six 
weeks, the judge said today as he began assembling prospective 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Patrick Dinkelacker said he  
hoped to have a jury seated by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, and his brother, Jimmy, 52, were indicted in April  
1998 on charges of pandering obscenity, disseminating material 
harmful to a juvenile, conspiracy and engaging in a pattern of 
corrupt activity. Both appeared in court today, eager to challenge 
this Ohio River city's anti-pornography standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from the alleged sale of a sexually explicit  
video to a 14-year-old boy at the Hustler Magazine &AMP; Gifts store 
that Jimmy Flynt manages. If convicted, each brother could get 24 
years in prison and $65,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, originally set for Jan. 19, has been rescheduled  
twice because Flynt, who has been in a wheelchair since he was shot 
in 1978, needed surgery for a urological problem related to his 
paralysis and also developed pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's first trial thrust him, and Cincinnati, into the  
spotlight in 1977. Flynt was convicted in the Common Pleas Court of 
pandering obscenity for selling Hustler magazine in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	He served six days of a 7- to 25-year sentence and was released  
pending appeal. The conviction, which was overturned in 1979, was 
depicted in the movie ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt has said he decided to open his own store to sell Hustler  
when he attended the movie premiere in Cincinnati and saw that the 
magazine still was not readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to win the court case, but that a loss in some  
ways would be better because he then could appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where you change laws, at the appellate level,'' he  
said. ``And that's what I'm attempting to do now is to get the 
antiquated obscenity laws off the books.''

<HEADLINE> Mourning Gets Help Against Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning turned in another strong  
performance against the New York Knicks, and this time he had some 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning scored 26 points Monday night and anchored the Miami  
Heat's defense, as usual, leading them past the New York Knicks 
83-73 in Game 2 of the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the MVP of the league,'' Knicks counterpart Patrick Ewing  
said. ``If he doesn't get it, there's something wrong with you all 
who vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, a 20-point Heat loss, Mourning was a one-man show.  
But in Game 2, he enjoyed plenty of support from guards Tim 
Hardaway, Dan Majerle and Terry Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had another poor shooting game, going just 1-for-5 and  
scoring 11 points, but he dished out 11 assists. Majerle made two 
3-pointers, his first baskets of the series, to hold New York at 
bay in the final quarter. And Porter had 11 points and six rebounds 
off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys stepped up and made a difference in the game,''  
Mourning said. ``They made plays for everybody. It's about 
penetrating and knocking shots down, and those three are the 
MVPs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, when Mourning had 27 points, the rest of the Heat's  
starting lineup shot 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other night, there was only one guy that showed up for  
us,'' forward P.J. Brown said. ``That was Zo, and everybody knows 
it. There was no way we could win this playoff series if only one 
guy is showing up to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Heat also know they need Mourning to lead the way, which  
he did Monday by making 10 of 16 shots, grabbing eight rebounds and 
blocking four shots in 46 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very active,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said. ``He played  
great the other night, and he played great tonight. He's so 
physical, and he's so needed by us out there. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence in the middle can change a lot of things.  
Anything that was coming to the basket, he was changing. He 
definitely gave us the game we needed to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing had 16 points and 15 rebounds but struggled to stop  
Mourning. The former Georgetown alums were matched up more 
frequently than in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick and I have had some battles,'' Mourning said. ``But  
it's a 5-on-5 competition. It's not a boxing match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in 5-on-5, the Heat had the edge Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutors Want Marine Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Prosecutors asked a military jury  
today to send a Marine pilot to prison for helping hide a videotape 
of a jet slicing the cable of a ski gondola, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., deserves two  
years in prison and dismissal as well as forfeiture of pay and 
allowances, Maj. Stu Couch told the jury of seven Marine officers. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense attorney, Capt. Jon Shelburne, asked the jurors to put  
themselves in Ashby's position and recall mistakes they have made 
and ``wished you could go back and undo it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prison time was appropriate for people who commit rape or  
larceny but ``wasn't even in the ball park'' for Ashby, Shelburne 
said in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury began deliberations after the arguments. Ashby was  
convicted Friday of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was at the controls of an EA-6B Prowler anti-radar jet  
that cut the cable on Feb. 3, 1998, at Cavalese, Italy. Twenty 
people died when the gondola crashed 370 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby was acquitted in March of 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., pleaded guilty to obstructing justice and was sentenced to 
dismissal from the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at  
Aviano, Italy, he took the personal videotape out. He testified 
that he later gave it to Schweitzer at the navigator's request. 
Schweitzer said he later threw it into a bonfire because he was 
afraid his face was on the tape and could be used by Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with involuntary  
manslaughter soon after the accident but the charges were 
dismissed. One of those officers, Capt. Chandler Seagraves, told 
investigators about the tape after he was granted immunity from 
prosecution.

hospital Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, 62, suffered the heart attack Friday, said her  
son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	She was in fair condition Monday night Massachusetts General

a test in which doctors inject dye into the heart arteries to check 
for a slowing of the blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy was to undergo another series of diagnostic tests  
on Tuesday, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, who was divorced from the senator in 1983, has  
described herself as a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in a 
number of rehabilitation programs following arrests for drunken 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Kennedy said in a statement that he spent Mother's Day  
weekend with his mother in the hospital and he expected his

<HEADLINE> Motorola Execs Bid for Chip Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- A group of present and former Motorola  
Corp. executives has asked the firm's board of directors for 
``immediate'' consideration of its $1.6 billion offer to buy the 
company's semiconductor components unit. 
</P>
<P>
	TFG Acquisition Group said it made an unsolicited offer March 30  
for the unit and recently refined it to profess job security for 
most of the 14,000 workers at plants in nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (semiconductor) unit is certainly a gem in the Motorola  
portfolio and ... will provide a strong operational and financial 
base upon which to build a premier organization to serve existing 
and new customers with the basic products of today and new products 
for the future,'' said Gary Thomas, TFG Acquisition's acting chief 
financial officer and former controller of two Motorola divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola spokesman David Rudd said the company would not comment  
on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola is restructuring its chip-making business to make it  
more profitable after a major downturn in the industry last year 
that came partly as a result of the Asian economic crisis. There 
was some speculation in February that the Schaumburg, Ill., 
equipment maker was shopping the chip components unit around for a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which remains contingent on approval by Motorola, is  
``genuinely superior to deals currently being considered'' by 
Motorola, TFG Acquisition said. The group has received a letter of 
intent for financing the purchase from a leading international bank 
and an equity investment firm, according to a statement.

<HEADLINE> $581M Awarded in Alleged Overcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- An Alabama jury awarded a jaw-dropping  
$581 million to a family who claimed they were overcharged $1,200 
for two satellite dishes, providing fresh ammunition for lawmakers 
who want to reform a legal system they say is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether such huge punitive-damage awards should be restricted  
has been a thorny issue for Congress and state legislatures 
nationwide. Tort reform, as it is called, is a particularly heated 
issue in Alabama, where critics say juries commonly dispense 
``jackpot justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an Alabama jury a few years ago that awarded $4 million  
to a doctor who didn't like that the paint had been touched up on 
his new BMW. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the award, and the 
doctor eventually got $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The $581 million verdict, delivered on Friday, is certain to be  
on the minds of Alabama state senators as soon as Tuesday, when 
they consider bills that would limit punitive-damage awards and 
make it more difficult to file frivolous lawsuits. A committee has 
approved the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``If ever there was a prime indication that Alabama needs to  
address the tort reform issue, this is it,'' Ragan Ingram, 
spokesman for Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, told The Birmingham News. 
``That's a lot of money. Alabama businesses can't survive in this 
kind of environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some lawyers say consumer protection laws are weak, so  
eye-popping verdicts are the only real protection available in 
Alabama to someone who has been cheated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the system is working now better than it ever has,''  
said Tom Methvin, the attorney who won the $581 million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved Barbara Carlisle and her parents, George and  
Velma Merriweather of Greensboro, in rural Alabama. They sued 
Whirlpool Financial National Bank and Gulf Coast Electronics, 
contending the companies tried to gouge them for $612 each on the 
purchase of two $1,100 satellite dishes sold by a door-to-door 
salesperson in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The salesperson said they would have to pay $34 a month for  
three years, but the contract ran for 4 1/2 years, Methvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the lawsuit was filed, Whirlpool Financial waived payment  
of the amount that was disputed by the family, said Robert 
Spotswood, a lawyer for Whirlpool Corp., which has since sold 
Whirlpool Financial to TransAmerica Bank. The family lost nothing, 
Spotswood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the jury awarded them $975,000 to compensate for their  
mental anguish and $580 million to punish the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury heard testimony that Whirlpool Financial cheated  
thousands of Alabamians out of $8 million by getting them to sign 
credit card deals that required them to pay as much as 300 percent 
in interest, even though the advertised rate was only 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We proved that Whirlpool Financial targeted the elderly and  
the illiterate,'' Methvin said. The jurors ``were outraged that 
this was going on in a modern society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool Financial said any wrongdoing was committed by Gulf  
Coast Electronics, a Mobile company that financed its satellite 
dish sales through Whirlpool Financial. The president of Gulf Coast 
Electronics, Don Gantt Jr., said his company sold the family a good 
system at a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not misrepresent anything,'' he said. ``We did not  
overcharge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Carlisle nor the Merriweathers could be located by  
telephone for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Spotswood said the case will be appealed. And Methvin, the  
family's attorney, said he expects the verdict to be reduced to 
less than $1 million because of the Supreme Court's ruling in the 
BMW case. In 1996, the high court said the verdict was ``grossly 
excessive.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Import Sales Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hurt by the continuing recession, sales of imported  
cars, trucks and buses in Japan slipped 0.6 percent on year in 
April, an industry group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Total import sales in April amounted to 19,962 vehicles, down  
from 20,084 the same month a year ago -- the second straight monthly 
drop, the Japan Automobile Importers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of imported passenger cars jumped 1.8 percent to 19,382,  
but truck imports plummeted 44.6 percent to 579. One imported bus 
was sold in April, the same as last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kunihiko Ono, a spokesman for the association, said imported  
vehicle sales were likely to remain weak amid few signs of a 
significant economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz was the leading import brand in April for the  
sixth straight month. Mercedes-Benz had a 21 percent share of the 
import market, followed by Volkswagen with 16 percent and BMW with 
9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By country, sales of passenger cars imported from Germany rose  
5.5 percent to 11,065. Mercedes sales increased 40.6 percent to 
3,949, Opel sales grew 3.1 percent to 1,383 and German-made Ford 
sales soared 183.6 percent to 431. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of U.S.-made passenger cars rose 24.2 percent to 4,363,  
with Ford sales rising 2.6 percent to 240 and Honda sales soaring 
371.1 percent to 1,630. 
</P>
<P>
	Ono said Ford's April sales were boosted by demand for its  
recently introduced three-door hatchback, the ``Ka,'' while Honda 
continued to benefit from strong demand for its Inspire and Saber 
luxury sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of other U.S.-made passenger cars fell, however, with  
DaimlerChrysler's sales slumping 39.7 percent, GM's dropping 8.8 
percent and Toyota's plunging 52.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of passenger cars from Britain dropped 15.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sabres and Bruins Heating Up Series / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- It's only taken two playoff games and one  
rough hit on Ray Bourque to create fury between the Boston Bruins 
and Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things will boil,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff promised Monday.  
``It's going to become an angry series. We were physical in Boston; 
we'd like to take it up one more notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres will try to do that when the series switches to  
Buffalo for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday. Buffalo tied the 
series at a game apiece with a 3-1 victory at Boston on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matters started really heating between these teams when  
Buffalo's Alexei Zhitnik slammed Bourque into the boards from 
behind during Sunday's game. Defenseman Kyle McLaren took it upon 
himself to inform Zhitnik that the 38-year-old Bourque, the Bruins' 
captain, is not available for Sabres target practice. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, McLaren said he did not know who Zhitnik hit and  
caused to slump to the ice. But after realizing it was Bourque, 
McLaren followed Zhitnick to the penalty box where he pointed his 
finger, hollered some obscenities and, as McLaren said, ``put it in 
his ear and let him know that we're coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren, who had four hits himself in the game, said he knows  
hits are part of the sport. He admitted that sometimes a player 
can't slow down enough to prevent a hit, but added: 
</P>
<P>
	``That hit was uncalled for. It was kind of from behind and you  
just don't do that to guys like Ray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhitnik earned a two-minute penalty for boarding.  
</P>
<P>
	Bourque, the 20-year Bruins veteran and sage of the Boston  
locker room, said cheap shots are a part of the game. And they 
should be expected during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to take it when it comes up and dish it out (when  
opportunity is there),'' Bourque said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Bruins echoed McLaren's warning that Zhitnik had better  
watch his back. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot you can get away with (on the ice),'' Bruins  
forward Tim Taylor said. ``(Zhitnik) just put himself in a really 
tough situation where every time he touches the puck, our guys are 
going to be coming -- and coming hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Pat Burns thinks his team has to get tougher in  
order to stay competitive in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference 
series. He said his players looked ``soft'' in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're much hungrier,'' Burns said of the Sabres. ``They know  
what it takes right now to continue and we're going to have to turn 
it around. Are we ready to sacrifice?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the talk of hate between these two teams, the players  
say they love the rivalry -- and the trash talk that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be any fun if nobody said anything and both teams  
really liked each other and patted each other after the game,'' 
Sabres forward Dixon Ward said. ``It's a good solid rivalry that's 
been created over the years, and we're picking it up where it left 
off.''

<HEADLINE> Skater Stojko Breaks Collarbone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAMPTON, Ontario (AP) -- Three-time world figure skating  
champion Elvis Stojko fractured his right collarbone last week 
while practicing in a rink near his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was skating backwards and caught an edge and went down in a  
strange, awkward position,'' Stojko said Monday while conducting a 
clinic for children. 
</P>
<P>
	He had returned to his home in Richmond Hill for a rest after  
performing in 49 shows in the annual post-world championship tour 
of the United States. He was to return to the tour Thursday in 
Florida but now aims to rejoin it in California next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it's kind of a blessing in disguise,'' Stojko said  
of the injury which happened last Monday. ``It'll give me a bit of 
time to think about what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he has to do is decide to either remain on the top  
competitive circuit and go for another world title, or perform 
exclusively as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the middle right now,'' he said when asked which way  
he was leaning. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko will sit down later this week with his business manager  
``to study all the options on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes right down to it, when you take away all the  
so-called glamour and glitter and fame, I've got to make sure I'm 
going to be happy with what I'm doing,'' he said. ``Maybe I'd make 
a little more money as a pro, but am I really going to be happy? 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I going to be able to push my potential the way I want to?  
Do I still want to push my potential? I know I still do. So, am I 
going to be able to do it successfully in a pro situation? 
</P>
<P>
	``In the amateur world, I feel comfortable doing that because of  
the whole scene -- the rules setup, the programs, everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he doesn't expect to make an announcement until well  
into the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I don't want to rush.''

<HEADLINE> Comcast Earns $73M on Cable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Comcast Corp., the third-largest cable  
operator in the country, earned $73.5 million in the latest 
quarter, bouncing back from a loss a year ago, on strong growth in 
its cable operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, which worked out to 12 cents per share, were ahead  
of analyst expectations and compared with a loss of $86 million, or 
11 cents per share, for the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter ending March 31 rose 9.5 percent to  
$1.37 billion from $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast attributed the good results to expansion into cable  
markets in Broward County, Fla.; Roseville, Calif.; Delaware and 
Maryland, adding over 20,600 basic customers. The results exclude 
the sales of the company's Primestar and British operations, which 
were sold last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes a week after Comcast backed out of the  
bidding war with AT&AMP;T for MediaOne, the nation's fourth-largest 
cable company. 
</P>
<P>
	Under AT&AMP;T's pact with Comcast, the two companies plan to  
exchange 2.7 million customers, giving each company a stronger 
presence in markets they have targeted for growth. Comcast will get 
2 million subscribers in seven markets, including Michigan, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in Comcast's digital cable and high speed Internet access  
businesses helped boost operating cash flow by 38 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Comcast shares closed up  
$1.37 1/2 at $37.87 1/2.

	Clinton Calls For Full Serb Pullout  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he was encouraged  
by a partial Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo but repeated NATO's 
demands for a complete pullout. Yugoslavia's army announced a 
partial withdrawal of military and police forces from Kosovo, 
saying it had completed its operations against ethnic Albanian 
rebels in the southern Serb province. NATO quickly said a partial 
withdrawal would not halt its air campaign. Virtually all foreign 
reporters have left Kosovo under government orders, and it could 
not be determined if any units have actually left.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China broke off talks on arms control with the  
United States today, and allowed waves of demonstrators to hurl 
stones at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for a third day to protest 
NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. The U.S. 
ambassador hunkered down in the American compound said the 
situation had deteriorated enough that he ordered sensitive papers 
in the embassy destroyed. China suspended diplomatic relations 
regarding human rights, arms control and international security, 
the state-run Xinhua news agency said, which affects U.S. concerns 
that China has provided nuclear weapons or missile technology to 
Pakistan, Iran or other countries.

responsible. The jury returned its verdict during the fourth day of 
deliberations in the case against Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds

	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said today that

the Republican nomination and overall presidential race for 2000,

J.D. Power and Associates. The company's annual Initial Quality 
Study is a widely followed measure of vehicle quality. The 
Associated Press today obtained results from a confidential

<HEADLINE> Panel Holds Cop Brutality Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after Mother's Day, Dorothy Elliott came  
to Capitol Hill seeking answers about her dead son. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearfully, she asked why her son, Archie, was shot 14 times by  
police in Prince Georges County, Md., and no one has been held 
accountable four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated next to her was Saiko Diallo, whose son Amadou, a street  
vendor from Guinea, was killed Feb. 4 outside his New York City 
apartment when four white police officers fired 41 shots at the 
unarmed black man, focusing national attention on police treatment 
of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police officers have been indicted for (second-degree)  
murder,'' Diallo told a hearing on police brutality held Monday by 
the Congressional Black Caucus. ``But they are still working full 
time with a full salary. This is unfair. This is not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem isn't only excessive use of force but dragnet  
techniques,'' said Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban 
League. He cited racial profiling of suspects on traffic stops and 
random stopping and frisking policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil  
rights, said that although his office is limited in its ability to 
bring federal prosecutions to local police jurisdictions, it has 
reached settlements with Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, after 
the Justice Department filed police discrimination complaints 
against the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said investigations of the Washington, D.C., New York City  
and New Orleans police departments are under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen several tragedies in the last few months,'' Lee  
said. ``We have to see how we as a nation as a whole respond. Not 
by pointing fingers but by moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts by relatives of those who died in police custody  
brought tears among both spectators and witnesses at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call it a tragedy but I call it a murder,'' Elliott  
sobbed. ``My son didn't resist arrest. My son's life had value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archie Elliott III, 24, was killed after being stopped by police  
in Prince Georges County in Washington's Maryland suburbs in June 
1995. Police said Elliott pointed a gun at them while sitting in a 
police car with his hands cuffed behind him. He refused to drop the 
gun and was shot 14 times, according to the police account. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he were a congressional aide, the legal system would have  
spared no expense to find the perpetrator,'' Elliott said. ``Isn't 
there a double standard here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chairman of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, said additional hearings on police abuse will be held in 
New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise we won't just file a report and go onto the next  
issue,'' Clyburn said. ``We need to stay focused and achieve some 
meaningful results.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Denounces Rumor-Starters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said Monday that he has  
learned from mistakes he may have made 20 or 30 years ago, and he 
denounced those who float rumors and try to destroy a candidate's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, front-runner among early GOP presidential prospects, has  
acknowledged ``youthful indiscretions'' and quitting drinking 
alcohol when he was 40. But beyond that, he has declined to discuss 
his past. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated that stand Monday, calling it ``a Washington game''  
to get candidates to respond to reputation-tarnishing rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have made mistakes 20, 30 years ago like a lot of other  
people. But I've learned from my mistakes,'' Bush told the ABC-TV 
program ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What's important, Bush insisted, is how he would conduct himself  
if elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's important for America to know about me is  
that if I'm fortunate enough to put my hand on the Bible, I will 
not only swear to uphold the laws of our country, I will swear to 
uphold the dignity of the office,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was my pledge I made to my fellow Texans, that I would  
uphold the dignity of the office, and it's a pledge I've kept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor has formed a presidential exploratory  
committee that's already raised an estimated $11 million. He has 
been the front-runner in several national opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	He is staying in Texas until the Legislature ends its current  
session May 31, then plans to travel to key campaign states before 
making a final decision on whether to seek the White House in late 
summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can float every rumor they want, and people can try to  
destroy the reputations of candidates,'' Bush said. ``But as we 
head into the 21st century, it's necessary to say: `The past is the 
past; judge me for what I am today.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's what an official does in office that counts.  
</P>
<P>
	``What people need to know about me is that I've learned from my  
mistakes and there needs to be a consistent message from people in 
my generation that says, `Drugs will destroy your life, abusing 
alcohol will destroy your life','' Bush said.

	Nearly 16,000 Kosovo refugees straggled across the border over  
the weekend, relaying tales of Serbs driving them out from the 
towns of Pec and Djakovica. And the influx was expected to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do expect more people today. Those arriving (Sunday) said a  
lot of people were behind them,'' said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

<P>
	The number of refugees arriving daily was shrinking last week to  
a few thousand, or even a few hundred. Aid officials were 
expressing hope that they could start moving large numbers of 
existing refugees further south, away from the unstable region 
around Kukes. The town of 30,000 people has become the temporary 
home for more than 100,000 refugees since the NATO bombing campaign 
began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	With the latest arrivals, the town square is again filled with  
ragged, sunburned refugees, milling around and looking for a tented 
camp that can take them in. 
</P>
<P>
	A large dirt field, which emptied last week as refugees moved  
on, is once again a parking lot filled with the now-familiar red 
tractors and wagons that bring most of the refugees out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR and other aid groups are trying to strike a balance  
between providing enough resources for all the new arrivals, and 
strongly encouraging the refugees to move south as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukes is simply not equipped to handle the population it has  
now, aid workers say. The town is also within range of Serb 
artillery, and the Yugoslav security forces have shelled some 
Albanian border regions in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Albanian government does not have full control  
of the remote northeast corner of the country, raising further 
security concerns. Already, there have been a number of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian boys stand by the side of the road and wave at the  
newly arrived refugees on the tractors, and as they pass, the 
youths snatch clothes, food, and other supplies that may have been 
dangling over the side of the slow-moving vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid groups fear such petty theft could increase frictions  
between refugees and Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The aid organizations plan a tent-to-tent information campaign  
starting Tuesday, when they will hand out leaflets and try to 
persuade refugees to move from the border.

that hugs the side of a mountain.

<HEADLINE>  Albania Sees New Refugee Influx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- A recent Serb offensive in southwest  
Kosovo has produced a new wave of refugees at the Albanian border 
and again strained the meager resources of this mountain town, a 
U.N. official said today.

<HEADLINE> Gun Makers, Anti-Gun Groups Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the nation's toughest anti-gun groups  
are joining with their historic enemy, gun manufacturers, to warn 
that the safety locks touted by President Clinton and others to 
fight youth violence can offer a false -- even dangerous -- sense of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing a tremendous disservice to consumers if we say,  
`Just run out and get a safety lock, and you'll be safe,''' said 
Kristen Rand of the anti-gun Violence Policy Center. She said some 
are made of such flimsy plastic they can easily be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some of the ways the president portrays them, he sends a  
wrong message. They're not childproof,'' agreed Robert Delfay, 
president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which 
represents gun and ammunition makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as the nation seeks ways to keep guns from children after  
the Littleton, Colo., shootings, proposals to make safety locks 
mandatory are gaining new support, even from critics like Delfay 
and Rand, who see them as imperfect. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats in Congress, backed by Clinton, will press in Senate  
debate this week to make locks mandatory. Even some Republicans 
call them acceptable. And a flurry of lawsuits by cities and by 
victims of previous school shootings cite lack of gun locks as 
evidence of manufacturers' negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides generally agree that gun locks address only a  
limited, although serious, problem: The 200 or so children killed 
and more than 1,000 injured each year in gun accidents. Both sides 
believe a gun lock won't deter a determined thief. 
</P>
<P>
	Trigger locks, the most widely used, fasten like a sandwich  
around a trigger to prevent it from being pulled. Cable locks 
thread through the gun's action, preventing it from going off. Some 
work with keys, others with combinations. Guns also can be locked 
in boxes or safes, Delfay notes. 
</P>
<P>
	All have drawbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Gun groups worry that locks can hamstring a person trying to  
fend off a surprise intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all manufacturers warn they should be used only on  
unloaded guns -- and in fact, can cause a loaded gun to fire 
accidentally. One company, Saf-T-Lok Inc., has drawn attention by 
insisting its device works on a loaded gun. The Boston police 
department recently bought Saf-T-Loks for its officers to use while 
off-duty, but Beretta USA Corp. says it tested the locks and found 
them unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their purpose is to enable people to leave their guns loaded  
and even accessible to children,'' says Jeff Reh, Beretta's general 
counsel. ``That is a step backward from the conceptual idea of 
making sure guns are unloaded and away from children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, lawyers for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence  
plan to cite Saf-T-Lok, in lawsuits on behalf of New Orleans, 
Atlanta and other cities, as evidence that gun makers still 
negligently shun expensive state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun industry replies that advocates exaggerate, for  
political purposes, the available technology and the 
as-yet-undeveloped promise of ``smart guns'' that could identify a 
gun's owner through fingerprints, denying anyone else the ability 
to fire it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such fights, several gun manufacturers voluntarily have  
begun shipping locks with their firearms. Beretta began after an 
October 1997 meeting at the White House where Clinton, appearing 
with eight top gun-makers, announced voluntary agreement to include 
locks with new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Police departments nationwide also increasingly provide locks  
both to officers and citizens. Bridgeport, Conn., has given 500 to 
citizens since February. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the city lawsuits, the families of four students  
and a teacher killed in the March 1998 Jonesboro, Ark., school 
shootings have sued two gun makers, saying the weapons used by the 
two youthful attackers, taken from the home of one boy's 
grandfather, were defective because they didn't have locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress this week is to debate measures, proposed by Clinton  
and Senate Democrats, to mandate child-safety locks on all guns 
sold, raise the legal age for handgun possession from 18 to 21 and 
impose background checks on buyers at all gun-show sales. A 
proposal to require safety locks failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While criticizing Clinton's proposals as ``knee-jerk reaction,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has appeared to leave 
open the door to some restrictions, specifically child locks. Gun 
makers say they can support a proposal, depending on specifics. The 
National Rifle Association, the largest gun-owners' organization, 
opposes mandatory locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and most anti-gun groups, including Handgun Control  
Inc., acknowledge locks won't solve all problems but contend they 
can prevent harm if the government sets minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are trying to focus on are things that can make a  
difference -- and that can pass Congress,'' said Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``And trigger locks meet both of those 
conditions.''

<HEADLINE> Edwin L. Dale Jr. Dies at Age 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former New York Times  
reporter and spokesman for the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, died of cancer Monday at the Hospice of Washington. He was 
75. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale served as assistant director of public affairs at OMB  
between 1981 and 1987, providing a critical link between reporters 
and the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two years after that as a counselor to then-Commerce  
Secretary C. William Verity before returning to the budget office 
as a director of external affairs. He worked in the area of policy 
studies before retiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his mastery of the federal budget, Dale fielded a  
variety of queries from reporters -- once taking as many as 110 
calls in a day during the height of budget season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale came to Washington in 1951 as a reporter for the New York  
Herald Tribune. Four years later, he began covering economics for 
the Times. He spent several years in Paris, and later returned to 
Washington with assignments at the White House and the State 
Department. In 1977, Dale went to work on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the author of ``Conservatives in Power'' in 1960 and was  
the primary author of ``The People's Budget,'' published in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Philadelphia, Dale graduated from Yale University in  
1944 and served in the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Meredith, and two stepchildren.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index in Hong Kong rebounding after falling sharply in 
early trading on worries over the NATO bombing of the Chinese 
embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's main indicator of  
blue chips, rose 165.77 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at 
13,163.20. On Friday, the index had slumped 572.81 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices opened sharply lower as investors  
continued to take profits on concerns that Sino-U.S. relations 
would worsen because of the bombing of the Chinese embassy in 
Belgrade last week that triggered massive protests in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices rebounded in the afternoon on bargain-hunting following  
news that banking giant HSBC Holdings is to acquire Republic New 
York Corp. for U.S. $10.3 billion. Trading in shares of HSBC 
Holdings was suspended before news of the acquisition of the U.S. 
banking group. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
30.49 points, or 0.18 percent, closing the day's session at 
16,977.01 points. On Friday, the average lost 354.09 points, or 
2.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices were supported by continued hopes that the  
government may come up with additional steps to stimulate the 
economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said Sunday that  
an extra budget to stimulate economic growth was ``one possible 
choice'' the Japanese government is considering. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors, however, remain hesitant to buy stocks ahead of  
earnings announcements in coming weeks from Japanese companies for 
the fiscal year that ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.86 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 0.32 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also 
marginally higher than its late Friday New York level of 120.85 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices closed sharply higher on buying by  
foreign investors. The main Composite Index, which tracks 100 key 
stocks, closed at 705.83 points, up 14.15 points, or 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the Philippines also closed higher, propped up by a  
cut in the central bank's overnight rates -- the 13th since the 
start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank reduced by 0.125 percentage point its overnight  
lending and borrowing rates to 10.125 percent and 12.125 percent, 
respectively. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected 
companies rose 38.07 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,564.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Singapore Stock Exchange, where share  
prices closed mostly lower as investors continued to take profits. 
The key Straits Times Index closed 37.07 points, or 2 percent, to 
1,862.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher for the first time  
in four sessions as investors ventured back to the market for 
bargains. The key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 15.04 points, or 
0.2 percent, to 7,484.37. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed narrowly mixed. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index slipped 0.42 point to 2,226.65. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with strong gains  
in the heavily weighted banking and telecommunication sectors 
outweighing sharp falls among resource stocks, particularly gold. 
The All Ordinaries Index rose 9.0 points, or 0.3 percent, to 
2,996.7. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Korea Composite  
Stock Price Index rose 3.62 points, or 0.4 percent, to 814.24. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed mostly lower on profit-taking. The  
Composite Index slipped 0.763 point, or 0.1 percent, to 574.355. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed slightly higher. The SET index  
rose 2.08 points, or 0.4 percent, to 490.43.

<HEADLINE> Chevron May Buy Texaco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chevron Corp. is discussing buying Texaco Inc.  
for about $42 billion in stock in a deal that would unite the 
nation's third and fourth biggest energy companies, The Wall Street 
Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	But the newspaper, citing unidentified people familar with the  
talks, said the companies aren't near an agreement and said a 
combination faces enormous hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	It said officials of Chevron, based in San Francisco, and  
Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., declined to comment on a 
possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Large oil companies have been rushing to unite because of  
falling oil prices and the need to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., the nation's two  
biggest energy companies, plan to vote later this month on a 
merger. British Petroleum acquired Amoco Corp., then the fifth 
largest U.S. energy concern, last year and the combined company, BP 
Amoco, has agreed to buy Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron chairman Kenneth Derr and Texaco chief executive Peter  
Bijur both have said recently they don't need partners to be 
successful but would consider merging with other companies to 
increase cash flow or efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say a Chevron-Texaco merger would make less  
sense than other recent oil company mergers because both companies 
have been cutting costs on their own and Texaco last year formed a 
refining partnership with Shell Oil, which would present a 
regulatory stumbling block.

<HEADLINE> Answers Sought in NYC 911 Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's 911 system experienced some delays  
with test calls placed by the New York Police Department over the 
weekend, although police said residents had no trouble getting 
emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Crotty, group president in New York and Connecticut for  
Bell Atlantic, said NYPD test callers experienced some delays in 
getting an operator over the weekend. A police spokeswoman said 
late Monday night there were no problems after some delays earlier 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	On a busy day, 911 in New York City receives some 30,000 calls.  
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said some calls took between five 
to 30 seconds to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Breakdowns have shaken peoples' confidence in the system and  
prompted criticism of Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get to the cause of this, to find out, `What is  
it?''' Bell Atlantic spokesman John Bonomo said before Monday's 
breakdown. ``We want to make sure the system is fail-safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a January service disruption, 41-year-old John Audy of  
Vermont, who was in Queens to celebrate his girlfriend's 40th 
birthday, suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend dialed 911 three times but got busy signals.  
Finally, she ran barefoot in 23-degree weather to a police station 
nearby. Audy died by the time help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said the phone company has taken the  
blame, but Bell Atlantic denied having told police the breakdowns 
were its fault. Safir again blamed the phone company on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department, which collects a small monthly surcharge  
on phone lines, has received $117 million since 1991 for a new 
back-up 911 facility and to pay for technological upgrades but has 
failed to find an adequate site in the city of 7.4 million people.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Execs Bid for Chip Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) -- A group of present and former Motorola  
Corp. executives revealed Monday they have made an unsolicited 
offer to buy the company's semiconductor components unit for $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	TFG Acquisition Group said it made an offer on March 30 for the  
unit and recently altered the offer to promise job security for 
most of the 14,000 workers at plants in nine countries. The group 
asked for ``immediate'' consideration by Motorola's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola spokesman David Rudd said the company would not comment  
on the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola is restructuring its chip-making business to make it  
more profitable after a major downturn in the industry last year 
that came partly as a result of the Asian economic crisis. There 
was some speculation in February that the Schaumburg, Ill., 
equipment maker was shopping the chip components unit around for a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (semiconductor) unit is certainly a gem in the Motorola  
portfolio and ... will provide a strong operational and financial 
base upon which to build a premier organization to serve existing 
and new customers with the basic products of today and new products 
for the future,'' said Gary Thomas, TFG Acquisition's acting chief 
financial officer and former controller of two Motorola divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which remains contingent on approval by Motorola, is  
``genuinely superior to deals currently being considered'' by 
Motorola, TFG Acquisition said. The group has received a letter of 
intent for financing the purchase from a leading international bank 
and an equity investment firm, according to a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola's shares soared $4.18 3/4, or 5.4 percent, to close at  
$81.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Company Uses 'Star Wars' to Recruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- ServiceWare Inc. wants the force to be with  
them -- the work force, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	The software design company is hoping to woo job candidates by  
offering free tickets to ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom 
Menace'' when it opens May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a techie kind of thing,'' employment manager Matt Rogers  
said. ``Obviously they'd enjoy that much more than a movie like 
'Titanic'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a newspaper advertisement last month, designed to look like  
the opening scroll of words in the ``Star Wars'' movies, 
ServiceWare invited prospective hires to ``join the Force.'' 
Candidates arriving for an interview with Rogers are greeted by a 
six-foot cardboard cutout of Darth Vader wearing a ServiceWare 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	So far about 50 people have applied to fill 10 to 15 openings,  
and roughly half were drawn in by the campaign, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	ServiceWare is a privately held company with about 200  
employees, founded in 1991 and based in Oakmont, Pa., near 
Pittsburgh. It designs software to help clients like Microsoft and 
Apple solve customers' computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nila Bhakuni, 32, didn't know about the campaign when she first  
applied for a job with the company last month. But now she says she 
may dress like Princess Leia for a second interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Since her first meeting with ServiceWare, she's been busy coming  
up with comparisons between the first ``Star Wars'' movie, which 
she saw when it opened in 1977, and the company.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Adopting Bank Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At the urging of Senate Banking Committee head  
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, federal regulators are taking action to keep 
politics out of bank examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four major bank-regulatory agencies are adopting or making  
more formal policies barring bank examiners from discussing 
politics with bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm issued a statement Monday saying the agencies' actions  
will ensure that bank inspections ``are free from political issues 
or considerations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The examination process can be trying enough for a banker  
without injecting the poison of political pressure,'' Gramm said. 
``These new policies should help prevent abuses by making sure that 
both (government) examiners and bankers are aware that exams should 
be above board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm is a fierce critic of the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act,  
which requires banks to make loans to the poor and minorities in 
the areas in which they operate. As Congress drafts sweeping 
legislation to overhaul the financial services laws, Gramm has 
tried to keep the government's community-lending ratings for banks 
from becoming a standard for allowing them to merge with other 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	His action has put him at odds with the Clinton administration,  
which has threatened to veto a financial services bill passed by 
the Senate last week on grounds it would hurt the community lending 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said the agencies took the action in response to his  
having recently criticized the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, part of the Treasury Department, for allowing its 
examiners to solicit positive ``political'' statements from bankers 
about the community lending law. 
</P>
<P>
	After the comptroller's office issued a formal directive to its  
employees prohibiting political communications, Gramm said, the 
other three agencies told him they planned to follow suit. They are 
the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and 
the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, told Gramm in a letter last  
week that the agency had a long-standing unwritten, informal policy 
of ``carefully avoiding any form of political communications by 
examiners'' with banks or their affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC has had no problems in this area for more than 60  
years, Ms. Tanoue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Gramm's request last month, the agency made the  
policy formal and distributed it to employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the Federal Reserve recently formalized its  
75-year-old policy of avoiding any form of political communications 
with banks, a spokesman for the central bank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	William Fulwider, a thrift office spokesman, said the agency  
planned to issue such guidelines to employees within the next few 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Crawford Injured in Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks forward Chris Crawford sprained his  
right shoulder Monday night when he tumbled to the court after a 
tip-in during Game 2 of the first-round playoff series against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford scored the first six points for the Hawks, the last  
basket coming as he stretched out to tip in a missed shot by Mookie 
Blaylock with 9:08 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 forward stretched out to reach the ball and fell to  
the court afterwards, landing hard on his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford was taken to the locker room for X-rays. He could not  
return to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury further depleted the Hawks' depth. Crawford started  
the final 30 games of the regular season after LaPhonso Ellis was 
sidelined with a sports hernia. Forward Alan Henderson, still 
suffering double vision caused by a severe abrasion to his left 
eye, did not play in the first half Monday after managing only four 
minutes in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta led the Eastern Conference series after a 90-70 victory  
Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Potomac Runs Through History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To its earliest explorers, the Potomac was a  
river of possibilities, a broad tidal stream so rich that sailors 
felt justified in trying to catch its teeming fish with the pan 
they used to fry them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Potomac would one day know slavery and see it abolished,  
sprout a national capital on its banks, become the cockpit of a 
civil war and fight to cleanse its once-pristine waters of the 
pollution of human enterprise and waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Centuries after the explorers, it would give its name to Potomac  
Fever, a potent malady that causes perfectly respectable citizens 
to look in the mirror in the morning and see the face of the 
president of the United States staring back. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the beginning, before the Indian tribes were swept aside,  
before the spelling of its name settled down from 20 or more 
variations of ``Patwomeck,'' ``Patomeck,'' ``Pattowmack,'' some 
hoped that the Chesapeake Bay to which the river flows might be a 
sea-road that would lead all the way to China. More practically 
they saw timber, masts for ships, mines, fisheries, farms and 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1608, the Englishmen sailing with Capt. John  
Smith found refuge in the river from a fear-inspiring ocean storm 
and ``an abundance of fish lying so thick with their heads above 
the water ... we attempted to catch them with a frying pan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the sweetest and greatest river I have found, so that  
the Thames is but a little finger to it,'' wrote Father Andrew 
White, a Roman Catholic priest arriving at ``the wished for 
country'' with the first Maryland colonists in 1633. 
</P>
<P>
	The Potomac runs just 380 miles from its source in a spring in  
the Blue Ridge Mountains, near an ancient boundary marker called 
the Fairfax Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	The river was always seen to have possibilities greater than its  
length. 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington, who lived his life near the river, was a  
constant promoter of its commercial potential in opening the West. 
</P>
<P>
	A conference held at Washington's Mount Vernon plantation in  
1785 on a dispute between Virginia and Maryland over taxing Potomac 
cargoes was a beginning link in a tangled chain of events that led 
to the drafting of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	That chain also led back to the Potomac when the government  
formed under the Constitution established its capital at a site of 
wavy hills and swamps on the river's banks. It was just about as 
far upstream as an oceangoing ship could sail before encountering a 
crashing wall of violent white water and jagged rocks at Great 
Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	John Adams, the first president to preside in Washington, walked  
down the slope from the White House to swim in the Potomac. John 
Tyler, the 10th president, narrowly escaped injury when a new 
cannon exploded during an 1844 Potomac boating party, killing the 
secretaries of state and the Navy and six others. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking a slave uprising, abolitionist John Brown briefly  
occupied the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, the place where the 
Potomac meets the Shenandoah, a place of such natural splendor that 
Thomas Jefferson had said it was worth a voyage across the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil War started slowly. But the initial reports of ``all  
quiet along the Potomac'' changed soon enough. Union troops, routed 
at Bull Run, flooded back across the Potomac from Virginia. The 
bodies of Union soldiers, repulsed by Confederates at Ball's Bluff 
upriver, floated back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert E. Lee twice led invading Confederates across the  
Potomac. After costly, bitterly fought battles at Antietam and 
Gettysburg he led them back again and the cause of the Confederacy 
began to sink. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 20th century the greatest villain lurking on and near the  
river has been pollution that all but turned the stream into an 
open sewer. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton says that when he was a student in the capital  
in the late 1960s the Potomac was so polluted that members of the 
Georgetown University rowing crew were required to get typhoid 
shots before pulling oars through the river's fouled water. 
</P>
<P>
	The Potomac's pollution is easing, due in part to effective  
federal, state and local environmental cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some species of long-absent fish are returning. This spring a  
trio of beavers so approved of the cleaner water that they set up 
housekeeping in the Tidal Basin, gnawing through cherry trees in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Potomac still has possibilities.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge Stops Anti-Mask Ordinance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled a Goshen city  
ban on masks unconstitutional, saying it violates the rights of Ku 
Klux Klansmen to express themselves and associate anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert L. Miller issued the ruling May 4. It  
was made public by lawyers on the case Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Goshen enacted an ordinance making it illegal for  
anyone 18 or older to wear a mask, hood or other device in public 
to conceal his or her identity, except for religious, safety or 
medical reasons. Violators were subject to a $2,500 fine. City 
officials hoped the measure would discourage the KKK from rallying 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Knights argued that they consider themselves a  
religion, and their national leader, the Rev. Jeffrey Berry, 
testified that members conceal themselves because they are sinners 
in God's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also said many members wear the hoods to remain  
anonymous and reduce the risk of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana was a Klan stronghold in the 1920s. The state had 10  
active chapters in 1997, according to KlanWatch, a national group 
that monitors KKK activity.

<HEADLINE> NBC, Xoom.com, Snap.com Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is joining forces with Web directory service  
Snap.com and Xoom.com, an electronic commerce site, to form a new 
Internet company in an attempt to broaden its online presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal announced today, the new company, NBC Internet or  
NBCi, will operate under the Snap name online but will include 
content from NBC and the trademark peacock brand. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging several different kinds of Internet properties under  
one umbrella, the new company is hoping to position itself as a 
full-service site with search capabilities from Snap, the online 
sales expertise of Xoom.com, and entertainment content from NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC will own about half of the new venture and is contributing  
several of its online properties, including NBC.com and 
Videoseeker.com. NBC is also contributing a 10 percent ownership 
stake in CNBC.com, the parent of Snap, to the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Xoom.com shareholders will own about a third of the company, and  
CNET will own about 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC, a 50-50 news partnership between NBC and Microsoft Corp.,  
was not part of the deal and will continue to operate on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's president and CEO Bob Wright will become chairman of the  
new company, and Xoom.com chairman Chris Kitze will become 
president of NBCi. 
</P>
<P>
	NBCi will buy $380 million in TV advertising from the network  
over the next four years, and expects to buy an additional $500 
million over the following six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by NBC resembles a strategy employed successfully by  
competing network CBS, which has taken equity stakes in several 
emerging Internet companies such as Marketwatch.com and promoted 
them across its media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	NBCi will be a publicly traded company.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns China on Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade  
that has sparked anti-American demonstrations in Beijing and other 
Chinese cities was the result of misinformation from CIA target 
planners, a U.S. government official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, American diplomatic officials and lawmakers warned  
that those demonstrations, which the Chinese government has 
sanctioned and at times assisted, could seriously affect U.S.-China 
relations if they are allowed to grow out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Those relations took a further downturn today when China  
suspended high-level military contacts with the United States and 
postponed talks on human rights, arms control, international 
security and arms proliferation. Assistant Secretary of State 
Stanley Roth also canceled a planned visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department also has issued an advisory cautioning  
Americans against travel in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The intended target in the air attack Friday was a military  
supply office. But due to faulty information provided by the CIA 
and reviewed by NATO and the Pentagon, the pilots mistakenly bombed 
the Chinese Embassy several hundred yards away, the U.S. official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went through all these hoops, but for whatever reason it  
was not detected,'' the official said. He said the CIA was 
reviewing its published and clandestine sources of information to 
determine how the mistake was made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post today quoted a senior NATO official, not  
identified further, as saying ``the tragic and embarrassing truth 
is that our maps simply did not show the Chinese Embassy anywhere 
in that vicinity.'' The current embassy was opened three or four 
years ago and the old one was several miles away, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unusual for the CIA to be involved in target planning in  
the air campaign, the U.S. official noted. More often that is the 
responsibility of NATO, the U.S. European Command or the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese said three people, all journalists, were killed and  
20 wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials, led by President Clinton, have apologized to  
China for the error, and Defense Secretary William Cohen and CIA 
Director George Tenet acknowledged in a joint statement that the 
bombing resulted from faulty information. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Chinese government has refused to accept this  
explanation, and U.S. diplomatic missions in Beijing and other 
Chinese cities have been besieged by tens of thousands of angry 
demonstrators, some bused in by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstration is now exceeding government expectations  
and there is always the danger that it is going to go out of 
control,'' U.S. Ambassador Jim Sasser, who has been trapped inside 
the Beijing embassy, said in a telephone interview Sunday on NBC's 
``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening in Beijing and throughout China today is  
intentional,'' Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., told CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' ``This is, unfortunately, going to be a very serious test 
of our relationship, whether the Chinese exploit this terrible 
accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, appearing on ABC's  
``This Week'' and CNN's ``Late Edition,'' said the bombing could 
lead to a ``temporary setback'' in diplomatic efforts to end the 
military conflict in Yugoslavia. China, with a seat on the U.N. 
Security Council, holds a veto over any U.N. decisions about 
sending peacekeeping troops to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pickering said ``it doesn't seem to me in light of where the  
Chinese have been that they would veto a peace settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, China's ambassador to the United States, Li Zhaoxing,  
refused to accept NATO and U.S. explanations for the attack. Anyone 
who tries ``to whitewash the atrocity as a mistake, he's wrong,'' 
Li told ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's supreme allied commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,  
also on ABC, said officials had looked at the process leading to 
the error and ``we think it's an anomaly.'' He said NATO had 
conducted 18,000 sorties during the air campaign, with only eight 
to 10 instances of bombs mistakenly hitting civilians or otherwise 
going astray. ``This is truly an exceptional record,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees  
said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that the embassy bombing error showed 
that U.S. spending on intelligence has been stretched too thin. 
</P>
<P>
	When the intelligence community is being ``pushed as hard as  
we're being pushed right now to the point where we're even 
diverting assets to take care of this problem in Kosovo, mistakes 
are going to happen,'' Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., head of the House 
panel, said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Senate counterpart, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., agreed,  
saying: ``We've been doing defense, which intelligence is part and 
parcel of, on the cheap for about 13 straight years, and now you're 
seeing the fruits of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is seeking approximately $29 billion  
for intelligence programs in the 2000 budget, an increase of about 
9 percent. But critics point out that proposed boost follows years 
in which intelligence spending has declined.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The parents of a 2-year-old boy who died  
after being stung 400 times by yellow jackets were charged with 
aggravated child abuse for allegedly waiting more than seven hours 
to summon medical help.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Get Playoff Wakeup Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Their postseason debut was disappointing,  
and Milwaukee's Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson are ready to show 
they've learned the difference between the NBA's regular season and 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, it was a little more hype than what I thought it  
was,'' said Robinson, one of four Milwaukee starters in Sunday's 
110-88 loss to Indiana who were playing in their first playoff 
game. ``As a team, we didn't know the intensity level that you have 
to play in a playoff game. ... It was probably a wakeup call for 
us. ... We realize now how much intensity we have to play with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 in the best-of-5 series is Tuesday night before the teams  
move to Milwaukee for Game 3 on Thursday. Both teams practiced 
Monday, with Indiana working out at Market Square Arena and 
Milwaukee practicing at nearby Hinkle Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who averaged 29 points and 11 rebounds against Indiana  
in the three regular-season meetings this season, is still bothered 
by a deep knee bruise that kept him out of the last three regular 
season games. He had 16 points and seven rebounds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a big, strong team. They like to rebound and bang the  
boards,'' Robinson said. ``I wanted to let the game come to me. I'd 
been out like 10 days, missed three days. It was my first day back. 
... Now we're getting used to things, so everybody is on target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen led the Bucks with 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was our first playoff game and now we know what to  
expect. We had the intensity when we started, but we leveled off in 
the second quarter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson is just one of a lengthy list of Bucks battling  
physical problems. The group added a new name Sunday when rookie 
center Robert Traylor injured his wrist when he landed hard on the 
court after fouling Antonio Davis late in the second quarter. He 
returned in the third quarter and eventually fouled out in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big thing for us is having Ray off to a good start,''  
Traylor said. ``Tomorrow if we get other guys off into the flow of 
the game, we'll have some fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traylor was icing the wrist down after practice and anticipated  
playing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not bad at all. I'm just kind of taking it easy, getting  
ready for the next game,'' he said. ``Last night was our first time 
out. They've got all the playoff experience, but I think now that 
we've played one game, the next four games will show that we'll 
play hard and do all the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 1/2, 284-pound Traylor has the major assignment of  
muscling 7-4 Rik Smits underneath and denying him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my job. Once he gets the ball, he's tough to stop,''  
Traylor said. ``I just want to get it out of his hands and make him 
work for everything he gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smits scored eight points and took eight shots in 17 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of getting ball into the post,'' Smits said.  
``They do a good job pressuring the low post with fronting and ball 
pressure. We made some adjustments ... and hopefully use it 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee's starters outscored Indiana's starting five, but with  
Jalen Rose scoring a career playoff high 24 points, the Pacers' 
bench outscored Milwaukee's 55-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really have to concentrate more on is their second  
team,'' Milwaukee's Chris Gatling said. ``We can't have any mental 
breakdowns, and I think at times we had those. We have to make a 
conscious effort to shut those guys down and make the other guys 
beat us at the start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana will be going for its ninth consecutive victory over  
Milwaukee and its 10th straight home playoff victory in Game 2.

<HEADLINE> DEA Sets Up Addiction Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, who flock to museums by the  
millions, can add a unique site to their itinerary: a museum on 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drug Enforcement Administration has put together a public  
exhibit at its suburban Virginia headquarters, tracing addiction 
back to the Civil War and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	It shows off the Tommy gun and hand grenades that Narcotics  
Bureau agents carried in the 1930s. From the other side of the 
battle is the booby trap that an ingenious marijuana farmer in 
Thailand installed to protect his crop, and a trafficker's 
diamond-encrusted gun. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a coroner's report, almost a century old, on a  
19-month-old girl who died from an overdose of ``soothing syrup'' -- 
apparently laced with opium. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibits tell how drug-taking declined in the first half of the  
century until attention turned in the 1930s to the marijuana -- and 
later, heroin -- associated with such jazz figures as Red Rodney, 
Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	The addiction museum, in Arlington, Va., is the newest arrival  
among about 8,200 American museums, according to Edward H. Able 
Jr., head of the American Association of Museums. There may be even 
more if local history centers and such institutions as the Museum 
of Bagpipe Music in Ellicott City, Md., and the Cockroach Hall of 
Fame in Plano, Texas, are counted. 
</P>
<P>
	The association estimates that American museums and similar  
collections including zoos and aquariums clocked 865 million visits 
in 1997, up from about 565 million a decade ago. Some 337 million 
of those visits were to art museums, according to a recent survey 
financed by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the cheapest show in town,'' said Able.  
</P>
<P>
	The NEA counted more visits -- 376 million -- to historic parks  
than to art museums, but parks are generally free. Plays, operas, 
and dance programs taken together attracted 280 million, the survey 
found, counting only adults 18 or older. Fewer children are taken 
to those events than to museums. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, museums began making themselves more  
attractive by trying for realistic exhibits, such as replicas of 
colonial kitchens or aircraft assembly lines, with miniature or 
life-size dummies to enliven them. Staff members, volunteers and 
audio guides explain the labels, in addition to films, 
demonstrations, concerts and lectures. 
</P>
<P>
	That appeals to families.  
</P>
<P>
	``Where kids can grow up and adults don't have to,'' says a  
colorful poster of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, displayed 
at the museum association's Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's museums have taken a big part in the boom. They've  
sometimes been called youth museums, as emphasis has increased on 
keeping teen-agers out of trouble. The first, the Brooklyn 
Children's Museum, is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. 
About 250 have opened over the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Few children's museums are free. They have special expenses  
keeping youngsters busy with drawing, sculpting, cutting, pasting, 
acting in plays, taking bus trips and doing scientific experiments. 
But ticket prices are low -- half of them charge even adults $4 or 
less, the association says. 
</P>
<P>
	It reported that in 1997 nearly half of American museums -- 43.4  
percent -- charged no admission fees at all. In Washington, that 
includes the addiction museum, the National Gallery of Art, the 
National Zoo and 15 collections run by the Smithsonian Institution. 
More than half the American museums that charged fees also offered 
free days, and more than 90 percent of museums charged less than 
$10 admission. 
</P>
<P>
	Special ``blockbuster'' exhibits in the bigger museums are  
different. Scalpers asked as much as $50 each for the free tickets 
to the recent show of van Gogh paintings at the National Gallery. 
The current exhibit of Georgia O'Keeffe works at the private 
Phillips Collection here charges $12.50 for adults, with a $4.50 
fee added for tickets ordered by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advantages may begin to erode,'' the association's ``Museum  
News'' warned last year, ``when popular exhibits require advance 
ticketing at higher-than-normal prices and crowds are at or near 
capacity. Worrisome, too, is the possibility that the educational 
experience might suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westat Corp. of Rockville, Md., conducted the NEA survey in  
December 1998, interviewing 13,349 Americans aged 18 or older about 
where they went in 1997. The survey has a margin of error of less 
than plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: O.J. Will Keep His Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's lawyer says the ex-football  
star will keep custody of his children under an agreement with the 
parents of his slain ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have formalized a settlement. It just needs to be signed by  
everyone,'' attorney Bernard Leckie said Monday. ``It's in the best 
interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the 
courts any further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If formalized, the agreement would head off a second struggle  
over custody of Simpson's children, a trial which promised to 
revive the argument over whether Simpson killed his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Leckie said he drafted a settlement agreement which is in the  
hands of the Browns' lawyer awaiting signatures and then approval 
by the court commissioner handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home on Monday, Simpson refused to comment on the  
reported agreement. Calls to the Browns were unreturned and their 
lawyer could not be located. The lawyer representing the children 
also did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, Justin, 10 and Sydney, 13, live with Simpson and  
often visit their grandparents, Lou and Juditha Brown, who 
previously sued for their custody and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody  
case could go back to court for another trial because the original 
family law judge failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Mrs. 
Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted in criminal court but held liable for the  
deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldman's 
family $33.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's lawyer said he and the Browns are on good terms and  
the grandparents are taking an active role in the children's 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns and Simpson are getting along better now,'' the  
attorney said. ``They sit together at the children's athletic 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leckie said four mental health experts who were consulted in the  
case agreed it would be best for the children to stay with their 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``To litigate the matter doesn't make any sense,'' Leckie said.  
``From the standpoint of the children's welfare, it is best for the 
children to believe their father did not kill their mother.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Landslide Kills Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of people were relaxing and sunning  
themselves at one of Hawaii's most spectacular hiking spots when 
boulders the size of small cars suddenly rained down. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were killed and dozens injured in the Sunday  
landslide that let loose with all sizes of rocks at Sacred Falls 
State Park. A seventh person is missing and presumed dead, rescue 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were bodies everywhere,'' said David Pahk, 37, a  
volunteer with the Sacred Falls Assistance Program, which hands out 
bottled water and sunscreen to often-unprepared hikers. 
</P>
<P>
	He and a dozen others worked frantically to save the life of a  
young girl, carrying her out the trail on a stretcher and sharing 
CPR efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just died in our hands,'' he said. ``No one gave up hope.  
We fought for her all the way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers used heat-seeking cameras and military search  
dogs Monday, but did not find any more bodies underneath the tons 
of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers, who had to dodge falling debris as they looked,  
returned to the scene after one injured hiker said he did not know 
what happened to his girlfriend. The woman's sister and brother, 
who were also hiking, had not seen her either. Officials assumed 
she was buried under rocks or water. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of hikers were taking in the view and weather at a pool  
beneath the park's 90-foot falls when the landslide began 600 feet 
above them. Hikers and rescuers told harrowing stories about 
bringing victims out of the rubble. Many suffered head injuries and 
some lost limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	After flying over the area, state Department of Land and Natural  
Resources geologist Glenn Bauer said: ``It looks like the cliff 
face came away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four victims were female, and two were male, including Air Force  
Master Sgt. Scott Huling, who was stationed at Hickam Air Force 
Base. His age and hometown was not available. The victims also 
included a young girl from the family of an Air Force staff 
sergeant. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the injured remained hospitalized, including a  
2-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	State geologists said the valley on the northeast coast of the  
island of Oahu remained unstable, forcing the closure of the state 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	The park in the lushly forested Koolau Range is about 30 miles  
north of Honolulu. The falls spill into a pool, reachable by a 
2.2-mile trail, at the base of a 90-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unsafe for our rescue people or anybody to go up  
there,'' Honolulu Fire Chief Attilio Leonardi said Monday. ``When 
we went up this morning, debris was still falling down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our geologist says there are areas in there probably where  
more rubble will fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The park has long been known as one of Hawaii's most dangerous.  
Since 1970, more than a dozen people have died in flash floods or 
hiking accidents at the park.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Mull Palmer DL Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers will wait several days before  
deciding whether to place third baseman Dean Palmer on the disabled 
list with a broken right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was injured Sunday while fielding a hard smash from  
Baltimore's Albert Belle. The ball glanced off his hand, but he 
recovered in time and threw out Belle. Palmer remained in the game 
until the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays showed he sustained only a hairline fracture.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers were Monday and are off again Thursday and May 18.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has plenty of time to rest, so there's no need to rush  
it,'' general manager Randy Smith said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he talked to Palmer by phone on Monday and he was  
``upbeat and positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer joined Detroit this season after signing a $36 million,  
five-year contract as a free agent. He's batting .273 with five 
homers and 15 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> TuineiMay Have Used Heroin, Ecstasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McKINNEY, Texas (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys star Mark Tuinei  
went to an apartment to obtain heroin the night before he died and 
apparently used it as well as the drug Ecstasy, one of the team's 
players told police in a court document. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, which investigators filed to get a warrant to  
search Tuinei's house, contains information from Cowboys running 
back Nicky Sualua, who said he spent Wednesday evening with Tuinei 
in a Dallas apartment. Sualua said he and Tuinei went to the 
apartment to get the heroin and ``Mark went into the bedroom, and 
he said, `Here it is.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mark came back to the living room, he looked as if he was  
passing out. Nicky advised (that) Mark started having problems and 
stopped breathing,'' the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua said Tuinei was alive when he dragged the 6-foot-5,  
320-pound ex-offensive lineman from the apartment to his car. 
Sualua then drove to Tuinei's house in Plano, suburban Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sualua got two blankets from the house and slept in the car with  
Tuinei until about 5:30 a.m. Thursday, he told police. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Nicky woke up, Mark was not breathing,'' the document  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 911 tape released Friday, a man identified as ``Nicky''  
told the dispatcher that his friend had stopped breathing. ``I 
can't feel a pulse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Tuinei was pronounced dead at the hospital. The  
preliminary autopsy report was inconclusive and further toxicology 
tests were expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas police said Monday that since Thursday, they have  
arrested three people at the apartment on various charges, ranging 
from heroin possession to public intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's death and Sualua's report of drug use were just the  
latest blows to the Cowboys, whose image has been tarnished by a 
series of court cases and off-the-field problems in the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to heroin, Sualua said Tuinei had used Ecstasy, a  
hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the stimulant amphetamine, 
at Tuinei's house earlier Wednesday evening, according to the 
document filed with Collin County Court-at-Law Judge Mark Rusch, 
who issued the search warrant. McKinney is the Collin County seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Police seized marijuana pipes, a marijuana cigarette, a white  
tablet, a cell phone and papers with phone numbers from Tuinei's 
house, according to an inventory attached to the affidavit, details 
of which were first reported by TV station KDFW. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sought a search warrant because Tuinei's wife, Pono, was  
in their home state of Hawaii. The couple planned to move there so 
Tuinei could be an assistant football coach at his old high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei played 15 seasons for the Cowboys before retiring in 1998  
and was a key player on three Super Bowl championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple and NFL spokesman Greg Aiello  
declined to comment on Sualua's situation. Under NFL rules, players 
involved in drug-related violations of the law can be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei was arrested a number of times in college for drunken  
brawling and he admitted to mixing alcohol with marijuana when he 
was young. In 1993, he told The Dallas Morning News that he could 
not say he had turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day-to-day, year-to-year battle,'' he said. ``I know  
that I'm always going to run into trouble of some kind. I just need 
to make sure I handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other cases that have tarnished the Cowboys' image,  
All-Pro receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the NFL in 1996 
after a cocaine charge, and then-coach Barry Switzer was arrested 
in 1997 for taking a gun to Dallas-Fort Worth International 
Airport. In between, several other Cowboys faced drug- or 
alcohol-related league suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there was a mysterious training-camp scuffle in which  
lineman Everett McIver was stabbed in the neck with scissors by 
another player, reportedly Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Pro Bowl defensive tackle Leon Lett has failed an NFL drug  
test for the third time, league sources said. The violation could 
carry a lifetime ban.

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Violence Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton intends to avoid making the  
gun and entertainment industries scapegoats for youth violence at a 
White House brainstorming session, aides say, but both complain 
they've already been targeted for blame. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton summoned young people, parents, religious leaders and  
representatives of the two industries to talk today about the root 
causes of violence that repeatedly erupts in the nation's schools, 
most recently and most deadly in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, uncompromising critic of gun  
control laws, was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials hope the session -- which was drawing about  
50 participants ranging from America Online's chief executive to 
poet Maya Angelou -- will provide the groundwork for a national 
campaign on reducing youth violence, much like similar campaigns to 
curb teen-age pregnancy and to find jobs for former welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's time for all sectors of society to step up to  
the plate and take responsibility,'' said Clinton domestic policy 
adviser Bruce Reed. ``We're not interested in pointing fingers. We 
want to find solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But gun advocates and participants from the entertainment  
industry say they are feeling more pressure than most, because of 
the newly intensified debate over the availability of weapons and 
whether violence among teen-agers is fomented by the images and 
language in movies, video games and song lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of two gun-manufacturing groups -- the National Shooting  
Sports Foundation and the American Shooting Sports Council -- met 
with Reed last week on Clinton's anti-violence plan and planned to 
attend today's gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	They left open the possibility of endorsing some of the  
administration's proposals to keep guns out of the hands of young 
people, although they said they wanted to see the details first. 
One measure would raise the age at which a person can buy a handgun 
from 18 to 21. Another would hold parents criminally responsible 
for making guns accessible to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said the White House would work with the groups to find  
common ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, meanwhile, called a news conference today to unveil its  
own proposals to make ``an immediate and significant impact'' on 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said Clinton  
administration officials should resist a knee-jerk urge to explore 
more restrictive gun laws and instead push for better enforcement 
of those already on the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have presided over a complete and total collapse of  
prosecution of laws,'' LaPierre said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' ``We have mandatory sentences for felons caught with guns. 
We have mandatory sentences for people carrying guns and selling 
drugs in the street. We don't enforce any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of  
America, said the film industry shouldn't be singled out for blame. 
He said he supports having the U.S. surgeon general do an in-depth 
analysis of ``the why of violence'' to better understand all of the 
factors at play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe that church and home and school are the three  
places where children learn what is right and what is wrong, and 
that's where they build a strong moral shield,'' Valenti said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Valenti, entertainment industry representatives expected  
at today's meeting were the heads of the Recording Industry 
Association of America, the National Association of Broadcasters, 
the National Cable Television Association and the Interactive 
Digital Software Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer, a candidate for the Republican  
presidential nomination, said the issue revolves more around the 
ability to teach values in school than on the images presented to 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the two student gunmen in Littleton who shot 12  
classmates and a teacher to death before killing themselves ``came 
to school giving the Nazi salute, produced a video showing them 
killing other students'' and posted an Internet ``Web site dripping 
with hate,'' but somehow managed to evade the scrutiny of school 
officials and other adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's at the heart of this issue, and basically not Hollywood  
and not guns,'' Bauer said. ``Eighteen gun laws were violated that 
day in Littleton, Colorado. I don't think anyone believes a 19th or 
20th is going to stop the tragedies that we are seeing.''

<HEADLINE>  Jagr Works To Regain Scoring Touch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The playoffs clearly have hit a critical stage  
for the Pittsburgh Penguins -- even Jaromir Jagr senses the need to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr did not skate Monday during the Penguins' optional off-day  
practice for Tuesday night's Game 3 against the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, but did put on his practice gear to work on restoring his 
shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr has rested on off days since straining a groin muscle  
during the first game of the New Jersey series, and the NHL scoring 
champion said the practice layoff has affected his shooting, 
judgment and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	His statistics, too: He has no goals and only one assist in two  
games despite taking his regular shifts against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the puck in the slot and I don't know whether to shoot  
or pass,'' Jagr said. ``The confidence isn't there. You get 
confidence in practice, but I haven't been practicing. I'm taking 
that extra second to shoot it. I've got to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr realizes the Penguins must be accurate on their scoring  
opportunities because Maple Leafs goaltender Curtis Joseph is 
playing so well, allowing only 12 goals in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph turned aside 25 of 27 shots as Toronto evened the series  
by winning 4-2 Sunday in Toronto. Just as important for the Maple 
Leafs, Mats Sundin came out of a slump with two goals and two 
assists and Lonny Bohonos scored the first goal in his first NHL 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave us our confidence back, especially knowing that Tom  
Barrasso had shut us out (2-0) in Game 1,'' the Maple Leafs' Steve 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins need Jagr to do the same, but the groin injury has  
stripped him of his ability to dominate games with his skating, 
stickhandling and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's tough for me is I can't use my speed,'' he said. ``All  
I can use is my hands. I can't challenge one on one and that's the 
worst thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr needs to take off several days to let the groin injury heal  
properly, but that's not possible while playing every other day. 
Yet the longer the injury persists, the more it affects his play. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring two goals in the Penguins' momentum-swinging  
victory in Game 6 against New Jersey and setting up two goals in 
Game 7, he is 0-for-6 shooting in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Kevin Constantine said Jagr is capable of helping  
the Penguins even at 60 to 70 percent efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a positive to us if he were breathing,'' he said.  
``He's just a talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a competitive person who wants to help. He puts aside the  
pain and plays. The possibility of him doing something is strong, 
whether he's injured or not. He feels he will do something along 
the way that will help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr plans to keep playing unless he aggravates the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to improve day by day, but I can't pull it  
or make it worse,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs haven't resorted to hooking or whacking Jagr's  
injured right leg, as the Devils did in a seemingly blatant attempt 
to reinjure him after Jagr returned in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto hasn't done that yet, but don't tell them that,'' Jagr  
said, laughing.

I can use is my hands. I can't challenge one on one and that's the 
worst thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr needs to take off several days to let the groin injury heal  
properly, but that's not possible while playing every other day. 
Yet the longer the injury persists, the more it affects his play. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring two goals in the Penguins' momentum-swinging  
victory in Game 6 against New Jersey and setting up two goals in 
Game 7, he is 0-for-6 shooting in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Kevin Constantine said Jagr is capable of helping  
the Penguins even at 60 to 70 percent efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a positive to us if he were breathing,'' he said.  
``He's just a talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a competitive person who wants to help. He puts aside the  
pain and plays. The possibility of him doing something is strong, 
whether he's injured or not. He feels he will do something along 
the way that will help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr plans to keep playing unless he aggravates the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to improve day by day, but I can't pull it  
or make it worse,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs haven't resorted to hooking or whacking Jagr's  
injured right leg, as the Devils did in a seemingly blatant attempt 
to reinjure him after Jagr returned in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto hasn't done that yet, but don't tell them that,'' Jagr  
said, laughing.

<HEADLINE> `The Mummy' Takes In $44 Million / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Mummy'' burst into North American  
theaters with a record $43.4 million box office take, the largest 
nonsummer opening in movie history and ninth among the top 10 
all-time opening weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the Universal Pictures remake of the 1932 Boris  
Karloff classic even caught studio executives by surprise. 
Universal Studios president Ron Meyer had expected something around 
$30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Brendan Fraser and packed with special effects, ``The  
Mummy'' opening was Universal's third biggest after ``The Lost 
World: Jurrasic Park'' ($90.2 million) and ``Jurassic Park'' ($47 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	Universal chose to brave the heavily-hyped May 19 release of  
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' by positioning ``The 
Mummy'' in the same slot that proved so successful last year for 
``Deep Impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nikki Rocco, Universal president of distribution, said the  
decision was made ``in order to stake our claim for what we knew 
would be the first big event movie for the summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sean Connery adventure ``Entrapment'' dropped to No. 2 with  
a $12.3 million gross in its second week of release. It's earned 
nearly $40 million so far. The Keanu Reeves movie ``The Matrix'' 
was third with $5.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reese Witherspoon-Matthew Broderick satire ``Election''  
opened in wide release to place fourth with $3.2 million, ``Never 
Been Kissed'' was fifth with $3 million and ``Analyze This'' was 
sixth with $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robert DeNiro-Billy Crystal comedy also crossed the $100  
million barrier after 10 weeks of release.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Fired for Cancer Tale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A reporter at a rural Kentucky newspaper  
who wrote moving stories about her battle with cancer was fired 
Monday after admitting she didn't have the disease at all, but 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Stacy, 33, said she lied because of the stigma attached to  
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in a small-town atmosphere where you are crucified  
for having AIDS or being gay,'' Ms. Stacy, who is a lesbian, said 
in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few weeks, she had told readers of the Owensboro  
Messenger-Inquirer that she had brain cancer and had less than a 
year to live. 
</P>
<P>
	She admitted the fabrications after the publisher at another  
paper for which she once worked confronted her with his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly sorry. I didn't think about what I was doing,''  
she said in the interview. ``I betrayed a lot of people and misled 
a lot of people including my own friends and family. Nobody knew 
until this weekend that I have AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Bob Ashley of the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer said Ms.  
Stacy was fired Monday for fabricating the stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she actually had resigned during a series of  
telephone calls over the weekend. The newspaper said she indicated 
to a supervisor that she would resign on Monday but never submitted 
a resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will write a news story and apologize to readers for  
misleading them,'' said publisher Ed Riney. ``We do have compassion 
for the situation she is experiencing, but we can't countenance 
misleading our readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The editors of the newspaper had asked Ms. Stacy to write the  
columns. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of a series of occasional columns during recent weeks,  
Ms. Stacy wrote: ``I'm going to die! I'm going to die! The words 
echoed through my mind, numbing me, and at the same time, causing 
me pain and sadness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have terminal brain cancer. I was told I had about 10 months  
to a year to live,'' she said in one of the columns, which was 
distributed in Kentucky by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said Monday, she has been treated off and on for  
AIDS for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy started her newspaper career several years ago at the  
tri-weekly Pikeville (Ky.) Appalachian News-Express. 
</P>
<P>
	News-Express publisher Marty Backus said that three of his  
staffers who were close friends with Ms. Stacy ``got suspicious 
about some things she was writing in the columns -- things that just 
didn't ring the right-sounding bell.'' The newspaper had agreed to 
publish Ms. Stacy's columns written for the Owensboro paper. 
</P>
<P>
	After investigating, Backus concluded that the latest column  
should be pulled, and he notified the Owensboro paper.

<HEADLINE> Small Group Embraces the Typewriter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A familiar face comes through the door, and Mary  
Adelman says hello to him. The white-bearded author has come to 
Osner Business Machines to buy a typewriter ribbon -- and to make a 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I discover I use the typewriter less and less,'' says a  
slightly embarrassed Herbert Gans, who wrote seven of his 10 books 
on a manual machine before going high-tech 10 years ago. ``The 
computer is taking over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Columbia University sociologist shrugs and surrenders $6.41  
for his ribbon. Mrs. Adelman smiles as he leaves. Gans hasn't fully 
abandoned his typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
	Not yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Hard drives. Megabytes. Web sites. The Internet. With each  
passing day, the typewriter evolves into Tyrannosaurus Next -- a 
dinosaur sinking in a tar pit of black ink. 
</P>
<P>
	The big typewriter manufacturers are memories now: Underwood,  
Royal, Remington. IBM left the business eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Adelman and others refuse to accept the typewriter's  
seemingly inevitable fate: extinction. Her tiny shop, tucked amid 
the yuppiedom of Manhattan's Upper West Side, is a cramped Jurassic 
Park for geriatric typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
	Osner dates back to the days when typewriters ruled the earth --  
or at least to 1941, when the business opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say typewriters are disappearing -- they're not  
actually disappearing,'' Mrs. Adelman gently asserts. ``It's just 
less use of the typewriter as a writing instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are buying typewriters to display. We sell a lot for  
props, too -- plays, theater, commercials. And some people are 
coming back to the typewriter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Adelman is not alone; the typewriter lobby is dwindling,  
but it remains notable for its loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes Tom Wolfe, author of ``The Right Stuff'' and ``The  
Bonfire of the Vanities.'' His most recent novel, the 727-page ``A 
Man in Full,'' was written and rewritten -- as were his previous 
best sellers -- on a vintage typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old model, which predates both of Wolfe's children,  
resides with them in the family's posh East Side home. It vacations 
across Central Park at Osner's, where the machine is meticulously 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	In the basement, beneath Mrs. Adelman's counter, the machines  
are broken down, cleaned and oiled. Upstairs, on wooden 
workbenches, two veteran repairmen with the touch of surgeons work 
the machines back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are stunning: A 1920 Underwood, recently  
refurbished, sits gleaming on a shelf, the store's dim light 
reflecting off its burnished silver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a work of art,'' Mrs. Adelman says proudly.  
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe is among the great typewriter traditionalists. He  
disdainfully recounts his single failed venture into the world of 
word processors. 
</P>
<P>
	What he intended was a single word: ``this.''  
</P>
<P>
	What his fingers wrought, instead, appeared quite differently:  
``tttttttthhhhiiiisssss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bye-bye, word processor.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a typewriter touch, not a computer touch,'' he says. ``I  
have a very fast typewriter, a 1966 Underwood -- like a 1958 
Thunderbird. It's very hard to find parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Except at Osner's. The basement is filled with the corpses of  
ancient typewriters, machines now cannibalized for parts. Regular 
customers -- a group that also includes playwright David Mamet -- 
often hunt down old machines and bring them to the shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a morning cup of tea, Mrs. Adelman will patiently explain  
the typewriter's enduring allure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Firstly, it doesn't hiss at you,'' she says in a soft voice  
that still carries a hint of her native London. ``It's quiet. It 
doesn't say anything until you put your hands on it and make it -- 
click! -- go along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, but the typewriter isn't winning many ribbons lately.  
These days, it's even taking friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Writers Rooms in Greenwich Village, once a haven for the  
hunt-and-peck crowd, a recent uprising pitted the cutting edge 
against the old guard. A new generation of writers, accustomed to 
their computers, found the typewriter rattle distracting. 
</P>
<P>
	This fell into the category of what goes around comes around;  
the typists were annoyed years ago by the beeping sounds when the 
first computers arrived at the 21-year-old writers' sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Public Library's Frederick Lewis Allen Room,  
another outpost for aspiring authors, was ``typewriters only'' just 
14 years ago. Today, not a single typewriter is in use, according 
to Jennifer Bertrand, a library spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are one or two stashed away,'' she says, ``but it  
doesn't appear anyone is using them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mention of the typewriters in the library causes her to laugh a  
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Reading Room in the library's main branch at 42nd Street  
and Fifth Avenue, visitors can plug in their laptops while doing 
research -- 30 tables that accommodate 16 laptops apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the typewriter of today,'' she suggests.  
</P>
<P>
	It's just not the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Breslin, author of several books including ``Damon  
Runyon'' and ``I Want to Thank My Brain for Remembering Me: A 
Memoir,'' says a floppy disk doesn't give a writer that feeling of 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the charm is out of it,'' he complained in an interview  
last year. ``Maybe it's more reliable, I don't know. Maybe it's 
quicker. Sometimes, you know, I just want to hold the finished 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Adelman understands.  
</P>
<P>
	She's now reflecting on some of the typewriter's other charms:  
They never crash. They never run out of memory. And all a typist 
needs to know about Y2K is to push the shift key on the first and 
last letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sold a typewriter just last week to a gentleman,'' Mrs.  
Adelman confides. ``His computer is OK, but he wants to have a 
manual typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just in case.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Jury Sides With Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Three of the nation's largest tobacco  
companies were cleared of liability Monday in the deaths of three 
smokers whose families claimed the companies and their cigarettes 
were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shelby County Circuit Court jury returned its verdict during  
the fourth day of deliberations in the case against Philip Morris 
Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	James Johnson, a lawyer for R.J. Reynolds, said he was pleased  
that after four months of testimony the jury ``conscientiously 
applied the law to (the) evidence and determined that somebody who 
smokes, and being fully aware of the risks of smoking, ought not 
collect money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That argument resonated with juror Carrie Jester.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like alcoholism. We know it's bad for you, but we  
make a decision to drink,'' Jester said after the verdict was 
returned. ``It's the same with smoking. We know it's bad for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Bobby Newcomb, a retired  
trucker who died last year at 64; Florence Bruch, a 63-year-old 
homemaker who died in 1996; and James Karney, a retired trucker who 
was 71 when he died in 1996. All were from Memphis and had lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The smokers' families claimed the companies knowingly sold a  
dangerous product and tried to cover up the risks. They were 
seeking more than $431,000 for medical bills and unspecified 
punitive damages that could have reached into the millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In similar cases this year a San Francisco woman with inoperable  
lung cancer was awarded $26.5 million and the family of a Portland, 
Ore., man who died of lung cancer was awarded $81 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Johnson Jr., a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expressed  
disappointment but vowed to continue taking the tobacco companies 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one case, this is one verdict and we'll be back  
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments last week, plaintiffs' lawyers said that  
for years the tobacco companies knew about the health risks of 
cigarettes but covered them up to get more people to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the tobacco companies rejected claims the  
companies sought to dupe customers. People who smoke do so with 
full knowledge of the potential health risks, they said.

<HEADLINE> Unreleased Beatle Song Due This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A previously unreleased single by the Beatles will  
be put out later this year, along with refurbished versions of the 
``Yellow Submarine'' soundtrack and movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The single is about three minutes long and features all four  
Beatles singing, said Geoff Baker, a spokesman for Paul McCartney 
and Apple Records. He wouldn't disclose other details about the 
song Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 87-minute movie ``Yellow Submarine,'' first released in  
1968, is being restored and given a remixed soundtrack, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The album had six songs by the Beatles and seven instrumental  
tracks from the film score by George Martin, the group's producer. 
The remixed version will drop the instrumentals and replace them 
with previously released Beatles tracks, Baker said.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones: It Wasn't Our Fault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Talk show host Jenny Jones said she regrets the  
shooting death of a guest after he appeared on her show but does 
not agree with a jury's decision that held the program responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very regretful. I'm very sorry that Scott (Amedure)  
lost his life,'' Ms. Jones said on ``Dateline NBC'' Sunday. ``I 
think it's an awful, awful tragedy. I really don't think we can be 
held responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, was shot to death in 1995, three days after he  
admitted on a taping of ``The Jenny Jones Show,'' that he was 
attracted to Jonathan Schmitz, who had agreed to appear to meet his 
secret admirer. 
</P>
<P>
	An Oakland County jury last week ordered the show and its  
corporate owner, Warner Bros., to pay Amedure's relatives $25 
million. Lawyers for the show have said they will appeal the damage 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she did some ``soul searching'' after the  
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course after this happened we went back. I thought back  
about the show and we all, you know, we all talked about it. We 
then and now still feel we did nothing wrong,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said she might have felt guilty if the two had been  
introduced on the show, but they had met beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because they knew each other, that's why I keep saying that  
with or without the show, the same relationship could have 
developed,'' she said, adding that the show's content is protected 
by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	On ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today, Ms. Jones said the  
trial would not prompt any changes in her show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need a verdict to make us be responsible. We are  
responsible,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the March 6, 1995 taping, Schmitz was kept offstage while  
Amedure declared his attraction to him and described a sexual 
fantasy involving Schmitz. Brought on-stage and told his secret 
admirer was Amedure, Schmitz smiled, covered his face with his 
hands and told Amedure that he wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Schmitz, then 24, bought a shotgun and shells,  
drove to Amedure's mobile home in Orion Township and shot him to 
death. His lawyers admitted he killed Amedure but contended the 
show humiliated Schmitz and he was fighting alcoholism, depression 
and a thyroid condition. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1996 conviction on second-degree murder charges was thrown  
out on a technicality. His retrial is set for this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the civil trial, lawyers for Amedure's family argued that the  
show ``lit the fuse'' leading to his death by first deceiving, then 
embarrassing an already disturbed Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said the show staffers made it clear to Schmitz that  
his secret admirer could be a man or woman, and that it had no way 
of knowing about Schmitz's past suicide attempts or struggles 
against alcoholism.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- There were 43 of them, mostly elderly women  
from swampy small towns west of New Orleans, and they were making 
another of their occasional getaways to a Mississippi casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Few ever won any money, but they liked to get out for a while,  
to socialize and play bingo during the 1 1/2-hour bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday -- Mother's Day -- their chartered bus picked them up in  
a supermarket parking lot. A half-hour later, just as the bingo 
cards were being passed out, the bus suddenly lurched. It careened 
off Interstate 610, crashed through a guardrail and nose-dived into 
an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It veered to one side and they all hollered, `It's going to  
crash!''' said George Tassin, whose wife and grown daughter were on 
the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash killed 22 people; 15 people were still hospitalized  
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen federal investigators were at the scene Monday. The bus  
driver and a witness said a car cut the bus off right before the 
crash, but the investigators said they probably would not determine 
the cause for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the victims were in their 70s and 80s. Two were over 90.  
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Marse, 73, and her husband, Arto, 74, made the casino  
trip about once a month from a small town called Reserve, said 
Nancy Desselle, their daughter. They hardly ever won more than $10, 
but they loved getting together with other elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would play games on the bus,'' Ms. Desselle said.  
``Sometimes it was the same crowd, sometimes it was new people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some friends and relatives of the victims gathered at a hastily  
arranged memorial service in the Place Dubourg retirement home in 
LaPlace, a town of 25,000 about 25 miles west of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight residents from the home were killed on the bus. Among the  
injured was Barbara Gibson, 62, who had moved into Place Dubourg 
only a month ago and was looking forward to taking a trip with the 
gambling group. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was just getting to know the people in the apartment  
complex,'' said her niece Donna Busby. ``She was so excited about 
it, and couldn't wait to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both of Mrs. Gibson's legs and arms were broken, her pelvis and  
right ankle were crushed, and her face was cut all over. ``But 
she's going to make it,'' said her daughter, Brenda Samrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, Frank Bedell, and at least one witness said the  
bus went out of control after a compact car cut it off on a stretch 
of highway that passes through the largest park in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation  
Safety Board, said the NTSB would interview witnesses, examine the 
bus for possible mechanical problems and look into Bedell's medical 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, who suffered a fractured pelvis and was undergoing  
surgery Monday, drove a municipal bus in New Orleans for 17 years 
before taking a job with Custom Bus Charters about three years ago, 
said his mother, Evelyn Bedell. 
</P>
<P>
	Place Dubourg resident Isabel Dutreix recalled how one of the  
victims, her friend Dorothy Richard, 74, used to bring her pudding 
and a newspaper every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dutreix doesn't go on casino trips, but she and Miss  
Richard often played bingo together and would talk about splitting 
their jackpots if either won. Mrs. Dutreix couldn't wait to see 
Miss Richard on Sunday because she had such good news: She had won 
at bingo on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I would see her and I would share it with her,''  
Mrs. Dutreix said, her voice trailing off.

<HEADLINE> Victims Had Passion for Sky Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEZUMA, Ohio (AP) -- They came from all walks of life. There  
were two engineers, a factory worker, a truck driver, and the owner 
of a construction company. But on weekends they pursued the passion 
that brought them together -- sky diving. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, their single-engine Cessna crashed in a  
farmer's field shortly after takeoff in this western Ohio 
community, ending their lives and the life of their pilot. The 
plane apparently had engine trouble but the cause of the crash 
remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were pilot Preston Parrish II, of Tipp City and  
passengers Jack Haenichen, 31, of Ottawa, Ohio; John Hoover, 43, 
Michelle Korsen, 43, and Arron Schroeder, 30, of Fort Wayne, Ind.; 
and Keith Edwards, 40, of Marion, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the passengers were sky divers and members of Grand Lake  
Skydiving, a 10-year-old operation with about 35 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were here all the time, every weekend,'' club owner  
Robert Tangeman said Monday. ``They were regulars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said each of the sky divers was well qualified, the  
least experienced of whom had probably jumped 250 times. One was an 
instructor and three were jumpmasters, who helped students jump for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that if he could have chosen how his life was going to  
end, it would have been sky diving,'' Edwards' wife, Michele, told 
the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoover's passion for sky diving began on his 38th birthday, when  
his wife, Arlene, paid for his first jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived for the weekends so he could sky dive,'' Hoover's  
sister-in-law, Rena Emery, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangeman said he bought the plane five years ago and installed a  
new engine in July. He said he had had no problems with the plane 
and there was no sign of any trouble Sunday. ``It sounded good. 
Just like it always did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash has had an impact on Tangeman, who has made 3,697  
jumps in the past 37 years. ``I may not go up anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montezuma is about 25 miles southwest of Lima.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Ask U.N. To End Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- As NATO missiles and bombs  
continue to pound Yugoslavia, Belgrade today accused the alliance 
of genocide and appealed to the United Nations' highest court to 
halt the punishing airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In two days of hearings starting today, Yugoslavia and the 10  
NATO allies involved in the bombing will fight a complex legal 
battle in the World Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acts of bombing of the territory of Yugoslavia are not  
just illegal acts,'' Yugoslav representative Rodoljub Etinski told 
the court. ``They constitute a crime against peace and also the 
crime of genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etinski insisted that Yugoslavia's crackdown in Kosovo was aimed  
at suppressing terrorism and that the allies had no right to 
intervene in an internal conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case before you is clear,'' he said, wrapping up the  
Yugoslav case. ``Stop the killing, save lives of all Yugoslav 
citizens, Serbs and Albanians, civilians and soldiers. Save the 
whole nation and all its communities. Don't be late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,  
is expected to rule within weeks on Yugoslavia's request for an 
order to stop the bombing while the court considers its main case. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia has argued that NATO broke international law when it  
resorted to force in an attempt to end fighting in Kosovo. A ruling 
on the main suit could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia accused the allies of genocide against the Yugoslav  
people, claiming NATO is endangering the entire population with 
pollution caused by attacks on oil refineries and chemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Etinski also claimed NATO is using internationally banned  
weapons -- cluster bombs and bombs containing depleted uranium -- and 
is arming and training a terrorist group -- the Kosovo Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``By killing people, by murdering children ... by destroying a  
whole nation, they want to protect a part of that population, one 
of its numerous ethnic minorities,'' Etinski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the court does tell NATO to stop bombing, there's no  
guarantee the alliance will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	If the alliance ignores a court order to stop, Belgrade can only  
report it to the U.N. Security Council -- a body dominated by NATO 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts do not believe the 15-judge court will go as far as  
explicitly ordering a halt to the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the court will call upon all the states to abide by  
international law,'' said Andre Nollkaemper, a professor of 
international law at Amsterdam University. ``It's clear that NATO 
is on very difficult legal ground when it comes to justifying its 
airstrikes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will present its case Tuesday. Yugoslav  
representatives had two hours to present their case today. Each 
NATO member will be given one hour to argue its side. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Washington's message would be simple: ``The bottom line is we 
don't think the court should indicate provisional measures (to stop 
the bombing).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other NATO members are expected to say the same.  
</P>
<P>
	When NATO began airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March 24 in an  
effort to stop Belgrade's purge of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, it 
did so without waiting for a Security Council resolution granting 
it the right to use force. That has led many international law 
experts to question the legality of NATO's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that this is legally very difficult to justify, it is a  
clever move by Belgrade to bring this into the spotlight,'' 
Nollkaemper said.

<HEADLINE>  China Breaks Off Arms Talks With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China broke off talks on human rights and arms  
control with the United States today, and waves of demonstrators 
hurled stones at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for a third day to 
protest NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also demanded that U.S. officials apologize for  
the NATO bombing, investigate the attack and punish those 
responsible. Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan issued the demands to 
U.S. Ambassador James Sasser, the state-run Xinhua News Agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasser and other American officials remained trapped today  
inside the U.S. Embassy compound, which was surrounded by hundreds 
of police in riot helmets and thousands of Chinese demonstrators. 
The protesters shouted, waved banners and threw stones in a repeat 
of Sunday's violent protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of halting the violence, police orchestrated the  
protest, directing the demonstrators past the U.S. and British 
embassies. Police also blocked nearby streets and ordered foreign 
reporters away from corners where they could see the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many protesters were students, but others came in busloads of  
organized groups from companies. About 1,000 marched under a banner 
from government-owned China Aerospace Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests were the biggest in Beijing since the Tiananmen  
Square pro-democracy demonstrations 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are essentially hostages of the embassy at the present time  
now. We've been here 48 hours without being able to leave,'' Sasser 
told AP Network News by telephone Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. diplomats left an office building about three blocks  
away during a lull today and returned to their homes in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	China suspended diplomatic relations regarding human rights,  
arms control and international security, Xinhua said, citing 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension affected areas of key interest to the United  
States, including concerns that China has provided nuclear weapons 
or missile technology to Pakistan, Iran or other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In its demands, China called for an ``open and official''  
apology to the Chinese government, its people and the relatives of 
the three reporters killed in the attack in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials, led by President Clinton, have apologized to  
China for the error, and Defense Secretary William Cohen and CIA 
Director George Tenet have said the bombing resulted from faulty 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department issued an advisory today warning  
Americans to postpone travel to China ``until the situation 
stabilizes.'' It said those in the country should avoid crowds and 
stay close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Official travel by U.S. government employees to China has been  
suspended and those working in the country have been told to stay 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced that he will  
shorten his first official visit to China, which begins Wednesday, 
while Russia's top envoy for Kosovo, Viktor Chernomyrdin, was 
flying to Beijing today to discuss the crisis over Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese people have flown into furies'' over the attack on  
the Belgrade embassy, said the People's Daily, the main paper of 
the ruling Communist Party. Monday's commentary showed that the 
government has refused to accept the explanation by NATO and the 
United States that the bombing was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody thinks he can intimidate the Chinese through the  
use of force, he will find himself completely wrong,'' the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people, all reported to be Chinese journalists, were  
killed in the bombing in Belgrade late Friday. More than 20 were 
injured, six seriously, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters were furious at what they saw as a deliberate attack  
on China. State-run media have not reported U.S. or NATO claims 
that it was an accident or their expressions of deep regret. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither have Chinese media reported the Serb attacks on ethnic  
Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo that NATO airstrikes 
were intended to stop. China has accused NATO of creating the 
refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 students from Politics and Law University in Beijing  
marched past the U.S. embassy Sunday, chanting ``a debt in blood 
must be repaid in blood!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators also attacked the British and Albanian embassies  
on Sunday and held protests outside U.S. consulates in Shanghai, 
Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Chengdu and in at least 16 other Chinese 
cities, state media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Consulate in the western city of Chengdu was damaged by  
fire Saturday after a break-in by protesters, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Shanghai, police acting on a bomb threat evacuated an office  
building today that houses foreign companies. A bomb squad with 
dogs was sent in. The manager of the Dongyi Building said they 
found nothing, and tenants were allowed back in after three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, thousands of people flowed past the main U.S. Embassy  
buildings in Beijing, smashing its windows with rocks and 
splattering its walls with paint. The Chinese government put the 
number of demonstrators at 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials protested to the Chinese government that embassy  
security was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao appealed for restraint in a  
nationwide television broadcast Sunday evening. He said the 
government supports ``legal protest activities'' but warned people 
to be vigilant against troublemakers.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Will Keep His Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson will keep custody of his two  
young children in a settlement with the parents of his slain 
ex-wife, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which still requires the signatures of Lou and  
Juditha Brown, heads off a second trial over the custody of 
13-year-old Sydney and Justin, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the best interest of the children that this not be  
dragged out through the courts any further,'' said Simpson attorney 
Bernard Leckie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have long fought Simpson over custody of the  
children, but Leckie said Simpson is now on good terms with his 
children's grandparents and they're closely involved in their 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Browns and Simpson are getting along better now,'' Leckie  
said. ``They sit together at the children's athletic events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at home Monday, Simpson refused to comment. Calls to the  
Browns were unreturned and their lawyer could not be located. The 
lawyer representing the children also did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody  
case could go back to court for a second trial because a judge had 
failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Simpson's former 
wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted in criminal court but held liable for the  
deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldman's 
family $33.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The custody agreement comes nearly five years after Ms. Simpson  
and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson spent a year in jail before he was acquitted. During  
that year, the Browns had custody of the two children. When Simpson 
was freed the children moved in with him but the Browns decided to 
sue for permanent custody. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge awarded custody to Simpson in 1996, but the Browns  
appealed the decision.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Holdings To Buy Republic Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- HSBC Holdings PLC will boost its stake in the  
high-margin business of catering to rich depositors with the $10.3 
billion purchase of the company that controls Republic National 
Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC, which already controls Marine Midland Bank in the United  
States, will double the size of its private banking portfolio under 
the $72-a-share deal announced Monday. At the same time, it will 
increase its share of the American commercial banking market, 
operating the third-largest branch network in New York state. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase includes Republic New York Corp. and its sister  
company, Safra Republic Holdings SA. Safra is the holding company 
for banks in Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Gibraltar, Monaco and 
Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Baker of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson described the deal as a  
sensible, ``low risk'' acquisition for HSBC, which also controls 
the No. 1 bank in Hong Kong -- Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. -- 
and Midland Bank, the fourth-largest in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good deal. I don't think they're overpaying,'' said  
Hugh Pye, an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic National Bank and Marine Midland make a good fit, and  
consolidation of their back-office operations should yield cost 
savings, Pye said. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based HSBC said it expects the acquisitions to lead to  
annual savings of $300 million within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisitions will add 30,000 private banking clients with  
total funds of $56.5 billion. Private banking is individualized 
banking for wealthy investors, a profitable business in which 
Republic is seen to have a strong market niche. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC Group chairman John Bond said the acquisitions reflect the  
company's strategy of balancing its activities between developing 
countries and more advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will also significantly enhance our position in the  
world's largest economy, giving us an additional 1 million 
customers in a mature and stable market,'' he said, referring to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC said it will pay for the acquisitions in part with money  
raised from the sale of $3 billion in stock. The company will take 
after-tax restructuring charges of $450 million in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still requires approval from Republic New York  
shareholders and regulatory authorities in the United States, 
Britain, Hong Kong and other jurisdictions. HSBC hopes to complete 
the acquisition by the end of the year, spokesman Adrian Russell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC Holdings earned $4.32 billion last year.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Streamlining Its Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp.'s management team made its  
first major move Monday since a shakeup last month, slimming the 
number of distributors of many of its business-class products to 
four from about 40. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will allow Compaq, the world's largest personal  
computer maker, to reduce costs and improve customer contact by 
streamlining distribution, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the efficiency gains of this program combined  
with more focused marketing programs will ultimately result in 
higher levels of customer satisfaction and enhance customer 
choice,'' said Peter Blackmore, a Compaq vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq held on to four longtime distribution partners: Omaha,  
Neb.-based Inacom Corp., Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram Micro Inc., 
Clearwater, Fla.-based Tech Data Corp. and El Segundo, Calif.-based 
Merisel Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first big change since chairman Ben Rosen and  
Compaq's board ousted president Eckhard Pfeiffer last month after a 
persistent slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, who heard of the distribution moves Friday afternoon,  
have generally applauded the move. Stock prices for the four 
resellers rose on the news, and Compaq gained $1.50, or 6 percent, 
to close at $26.25. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to cut down their indirect relationships to  
focus more on the direct model,'' said Rob Enderle of the Giga 
Information Group. ``With fewer distributors to carry the load, it 
should result in a further reduction of costs and a potential 
increase in perceived quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enderle, who characterized the decision as ``clearly a step in  
the right direction,'' said Compaq's complex distribution system 
had added costs and detracted from customer relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud to be part of Compaq's exciting new strategy, and  
we're confident that resellers will reap the benefits of the new 
distribution model through improved service levels,'' said Jim 
Illson, president of Merisel. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of Compaq's effort to forge a closer  
relationship with its larger customers without committing to direct 
sales, like competitors Gateway and Dell. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've leaving all their options open,'' Enderle said.  
``Their view is to provide the buyer with choice. If they want to 
buy from CompUSA (via resellers), OK. If they want to buy direct 
from Compaq, OK. Wherever the buyer goes, they want to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also might make other PC giants IBM and  
Hewlett-Packard take notice, said analyst Kevin Knox of Gartner 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are IBM and HP going to follow suit, or does this make them  
stronger with channel players (distributors) who are not part of 
Compaq's program?'' Knox said.

<HEADLINE> US, EU No Closer to Beef Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the deadline looming to settle a trade  
dispute that has led to a European ban on hormone-treated U.S. 
beef, neither American nor European Union officials seem any nearer 
to a compromise that would open Europe's markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not open to further foot-dragging and evasion,'' Tim  
Galvin, administrator of the Agriculture Department's Foreign 
Agricultural Service, said Monday. The U.S. has threatened to 
impose 100 percent tariffs on more than $900 million worth of 
European products to retaliate unless the ban is dropped by 
Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. impatience on this issue has been 10 years in the making  
and time has run out,'' Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials were just as adamant.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will not lift the embargo on May 13,'' Elio Di Rupo,  
Belgium's deputy trade minister, told Dow Jones Newswires on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization set Thursday 's deadline for the EU  
to lift the hormone-treated meat ban. In its ruling a year ago, the 
WTO said the ban is illegal and is not supported by proper risk 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the EU issued a report that contended one growth  
hormone may cause cancer -- a finding that has been widely disputed 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to make cattle grow 
faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, the United States has exported only hormone-free  
beef to Europe because of the union's ban. The cattle industry has 
estimated lost export sales at $500 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the EU to play fair with us,'' said George Swan,  
president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ``Access is 
what we want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Scher, America's trade negotiator on agriculture, said the  
U.S. still hopes Europe ``will take the steps necessary to comply 
with its obligations and frankly to allow European consumers the 
right to decide whether or not they want to purchase and consume 
U.S. beef.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still time to do that,'' Scher said. ``We are still  
very open to working with the EU in that direction.''

<HEADLINE> Lucent Chip Combines Phone, Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies said today it has  
developed a computer chip for phones that will help small- and 
mid-size businesses use their companies' computer networks to 
deliver voice calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The chip will help lower the cost of ``Internet phones'' from  
about $250 to $150 by decreasing the number of chips in a phone 
from five to one, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet telephone systems converge voice and data using a  
single wall outlet jack. Typically, two connections on wall jacks 
are required -- one carrying voice and the other carrying data. 
</P>
<P>
	The market for these Internet telephone sets is expected to  
average annual growth of more than 250 percent for the next three 
years, according to the Murray Hill, N.J.-based company.

<HEADLINE> RNC Turns Sights on Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party, citing internal polls on  
Vice President Al Gore's political standing, has ordered its 
research department to devote half its time scouring the background 
of Gore rival Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	A memo written by David Israelite, director of political and  
governmental affairs, says Gore's poll numbers are down and 
Bradley's are up. The memo to Republican National Committee 
chairman Jim Nicholson also says Gore's unfavorable rating ``is at 
a high 23 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on this most recent confirmation of what our earlier  
research has indicated, I have directed our research department to 
shift its focus to Bill Bradley a full 50 percent of the time. We 
will continue to monitor the situation,'' Israelite wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreed,'' Nicholson said in a handwritten reply. ``Do it!''  
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the May 4 memo was obtained Monday by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore the early favorite to win the Democratic nomination,  
Republicans are eager to portray him as a weak candidate. The memo 
may be part of that strategy, but it also reflect the results of 
some public opinion polls that showed a shrinking gap between Gore 
and the former New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore holds a lead of 20 or more percentage points in most  
polls, and least one public survey suggests that the vice president 
has regained some of the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign dismissed the memo.  
</P>
<P>
	``This must be the RNC's version of trickle down negative  
politics,'' spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``It's too bad they can't 
spend some of those resources coming up with good policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether serious or not about Bradley's chances, the RNC is  
starting to treat Bradley as a serious candidate: The party's 
spokesman attacked him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without looking in depth yet, I would say the fact that Bill  
Bradley's biggest accomplishment in the Senate was losing the fight 
against welfare reform is significant,'' said RNC communications 
director Cliff May. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has expressed concern about the impact welfare reform  
has on poor Americans. Gore supported President Clinton's decision 
to sign the 1996 welfare overhaul bill. 
</P>
<P>
	May also noted that Bradley voted against President Reagan's  
nomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Greenspan 
is given high marks by Democrats and Republicans for his role in 
improving the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator had  
questioned Greenspan's international experience during the first 
confirmation hearing, but voted for Greenspan when he was 
re-nominated. 
</P>
<P>
	``His worries have proven unfounded,'' the spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
	With party pollsters still in the field, RNC chief of staff Tom  
Cole predicted last month that the party would turn its sites on 
Bradley. The Israelite memo put the new policy in motion.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Up in East, Down in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose in most parts of the  
country, while dropping about 5 cents in the West as the effects of 
refinery problems wore off, an industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil price hikes caused pump prices to rise about 1 to 2  
cents per gallon in the East and Midwest, according to the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.2337 per gallon Friday, a 0.41 cent rise from two weeks 
earlier, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fatal explosions and problems in several California refineries  
caused prices to skyrocket in the West recently. However, increased 
supplies of gasoline have stabilized the market and are expected to 
continue knocking down prices in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have risen more than 23 cents per gallon since they  
bottomed out on Feb. 19, but over the past month the increases have 
been very small, she said. ``It looks like they are losing 
momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide gasoline boycott organized for April 30 by consumer  
groups angry about price hikes succeeded in lowering sales on that 
day but may have had little long-term effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prices were down that day, but they were up the day before and  
the day after,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC and Mexico's decision to cut back on oil production may  
continue to force gas prices slightly higher in other regions, Ms. 
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average prices at self-service stations was $1.1767 per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.2783 for mid-grade and $1.3628 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.5356 for regular, $1.6220 for  
mid-grade and $1.6954 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Car Seller Biggest Black-Owned Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A car dealership empire headed by former Pro  
Bowl running back Mel Farr dethroned a slimmed down TLC Beatrice 
International Holdings Inc. as the nation's largest black-owned 
business in rankings released today by Black Enterprise magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Farr Automotive Group, with sales of $596.6 million last  
year, became the first auto dealership to claim the title in the 27 
years the magazine has measured the performance of black-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While auto dealerships like Farr's benefitted from a robust  
economy last year, TLC Beatrice -- which dominated the rankings 
through the 1990s -- was shrinking and slipped in the standings. 
Revenue fell to $322 million from $1.4 billion in 1997 as TLC 
Beatrice sold some of its operations overseas and was left with an 
ice cream business in Spain and a potato chip unit in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The rankings appear in the June edition of Black Enterprise,  
which will reach newsstands on May 25. But the magazine said it 
also will make the data available starting Tuesday on its Web site, 
http://www.blackenterprise.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Enterprise used to issue just one list of top black-owned  
businesses until car dealerships came to dominate it. There are now 
several lists, including those for banks and insurance companies, 
but Mel Farr Automotive Group topped all in the rankings based on 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Farr, whose father ran an auto dealership, shifted from the  
Detroit Lions backfield into the auto business and promoted his 
showrooms over the years by appearing in commercials as the caped 
Mel Farr Superstar. His business, based in Oak Park, Mich., tops 
the Black Enterprise list of the top 100 black-owned auto dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in sales at the top 100 black-owned auto businesses was  
up 13.2 percent in 1998 from 1997, but there was a rise of only 
about 1 percent for the top 100 black industrial and service 
companies. In comparison, revenue for the Fortune 500 companies 
last year was up a modest 4.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 company on the list of the 100 top black-owned  
industrial and service businesses is the Philadelphia Coca-Cola 
Bottling Co., with 1998 sales of $389 million; No. 2 is Johnson 
Publishing Co., the Chicago-based publisher of the venerable Ebony 
magazine and creator of Fashion Fair cosmetics, with $322 million 
sales in 1998. TLC Beatrice, headquartered in New York, is third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to quibble with anything TLC has done'' since Loida  
Nicolas Lewis became chairman, Tony Chappell, publisher of 
Securities Pro, a newsletter that reports on blacks in the 
securities industry, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lewis, an attorney, took over after her husband, TLC  
Beatrice's legendary creator Reginald Lewis, died in 1993. She has 
settled lawsuits filed by dissident shareholders, sold its beverage 
component as part of its reduction plan and taken the privately 
held company public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think being No. 1 is not so important to them as doing the  
right business thing,'' Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farr expanded his business by acquiring other companies,  
breaking with the traditional black community business model of 
building from the ground up, such as Johnson Publishing. The group 
now has a total of 11 dealerships in Ohio and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mel has been acquiring dealerships for the last 3 years,  
spreading beyond his boundaries in the Detroit area,'' Chappell 
said. ``For him to have become No. 1 is not such a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for the list, a company must have been fully  
operational in 1998 and at least 51 percent black-owned. It must 
manufacture or own the product it sells or provide industrial or 
consumer services.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Sentenced in Italy Ski Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine pilot who was acquitted of  
manslaughter in the Italian cable car tragedy was sentenced to six 
months in prison and dismissed from the corps Monday for helping 
destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., became the  
first crewman to go to prison in connection with the accident that 
killed 20 people. Because the dismissal takes effect upon his 
release from prison, he was also ordered to forfeit all pay and 
allowances, including those for food and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have gotten as much as 10 years behind bars from the  
military jury that convicted him last week of obstructing justice 
and conspiracy for his actions after the 1998 accident, in which 
his plane sliced through a ski cable in the Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby stood at attention when the sentence was read by the  
jury's foreman. There was no sound in the courtroom after the judge 
warned Ashby's family against outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby showed no emotion as he left the courthouse with his  
family and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, commanding general of Marine Forces  
Atlantic, rejected a request from defense attorney Frank Spinner 
for a deferral of the sentence. Ashby was taken to the brig at Camp 
Lejeune late Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Spinner, who said he would appeal the conviction and the  
sentence, seemed especially unhappy with the prison term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe that this is a case that called for  
confinement,'' he said. ``We do think that the (jurors) had to 
consider the fact that there are people who died in this tragic 
incident. And we are concerned that they let that override their 
objectivity ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	The news of the jail term came too late for the widely watched  
dinner-hour TV news in Italy, and there was no immediate public 
reaction to the sentencing. Italians reacted with outrage after 
Ashby was cleared of manslaughter in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked the jury to sentence Ashby to two years in  
prison and throw him out of the service. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Ashby testified that he took the video out of  
his EA-6B Prowler anti-radar jet after the accident and later gave 
it to his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, at Schweitzer's 
request. Schweitzer said he burned the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby and Schweitzer had maintained that the tape, shot just  
before their jet entered the valley where it clipped the cable, 
contained no incriminating information. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued that the two got rid of the tape to block the  
investigation of the tragedy and that the footage might have shed 
light on the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty to  
obstruction and conspiracy and was ordered dismissed from the 
Marine Corps. The Marines dropped manslaughter charges against 
Schweitzer after Ashby's acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare the sentence for Capt. Schweitzer, who was  
the one who actually destroyed the tape, with the sentence Capt. 
Ashby received, it's hard to understand the disparity,'' Spinner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two back-seat officers in the jet were charged with  
manslaughter soon after the accident, but those charges were 
dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Buses a Safe Form of Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last June, it was a Greyhound bus that veered  
off the Pennsylvania Turnpike and smashed into a parked 
tractor-trailer, killing seven. On Christmas Eve, it was a 
casino-bound charter that slid off an icy Garden State Parkway, 
killing eight. On Sunday, it was the worst one yet, another casino 
bus swerving off a highway in New Orleans, killing 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a run of deadly accidents, federal statistics show that  
buses are generally a safe way to travel on the nation's highways. 
On average, six people die in motor coach crashes annually; in 
1997, 22,000 people died in passenger car crashes, 2,100 were 
killed in motorcycle crashes and just over 700 died in large truck 
crashes on U.S. interstates and highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the National Transportation Safety Board is concerned  
about the safety of America's coach fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is just completing a special investigation of bus  
crash-worthiness, and preliminarily it has found that the most 
dangerous aspect of a crash is passenger ejection, said Joe 
Osterman, head of highway safety for the NTSB. 
</P>
<P>
	That may prompt the five-member board to recommend new  
guidelines for the size or rigidity of bus windows -- especially in 
new coaches offering panoramic views of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also triggered a discussion of seat belts in motor coaches.  
</P>
<P>
	While the federal government has required seat belts in  
passenger cars since 1968, it has never required them in any kind 
of bus, whether school buses, transit buses or motor coaches. The 
thinking has long been that with their size, height, padded seats 
and high seat backs, buses offer passengers a protective cocoon in 
the event of a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that in a rollover, it creates flexing of the  
body (of the bus), which casts off windows,'' Osterman said. ``In a 
bus that creates some fairly significant portals where the 
passengers can come out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the bus industry has cited the lack of research showing  
the benefit of seat belts. There is also concern that requiring 
seat belts might force the installation of stronger -- and more 
expensive -- seats and floors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's accident, a coach carrying elderly people headed for  
a Mississippi casino hurtled down an embankment off Interstate 610 
in New Orleans. Investigators were checking witness reports of a 
car possibly cutting off the bus, but they were also looking into 
the driver's medical history and driving record. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness said: ``People started flying out of the bus, flying  
out the windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bus is technically any vehicle with more than 10,000 pounds  
gross vehicle weight that carries more than 10 people. That covers 
the spectrum from airport car rental vans to modern motor coaches, 
which carry up to 50 passengers and store their luggage in bays 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, there are up to 4,000 motor coach companies,  
ranging from one-bus charter operations to Greyhound, a 2,100-bus 
company that provides the only regular nationwide service. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry has enjoyed 5 percent to 7 percent growth over the  
past six years, according to Peter Pantuso, president of the 
American Bus Association, which represents about two-thirds of the 
nation's bus fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great way to travel. It's affordable, people can stay  
together,'' Pantuso said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sunday's accident was typical in many respects: Casinos are  
a top destination for buses, in many cases the deaths occur when 
the bus leaves the roadway and the deadliest of accidents usually 
involve passenger ejections. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety  
Board, wrote a letter to the transportation secretary in February 
calling for better bus brake inspections and a closer study of 
driver fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward that end, the agency is conducting three hearings this  
year focusing on oversight of the industry and safety technology. 
The board is also expected to consider recommending improvements in 
seat and interior compartment design. 
</P>
<P>
	It concedes the safety of buses, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is occasionally some competition between motor coaches  
and school buses as to which is safer,'' Osterman said. ``But they 
are the safest vehicles on the highway.''

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Economy Bouncing Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's economy is  
beginning to bounce back from months of sluggish growth, EU finance 
ministers said Monday, adding that recovery won't be held back by 
the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer confidence in Europe and signs of improvement in  
Asian economies were indications that the European slowdown is 
bottoming out, said Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm. 
</P>
<P>
	``All expectations show that the lowest point has been passed,''  
said Belgian Finance Minister Jean-Jacques Viseur. ``Growth will 
now accelerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers were united in downplaying the potential for the  
Kosovo crisis to hinder European growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo conflict will have little impact,'' said Spanish  
Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato. ``The prospects of recuperation in 
the European economy are strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Ciampi bucked the optimistic  
trend with a statement warning the ``balance of risks'' for the 
European economy ``remains on the downside.'' However, he also 
predicted a resumption of economic activity in the second half of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said the decline of the euro  
against the dollar since the EU single currency was launched by 11 
EU nations Jan. 1 was a natural result of stronger economic growth 
in the United States and ``did not require any particular 
measures'' from the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the European Commission predicted economic growth in  
the 15-nation bloc would slow by 0.8 percentage points to 2.1 
percent this year. However, the mood has improved recently, helped 
by better export potential, lower interest rates and more bullish 
surveys of business sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's meeting was the EU finance ministers' first formal  
gathering since NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia began March 24.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged To Reconsider US Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American leaders made a last-minute attempt  
Monday to persuade the European Union to end a 10-year ban on 
hormone-treated U.S. beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU faces in four days a deadline to end the ban or face U.S.  
trade retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States still hopes Europe ``will take the steps  
necessary to comply with its obligations and frankly to allow 
European consumers the right to decide whether or not they want to 
purchase and consume U.S. beef,'' said Peter Scher, America's trade 
negotiator on agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still time to do that,'' Scher said. ``We are still  
very open to working with the EU in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as Scher and other U.S. officials made a final overture  
toward the EU, a European official said the ban would continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not lift the embargo on May 13,'' Elio Di Rupo,  
Belgium's deputy trade minister, told Dow Jones Newswires on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday is the deadline set by the World Trade Organization for  
the union to lift the hormone-treated meat ban. In its ruling a 
year ago, the WTO said the ban is illegal and is not supported by 
the proper risk analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has threatened to impose 100 percent  
tariffs on more than $900 million worth of European products to 
retaliate for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the EU issued a report that contended one growth  
hormone may cause cancer -- a finding that has been widely disputed 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Galvin, the Agriculture Department's administrator for the  
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the United States is ``not open 
to further foot-dragging and evasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are prepared to protect our rights,'' Galvin said. ``U.S.  
impatience on this matter has been 10 years in the making, and time 
has run out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones  
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to make cattle grow 
faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, the United States has exported only hormone-free  
beef to Europe because of the union's ban. The cattle industry has 
put lost export sales at $500 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the EU to play fair with us,'' said George Swan,  
president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ``Access is 
what we want.''

	China Wants Bomb Halt Before Talks  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- China is insisting that a halt to NATO's  
bombing of Yugoslavia is a prerequisite for any Security Council 
discussion of a Kosovo peace plan. Last week the seven major 
industrialized nations and Russia agreed to draft a resolution 
calling for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and the 
deployment of an international security presence. NATO says it will 
continue airstrikes until these conditions are met. Today, at the 
start of a second council meeting called by China to condemn NATO's 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, U.N. Ambassador Qin 
Huasun made clear that Beijing won't discuss peace unless the 
bombing stops. 

</P>

	China Breaks Military Ties With US  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China broke off military ties with the United  
States today and demanded those responsible for NATO's bombing of 
its embassy in Yugoslavia be ``severely'' punished. President 
Clinton apologized anew, calling the bombing ``an isolated tragic 
mistake.'' U.S. officials blamed it on CIA misinformation. 
Meanwhile, Chinese authorities allowed waves of protesters to 
descend on the paint-spattered, debris-strewn U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing. Some hurled burning objects. Tibetan monks also joined the 
demonstrations. 

</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Pullback Dismissed by NATO  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said NATO  
would continue its air campaign, despite Yugoslavia's announcement 
today of a partial military withdrawal from Kosovo. Cohen said he 
would consider a pause if Yugoslavia indicated its acceptance of 
all the alliance's demands and made a ``demonstrable'' start to a 
troop withdrawal. Meanwhile, NATO carried out daylight bombings on 
several towns in central and western Serbia, killing four civilians 
and smashing a factory in one 20-minute bombardment, Yugoslav media 
reported.

	EU To Create Defense Policy

<P>
	BREMEN, Germany (AP) -- European Union defense ministers pledged  
today to work toward a common security policy by December 2000. 
German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping admitted it was a ``tight 
timetable'' given the persistent shortcomings of Europeans in 
defense matters. EU leaders will debate the issue in more detail at 
a summit next month in Cologne.

	Man Charged in Columbine Attack  
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was formally charged  
today with providing a pistol to students who used it in the 
Columbine High School massacre. Mark Manes, a former Columbine 
student, has admitted selling the semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, who used it in the lunchtime 
attack. They killed 12 students and a teacher before killing 
themselves. Defense lawyer Robert Ransome said Manes did not know

Ashby also was ordered to forfeit all pay and allowance for his

right to restore the traditional hunts that had been banned for 70 
years. The whaling crew had intended to go on a practice run, but 
protesters were following their canoe, so the tribe issued a 10-day 
hunting permit that requires other vessels to stay at least 500

<HEADLINE> Figure in Overthrow Plot Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal jury decided today that a  
white supremacist should get a life sentence, sparing him from the 
death penalty for killing a family as part of his plot to set up a 
whites-only nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had asked that Chevie Kehoe be put to death for the  
1996 killings of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and 
her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell. The three were suffocated 
with plastic bags, weighed down with rocks and tossed into a 
western Arkansas bayou during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe appeared subdued as the sentence was read and made no  
comment afterward to reporters as U.S. marshals led him away in 
handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Mark Hampton, said ``It appears that the jury took a  
solemn approach to their duties, and this was a difficult decision, 
but mercy was shown to Chevie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors had only two choices in recommending sentence on the  
murder conviction, life in prison or the death penalty. When U.S. 
District Judge G. Thomas Eisele formally pronounces sentence, his 
only option will be a life sentence as the jury recommended. 
Besides the formal sentencing on the murder count, Eisele will 
decide the penalties for lesser charges. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief delay in announcing the verdict because Eisele  
had to send the mostly black jury back to its deliberating room to 
sign a form declaring the decision was reached without regard for 
Kehoe's race or religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kehoe, 26, of Colville, Wash., and codefendant Danny Lee, 26, of  
Yukon, Okla., were found guilty last Tuesday of murder, 
racketeering and conspiracy. They were accused of trying to 
overthrow the government and set up the Aryan Peoples Republic in 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel considered Kehoe's fate first. A hearing on Lee's  
penalty is scheduled to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding Kehoe's sentence, jurors apparently were persuaded  
by the defense argument that Kehoe came from a dysfunctional 
family. They argued that he was influenced by his parents, 
particularly his father, Kirby Kehoe, and other adults who held 
extremist political and social views. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers had argued it was possible that Kehoe's brother,  
Cheyne, who testified against Chevie Kehoe, actually killed the 
Muellers. They said Cheyne was motivated to testify because he 
wants a sentencing reduction in Ohio, where the two brothers were 
convicted in a 1997 videotaped shootout with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors would not comment on the sentencing. A gag order  
remains in place for lawyers and parties connected to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimma Gurel, Mrs. Mueller's sister, said her family would have  
been satisfied with either a death sentence or life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the weekend, we talked about it, and justified it that  
either way we were winning, because they're not going to be out and 
able to do anything to someone else. Being in prison might be 
worse,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banks Plan Loan-Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Leading Japanese banks said Monday that they will  
lower the long-term prime lending rate, the rate for loans of a 
year or more to the best corporate clients, to a record low 1.9 
percent from 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term prime rate is a benchmark for other bank loans.  
Lower rates on home mortgages and automobile and small business 
loans could follow the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Industrial Bank of Japan and The Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.  
said they would lower the rate beginning on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cut brings the long-term prime rate below 2 percent for the  
first time. The previous record low was 2.2 percent offered between 
November and December 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rates on Japanese bank loans and government bonds have fallen  
dramatically in recent years as the nation struggles to recover 
from its deepest-ever postwar recession.

<HEADLINE> LSU Coach Bertman Is Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- LSU head baseball coach Skip Bertman has  
been hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat which was detected 
Sunday by doctors after he complained of nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertman's complaint came during the Tigers' plane flight from  
Atlanta, where the team had a three-game series with Georgia. He 
was taken to an area hospital where doctors discovered the 
irregularity and gave him medication to correct it, the university 
said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertman, 61, said doctors have told him there was no structural  
damage to his heart. However, he was ordered to rest and will miss 
Tuesday's game at Northeast Louisiana. Bertman is expected to 
rejoin the team practice Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Duval Vs. Woods on ABC TV Event  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It's not Augusta National. It won't even be the final round  
Sunday at a regular PGA Tour event. But for those longing to see 
David Duval and Tiger Woods finally go head-to-head on the golf 
course, the ``Showdown at Sherwood'' will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
	After two months of rejecting the notion that a rivalry is  
brewing between the top two players in the world rankings, Duval 
and Woods have agreed to stage an 18-hole match on prime-time 
television two weeks before the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports will televise the exhibition live on Aug. 2 at 8 p.m.  
EDT from Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif., site of 
the Shark Shootout. International Management Group, the agency for 
both players, helped put the event together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't heat up whatever rivalry there might be because  
it's a one-day match,'' Duval said Monday during a teleconference 
to announce the match. ``It's not the U.S. Open or the Masters, 
it's not Sunday when you go head-to-head. It's a great way to gain 
more exposure to the game through what might be nontraditional golf 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, No. 1 in the world for 41 consecutive weeks until Duval  
unseated him after The Players Championship, compared the 
exhibition to challenge matches once played between Arnold Palmer 
and Gary Player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance where David and I can compete head-to-head, beat  
each other's brains out, walk away and say it was great for the 
game of golf,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purse will be $1.5 million, with $1.1 million going to the  
winner. Each player will donate $100,000 to The First Tee program, 
and an additional $100,000 to the charity of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports president Howard Katz said the match, which will be  
shown from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT, will pre-empt summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it will surpass what we normally get in that time  
period,'' Katz said. ``It's not the British Open. We're not going 
to prove who the world's greatest player is. We want to entertain 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What could help an otherwise made-for-TV event are the players.  
Woods gave golf a huge lift when he became the first black player 
to win the Masters in 1997, and did so with such an astonishing, 
record-breaking performance that he became the top icon in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has won only twice on tour since July 1997, and Duval has  
risen to the top of the rankings with equally dominant play. Not 
only did Duval shoot the first Sunday 59 in tour history to win the 
Bob Hope Classic, he became the first player in 25 years to win 
four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a much-anticipated Sunday showdown between them didn't  
materialize at Augusta National and has never happened in their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless that happens in the U.S. Open or British Open or any  
other event between now and August, fans will have to settle for a 
manufactured event with only pride at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be able to play against the world No. 1, David Duval, is  
not only a fabulous treat for myself but for anyone watching the 
tournament,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he had reservations about playing the match, fearful  
that it would draw too much attention to them and not enough on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he and I could expose the game to a broader  
audience,'' Duval said. ``ABC came in and has given us the 
platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour cannot endorse the exhibition, it has agreed to  
give the players the television release they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``The popularity of David Duval and Tiger Woods and their recent  
competition for the No. 1 position has set up this contest as a 
very compelling viewing opportunity,'' said Henry Hughes, senior 
vice president chief of operations for the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duval has been more successful the past two years, he does  
not have the ratings strength of Woods, which helped the PGA Tour 
negotiate a 40 percent increase in its new television contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval isn't even sure how many nongolf fans know who he is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tiger is obviously a very critical piece of this  
puzzle,'' Duval said. ``He has obviously drawn in a much broader 
audience than I conceivably ever well. He's had a lot of burdens to 
carry. To win as often as he has with all the outside issues is a 
wonderful achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be a golf star, but I think Tiger is a star,'' he  
said. ``He transcends the game.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Invest $600M in Nextel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Just days after talks to be acquired by MCI  
WorldCom unraveled, Nextel Communications is selling a small piece 
of itself to Microsoft for $600 million in a deal to provide 
Internet services for wireless phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies plan to create a Nextel version of the MSN Web  
portal to supply e-mail, calendar and address book functions for an 
Internet-ready phone being introduced by Motorola later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday leaves Microsoft with a 4.25 percent  
stake in Nextel, while the $600 million will help Nextel continue 
building and improving its wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
	``To do that requires huge amounts of capital,'' said F. Drake  
Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport and Co. in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming less than a week after Nextel and MCI WorldCom ended  
merger talks, the Microsoft deal may drive up the asking price for 
Nextel, the nation's largest independent wireless company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day someone waits to put in a bid for Nextel, they're  
going to end up paying a higher price,'' said Johnstone. ``I think 
this raises the stakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft deal valued Nextel's shares at $36 each, slightly  
shy of Friday's closing price of $36.37 1/2 and well below the nearly 
$45 price tag that Nextel was reportedly seeking to be acquired by 
MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nextel rose 56 1/4 cents per share to $36.93 3/4 on Nasdaq  
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nextel-branded version of the MSN portal will also provide  
Nextel wireless customers with timed or triggered notifications of 
stock quotes, sports scores and other news and information. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which dominates the market for computer operating  
systems and many other types of software, has been trying to ensure 
its role in key growth areas of Internet access such as wireless 
phones and cable television lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Within five years, analysts say Internet-ready phones will be  
huge players in telecommunications and computer access because they 
are lightweight, convenient and allow users to get information from 
almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Microsoft invested $5 billion in AT&AMP;T, which plans to  
use cable TV wires for Internet access, telephone calls and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important for them to be well positioned with those  
two markets,'' Johnstone said. ``The potential applications are 
fairly extensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said, ``Microsoft and Nextel will  
deliver the next generation of wireless services to enable people 
everywhere to stay in touch with the information they need 
regardless of location.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of Nextel's integrated data network and  
Internet-ready phones will provide our customers with the ability 
to access information and applications that are important to them, 
wherever they are,'' said Dan Akerson, chief executive of Nextel, 
which is based in Reston, Va.

<HEADLINE> Questions Loom As Farmers Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Ohio (AP) -- Work beckons in the fields, the tractor needs  
a new clutch and the barn and outbuildings could use a fresh coat 
of paint. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody McDowell slumps on a stool inside the barn to catch his  
breath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get awfully tired,'' said the 80-year-old farmer. ``It takes  
me longer to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the barn creaks in the wind, McDowell watches a friend work  
on his tractor. McDowell's cheek bulges with a plug of tobacco, and 
he pauses to spit from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been farming his 129-acre spread in west-central Ohio  
since 1953 and also works about 1,000 acres of nearby farmland. But 
age is catching up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This winter, my wife and I both really slowed down,'' said  
McDowell. ``I hope we can make it through this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's farmers, on average, are aging.  
</P>
<P>
	According to the Agriculture Department, the average age of an  
American farm operator in 1997 was 54.3 years, up from 53.3 years 
in 1992 and 50.5 years in 1982. In Ohio, the average age also 
increased by a year from 1992 to 1997, to 53.1 years. 
</P>
<P>
	That rise is connected to the question of what happens when a  
farmer retires or dies. Unless heirs protect the farm or another 
farmer takes it over, it may fall into the hands of developers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. farmland shrank from 945 million acres in 1992 to 931  
million in 1997. In Ohio, it went from 11.5 million acres to 11.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to farm the ground? Is there going to be anything  
left from this urban sprawl?'' McDowell asked. ``They're going to 
have to do something because the backbone of the United States 
started with agriculture, and it's still the backbone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Beale, senior demographer with USDA's Economic Research  
Service, said fewer farm families have children who are interested 
in farming in part because of financial hurdles and also because 
the families are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pullins, vice president of business services for the Ohio  
Farm Bureau, said it can be challenging to attract young people to 
farming because it takes money to get into it and can take time to 
make money in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't go into farming with a lunchbox,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Pullins said, young people have many opportunities  
in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those farm kids who are raised and have a strong work ethic  
are recruited by many others,'' he said. ``It's a matter of 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts have been made to preserve farmland by trying to  
establish links between farmers and buyers. But the programs, 
designed to match young people interested in farming with older 
farmers who have no heirs, have had spotty success, Pullins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said older farmers can be reluctant to turn over control,  
especially if the chemistry isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard enough when people are related,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	McDowell said that while he doesn't expect any of his three  
grown children to work the farm after he's gone, they won't sell it 
to developers either. He expects they will arrange for someone else 
to farm the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they will have to withstand the pressures of urban  
sprawl. While sheep graze in a pasture sprinkled with spring's 
dandelions just across the road, modern, suburban-style houses have 
popped up on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell fears the nation will have to begin importing much of  
its food ``if we put blacktop over all of our prime farm ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They better be thinking about this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Fired for Cancer Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A reporter at a rural Kentucky newspaper  
who wrote moving stories about her battle with cancer was fired 
Monday after admitting she didn't have the disease at all, but 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Stacy, 33, said she lied because of the stigma attached to  
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in a small-town atmosphere where you are crucified  
for having AIDS or being gay,'' Ms. Stacy, who is a lesbian, said 
in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few weeks, she had told readers of the Owensboro  
Messenger-Inquirer that she had brain cancer and had less than a 
year to live. 
</P>
<P>
	She admitted the fabrications after the publisher at another  
paper for which she once worked confronted her with his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly sorry. I didn't think about what I was doing,''  
she said in the interview. ``I betrayed a lot of people and misled 
a lot of people including my own friends and family. Nobody knew 
until this weekend that I have AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Editor Bob Ashley of the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer said Ms.  
Stacy was fired Monday for fabricating the stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she actually had resigned during a series of  
telephone calls over the weekend. The newspaper said she indicated 
to a supervisor that she would resign on Monday but never submitted 
a resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will write a news story and apologize to readers for  
misleading them,'' said publisher Ed Riney. ``We do have compassion 
for the situation she is experiencing, but we can't countenance 
misleading our readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of a series of occasional columns during recent weeks,  
Ms. Stacy wrote: ``I'm going to die! I'm going to die! The words 
echoed through my mind, numbing me, and at the same time, causing 
me pain and sadness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have terminal brain cancer. I was told I had about 10 months  
to a year to live,'' she said in one of the columns, which was 
distributed in Kentucky by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said Monday, she has been treated off and on for  
AIDS for four years. When asked how readers will know if Ms. Stacy 
is telling the truth now, she would only say: ``I don't have an 
answer for you all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy started her newspaper career several years ago at the  
tri-weekly Pikeville (Ky.) Appalachian News-Express. 
</P>
<P>
	News-Express publisher Marty Backus said that three of his  
staffers who were close friends with Ms. Stacy ``got suspicious 
about some things she was writing in the columns -- things that just 
didn't ring the right-sounding bell.'' The newspaper had agreed to 
publish Ms. Stacy's columns written for the Owensboro paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Backus notified the Owensboro paper, and Ashley said Ms. Stacy  
called her editors on Saturday and asked them to pull her column 
from Sunday's paper.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Progressing Before Spinoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. plans to be a  
bigger player in the consolidation of the global auto-parts 
industry after it becomes independent from General Motors Corp. 
later this month, its chairman says. 
</P>
<P>
	J.T. Battenberg III said Delphi was in solid financial shape  
going into the May 28 spinoff, when the remaining 452.6 million 
Delphi shares will be distributed to GM shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest auto-parts maker no longer has any  
money-losing plants, is getting cooperation from its unions to cut 
costs and is winning more non-GM business, Battenberg told 
reporters at a briefing Monday. Though Delphi lost $93 million last 
year because of several one-time costs, it earned $284 million in 
the first quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is cutting Delphi loose to focus on its core business:  
building cars and trucks. Delphi executives say they expect their 
business to grow as other automakers no longer have to fear working 
with a supplier owned by their biggest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	There's evidence that's already happening, even though the  
spinoff won't be completed until May 28. In the first quarter, 
Delphi won $4 billion in new contracts with GM and a surprising $2 
billion worth of non-GM contracts. Delphi stock price increased 18 
percent in its first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock has performed well,'' said analyst Jonathan Lawrence  
of Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``They're certainly winning business, and 
that's picked up since their announcement of the spinoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., and Battenberg will face their  
first big test come summer when they will work out details of a new 
contract with the company's largest union, the United Auto Workers. 
Talks already are under way with some UAW locals and Battenberg 
said there has been progress. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's  
North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million. Both 
companies are trying to repair their long-contentious relationship 
with the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg declined to comment in detail on that relationship  
but said he was in ``personal touch'' with UAW leaders. Though 
company insiders say UAW president Stephen P. Yokich has been 
cooperative, publicly he has criticized the spinoff and urged GM to 
retain 51 percent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delphi-UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial  
contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit 
of DaimlerChrysler AG. The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi's 
hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM's hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi no longer has any plants that are unprofitable, in some  
cases because its unions agreed to relax restrictive work rules, 
Battenberg said. In Kokomo, Ind., for example, the UAW agreed to 
work rule changes to allow the electronics plant to operate 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Battenberg said Delphi plans to focus on acquiring companies  
that can supply future technology, especially in the area of 
high-tech electronics as computers and satellite telecommunications 
become more integrated into the design of car and truck interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at Delphi becoming an electronics company that makes  
products for vehicles, which is a lot more attractive than a 
traditional auto-parts company,'' Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Delphi has been trimming its work force through  
attrition, the company may end up adding workers if it meets its 
goals to increase new business, Battenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, Delphi will debut a $1 million TV-and-print  
advertising campaign to coincide with the Indianapolis 500 auto 
race. The campaign and 20-city roadshow are intended to make Delphi 
a brand known outside the auto industry.

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New PowerBook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. interim CEO Steve  
Jobs gave computer programmers a taste of the future Monday, 
unveiling a faster and more powerful PowerBook laptop for 
professionals, new speech recognition software and a deal to sell 
the popular iMac desktop computers at Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a better time to be a Mac  
developer,'' Jobs told more than 2,500 programmers at Apple's 
annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The new PowerBook G3 is 20 percent thinner and almost two pounds  
lighter than its predecessor. The top models, selling for $3,500, 
come with DVD players and batteries that last up to 5 hours, 
allowing users to watch entire movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs said that Dragon Systems Inc. is creating  
Macintosh-compatible products based on Dragon NaturallySpeaking, 
the top-selling retail speech recognition software. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragon Systems Janet Baker said their company has received many  
requests for a Macintosh version. 
</P>
<P>
	Jobs also announced that Sears will offer the iMac and a wide  
range of iMac peripherals to its customers by Memorial Day weekend.

<HEADLINE> Astros Coach Sidelined 3-4 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) - Houston Astros first-base coach Jose Cruz will be  
sidelined for 3-4 weeks for treatment of an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This condition is not considered serious, but Jose will be  
taking blood thinners which will prevent him from being in uniform 
for three to four weeks,'' Houston general manager Gerry Hunsicker 
said Monday prior to the Astros' game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately Jose will undergo electronic stimulation to try and  
put his heart rate back at a normal rhythm,'' Hunsicker said. 
``This is a common procedure, President Bush underwent the same 
thing a few years ago and so did one of our scouts, Walter 
Matthews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 51, was not at Monday's game because of the condition,  
known as arhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to him this afternoon and he's very upbeat as  
usual,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said. ``He's not letting it 
get him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 19 seasons, Cruz set Houston career records for at bats  
(6,629), hits (1,937), triples (80), RBIs (942) and total bases 
(2,746). His son, Jose Jr., plays for the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cruz' absence, bullpen coach John Tamargo will take over  
first-base coaching duties.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Fined for Security Breach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines paid or has pending  
more than $120,000 in fines for security breaches at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport in the past two years, federal records show. 
Twice, agents were able to sneak dynamite bombs past airport 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has paid $21,500 in settling four breaches since 1997  
and has $99,000 in finds pending for nine other lapses, The Detroit 
News reported today, citing Federal Aviation Administration records 
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. A 14th violation 
was found but the level of fine was not yet set. 
</P>
<P>
	Among violations cited in the records:  
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 24, 1997, Northwest flew the checked bag of a federal  
aviation agent on a flight from the airport to Toronto. The special 
agent wasn't on the flight or any other headed to Toronto. 
Northwest settled the complaint for $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Undercover FAA agents successfully sneaked dynamite bombs  
through checkpoints during September 1997 tests -- once because a 
security guard was talking to a co-worker instead of looking at a 
monitor to check a briefcase's contents. The airline paid $10,500 
in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Nov. 6 security breach prompted by an unidentified man who  
avoided a checkpoint and walked through an exit-only door after a 
security guard failed to watch the door while reading a book. Fines 
were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials told the News that the number of citations was  
relatively high, though they stressed it can vary based on the 
number of undercover operations conducted at an airport. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA regional spokesman Tony Molinaro said the agency is ``much  
happier with the airport's security plan in the past three 
months,'' since a new security company was hired and safety 
measures were enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Northwest canceled the contract of its security  
company, Atlanta-based Argenbright Security Inc., in favor of 
Huntleigh Corp., which took over April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin declined to address specific  
incidents, noting that fines are routinely reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always concerned about security and work daily with the  
FAA on the subject,'' he said. ``We want the FAA to test our 
procedures and personnel so that we can identify and implement 
improvements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Katz, Wayne County's airport director, said the change in  
companies has enhanced Northwest's security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get more than a million passengers in here a month. It's  
pretty hard to bat 100 percent when it comes to security,'' he 
said. ``This is a safe airport, and Northwest is a safe airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Newman, an Argenbright spokeswoman in Atlanta, did not  
return several telephone calls, the News reported.

<HEADLINE> Test Says Chiasson Was Driving Drunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Steve Chiasson of the Carolina Hurricanes  
was drunk when he was killed in a pickup truck accident last week, 
a toxicology report showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	His blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal  
limit, the state Medical Examiner's Office in Chapel Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson's blood alcohol level was 0.27 when he died May 3. The  
legal limit in North Carolina is 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old player, an NHL defenseman for 13 years, was  
killed in a single-vehicle accident. He was thrown from his truck 
after leaving a party at the home of teammate Gary Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened hours after the Hurricanes had been  
eliminated from the playoffs in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we definitely feel for his family and friends, he was 3 1/2  
times over the legal limit,'' said Shannon Page, executive director 
for the state chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. ``Anyone 
who can walk at that level it is indicative of a larger problem. 
This was not a first-time drinker. We are grateful he didn't kill 
anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Kevin Dineen said Chiasson refused to wait for a taxi  
and decided to drive to his nearby home. He lost control of his 
truck around a curve on a two-lane road. He wasn't wearing a 
seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Chiasson was traveling 74 mph in a 55 mph zone when  
the accident occurred about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson is survived by his wife, Susan, and three young  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there with Steve,'' Dineen said Monday. ``I told Sue's  
family they should be prepared for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dineen said he was in the garage with Chiasson and went upstairs  
to get a teammate to drive the defenseman home, but Chiasson left 
before Dineen and others returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw the headlights of the car go out. He was down there by  
himself,'' Dineen said. ``He made a conscious decision to drive 
home. His state was impaired. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a bad judgment. We were out in the garage and he said,  
`I'm ready to go home and see the kids.' He was determined and 
stubborn enough to go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiasson also was exhausted after playing 40 minutes in a  
double-overtime loss in Game 5 against the Bruins on Friday night 
and then more than 30 minutes Sunday night, Dineen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had lost 10 pounds (on Friday night) and there was  
definitely a lot of physical exhaustion there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No other tests were conducted, including for drugs, said Sharon  
Fuqua, an office superivsor at the medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always run a test for alcohol,'' Fuqua said. ``If the  
police suspect drugs or they are found at the scene then we'll run 
more tests. That didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team released a one-paragraph statement on the toxicology  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in the healing process in losing a valued friend  
and teammate,'' the statement said. ``Obviously, we are 
disappointed in the toxicology report. However, a member of our 
hockey family lost his life and the feelings toward this reach far 
beyond the hockey element of this tragedy.''

	NATO Skeptical About Yugoslav Withdrawal  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. and NATO officials are  
skeptical about Yugoslavia's announcement that is has withdrawn 
part of its military and police forces from Kosovo. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright said even if statement is true, it's still 
a ``half measure'' and not enough to halt NATO airstrikes against 
Serb targets. A NATO spokesman said the report must be ``treated 
with caution.'' But he said a withdrawal could be a sign that the 
Serbs are feeling the effects of the bombing campaign, which began 
March 24.

	Clinton Apologizes for Embassy Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton apologized anew today for  
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, calling it ``an 
isolated tragic mistake.'' But he said NATO airstrikes will 
continue against Yugoslavia. Clinton said it was important to 
distinguish between the accidental bombing of the embassy and 
Slobodan Milosevic's policy of ``ethnic cleansing'' to drive ethnic 
Albanians from Kosovo. Meanwhile, the White House said protests in 
China were cooling. 

</P>
<P>
	US: 90 Pct. of Kosovars Expelled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 90 percent of all ethnic Albanians  
have been expelled from their homes in Kosovo by Serb forces and 
Serb civilians, the State Department said today. An estimated 
600,000 refugees are still in the Serbian province, struggling to 
survive, the report said. Another 700,000 have gone to Albania, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia or Montenegro, the smaller of 
Yugoslav's two republics. Another 130,000 found temporary haven in 
other countries.

	Clinton Holds Anti-Violence Conference  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has opened a meeting with  
entertainment industry leaders and parents and teachers concerning 
youth violence and said, ``we are not here to place blame.'' The 
summit is meant to produce ideas on how to curb violence involving 
children in the wake of a rampage at a Colorado high school. Among 
those invited were executives from the movie and video games 
industry, Internet experts, and gunmakers.

	Bubonic Plague Confirmed in Namibia  
</P>
<P>
	WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- Local medical authorities confirmed  
today an outbreak of bubonic plague in Namibia's populous 
north-central region that has killed three of the 73 people with 
the disease. Bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, killed 
an estimated 25 million people in Europe between 1346 and 1351, 
wiping out nearly one-third of the population. The disease is 
transmitted by fleas infecting rats which in turn infect humans. If 
left untreated, it can kill within three to five days. Today, it is 
easily treatable by powerful modern antibiotics.

	U S West Plans Phone-Computer Hybrid  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West plans later this year to become the  
first phone company to sell two new telephone-computer hybrids that 
feature one-button dialing to the Internet and other simplified 
ways to use the Web. The plug-in WebTouch phones made by Alcatel of 
France will be available this fall and U S West will offer wireless 
service for Qualcomm's Thin Phone by the end of the year. The new 
phones operate much the same way as a personal computer uses a 
modem to dial the user's Internet service, but reduces the process 
to one step. The Alcatel phone is expected to sell for several 
hundred dollars.

votes from a panel of sports writers and broadcasters.

	As defending Stanley Cup champions, the Detroit Red Wings have  
been regarded as the team to beat in the playoffs. So far, nobody 
has been able to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings are 6-0 in the postseason, and going home for two  
games following Sunday's 4-0 victory at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing with lots of energy,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``They're playing better as a team than we are right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's victory was a little easier for the Red Wings than the  
opener of their Western Conference semifinal series, a 3-2 overtime 
thriller. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never talked about going home up 2-0,'' Red Wings captain  
Steve Yzerman said. ``By no means can we relax. They could get back 
into this one if we aren't careful. Remember, the Avalanche have a 
great road record (3-0 in the playoffs), better than at home 
(1-4).'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Sunday, Buffalo beat Boston 3-1 and Toronto  
defeated Pittsburgh 4-2 to tie each of those Eastern Conference 
series at a game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs continue tonight with Dallas at St. Louis holding a  
2-0 lead in their best-of-7 Western Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored two goals and Bill Ranford gained his fourth  
career playoff shutout to lead the Red Wings, who won their 11th 
straight playoff game dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, seeking a third consecutive Stanley Cup, gave coach  
Scotty Bowman his 200th career playoff win -- extending his NHL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman scored in each of the first two periods, giving him  
eight goals in the playoffs to equal a career high. Nicklas 
Lidstrom and Wendel Clark added power-play goals in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, the 1990 NHL playoff MVP with Edmonton, started his  
second straight game in goal in place of the injured Chris Osgood, 
who is out with a sprained right knee. He had 28 saves, preserving 
his shutout with a diving stop on Peter Forsberg late in the first 
period and with back-to-back stops on Theo Fleury and Sylvain 
Lefebvre in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys played unbelievably in front of me,'' Ranford said.  
``There were times when I didn't see the puck, and they were able 
to block it out for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Roy had 33 saves in the Colorado net.  
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 will be played in Detroit on Tuesday and  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Sabres 3, Bruins 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Goaltender Dominik Hasek, rebounding from an opening-game loss,  
looked more like the NHL's two-time MVP as the visiting Sabres beat 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, looking a lot sharper than he did in the Sabres' 4-2 loss  
to Boston on Thursday, stopped 28 of 29 shots this time as Buffalo 
wiped out the Bruins' home-ice advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek seemed headed for his fifth career playoff shutout before  
Don Sweeney scored on a power play with 5:57 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca, Curtis Brown and Dixon Ward scored for the Sabres,  
who will host the next two games of the series on Wednesday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Maple Leafs 4, Penguins 2    	
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin broke out of his scoring slump to lead the Maple  
Leafs over the visiting Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Sundin scored his second and third postseason goals and assisted  
on goals by Steve Thomas and Lonny Bohonos, recently brought up 
from the minors to start on the Maple Leafs' first line. 
</P>
<P>
	Kip Miller and German Titov beat Curtis Joseph, who was  
otherwise at his acrobatic best. 
</P>
<P>
	The series switches to Pittsburgh for Games 3 and 4 on Tuesday  
and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> IOC Exec Explains Cole Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An investigation of IOC member Phil  
Coles will focus on possible ``linkage'' between repeated trips to 
Salt Lake City and any services given to Olympic bidders there, a 
committee leader said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevan Gosper, an International Olympic Committee executive board  
member from Australia, said Coles' behavior ``somewhat reflects a 
continuous pattern of misjudgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper denied speculation that he had been sent to Sydney by  
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to fire Coles or force his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be quite unusual for me to come out here, an  
investigation having been set up, to tell Phil Coles what he should 
do and what he shouldn't do,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been severely warned by IOC leaders for accepting  
lavish travel and other benefits from Salt Lake bidders, and is now 
under investigation for further allegations of abusing his Olympic 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife has told the IOC that the couple received jewelry  
valued at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid 
for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And news reports last week in the United States and Australia  
said Coles and his current partner, Patricia Rosenbrock, had 
written notes on 400 pages of Australian government reviews of IOC 
members that were conducted for Sydney's successful bid for the 
2000 Games but passed on to Salt Lake's 2002 bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.,  
said the three-member IOC panel appointed last week would 
investigate ``whether there was any linkage in any chain of events 
which works backwards from the original investigation into Phil's 
many visits to Salt Lake City after the bid was won by that city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper met with his Australian colleague Monday and said he  
filled in Coles on the latest inquiry. He said there was no plot to 
oust Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no persons, I know of no information that suggests  
there is a conspiracy against Phil Coles -- and I told him that,'' 
Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has been the target of repeated calls to resign from the  
IOC or from the board of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic Games. The latest came early Monday from Jackie Kelly, 
Australia's sports minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``His time has come,'' Kelly said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles has stepped aside from SOCOG pending the IOC  
investigations but he expects to be cleared and to return to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position has not changed,'' Coles said. ``I have to appear  
before the (IOC) and Mr. Gosper has no role to play in that. The 
(IOC) meeting will take place and I'll present my case and I'll be 
cleared.''

	HOOD RIVER, Ore. (AP) -- One woman was killed and another injured  
Sunday after a loading ramp fell on them during a Mother's Day 
cruise on the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials say the Queen of the West cruise ship had  
moored at Hood River when the accident occurred about 11:30 a.m. 
The women, who were together on the cruise, were on the deck below

<HEADLINE> Northwest/KLM, Alitalia To Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch  
Airlines are adding Alitalia Italian Airlines to their partnership 
in flights across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines will submit a joint application Tuesday to the U.S.  
Department of Transportation for antitrust clearance, allowing 
Alitalia, KLM and Northwest to coordinate their trans-Atlantic 
route networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alliance means the airlines will list each other's  
flights in their computers and coordinate frequent-flyer plans. 
Doug Steenland, a vice president with Northwest, said customers can 
expect lower fares and the convenience of seamless flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Steenland also he expects the alliance to boost profits and  
revenue for all three airlines in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Rosso, a vice president with Alitalia, said his company  
studied other partnership possibilities before deciding to join 
Northwest and KLM. 
</P>
<P>
	``We concluded that the joint-venture approach ... used by  
Northwest and KLM was the best example to really enhance a 
corporation with the best results that you can forecast on paper,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the alliance, the airlines would coordinate schedules at  
U.S. and Italian hubs and gateways. It also would include joint 
pricing and inventory management, as well as sharing of facilities 
services, marketing, advertising and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliances are becoming increasingly common in the international  
aviation industry, where travel is booming. Leading airlines 
realized long ago it wouldn't be feasible to get big enough to 
cover the entire globe single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest and KLM began code-sharing in 1993. KLM and Alitalia  
entered an alliance in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a University of Illinois study on the benefits of  
international alliances, Northwest officials said last week their 
alliance with KLM has saved passengers between $110 million and 
$180 million annually because of lower fares. Jon Austin, a 
spokesman for Northwest, said the addition of Alitalia could 
produce even larger savings.

<HEADLINE> May Stores Earnings Climb 17 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The May Department Stores Co.'s first-quarter  
earnings climbed more than 17 percent from a year ago, boosted by a 
surge in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based retailer reported Monday that it earned $122  
million, or 34 cents a share, compared with $110 million, or 29 
cents a share in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2.94 billion, up from $2.72 billion last year.  
</P>
<P>
	May's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates, but its  
stock closed down 43 3/4 cents at $44.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	May discontinued its consumer electronics business at the  
beginning of fiscal 1999, which depressed its sales figures by 
about 1 percent for the quarter and the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the board of directors authorized the  
repurchase of up to $500 million of May shares during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	May opened two new stores in the first quarter, one in Nittany  
Mall in Pennsylvania and a Famous-Barr store in Kentucky. The 
company plans to open 16 additional new stores this year. 
</P>
<P>
	May now operates 394 department stores in 32 states and the  
District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Armstead for $33 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jessie Armstead signed a  
seven-year, $33 million contract with the New York Giants on 
Monday, making him one of the NFL's highest paid linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants also signed center Lance Scott, a starter much of the  
last two seasons, to a two-year contract, general manager Ernie 
Accorsi said. Terms were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstead, who has led the Giants in tackles the last three  
years, will receive a $6 million signing bonus, Drew Rosenhaus, his 
agent, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice getting it resolved for him and the Giants,''  
Rosenhaus said in a telephone interview. ``He has been a great 
player for the Giants and this puts him among the highest paid 
linebackers in the league, and deservedly so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making the deal, the Giants and Armstead, 28, tore up the  
remaining four years left on his current contract and wrote a new 
seven-year deal. By doing that the team gets some salary cap relief 
and it can prorate the signing bonus over the length of the 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants will open a veterans minicamp on Tuesday at Giants  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstead had planned to attend the camp, Rosenhaus said, adding  
the start of minicamp and the signing were a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted him in the circle of the highest paid linebackers,''  
Accorsi said. ``He deserved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing much of the season with a badly sprained ankle,  
Armstead led the Giants (8-8) with 101 tackles, 75 solos. The 
weakside linebacker also had five sacks, a team-high three forced 
fumbles and five passes defended. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstead, an eighth-round draft pick in 1993, is the first Giant  
to lead the team in tackles for three straight years since Pepper 
Johnson from 1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who was a free agent, will have to battle Brian Williams  
for the starting job this year. Williams is attempting to return to 
football after missing the last two seasons with an eye injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's our long snapper and our backup center and guard,''  
Accorsi said of Scott. ``He has a lot of incentives. The more he 
plays the more he gets.''

<HEADLINE> Vigra Rival Has Disappointing Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A potential competitor to the blockbuster  
impotence drug Viagra won't be available for at least a year 
because its sponsors need more time to prove it works. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough Corp. and partner Zonagen Inc. said Monday they  
will postpone completing the Food and Drug Administration review 
process for their experimental pill Vasomax. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent stock in Zonagen, a tiny biotech company based  
outside Houston, plummeting nearly 50 percent Monday. It fell $9.13 
to close at $10.69 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of 
Schering-Plough, a much bigger company whose stock isn't dependent 
on the drug, rose 44 cents to $50.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra, introduced by Pfizer Inc. in April 1998, had $788  
million in U.S. sales last year. The first pill to treat impotence 
became an instant success, and is the fastest selling new drug in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Viagra, at about $8 a pill, is expensive and competition  
could help drive down the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Zonagen, which is developing Vasomax, joined with  
Schering-Plough in November 1997. Zonagen, which has no drugs on 
the market, applied for FDA approval in July 1998, and approval was 
expected this summer. The drug is approved for use in Mexico under 
the brand name Z-Max. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we are disappointed with this delay, we believe that  
the additional data from Schering-Plough's studies are important to 
the long-term success of Vasomax,'' said Joseph S. Podolski, 
Zonagen's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Zonagen nor Schering-Plough would release the results of  
the tests that prompted the delay in the drug application. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said  
Zonagen's early studies show that Vasomax is not nearly as 
effective in producing an erection as Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the studies show Vasomax only effective about 40 percent  
of the time compared to about 70 percent for Viagra. ``This 
announcement is without doubt a most unwelcome surprise,'' Sweig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Podolski acknowledges some data shows Vasomax lacking against  
Viagra. But he contends there are many ways to measure success. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes that after the additional studies are completed  
the company will show that the drugs work similarly. 
</P>
<P>
	Podolski predicted that Vasomax will be proven safer than Viagra  
in men with heart trouble. Viagra is dangerous when taken by those 
who also take certain heart drugs such as nitroglycerin. Also, 
Vasomax works in about 15 to 30 minutes, about twice as quick as 
Viagra, Podolski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay in Vasomax will likely put its sponsors behind TAP  
Pharmaceuticals in the race to launch the first Viagra competitor 
</P>
<P>
	TAP, a joint venture between Abbott Laboratories and Japanese  
drugmaker Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. expects to seek federal 
approval for its anti-impotence pill Uprima in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, TAP presented data at a medical conference showing  
the largest dose of Uprima is 61 percent effective compared to 29 
percent for a dummy pill.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta's Crawford Injured in Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Hawks forward Chris Crawford separated  
his right shoulder Monday night when he tumbled to the court after 
a tip-in during Game 2 of the first-round playoff series against 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford scored the first six points for the Hawks, the last  
basket coming as he tipped in a missed shot by Mookie Blaylock with 
9:08 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9 forward stretched out to reach the ball and fell to  
the court, landing hard on his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawford, taken to the locker room for X-rays, returned to the  
bench in the second half wearing street clothes. He was diagnosed 
with a minor separation and listed as day to day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Atlanta won 89-69 for a 2-0 lead in the  
best-of-5 series. Game 3 is Wednesday night in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had this freak accident happen,'' Crawford said.  
``Hopefully, I'll come back in a little bit and be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury further depleted the Hawks' depth.  
</P>
<P>
	Crawford started the final 30 games of the regular season after  
LaPhonso Ellis was sidelined with a sports hernia. Forward Alan 
Henderson, still suffering double vision caused by a severe 
abrasion to his left eye, did not play Monday after working only 
four minutes in Game 1.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Landslide Kills Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAUULA, Hawaii (AP) -- Dozens of people were relaxing and sunning  
themselves at one of Hawaii's most spectacular hiking spots when 
boulders the size of small cars suddenly rained down. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were killed and dozens injured in the Sunday  
landslide that let loose with all sizes of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat-seeking cameras and military search dogs did not find any  
more bodies Monday underneath tons of rubble at Sacred Falls State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But searchers, who had to dodge falling debris as they looked,  
returned to the scene after one injured hiker said he did not know 
what happened to his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of hikers were taking in the view and weather at a pool  
beneath the park's 90-foot falls when the landslide began 600 feet 
above them. Hikers and rescuers told harrowing stories about 
bringing victims out of the rubble. Many suffered head injuries and 
some lost limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were bodies everywhere,'' said David Pahk, 37, a  
volunteer with the Sacred Falls Assistance Program that hands out 
bottled water and sunscreen to often-unprepared hikers. 
</P>
<P>
	He and a dozen others worked frantically to save the life of a  
young girl, carrying her out the trail on a stretcher and sharing 
CPR efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just died in our hands,'' he said. ``No one gave up hope.  
We fought for her all the way down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After flying over the area, state Department of Land and Natural  
Resources geologist Glenn Bauer said: ``It looks like the cliff 
face came away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four victims were female, and two were male, including Air Force  
Master Sgt. Scott Huling, who was stationed at Hickam Air Force 
Base. His age and hometown was not available. The victims also 
included a young girl from the family of an Air Force staff 
sergeant. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the injured remained hospitalized, including a  
2-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	State geologists said the valley on the northeast coast of the  
island of Oahu remained unstable, forcing the closure of the state 
park. 
</P>
<P>
	The park in the lushly forested Koolau Range is about 30 miles  
north of Honolulu. The falls spill into a pool, reachable by a 
2.2-mile trail, at the base of a 90-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unsafe for our rescue people or anybody to go up  
there,'' Honolulu Fire Chief Attilio Leonardi said Monday. ``When 
we went up this morning, debris was still falling down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our geologist says there are areas in there probably where  
more rubble will fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The park has long been known as one of Hawaii's most dangerous.  
Since 1970, more than a dozen people have died in flash floods or 
hiking accidents at the park.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Works To Regain Scoring Touch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The playoffs clearly have hit a critical stage  
for the Pittsburgh Penguins -- even Jaromir Jagr senses the need to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr did not skate Monday during the Penguins' optional off-day  
practice for Tuesday night's Game 3 against the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, but did put on his practice gear to work on restoring his 
shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr has rested on off days since straining a groin muscle  
during the first game of the New Jersey series, and the NHL scoring 
champion said the practice layoff has affected his shooting, 
judgment and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	His statistics, too: He has no goals and only one assist in two  
games despite taking his regular shifts against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the puck in the slot and I don't know whether to shoot  
or pass,'' Jagr said. ``The confidence isn't there. You get 
confidence in practice, but I haven't been practicing. I'm taking 
that extra second to shoot it. I've got to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr realizes the Penguins must be accurate on their scoring  
opportunities because Maple Leafs goaltender Curtis Joseph is 
playing so well, allowing only 12 goals in eight playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph turned aside 25 of 27 shots as Toronto evened the series  
by winning 4-2 Sunday in Toronto. Just as important for the Maple 
Leafs, Mats Sundin came out of a slump with two goals and two 
assists and Lonny Bohonos scored the first goal in his first NHL 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave us our confidence back, especially knowing that Tom  
Barrasso had shut us out (2-0) in Game 1,'' the Maple Leafs' Steve 
Thomas said. 
</P>

	The Penguins need Jagr to do the same, but the groin injury has  
stripped him of his ability to dominate games with his skating, 
stickhandling and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's tough for me is I can't use my speed,'' he said. ``All  
I can use is my hands. I can't challenge one on one and that's the 
worst thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr needs to take off several days to let the groin injury heal  
properly, but that's not possible while playing every other day. 
Yet the longer the injury persists, the more it affects his play. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring two goals in the Penguins' momentum-swinging  
victory in Game 6 against New Jersey and setting up two goals in 
Game 7, he is 0-for-6 shooting in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Kevin Constantine said Jagr is capable of helping  
the Penguins even at 60 to 70 percent efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be a positive to us if he were breathing,'' he said.  
``He's just a talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a competitive person who wants to help. He puts aside the  
pain and plays. The possibility of him doing something is strong, 
whether he's injured or not. He feels he will do something along 
the way that will help us win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr plans to keep playing unless he aggravates the injury.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to improve day by day, but I can't pull it  
or make it worse,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs haven't resorted to hooking or whacking Jagr's  
injured right leg, as the Devils did in a seemingly blatant attempt 
to reinjure him after Jagr returned in Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto hasn't done that yet, but don't tell them that,'' Jagr  
said, laughing.
