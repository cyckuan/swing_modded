<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Drops in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
rate dropped from 8 percent in September to a 14-month low of 7.5
percent in October this year, the Central Statistics Service
(CSS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The rate was only 0.1 percentage point higher than in August
1996.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase of the consumer price index (CPI), as
well as the increase in the seasonally adjusted index, was 0.4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The CPI increase was mainly due to price hikes in food,
housing and transport with each contributing to 0.1 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The price index for food showed an annual growth rate of 6.8
percent in October, 1.5 percentage points lower than the 8.3
percent in September.
</P>
<P>
It registered a monthly increase of 0.8 percent, also lower
than the corresponding rate of 2.2 percent in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although inflation was easing, South Africa's economy slowed
down significantly in the third quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to CSS figures released on Tuesday, South Africa's
GDP growth nose-dived to only 0.3 percent in the third quarter,
compared with the 2.4 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to bad behavior in most of the
economic sectors, especially in manufacturing, electricity, gas
and water, and construction.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Doubts Credibility of Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the latest Israeli redeployment proposal is
"neither adequately serious nor credible to be feasible for
salvaging the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after a meeting with his visiting French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine who also held talks with President
Hosni Mubarak on the Mideast peace process, the U.N.-Iraq crisis
and bilateral relations during his short visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's remarks came in response to a proposal reportedly put
forward by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on offering
the Palestinian National Authority 6-8 percent of the West Bank
area now under sole Israeli control in further pullbacks as
stipulated in the Hebron agreement signed in January.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Vedrine said the peace process needs practical
proposals to get it moving again.
</P>
<P>
"Our worries are identical vis-a-vis the grave crisis in the
Middle East peace march," he said. "We, once again, evaluated all
our drives in this domain to see how to reactivate the process,"
Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
All the world at present are preoccupied with the peace
process, including, in particular, Egypt, France, the EU, the U.S.
and some people in Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All have agreed that what is needed is an even-handed
political solution that stems from the commitments already
pledged," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Vedrine will also meet with Arab League
Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Meguid to discuss the European role
in the Middle East peace process and means of promoting Euro-Arab
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's three-day Mideast tour has so far taken him to Israel
and the Palestinian self-rule area. He will complete his mission
with another tour, scheduled to begin on January 12 next year,
which will include visits to Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister had prepared for his visit through
intensified consultations with his European partners in Luxembourg
last weekend. He also contacted his U.S., Russian, German and
British counterparts.

concluding his four-day official visit to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing here, he said his visit to Ethiopia has

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Proceed with Farm Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said here today the acquisition of farms for resettlement
would proceed with or without the assistance of the British
government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a two-hour meeting with Nick
Swanepoel and David Husluck, president and director of the
Commercial Farmers Union respectively, Mugabe said the colonial
exercise would be corrected once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The government had not gone to Britain to beg for money but to
tell the British that the land question had not been resolved at
the Lancaster house talks in 1979 and had nearly brought a
dead-lock to the talks which result in Zimbabwe's independence in
1980, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I insisted that our team which was going to negotiate make it
clear there was no way we could go back to accepting a
willing-seller settlement or accept to pay compensation to
farmers for the purchase of the land. We are only prepared to
pay for improvements on the land," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he had briefed the farmers on the land issue and
gave them the background which included setting up the machinery
for assessing the land at provincial and national level.
</P>
<P>
A list of 1,503 farms identified for designation would be
gazetted on Friday, Mugabe said, adding that the government was
willing to listen to ideas and incorporate them into the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel said they had expressed to the president farmers'
concerns over the land issue which included the criteria followed
in the designation of farms.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not elaborate on the concerns, saying he would
comment after the list had been gazetted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GDP Maintain Robust Growth in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Strong consumer spending
and the active business investment in equipment in nearly 14 years
pushed economic growth to a robust 3.3 percent annual rate, the
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter's expansion was achieved with little
inflation. A price measure linked to GDP inched up at a 1.5
percent annual rate, the smallest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number
of first-time claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 31,000
to 303,000 last week. It was the sharpest decrease since early
August.
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly economic growth marks a slight downward
revision from the 3.5 percent estimated a month ago. The
department attributed the change to somewhat weaker export growth,
slower growth in commercial construction and a diminished rate of
inventory accumulation.
</P>
<P>
In October, orders to factories for durable goods fell 0.3
percent to a seasonally adjusted 185.9 billion U. S. dollars after
advancing only 0.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the first drop since May. However, purchases of durable
goods by consumers and businesses were the driving force in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending overall rose at a 5.8 percent annual rate,
the fastest pace in about 5 years. Americans' purchases of durable
goods, items from cars to computers, shot up at an 18.2 percent
pace, the best in about 9 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business spending on equipment from trucks to
turbines soared at a 24.1 percent rate, the best since the final
three months of 1983.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction rose at a 3.7 percent rate and
government spending at a 1.1 percent pace.

ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Pakistan will continue to hear a petition challenging the 13th
Amendment to the Constitution on Thursday, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment, which was passed by the Parliament in April

Last Friday, a five-member bench headed by Chief Justice of the

If the Supreme Court upholds the petition against the 13th

which the President has the powers to dissolve the National
Assembly, will be restored, according to the sources.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho AIDS Cases to Rise to 40,000 in Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- There will be one AIDS
patient in every 50 Lesotho citizens in four years, South African
Press Association quoted a Lesotho report as saying today.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 people will have full blown AIDS (acquired
immuno-deficiency syndrome) in Lesotho in four years time, the
Lesotho National AIDS Prevention and Control Program said in a
report released to coincide with the commemoration of World AIDS
Day next Monday.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the epidemic could have potential devastating
consequences on the country's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government is expected to adopt a multi-sectoral
approach to combat the fatal disease. This will include more
participation by the public and private sectors, non-governmental
organizations, institutes of higher learning and the donor
community, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics in the report, AIDS cases rose to
2,400 by mid-1997. The number of new cases reported countrywide
reached the highest annual figure of 936 last year.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's capital, Maseru, had the highest prevalence rate,
with 43 percent of HIV-infected women found there.
</P>
<P>
The HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) virus leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Young people in the 20 to 39 age group were the most
susceptible to the disease, the statistics showed. These
constituted 65 percent of reported cases. Women patients
dominated this age group while male patients dominated the 40 to
59 years age group.
</P>
<P>
The number of children orphaned as a result of the disease
also increased.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the quick spread of the disease to
migrant labor.
</P>
<P>
The movement of most Lasotho men to South Africa in search for
jobs increased the risk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Rural to urban migrations within Lesotho led to high
concentrations of predominantly male communities and increased
the prevalence of commercial sex in urban areas, thus
accelerating the spread of HIV virus.

<HEADLINE> Coup-Attempt Trial in Qatar Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A trial held by Qatar today
on 110 people accused of involvement in a foiled coup attempt in
1996 has been adjourned to next year, said reports reaching here
from Doha.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters, Abudullah Yousuf al Mal,
prosecutor general of the Qatari Supreme Court said the trial will
be postponed to "February 11 next year to enable laywers to study
trial-related files and consider requested evidence."
</P>
<P>
The court made the decision after defenders asked for a
postponement to read the files. Seventy defendants appeared in
court today, while 40 others, including former interior minister
Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani, are being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The defendants have been charged with treason for involvement
in the coup against Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani, who
toppled his father in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Defendants grumbled during today's trial that the court did not
allow them to see their lawyers and relatives when they were
prisoned, al Mal said.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that those defendants who were absent
from today's session will be informed by the police of the
countries in which they are living.
</P>
<P>
If they keep absent during next year's trial, they will be
judged by default, he said. Two Egyptians and one Bahraini are
being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has said the two Egyptians, Attiya Badri and Ahmed Tawfic
Said were from the Egyptian army and some Qatari officials,
including the Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin Jassim Jabir
al-Thani made comments implicating Cairo in the failed coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt denied the charges. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said that the two Egyptian suspects are "retired army officers
who had temporary work contract with the Qatari government."
</P>
<P>
Egypt also called on Qatar to clarify its position towards the
charges.

<HEADLINE> WTO Publishes Report of EU's Trade Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's single
market program and liberalization under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have generally improved access conditions for
the EU's trading partners and increased exposure of the EU economy
to international competition and structural change, WTO stated in
its report on the EU's trade policies and practices published here
today.
</P>
<P>
However, despite progressive liberalization, there are still
significant internal obstacles to efficient resource allocation,
resulting in higher costs in some industrial and services sectors
with adverse consequences on growth and competitiveness, the
report points out.
</P>
<P>
The report covers changes since the last Trade Policy Review,
held in 1995. The report prepared by the WTO secretariat, along
with a policy statement prepared by the EU itself, provides the
basis for a review of the EU's trade policies and practices in the
WTO Trade Policy Review Body on November 25-26.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report concludes that the EU's trade policies and
practices have generally evolved in a favorable direction.
</P>
<P>
This should benefit both the EU and its trading partners, the
report says, adding at the same time that the present transitional
period in European economic integration presents challenges both
for the EU and the multilateral trading system.

<HEADLINE> Political Impasse Continues in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The political standoff
between India's Congress party and the ruling United Front
continued when the former decided tonight to send one more letter
to Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral instead of withdrawing
support to the minority government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the decision was made by
the Congress Working Committee, the supreme decision-making body
of the Congress party, which met here tonight to discuss moves on
the current political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered last week following the release of an
investigative report which accused the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham
(DMK), a major constituent of the ruling United Front, of being
linked with the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After the report was tabled in the parliament last Thursday,
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri wrote to Prime Minister
Gujral demanding the removal of three DMK ministers from the
government.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Congress party will otherwise withdraw its
crucial support to the minority government.
</P>
<P>
In a reply to Kesri on Monday, however, Gujral rejected the
Congress' demand but agreed to talk with the party on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At its meeting held here tonight, the Congress Working
Committee apparently did not approve immediate withdrawal of
support to the 13-party United Front government.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the two-hour meeting, Congress party spokesman
V.N. Gadgil told reporters that a letter is being sent tonight to
Prime Minister Gujral in response to his letter rejecting the
Congress party's demand for sacking the three DMK ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The content of the letter is confidential," the spokesman
said, declining to elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Continues to Fall Despite Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee continued
to slide against the U.S. dollar today touching 38.72 in intra-day
trading before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened with
massive dollar selling, helping it close at 38.54/60 rupees on
Bombay's foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
This is the third day in succession that the rupee has plunged
to an all-time low against the dollar, largely due to currency
speculators taking advantage of the continued turmoil in the
political scene of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, for most of the day,
banks tested the RBI reference level of 38.56 and extensively
bought dollars in the wake of heavy corporate demand and offshore
fundings, sending the currency to its lowest-ever level of 38.72
at noon.
</P>
<P>
However, RBI's reported intervention of between 50 and 100

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Opposition Safina Party Registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government
registered influential opposition Safina party today, 33 days
before the country's second multi-party general election set for
December 29.
</P>
<P>
This brought the total number of registered political parties
to 22 in the eastern African country, meaning its presidential
race may attract 22 contenders at most.
</P>
<P>
"The government has allowed the registration of all political
parties whose applications are pending with the Registrar of
Societies. This includes Safina," said a brief statement from the
Presidential Press Service (PPS).
</P>
<P>
However, the party's Secretary-General, Richard Leakey, told a
press conference today that the party has so far not decided
whether to take part in or still boycott the elections. The
decision is to be announced tomorrow, he added.
</P>
<P>
"While welcoming the news Safina has been granted
registration, we condemn in the strongest terms the
unconstitutional and undemocratic processes that occasioned the
delay," said Leakey.
</P>
<P>
Safina was denied registration on the grounds of posing
threats to "peace, welfare and good order in Kenya" at the
beginning of October when other 10 parties were registered.
</P>
<P>
"The delay in registration has clearly been a tactic by the
government to wrong-foot the pro-democracy movement and the last
minute decision to give us legitimacy in law is surely intended
to divide the opposition," Leakey claimed.
</P>
<P>
Safina, which means Noah's Ark in Swahili language, was set up
in June 1995 with the aim to unite opposition parties as many as
possible in an attempt to defeat President Daniel arap Moi in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 74 and in power for 19 years, is the sole presidential
candidate of the ruling Kenya African National Union party and
widely believed to win the election for another five-year rule.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Defends Iran's Supreme Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today defended the country's supreme leadership,
describing it as the backbone of the Islamic system of government,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a large group of Basij (mobilization
volunteer) forces here this afternoon, Khamenei, the leader of the
Islamic Revolution in 1979, asked his supporters to halt protest
rallies with the aim of calming down the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said he, as a member of this nation, is duty bound to
defend the supreme leadership, Velayat-e Faqih (governance of
supreme religious jurisprudent).
</P>
<P>
More and more groups, factions and figures have announced to
hold large rallies throughout the country Friday in order to
voice their support for the country's supreme leadership and
condemn the controversial remarks by Aytallah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, a religious canonist.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri accused Khamenei of having too much interference in
the government's affairs and claimed that a leader should be
supervisor to monitor the government's affairs rather than
directly intervene.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, rallies and demonstrations were held
throughout the country and even hundreds of religious teachers
and students attacked Montazeri's office in the religious city of
Qom.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that "the recent conspiracies to erode Velayat-e
Faqih have been architected by the enemies and carried out by some
naive individuals."
</P>
<P>
He said that with a strong leadership, all the conspiracies of
the enemies have failed and would face similar fate in the
future.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- All the Boeing 747 passenger
planes which are in service in France have been subjected to
technical checks, in order to prevent a technical failure similar
to the U.S. TWA 800 plane, said the French Minister of Transport
Jean-Claude Gayssot today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authorities have been analyzing the
recommendations from the Federal Agency of Aviation (FAA) of the
United States, which is the authority to issue certificates to the
Boeing 747 jets.
</P>

A hythothesis on a technical failure in the central reservoir
was raised after the TWA 800 passenger plane exploded in Long
Island Coast, New York, on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 people
on board.
</P>

Recommended inspections of Boeing 747 planes were made
immediately obligatory to all French operators using the type of
plane and it has allowed the correction of some defaults, said the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Stock Market Sets Up Standby Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced tonight that the Kuala Lumpur
Stock Exchange (KLSE) has set up a standby fund of 500 million
ringgit (about 143 million U.S. dollars) in case any member
company needs help to reduce possible systemic risks in a currency
and stock market crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The KLSE committee has approved a KLSE/SCANS (Securities
Clearing Automated Network Services) standby fund," Anwar, who is
also finance minister, said at the KLSE annual dinner here.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount was decided after a thorough study.
</P>
<P>
As for the equity market, he said, the KLSE was monitoring on a
daily basis the financial position of all stockbroking companies,
including their exposure to clients.
</P>
<P>
There has been no default of payment to the clearing house by
any member company, Anwar said, adding that in fact four of these
companies had increased their paid-up capital to improve their
share-holders fund position and another two were making plans to
do so.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all those involved in securities industries to
identify new plans to revive current plans to satisfy their
clients' needs and provide sound continuity for themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Member companies must continue to perform their duty of
marketing our stocks. Our analyses must maintain their
objectivity. If they keep following the foreign herd and
downgrading Malaysian companies which are strong and stable, the
situation will take a longer time to improve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said it was everyone's responsibility to see the nation
through this trying period.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would meet the challenge of restoring
confidence in the market by maintaining a sound financial system.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's currency and stock markets have been in a downward
trend since July when a currency crisis hit the Southeast Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's currency -- the ringgit, today ended at 3.4920/20 to
the U.S. dollar, marginally higher against Tuesday's 3.4960 and
2.5200 in early July.
</P>
<P>
But the KLSE today closed sharply lower with further losses on
financial counters, in line with the weakening sentiment of
regional financial sectors following problems faced by Japan.
</P>
<P>
At today's close, the 100-quality stocks Composite Index (CI)
fell 15.45 points to 526.12, the all-share Emas Index dropped
5.15 points to 142.36, the Second Board Index lost 8.00 points to
235.35 while the Industrial Index was 17.70 points lower at
1,066.52.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE's CI stood at over 1,000 points in early July this
year.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriots to Organize Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Greek and Turkish
Cypriot organizations have initiated a first joint event "The
Festival for Peace" in an effort for rapprochement between the
two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The event will be held Saturday at the Ledra Palace Hotel
in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Stephanos Stephanou,
representing the Greek Cypriot organizations involved in this
event, said "the festival comes at a time when military
activities and armaments are on the increase and increased
nationalism poses a grave danger for new conflicts and wars."
</P>
<P>
He called on everybody who backs efforts for rapprochement
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, forcibly
separated since the 1974 Turkish invasion, to attend Saturday's
fiesta.
</P>
<P>
Cemal Ozit, representing the Turkish Cypriot organizations,
warned that another war on the island will leave all the
Cypriots "in tears."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that neither the Turkish nor the Greek
Cypriots are responsible for the present situation on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Organizers told reporters that they had decided to set up a
permanent coordinating committee to promote common goals for
peace through joint meetings and various functions.
</P>
<P>
"Contact between us so far has convinced us that the two
communities have joint objectives, common fears and visions,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday's event is expected to adopt a declaration
against war and for a common homeland.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over 37 percent of the island following a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> UN General Assembly Urges "Olympic Truce " </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly of
the United Nations today called on all member states to cooperate
the International Olympic Committee in promoting the Olympic Truce
and urged them to observe it during the XVIII Olympic Winter Games
to be held in Nagano, Japan, in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the idea of Olympic Truce, an ancient Greek
tradition revived by the General Assembly in 1993, countries agree
to stop all hostilities during the course of the Games.
</P>
<P>
In adopting a resolution on the building of a peaceful and
better world through sport and the Olympic ideal, the Assembly
also welcomed the decision of the International Olympic Committee
to fly the United Nations flag at all Olympic Games sites.
</P>
<P>
Further, the Assembly asked UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
promote the observance of the Olympic Truce and draw world opinion
to its contribution to international understanding, peace and
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Secretary-General to cooperate with the
International Olympic Committee in realizing that object.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before adopting the resolution, the representative of
Australia Penny Wensley said that flying the United Nations flag
at Olympic Games had more than symbolic value, and it would be a
visible, daily remainder of the importance of the United Nations,
shared ideas and the commitment of participants to sport and the
promotion of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the resolution, Japan's representative Mikako
Kotani said fair competition in the spirit of sportsmanship
fostered mutual respect that excluded discrimination based on race,
religion, gender, or nationality, and served to deepen mutual
goodwill.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Running on IMF Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Tuesday
approved a second letter of intent outlining the country's
economic rehabilitation plans and pledging to continue to take
necessary measures to revive the economy with the aid of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The letter, which will be submitted to the IMF for review to
facilitate the transfer of the second tranche of its 17.2 billion
U.S. dollar aid package, included the new Thai government's policy
adjustments as well as new steps to keep Thailand running on the
track co-laid with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In the revised letter of intent, the government led by Chuan
Leekpai, which was sworn in on November 15, reassessed Thailand's
key economic targets for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
It admitted that Thailand now is facing some problems,
including the weakness in short-term macro-economic planning.
</P>
<P>
The slower return of confidence has further caused the baht to
depreciate, mounted pressure on interest rates and resulted in
sharper decline in private investments and consumption than
originally anticipated, the Thai finance ministry said on Tuesday
in a press release on the letter.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the new government adjusted Thailand's economic
growth targets set by the previous government of Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, lowering them to 0.6 percent for this year and 0-1
percent for 1998 but slightly raising the inflation control
targets to 10 percent for 1997 and 6 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan government also unveiled concrete measures or
timetables for tackling major economic problems, especially those
facing the country's battered financial sector, and pledged to
push ahead with some plans of the previous government.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministry said the government has introduced fiscal
measures to trim the country's current account deficit as required
by the IMF, citing budget cuts and tax hikes for example.
</P>
<P>
On monetary policy, the ministry said the Thai central bank
will stick to a tight monetary stance and set interest rates
mainly with the objective to help stabilize the baht and restore
confidence in domestic financial assets.
</P>
<P>
The government will also act as quickly as possible to remove
the limits on the purchasing, selling and borrowing of baht by
non-residents, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government set timetables and guidelines in
the letter for the Financial Restructuring Agency (FRA) and the
Asset Management Corporation (AMC) to work on bailing out 58
suspended finance firms and reinforcing other financial
institutions remaining in operation, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministry is set to decide by December 7 whether or
which of the 58 finance firms will reopen. It has set a timetable
to implement the measures announced by the previous government
last month for strengthening the existing healthy financial
institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, privatization is one of the key medium-term
goals for the government and it will announce firm plans in the
area by June next year, including reduction of government stakes
in the national airline.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is currently urging the IMF to review its
performance in the economic rehabilitation process after it
withdrew a tranche of 1.6 billion dollars from the IMF in August
this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Allegations of Spying on UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied allegations
that it is spying on contacts and the activities of the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was in no need of spying on UNSCOM contacts or activities
because Iraq had no proscribed weapons or materials to conceal
before the U.N. inspection teams, the agency quoted an official
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times carried an article Tuesday, which quoted a
UNSCOM spokesman as saying that Iraq is spying on UNSCOM contacts
or activities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that Iraq had opened the doors for
the UNSCOM to inspect Iraqi factories, installations and
laboratories and fully cooperated with the commission within its
fulfillment of obligations toward relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM spokesman and those who support him in Washington
such as U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen "who has a hand in
raising the same charges, are well aware that their charges fall
short of evidence," the Iraqi spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen issued a statement recently, saying that Iraqi
authorities had obstructed U.N. weapons inspectors' access to some
suspected sites in Iraq. Iraq has denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"If those charges were true," said the spokesman, "They would
be raised before Iraqi authorities and even the U.N. Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the UNSCOM spokesman's claim that by spying on
UNSCOM contacts, Iraq authorities would know the sites that the
UNSCOM intended to inspect and conceal proscribed weapons before
U.N. monitoring teams arrived, the Iraqi spokesman said for many
times, heads of many inspection teams had informed the Iraqi
authorities that they only had an idea of the sites they intended
to inspect only a few minutes before the teams headed for the
sites.
</P>
<P>
"How can the Iraqi authorities be aware of the sites before
the inspectors themselves?" the spokesman asked.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Uzbek Warlord Sends Peace Mission to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ethnic-Uzbek
warlord Rashid Dostum today sent a delegation to the headquarters
of the Islamic Taliban militia in Kandahar apparently to discuss a
peaceful end to the country's on-going bitter fighting.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is very important to end the current crisis in
Afghanistan," said a Taliban spokesman in Kandahar, Taliban's
stronghold in southern Afghanistan, according to a report
monitored here this evening.
</P>
<P>
However, neither Dostum nor the Taliban spokesman could
immediately be reached for comment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear what prompted today's meeting, but the Taliban
spokesman said the Taliban will be sending its representatives to
the opposition's stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north
of the Afghan capital of Kabul, in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful through these kinds of contacts with other
factions as well that we will be able to solve Afghanistan's
problems through negotiations," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who is part of the anti-Taliban northern alliance
locked in a protracted battle with the Taliban, has stepped out on
his own in recent weeks exchanging prisoners with the Taliban
militia and offering to return the bodies of Taliban fighters
allegedly massacred in northern Afghanistan last May.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been no signs that other members of the
northern alliance, including Afghanistan's former military chief
Ahmad Masood, were willing to negotiate with the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday several senior Taliban leaders, including the former
governor of western Herat Abdul Razzak, arrived in Kandahar after
spending seven months in prison in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Dostum may have arranged their freedom
after sending his former ally, Abdul Malik, fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
Malik arrested thousands of Taliban fighters last May,
including Razzak, after a deal he had struck with them soured.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban control roughly 85 percent of Afghanistan, imposing
its brand of Islamic rule on the area. The northern 15 percent is
run by the anti-Taliban alliance, made up mostly of the country's
minority ethnic and religious groups.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Efforts on Altering Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed the
international efforts to persuade the Turkish government to
alter its position on Cyprus issue and Cyprus' European Union
(EU) accession.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, government
spokesman Manolis Christofides said that the Cypriot government
believes that Turkey's uncooperative position on Cyprus issue and
its EU accession have left the country isolated.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and five other east European applicant countries are
set to start membership negotiations next year with the
EU. Turkey, which is not included in this list, has reacted
strongly to this decision which it considers discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also seeks to become a member of the European family or
have its application for accession approved by EU's 15 member
states.
</P>
<P>
Christofides noted that the international community does not
recognize the present status quo in Cyprus and wants to redress
this by creating a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that efforts by the international community
to solve the Cyprus problem are now directed toward Turkey,"
Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million
children in Southern and Central Iraq are chronically
malnourished, according to survey results published here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted jointly by the Iraqi Government and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), found that 32 percent of
children under the age of five in the areas suffer from
malnutrition, a rise of 72 percent over 1991.
</P>
<P>
About 23 percent are found underweight, twice as high as the
levels found in neighboring Jordan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
There has been no sign of improvement since the U.N. Security
Council resolution on oil-for-food came into effect in December

<HEADLINE> People's Daily: Promoting Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be published
in China's official People's Daily Thursday says the APEC Approach
will promote economic and technical cooperation as well as trade
and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The approach, raised by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the
4th APEC meeting, was reiterated in the Vancouver Declaration,
adopted at the 5th APEC informal leaders' meeting in Vancouver,
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the approach, an "entirely new approach" to
international economic cooperation, gives full consideration to
the diversity of APEC members and acknowledges their divergence in
the level and state of development as well as the consequent
differing interests and needs.
</P>
<P>
The approach also adheres to the principles of mutual respect,
equality, mutual benefit, consensus, seeking common ground while
putting aside differences and voluntarism, the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
This is in conformity with the trend of the time and the actual
circumstances in the region.
</P>
<P>
APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) is the most
influential economic forum in the region and one of the most
vigorous organizations for economic cooperation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The editorial continues that under the approach, trade and
investment liberalization will be carried out through both
unilateral and team actions so as to achieve common development
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It says the informal leaders' meeting, which concluded
successfully Tuesday, will promote economic and trade cooperation
as well as technological exchange among the APEC members.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang made an important speech at the meeting. Before
it, a ministerial meeting was held on expanding economic and
technical cooperation, setting up relevant cooperation mechanism,
improving advance liberalization in partial sectors and promoting
regional financial cooperation.

LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Wednesday defended the out-of-school childcare program
announced on Tuesday by the finance minister, Gordon Brown.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Prime Minister's Question in the parliament, Blair
said the 300-million-pound plan, funded mainly by the National
Lottery, would "give a lot of support and help to parents,
particularly lone parents, who desperately need it at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The Government aims to create 30,000 out-of-school centers to
allow parents increased freedom to take jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Education and Employment Secretary, David Blunkett, said
the network of clubs would be set up in England, Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales within five years.
</P>
<P>
This would provide care for one million children and would
additionally improve children's education and benefit the
community, he said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Establish Free Agricultural Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) said here
today that the regional body plans to establish a free trade area
in agricultural products by 1999, the Zambia News Agency ZANA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted the COMESA official Erastus Mwencha as saying when
opening a two-day COMESA round-table conference on commodity
development in eastern and southern Africa that a free trade area
in agriculture by 1999 will enable the reginal body attain free
trade in the year 2000 for all products.
</P>
<P>
The compelling factor for this action is "to legitimise cross
border informal trade in agricultural produce, expand the market
for farmers in the region and promote the attainment of food
security for the region given the complimentarity of agricultural
seasons in easten and southern africa", said Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
He, however, cautioned that other issues like increased
production of agricultural commodities have to be addressed in
COMESA countries if trade in agricultural commodities has to be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
It should be remembered that the expansion of agricultural
trade among the COMESA countries depends to a large extent on the
timely and cost effective supply of agricultural inputs, such as
fertilisers, improved seeds, pesticides, agricultural machinery,
tools, spare parts and fuel, Mwencha noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that producer prices and marketing efficiency of
agricultural commodities have also to be addressed so that
increased productivity in agriculture could be achieved among the
20 COMESA member states which aim to establish a free trade area
by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Derelict Luxor Policemen Face Trial in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Habib
Ibrahim el-Adli has issued a decision to refer to trial before the
Higher Police Disciplinary Council a number of senior police
officers for dereliction of duty in the Luxor massacre.
</P>
<P>
The former director of the general administration of Luxor
police and his deputy as well as other four officers will be tried
on charges of negligence in carrying out security plans for
securing archaeological and tourist areas in Luxor, said Egypt's
Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were taken following investigations by the
Inspection and Control Sector of the Interior Ministry into the
November 17 terrorist attack in Egypt's biggest archeological city.
</P>
<P>
Six Islamic militants went on a shooting spree, killing 58
foreign tourists and four Egyptians in front of a Pharaonic temple
in Luxor before they were gunned down by the police who were slow
to the rescue. The area around the temple was guarded by only two
policemen.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Egypt has replaced its top security chief,
kicked out a number of senior police officers and revamped its
security plans.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will fly
to Zurich Friday to attend an official funeral arranged by the
Swiss government for its nationals killed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti flew here a day after the
massacre which claimed about 35 Swiss holiday-makers
alone. Switzerland has warned travelers to stay away from Egypt
altogether as Swiss travel agents reported cancellations flooding
in.
</P>
<P>
Since Islamic militants began to wage a war against the
government in 1992, nearly 1,300 people have been killed, mostly
policemen and militants.

President Jiang put forward important and constructive
proposals on adhering to "the APEC Approach" and further
strengthening economic cooperation of the region, the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that economic and technological cooperation and
trade and investment liberalization are closely linked and should
support each other. Science and technology cooperation should be
an important part and priority area in the region's economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also spoke in detail about fully opening the market for
technology trade, encouraging and speeding up the transfer of
hi-technologies to all members and developing members in
particular and rationalizing the intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
These far-reaching views were highly valued at the meeting and
reflected in the Vancouver Declaration, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang proposed that APEC make an agenda for science
and technology industry cooperation into the 21 century. Member
leaders all accepted this proposal and instructed their ministers
to work out a draft agenda and report to the next year's meeting
in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also expounded Chinese position on sustainable
development. APEC should devote itself to pushing forward the
economic development of all its members if it wants to maintain
the ever lasting vigor of the region.
</P>
<P>
"But the reality is that there is a great divergency in terms
of economy and technology development among the APEC members," the
editorial say.
</P>
<P>
"Thus how to create favorable conditions for the
developing members, how will the developed members use their
economic and technological advantages to help the developing
ones, and how to enhance science and technology cooperation and
technology transfer among the members become big questions
relating to the future of the region's economic cooperation and
development," the editorial adds.
</P>
<P>
The economic prosperity of the developing members and the
improvement of the living standard of their people will also
create more spaces for the economic sustainable development of
their developed counterparts and inject more driving force for the
regional economic cooperation, it says.
</P>
<P>
In a world that all countries are now more
economically interrelated, the economic development of the
developing countries is the real hope of realizing global economic
sustainable development, the editorial points out.

The financial instability in Southeast Asia has affected many
regions and aroused widespread concern from the meeting, the
editorial goes on.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang pointed out that normal and safe operation of
the financial system is crucial to the overall economic stability
and development, and to maintain a normal financial order and ward
off financial risks, APEC should not only formulate correct
economic development strategies and preserve a rational economic
structure, but also improve the financial system through
strengthened financial supervision and regulation according to its
specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
It is beneficial to all countries to enhance regional and
international financial cooperation, jointly ward off the impact
of excessive speculation of hot money in the world, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that China adopts a positive attitude
toward strengthening financial cooperation in the region and is
ready to participate in discussions on relevant mechanism for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has made great contributions to APEC cooperation and
development, as President Jiang himself has attended its informal
meetings for five times, putting forward clearly China's position
and principles each time.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, President Jiang announced that the Chinese
Government has decided to lower its average tariff on industrial
products to 10 percent by 2005 and China has decided to accede to
the Information Technology Agreement and start negotiations on
relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
China has officially proposed the convocation of the 9th
informal APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, China, in
2001.
</P>
<P>
All this has manifested China's sincerity in advancing the
cooperation in the region that has received general welcome from
the participants, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
When the mankind is entering a new century, it is hoped that
APEC will continue its healthy development and play a more
important role in both establishing a new rational and fair
international economic order and in furthering the development of
the region and the whole world, the editorial concludes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaria remains the major killer
disease in Nigeria, sending some 300,000 Nigerians to the grave
annually, a medical expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigerian
Institute for Medical Research, 64 million persons in the country are
infected by malaria parasite yearly, while 50 million actually
suffered the disease, especially women and children.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a population of around 100 million.
</P>
<P>
Malaria parasite, discovered 100 years ago, was becoming resistant
to common drugs as well as to various brands of insecticides, he said
at a health seminar.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that the endemic disease in the country is
worsening poverty, saying that "there is a lack of commitment on the
part of government to eradicate the disease".
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to adopt preventive measures to tackle the
malaria problem.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon: Syrian Troops to Stay Until Israelis Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berry said today that the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon is
aimed at liberating the south from Israeli occupation and will
stay until Israelis pull out.
</P>
<P>
"Syrian troops will withdraw from Lebanon only when the legal
Lebanese government and organizations require them to do so," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when answering a question at a news
conference held for some 70 journalists from 40 countries who are
attending the World Christian Journalism Conference here.
</P>
<P>
Berry said that the 40,000 Syrian soldiers now stationing in
Lebanon were invited by the Lebanese authority. They do not take a
single cent from Lebanon, but also help Lebanon restore its unity
and safety.
</P>
<P>
When Israel pulls its troops out of Lebanon, then the
discussion about Syrian troops withdrawal will start, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Syrian troops do not fight with Israeli soldiers
in the south because no permission is given by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops officially entered Lebanon in 1976 as major part
of a 30,000-strong Arab Deterrent Force to intervene in the
Lebanese 1975-1990 civil war and made a major role in helping
achieve the reconciliation of warring factions. Now, Syria keeps
a special relationship with the country.
</P>
<P>
Late September, Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Nasrallah
Butros Sfeir appealed Syrian troops to leave from Lebanon,
saying the current presence is against the establishment of
the country's independence.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Urges Closer Economic Ties with Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- President Nursultan Nazarbayev of
Kazakhstan today called on Germany to boost its economic
activities in his country.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, who is on a three-day visit to Germany, said during
a meeting with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel today that the
potentials of the economic relations between the two country had
not been fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
Germany's investment in Kazakhstan still lagged behind that of
the United States, Turkey and South Korea, he told reporters today
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev is scheduled to visit Frankfurt Thursday to seek
more investment from German companies in Kazakhstan's mining
sector.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nazarbayev also met German President Roman Herzog
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Both German leaders stressed Germany's
willingness to strengthen the bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
German officials said Bonn would grant another 25 million marks
(14.4 million U.S. dollars) in development aid to Kazakhstan,
which would bring the total of its aid so far to 130 million marks
(74.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
During Nazarbayev's visit, the two countries also signed a
series of agreements on technological cooperation, double taxation
and education. Under one accord, Germany will send German teachers
to Kazakhstan, where about 350,000 ethnic Germans live currently.

<P>
CALGARY, Canada, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, starting his state visit to Canada, today expressed
his belief that China-Canadian relations will surely be ushered
into the 21st century "with a brand-new outlook."
</P>
<P>
"My current visit to Canada is aimed at deepening
understanding, enhancing friendship, looking into the future and

Ottawa and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Canadian Governor-General Romeo LeBlanc Jiang

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Hold "Constructive Dialogues" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran today announced its
readiness to resume "constructive dialogues" with the European
Union (EU) countries following the end of the seven-month
standoff between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran is ready to embark on
constructive dialogues with all European states, provided that
they have the political resolve to correct their relations with
Iran and further adopt policies toward the Islamic Republic
based on mutual respect and free from outside influences," said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remarks in a response to the inclination of
European countries including Germany to re-open dialogue with
Iran, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The German daily Frankfurter Rundschau recently quoted a
German Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Bonn expected
the return of its ambassador to Tehran would be the preamble to
negotiations over all the issues of contention between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
All of the EU ambassadors returned to Tehran recently after
Iran and the EU reached an agreement over the diplomatic row
triggered by a Berlin court verdict accusing Tehran of sponsoring
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries recalled their ambassadors last April in a
protest to Iran after the Berlin court charged Iranian leadership
with involving in a case of political assassinations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
With the coming in office of the new government led by
President Mohammad Khatami, the EU countries insist on continuing
"critical dialogues" with Iran, though the United States has
intensified its sanctions on Iran by threatening to punish any
foreign company with over 20 million U.S. dollars investment in
Iran's oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said British Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek Fatchett today also warned
the U.S. that its sanctions regime against Iran was damaging
its cooperation with the EU on a common policy toward Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Britain and its EU partners were opposed "in principle" to
the U.S. extraterritorial legislation and believed it was "better
not to isolate Iran totally," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
He told the Washington Institute for Near East Policy that
"sanctions against an EU company for making what are in my view
legitimate investments in Iran's hydrocarbon sector will lead to
a transatlantic row, which will benefit nobody but the hawks in
Iran."
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel reiterated earlier this
month that it was necessary for the EU states to resume
"critical dialogues" with Iran over the issues of international
terrorism, human rights abuses, mass destruction weapons as well
as Tehran's stance toward the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Namibia Discuss Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The issue of illegal
immigrants flooding into South Africa from neighboring states was
raised by President Nelson Mandela in today's talks with his
Namibian counterpart, Sam Nujoma, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma is in Cape Town for a flying visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems that concerns us, especially in South Africa,
is the large number of immigrants who are coming in, without full
compliance of the law," Mandela told reporters after the 90-minute
meeting with Nujoma at his official residence in Cape Town, Genadendal.
</P>
<P>
He said issues of bilateral and regional cooperation, particularly
trade and investment, had also been discussed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said South Africa had an obligation to help its neighbors
to creat jobs and therefore curb illegal population flow.
</P>
<P>
It had become important to ensure that investment is spread over
the entire region, so that countries, where people can not earn a
living, are able to provide employment which can therefore prevent
people from moving across the border into other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The problem is being addressed by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
"But it is also fruitful to discuss this on a bilateral level to
ensure we assist SADC in search of a solution," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a particular difficulty to deal with the issue of
illegal immigrants, because during the years of the anti-apartheid
struggle, liberation movements in South Africa had been given asylum
in neighboring countries, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are victorious, they regard our victory as their
victory. They say now that our brothers and sisters are free in South
Africa, we can go there and look for jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, along with other SADC members such as Zimbabwe, is
critical of South Africa's economic dominance in the region and has
accused it of being too protectionist.
</P>
<P>
Namibia is also critical of South Africa's attempts to negotiate a
free trade agreement with the European Union, which it fears may be
detrimental to other SADC states.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Finnish President
Martti Ahisaari expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia
speedily signed border treaties with Estonia and Latvia, according
to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference the Finnish President, who arrived in
Moscow this afternoon on a two-day visit, said that the step
"would promote confidence between Russia and Baltic countries."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the security guarantees offered by Russia to the
Baltic states, Ahisaari said that he "respects the right of each
Baltic state to decide security matters on its own."
</P>
<P>
The visiting president meanwhile called on Russia and the
Baltic states to demonstrate "patience and understanding".
</P>
<P>
Speaking about relations between Russia and Finland, he said
past experience "should not hinder business cooperation between
two European countries."
</P>
<P>
Ahisaari is expected to meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday. The two sides
will discuss transport between the two countries, which has
increased five-fold since Finland's admission to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The other subject will be the transit of Russian oil across
Finland to Western Europe, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Welcomes EU Renewable Energy Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace today welcomed the
European Commission's formal adoption of the Renewable Energy
White Paper just five days before the opening of the United
Nations Climate Summit in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"This is additional ammunition for the EU negotiators in
Kyoto," said Greenpeace EU advisor Aphrodite Mourelatou. "They are
now even better armed to argue that strong emission targets are
practicable and workable and must be adopted in Kyoto," she added.
</P>
<P>
The white paper calls for a doubling to 12 percent of the
contribution made by renewable energies by 2010 to EU energy
needs.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, this would deliver around one third of carbon
dioxide emission reduction needed to meet the EU's formal target
proposal of a 15 percent reduction in carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace estimates that this could also create hundreds of
thousands of new jobs in wind and solar power within the EU and
generate a multi-billion dollar export industry.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission White Paper substantiates what we have known
all along -- that it is perfectly possible to replace
climate-destroying fossil fuels with clean renewable energy
technologies," said Karl Mallon, Greenpeace International Energy
Solutions campaigner.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Hussein Invites UN Experts to Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
today invited U.N. experts to his presidential houses to made sure
if there is any weapons of mass destruction as alleged by
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by a meeting of the Revolution Command
Council and the ruling Baath Party, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 or more representatives from the countries that
take part in the U.N. inspection teams, and experts or diplomats
from the U.N. Security Council have been invited, according to a
statement by the Revolution Command Council.
</P>
<P>
These representatives can visit the presidential palaces "for a
period of one week or more, or for a month, so that they can find
out the truth," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The invitations were made after U.N. weapons inspection teams
said the presidential palaces are the likely targets for hiding
weapons of mass destruction, like chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the tension triggered off by Iraq's expulsion of
U.S. members from the U.N. weapons inspection teams earlier this
month could be further eased with the invitations.
</P>
<P>
The crisis which threatened war was defused when
U.N. inspectors returned to work last week after Russia's
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after Saddam's
1990 invasion of Kuwait could only be lifted after U.N. inspectors
verify that Iraq is disarmed of mass destructive weapons.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Boosts Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
singled out agriculture and agro-allied productive base to form
part of the priority areas of government attention, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision is made because Nigeria basically has an
agrarian economy with "agriculture providing over 80 percent of
the nation's employment opprotunities and a respectable
proportion of the annual rate of growth of our GDP," said Ahlaji
Gidado Idris, Secretary to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is part of the government resolution to
structure development efforts along the areas and sectors in
which the country has comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the country's foreign exchange
earning came largely from crude oil sales receipts, Idris said
that the inflow of petro dollars is a "dubious blessing to our
national economy as it never translated into enhanced and
proportionate percentage contribution to our gross domestic
product (GDP)".
</P>
<P>
He said, "Nigeria's population of nearly 100 million people
has to be fed, clothed, sheltered and found gainful employment in
agriculture until other sectors of our economy are sufficiently
developed to replace or complement crude oil and agriculture as
the mainstay of our economy."
</P>
<P>
A number of policies and programs have been initiated to
promote agricultural development in the country over the past 20
years. However, they failed to achieve their desired objectives.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the failure to political instability
and national disunity, the absence of national identity,
patriotism and commitment.
</P>
<P>
The present administration, which came to power in 1993 and
will quit next year, has been carrying out policies of guided
de-regulation and guided commercialization and privatization.
</P>
<P>
Veritable objectives and targets have been set for agriculture
and other sectors of the economy, Gidado Idris said.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Eurofighter Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament today gave
the greenlight to the controversial four-European-nation
Eurofighter project, clearing the last hurdle to production of a
21st-century warplane for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget plan approved by the German parliament despite
strong opposition from the opposition parties, the German air
force Luftwaffe will be able to order 180 Eurofighter jets at
total costs of about 23 billion marks (13 billion U.S. dollars) in
the period between 2002 and 2014.
</P>
<P>
It will be the biggest and most expensive military project for
Germany in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter project have been controversial in Germany at a
time when Bonn is struggling with strict financial austerity to
meet the fiscal requirements for qualifying for the planned single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Development of Eurofighter prototypes has already cost German
taxpayers seven billion marks (four billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, however, said that
Eurofighters are necessary to modernize the German air force's
out-of-date aircraft fleet which is dominated by Phantom jets.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, the German contractor of the
four-nation group that will build the modern jet, also argued that
the jobs and technological payoff of the project were
indispensable to the future of the company and a German place in a
European aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
The other three European partners in the project, Britain,
Italy and Spain, have already approve the project, with London
planning to buy 232 Eurofighters, Rome 121 and Madrid 87.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the Eurofighter project is estimated at about
75 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body, the European Commission, today adopted a white
paper on its renewable energy blueprint.
</P>
<P>
The white paper set out for the first time a comprehensive
strategy and action plan designed to achieve by 2010 the goal of
doubling the share of renewable energies from the present 6
percent to 12 percent in the EU's total energy demand.
</P>
<P>
"We are sending a clear message that we are determined to
follow an ambitious and realistic policy to promote the use of
energy sources which enhance our security of supplies, contribute
to the creation of jobs and help us protect the environment," said
Christos Papoutsis, EU commissioner responsible for energy.
</P>
<P>
The benefits from the achievement of the goal would be "very
considerable" in terms of carbon dioxide emission reduction, jobs
creation, increased security of supply and local and regional
development, the commission noted in a press release issued today.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that a central aim of the strategy and
action plan was to ensure that the need to promote renewable
energy sources was integrated in new policy initiatives as well as
in the full implementation of a wide range of policies.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the adoption of the white paper would give EU
negotiators "additional ammunition" at the upcoming United Nations
Climate Summit in Kyoto, Japan.

JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's arms
manufacturer Denel will participate in this year's arms show in
Malaysia, company
official said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is scheduled for December 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
Denel Communications Director, George Masoek, told reporters in
Pretoria that his company decided to go there although many companies,
including some from the United States, Australia, Russia and Belgium,
had withdrawn from the Langkawi Aerospace and Maritime Exhibition
(LIMA).
</P>
<P>
"Although the slowdown of the Malaysian economy has resulted in a
number of the country's defense purchases being put on hold,... our
cooperation with Malaysia still continues," Masoek said.
</P>
<P>
Denel is confident the Malaysian economy will recover.
</P>
<P>
Masoek said Denel is not only interested in selling its goods, but
also in developing long-term business relationships through the
sharing of expertise.
</P>
<P>
To underline this message, South African Public Enterprises
Minister Stella Sigcau and Defense Minister Joe Modise will also
attend the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to gear both the local and Malaysian industries with
capabilities for developing, producing and supporting the Rooivalk
(attack helicopter), and in the future, other aircraft like the Oryx
transport helicopter," Masoek said.
</P>
<P>
Masoek said three of the company's divisions will participate in
the exhibition, which would focus on showing off the Rooivalk.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Efficiency in Enforcing Judgements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today called for the rights
of EU citizens and businesses to be enforced through increased
efficiency in procedural law.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the proposal on the grounds that it
believes that it is both time- and cost-consuming to get a civil
or commercial judgement given in one member state recognized and
enforced in another.
</P>
<P>
It said that this kind of obstacle had obstructed access to
justice on equal terms across the EU market and that citizens and
small and medium-sized companies were the most vulnerable in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, EU commissioner responsible for justice and home

LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The gold price fixed today at
under 300 US dollars an ounce on the London market for the first
time in 12.5 years and analysts said it could head still lower.

It was fixed at 297 dollars per ounce in the morning and the

<HEADLINE> France Adopts National Plan to Fight Greenhouse Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
adopted a national plan to fight global warming, or the greenhouse
effect, a few days before the opening of the world conference on
environment protection in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
When presenting the plan to the Council of Ministers, Minister
of Environment Dominique Voynet said that as economic growth
returns to France, the country should adopt at the same time an
ambitious plan to reduce the emission of gases which cause global
warming.
</P>
<P>
"If the growth returns to France, we should have an ambitious
program of action to reduce the greenhouse effect gas, that we
will realize with or without an agreement at Kyoto, because it is
beneficial," said Voynet.
</P>
<P>
Although the plan defines the priorities for environmental
protection without fixing statistics, it is the first in the world
and shows the will of France to fight against the greenhouse
effect, said observers.
</P>
<P>
The plan said that France is first of all favorable to the
policy of the European Union to impose taxes on energy products to
"harmonize fiscality" with a minimum tax rate on gas-oil products.
</P>
<P>
France will reinforce regulation on heating facilities of new
houses and establish a control system from 1999, while all
infrastructure of long duration, including houses, industrial
installations and transport infrastructure, must take into account
the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
The government will support voluntary agreements with
industries which consume great amounts of energy, such as iron and
steel metallurgy, agricultural and food industry, paper and
cardboard industry, smelting, founding and casting industries, and
cement industry.
</P>
<P>
The minister praised the oil group Elf-Aquitaine for deciding
to reduce by 15 percent the emission of greenhouse effect gases by
2010, and encouraged small and medium-sized enterprises to
economize energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
The plan said that by the year 2010, transport will be
responsible for 40 percent of the emission of carbon dioxide,
therefore priorities will be given to the research on energy
consumptions, emission of polluting gases and motors of heavy
trucks.
</P>
<P>
The government will also elaborate laws on air cleanness in
cities, develop public transport such as collective transport and
railway and road transport.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the European Union will reduce the emission
of carbon dioxide by vehicles from 165 grams per kilometer to 120
grams. The French automaker Renault will innovate its product to
reduce the emission to 140 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The government will also develop a program of economization for
electricity and heating generation centers, and to develop
renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy.
</P>
<P>
The government will plan the planting of 30,000 hectares of
forests each year to increase wood resources for construction, and
will carry out information campaigns to raise people's awareness
about environment protection.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 500 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unilaterally
released 500 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) captured during the
eight-year (1980-1988) war between the two neighbors, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The POWs would be delivered to the Iraqi side on the border
this afternoon, according to an Iranian source.
</P>
<P>
The POWs were released after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Wednesday expressed his agreement with the proposal
put forward by President Mohammad Khatami on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held here this morning, head of the Iranian
Commission in charge of POW Affairs Brigadier General Abdollah
Najafi said that Tehran has so far released 49,196 Iraqi POWs, of
whom 10,000 have been released unilaterally by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Najafi expressed hope that Iran's humanitarian measure
would be a preamble to the final conclusion of the POW issue
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Iranian authorities announced that some 15,000
Iranian POWs were still held in Iraq and accused the Iraqi
government of making no response to Iran's humanitarian measures
of releasing Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi side repeatedly dismissed the allegation of
any Iranian POWs in Iraq. Charge D'affaires of the Iraqi Embassy
in Iran Salah Noori Samarmad claimed earlier this month that Iraq
has released all Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
He said Baghdad holds 62 Iranians who were captured in Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War, adding that "we are ready to release
these 62 Iranians if the Iranian authorities release all of our
POWs."
</P>
<P>
An estimated one million people were killed in the eight-year
war between Iran and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Russian Communist Leader Visits Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov arrived here today for a three-day visit aimed at
promoting ties with the Iraqi ruling party and discussing efforts
to get the U.N. embargo on Iraq lifted or relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Baghdad, Zyuganov, also head of a large
party delegation, told reporters that he is glad to visit Iraq,
hoping that this visit will contribute to promoting ties between
Russian Communist Party and Iraq's ruling Baath Arab Socialist
Party, Iraqi News Agency (INA) said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Zyuganov as saying that the Russian Communist
Party, the Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) and
the Russian people will continue seeking to get the seven-year-old
U.N. embargo on Iraq lifted, which bars Iraq from exporting its
oil.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Zyuganov comes after Iraq accepted a Russian
proposal last week to allow the United Nations arms inspectors
back to Iraq to continue their monitoring work of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Baghdad expelled U.S. members of the inspection teams
in a crisis which threatened war.
</P>
<P>
Russia in return has promised to work for the lifting of the
crippling economic sanctions the U.N. Security Council imposed on
it after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to Iraqi parliamentary sources, Zyuganov will meet
Chairman of Iraq's National Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi,
and is also expected to meet a number of other Iraqi
officials.

Calgary, Canada, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that economic cooperation between
China and Alberta, Canada, has been growing fast in recent years

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers to Meet on ASEAN Fund Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 27 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN finance ministers
will discuss the establishment of an ASEAN Fund, a standby credit
facility, at a meeting to be held here on December 1-2, a senior
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Fund would serve more as a confidence-building
measure given the adverse effects of recent currency attacks on
regional economies, Malaysian Treasury secretary-general Clifford
Herbert told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that a meeting of the finance ministers
of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries scheduled as part
of the December 1-2 meeting has been postponed to early next year,
as it would clash with a South American finance ministers'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the ASEAN Fund, Herbert said finance ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would decide
whether the fund would be independent of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said the quantum of the ASEAN Fund "has yet to be decided
..., but it will not be very large."
</P>
<P>
Herbert said the finance ministers would also discuss the
current economic situation faced by ASEAN member countries and
exchange views on the region's recent currency crisis and policy
responses needed to restore stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam -- will be joined by their counterparts from China, South
Korea, Japan, the United States, Australia and Hong Kong, China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus will join the ministers
to report on the progress of an IMF study on hedge funds and their
role in market dynamics, while the vice-president of the World
Bank would also brief the ministers on an initiative toward
strengthening the financial system in the region, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> HK Ranks 3rd in World in Foreign Exchange Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's official foreign
exchange reserves, including those held in the Land Fund, were
91.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of October this year, the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of 4.2 percent over the end
of September when the reserves stood at 88.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong thus ranks the third in foreign reserves in the
world, after Japan and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of October, the foreign reserves held in the
Exchange Fund were 74.4 billion U.S. dollars and those in the Land
Fund 17.4 billion U.S. dollars as compared with 71.4 billion U.S.
dollars and 16.7 billion U.S. dollars respectively at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign currency assets in the Exchange Fund
represents capital inflows into Hong Kong in October despite some
shorting of Hong Kong dollars by speculators in the second half of
the month, as currency turmoil spread around the region, HKMA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the rise in foreign currency assets in the Land Fund,
which was established on July 1, 1997, reflects investment-related
purchases.

<HEADLINE> Sports Minister Criticises Spanish Referees' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Spain's minister of sport Pedro
Martin Thursday criticized the Spanish first division referees'
decision to go on strike this weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The measures taken are disproportionate and not beneficial
to a climate of dialogue," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish referees have gone on strike in response to the
torrents of abuse heaped upon them in recent weeks by players
and club officials.
</P>
<P>
"I know the referees have a difficult job but this (strike)
is bad for football," said Martin.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Spain's Supreme Council for Sports mediate
in the dispute. "If we can get some dialogue then I'm sure we
can find a solution."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Professional League had no comment on the
referees' action but was hoping to discuss the issue with them
on Thursday or Friday in an effort to avert the strike.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UNSCOM to End Inspections in 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) today called on the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
to close its files and end inspections in Iraq within six months,
the official Iraq News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
After an emergency session, chaired by Parliament Speaker
Saadoun Hammadi, the assembly said in a statement that the period
starts as of November 20 when UNSCOM resumed work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had fulfilled all its commitments under U.N. resolutions,
said the statement while stressing the need for lifting the
sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly was convened to discuss Iraq's relationship with
UNSCOM, in charge of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction,
and U.N. security council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will take all practical measures in defense of its
legitimate rights, unity and national security, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament also expressed high appreciation of the
Iraqi leadership's courageous and wise handling of "the historic
battle against American imperialism", said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Head of the assembly's Arab and International Committee Saad
Qassim Hamoudi slashed at the U.S. policy of trying to prolong the
embargo against Iraq and change its national leadership at the
session.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring an early end to the U.N. sanctions, the Iraqi
Revolution Command Council decided Wednesday to invite
representatives from the 20 countries that take part in the
U.N. inspection teams and experts or diplomats from the 15
U.N. Security Council members to inspect sites in Iraq under
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
These representatives can visit the presidential palaces "for a
period of one week or more, or for a month, so that they can find
out the truth," the council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The invitations were made after U.N. weapons inspection teams
said the presidential palaces are the likely targets for hiding
weapons of mass destruction, like chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq could only be
lifted after U.N. inspectors verify that Iraq is disarmed of mass
destructive weapons.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Make Contribution to ASEAN Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Treasurer Peter Costello told
parliament today that he expected Australia to make a major
contribution to next week's meeting of ASEAN finance ministers in
Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, which aims to stabilize the
financial situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Costello made the remarks as he prepared to fly to Kuala Lumpur
to approve an early warning process to improve the international
community's response to further economic time-bombs in the Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
The December 1-2 meeting of ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) finance ministers and representatives from six
other nations including Australia, China and the United States is
expected to endorse what has become known as the Manila plan.
</P>
<P>
Costello said there would be a downturn in Southeast and North
Asia due to the region's recent currency and financial instability
which would in turn affect Australian exports.
</P>
<P>
"From the point of view of Australia, the downturn in the
Southeast or North Asian region affects Australia, it affects
Australian exports and it affects our jobs," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only in the interests of the region but it's in the
interests of Australia to see financial stability return to the
region and economic growth strengthened."
</P>
<P>
Under the Manila plan, a new surveillance mechanism will ensure
that central banks within the region exchange information in a bid
to detect early signs of impending troubles.
</P>
<P>
The role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be
strengthened, while arrangements will be developed to allow the
IMF to call on nations to supply supplementary funding for any
further rescue packages.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already committed 1 billion U.S. dollars to a
loan package for Thailand, offered another 1 billion dollars in a
second-tier of funding for Indonesia and is waiting for an IMF
request to assist in bailing out South Korea.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Vows to Adjust to China's Changing Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will cater to
the changing situation and needs of China, maintaining annual
lending to the world's largest developing nation at around 2.5 to
three billion U.S. dollars, according to the bank's new chief in
China.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed and continued a very strong relationship and
we are now entering what we call a new stage," Yukon Huang,
director of the World Bank's China program, said in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The interview is the first Huang has granted in his capacity as
program director after his arrival in Beijing this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank's Strategic Compact and renewal process, which
is intended to transfer decision-making and responsibility to the
field offices and better utilize global knowledge and expertise,
will enable the largest international financial institution to
provide better, faster and cheaper services for its clients.
</P>
<P>
Drastic changes have taken place in China during the last two
decades as it advances toward a market-oriented economy, said
Huang, who is also chief of the bank's resident mission in China.
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of changes under way in China and the bank has
to adjust to the changing situation in China so that we will be
able to provide good service in the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Colossal Industrial Project Built in Coastal Province (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a modern
petrochemical center, the largest industrial project ever built in
Fujian Province, was unveiled at the Xiaocuo economic zone
recently.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost an estimated 100 billion yuan provided by
the Central Government in the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Xiaocuo will build a polyethylene plant turning
out 600,000 tons a year, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) project with
an annual output of 300,000 tons, a 260,000-ton caustic soda
project and a 40,000-ton epoxy propane project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Council has approved construction of a
refinery which is capable of refining 8 million tons of crude
oil annually at Xiaocuo. This will raise the annual oil refining
capacity of the Fujian Provincial Refining Company to 12 million
tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of this gigantic industrial project, Xiaocuo
will become a modernized harbor devoted to petrochemical
production on the western bank of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Xiaocuo economic zone covers 319 square kilometers on the
southern bank of Meizhou Gulf with a population of 350,000.
</P>
<P>
The zone is 200 nautical miles from the port cities of Keelung
and Kaohsiung in Taiwan island and an hour's drive to Fuzhou, the
provincial capital, Xiamen Special Economic Zone and Jinjiang
city. The zone sits midway between Shanghai and Guangdong, two of
the largest industrial centers in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone is also a deep-water harbor with a
5.5-kilometer coastline capable of accommodating 300,000-ton
ships. As a hub of communications, it has opened shipping routes
to all major harbors both in China and the world.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Opposition Names Senatorial Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' united
opposition, the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP),
announced here today the first nine candidates in its 12-man
senatorial line-up for the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the absence of Vice President Joseph Estrada and
Senator Orlando Mercado, chairman and president respectively of
the Partido ng Masang Pilipino (PMP), from the list fueled
speculation that the united opposition may be headed for a split.
</P>
<P>
PMP is one of the three members of the united opposition. The
other two members are the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) and
the Laban ng Demokratikong (Laban).
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier hinted at a brewing rift between Estrada and
Laban chairman Senator Edgardo Angara who are vying for LAMMP's
nomination to the 1998 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
PMP, NPC and Laban merged to form LAMMP but their leaders
continued to maintain their loyalty to their respective
presidential bets until the opposition's presidential
standard-bearer is formally named.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent move to display its unity, LAMMP issued a
statement saying the early announcement of its senatorial
candidates is one more proof that the united opposition will
remain intact until next year's elections regardless of whoever
will become the presidential candidate.

<P>
Huang explained that a strong relationship between the bank and
China, which rejoined in 1980, is built upon the fact that both
parties recognize the need to ensure that change will continue
during the process.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he will personally use the power he enjoys to ensure
that projects are performed better. The new World Bank official
was born in China's southwestern Sichuan Province and migrated to
the United States when he was five years old.
</P>
<P>
"One of my main responsibilities is to try as much as possible
to make sure that our program responds to the needs of the country
and the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the bank's internal reform package, directors of the
country programs now have much greater decision-making power than
their predecessors. In the case of Huang, he is empowered to make
80 percent of the relevant decisions concerning China projects.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that he has been impressed by the Chinese
government's commitment and desire to strengthen ties with the
bank, praising China as the best-performing country in
implementing bank-supported projects.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always been serious about making the
best use of bank funds to ensure that the money is well-spent,
said Huang, who has been working for the bank since 1976.
</P>
<P>
"The government of China could be used in many ways as a model
of how governments work with the bank," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the new stage of bilateral relations between the
bank and China, both parties should view and seek to promote such
a relationship from the perspectives of change and development,
Huang said, hoping that the Chinese government will in the future
create better conditions for the implementation of bank-funded
projects.

The bank is interested in supporting the Chinese government's
strategic plan to accelerate development in the more
under-developed central and western parts, but the fiscal strains
of local governments have made it hard to raise the matching funds
needed for bank loans, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Huang strongly advises that the Chinese
government enforce an effective transfer payment system in the
central and western provinces and regions of China.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who was the bank's chief of business in Russia and six
central Asian nations prior to his current post, said that the
Chinese economy is very strong.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that to ensure long-term, healthy growth of
its national economy, China should improve its fiscal and pension
systems, reform its state-owned enterprises and commercialize its
state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the bank has approved 185
projects in China, with a cumulative loan portfolio of 28.2
billion U.S. dollars, including 9.1 billion U.S. dollars provided
by the International Development Association.
</P>

China has been the bank's single largest borrower for five

are now in operation. Work is well under way on an oil wharf, a
multi-function coal wharf, a grain transit dock and a container
dock at a cost of 920 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Completion of these projects will turn Xiaocuo into one of four

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Tails Used To Whip Up Passion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Computers have helped to
prove that male dinosaurs were able to woo their partners
and intimidate rivals by cracking their long tails like
bullwhips.
</P>
<P>
The claim, first put forward by R. McNeil Alexander of Leeds
University, has been followed up by Nathan Myhrvold of the
software company Microsoft, who used computers to simulate the
tails of the giant sauropods and show that the feat was possible,
according to The Times.
</P>
<P>
Using a bullwhip bought from a supplier in Seattle, Myhrvold
used his computer to confirm that a wave generated at the base of
a dinosaur's 40-feet tail could exceed the speed of sound by the
time it reached the tip, producing, in effect, a miniature sonic
boom.
</P>
<P>
He studied the tails of eight fossil sauropods and found that
the tail vertebrae were longest about a quarter of the way down, a
known site of strain in a whip. Half the fossils had fused
vertebrae at this point, which can result from an injury.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the fossils were males, that whipped up a
frenzy with their tails in displays of sexual availability or
aggression. "Males whipped their tails to get a date."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan's Judicial Crisis Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been plunged
into a grave constitutional crisis as the two sides of a split
Supreme Court have intensified their tug of war over the
appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic development of the ongoing judicial crisis, Chief
Justice Sajjad overturned an order for his own suspension
Wednesday night, which was issued earlier in the day by a
two-member bench of the apex court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court Quetta bench passed an interim order
Wednesday afternoon suspending Sajjad as Chief Justice while
hearing a constitutional petition.
</P>
<P>
The short order passed by the Quetta bench said that as a
result, Justice Sajjad shall cease to perform judicial and
administrative functions and powers of the Chief Justice of
Pakistan till further orders.
</P>
<P>
Reacting within hours of the passing of the interim order by
the Quetta bench, Sajjad issued a short order declaring that the
verdict of the Quetta bench had no legal effect for the reason
that proper procedure was not followed.
</P>
<P>
He said the bench had no authority to hear the petition
challenging his appointment. The two judges present at Quetta
bench had acted "without lawful authority," Sajjad claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, the dramatic intra-judicial row took a new twist
Wednesday night when the Quetta bench issued another order, saying
the earlier order by the bench concerning the suspension of the
Chief Justice "still holds the field and is hereby reiterated and
confirmed."
</P>
<P>
The Quetta bench challenged the appointment of Sajjad as the
Chief Justice on the ground that he was not the senior most judge
at the time of his promotion three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Sajjad to the top judicial post by the
president on June 5, 1994, "is held in abeyance," said the order
by the Quetta bench.
</P>
<P>
Under the Pakistani Constitution, only the senior most judge at
the Supreme Court should be appointed as the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Sajjad has formed a five-judge bench
under him to hear two different petitions filed Wednesday
challenging the order of the Quetta bench holding in abeyance the
appointment of the Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ongoing tussle between the government and the
judiciary has also intensified as President Farooq Leghari refused
to accept the advice of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to appoint an
acting Chief Justice after the Quetta bench suspended Sajjad.
</P>
<P>
After the Quetta bench issued the interim order, Prime Minister
Sharif sent a summary to the president advising him to appoint
Ajmal Mian as the acting Chief Justice.
</P>
<P>
However, President Leghari has sent back the summary without
signing it.
</P>
<P>
The developments at the Supreme Court have touched off a
constitutional debate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that under the constitution the president is
bound to appoint an acting Chief Justice on the advice of the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Other experts, however, maintained that the president could not
make such an appointment in the light of the order of Chief
Justice Sajjad who had declared the order of the Quetta bench
invalid.
</P>
<P>
Now, the question remains of who is the Chief Justice of
Pakistan at the moment. While the government believes that Sajjad
stands suspended leaving the office of Chief Justice vacant,
Sajjad refuses to go.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation was further complicated late last
night when Justice Ajmal Mian, the senior most judge after Chief
Justice Sajjad, directed the Supreme Court office in the capital
to reconstitute the five-member bench hearing the contempt of
court case against Prime Minister Sharif.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Urged to Resign over Bribery Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea(PNG)'s Prime
Minister Bill Skate was urged today by a major coalition partner
and the opposition to resign over corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
The People's Progress Party (PPP), a major coalition partner,
said it would hold a special meeting at the weekend to advise its
caucus members on what action to take over allegations of bribery
against Skate, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Skate issued writs in the Queensland Supreme Court in Brisbane
today, suing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and
former government adviser Mujo Sefa for defamation over a
television report Wednesday night which alleged he authorized
1,300 U.S. dollars in bribes through his Internal Affairs Minister
Thomas Pelika, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Sefa, who secretly videotaped meetings between himself and
Skate and Pelika in his Port Moresby office last month, gave the
tapes to the ABC after a falling-out with other prime ministerial
staff.
</P>
<P>
In Brisbane, a spokesman for Skate said the prime minister was
distressed by the report and the adverse impact it would have on
PNG's reputation.
</P>
<P>
Skate, who was returning today from the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting in Vancouver, Canada, has
strongly denied the allegations and labeled Sefa a blackmailer.
</P>
<P>
A group of opposition MPs led by opposition leader Bernard
Narakobi and former Prime Minister Michael Somare today also
called for Skate's resignation and an inquiry into the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"We've called for his immediate resignation and we have also
called for Mujo Sefa to be extradited and brought into this
country and investigated by police," Narakobi said.
</P>
<P>
PNG former Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu, who refused to join
Skate's coalition government formed in July, today also called for
an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The PNG Media Council also backed an inquiry after allegations
in the ABC report said that the money allegedly paid was to take
care of local journalists.
</P>
<P>
PPP leader Andrew Baing said the issue of corruption was of
paramount importance to the survival of democracy in PNG, but
added that he would not back calls for an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Another government coalition partner, the People's Democratic
Movement (PDM), stood behind party member Pelika and the ruling
coalition today.
</P>
<P>
"We are all together as a party and we are supporting the
current government," said PDM leader and Finance Minister Iairo
Lasaro at a joint press conference with Pelika.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer refused today to become embroiled in the
controversy, saying it was a matter for PNG to resolve.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Experts Continue inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight teams of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) this morning continued
inspecting a number of suspected Iraqi weapons sites, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The teams set out to monitor sites in and outside the capital
Baghdad this morning, and three helicopters would make aerial
surveillance, an Iraqi official who did not identify himself was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq is providing necessary facilities to the
arms experts to carry out their duties smoothly.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth day in a row that UNSCOM experts go ahead with
their mission since their return to Iraq on November 21 after a
three-week break due to an Iraqi-U.N. standoff over arms
inspection.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Iraqi President Saddam Hussein decided to invite
representatives of member countries of the U.N. Security Council
and UNSCOM to his palaces in order to make sure if he was hiding
weapons of mass destruction as alleged.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi decision fetched cautious welcome from weapons
inspectors and U.S. officials who have been threatening military
operations to force Baghdad into giving access to the palaces in
which they suspect biological weapons are stashed.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad had insisted that three presidential palaces were
"off-limits" to the arms inspectors because they were signs of
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
This move is seen here as aimed at preempting U.S. arm-twisting
against Iraq and seeking a political means to have the crippling
U.N. sanctions, imposed after Baghdad sent troops to Kuwait in
1990, lifted as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolutions, UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction before the Security
Council can remove the sanctions, including a ban on oil export.

<HEADLINE> Polish PM Visits NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy
Buzek today visited the NATO headquarters to receive a letter of
invitation for accession from NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
The visit was seen as the closing step of a two-month,
five-round accession talks between NATO and Poland.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister told the press after his meeting with
Javier Solana that it was a very important day today and his
nation has been waiting for this day for "many many years."
</P>
<P>
"The (Polish) Solidarity Movement launched the accession move
17 years ago and the Poles have waited such a long time for their
wishes to come true, " said Buzek.
</P>
<P>
"Full-fledged membership is something the (NATO) secretary
general has promised us today," said Buzek who pledged that Poland
will assume the responsibilities required of a NATO member state.
</P>
<P>
Poland is expected to contribute 2.48 percent to NATO's common
budget which amounted to some 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
Poland is now looking forward to the forthcoming ratification
process to be taken by the parliaments of the 16 NATO member
states early next year.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Poland should worry that possible Russian
counteraction will slow down the ratification process, the prime
minister said that diplomatic efforts will be made and major
attention will be paid to the good relations between Russia and
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Buzek said that his nation will try to resume quickly top-level
dialogue with Russia in terms of personal contacts and he was
hopeful that any problem pending will be solved on a top-level
basis.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that NATO-Poland ties and security in
Europe are the top considerations.
</P>
<P>
Solana said at a press briefing that it was through the
accession talks that the western military alliance came to know
how well Poland was prepared to join.
</P>
<P>
The protocol for accession is scheduled to be signed during the
December meetings of NATO defense ministers and foreign ministers
in Brussels while the formal accession is slated to take place in
April 1999 in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Merger Wave Hitting Steel Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A merger wave is hitting the
Chinese iron and steel industry. One of the latest, and also the
largest, was the union of the Hubei-based Wuhan Steel and Iron
Company (WSIC) with two smaller local steel works -- Daye Steel
Plant and Echeng Iron and Steel Works.
</P>
<P>
On November 24 the heads of the three companies gathered in
Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, and signed a merger agreement
amidst warm applause from officials of the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry (MMI) and the local provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three companies will form a new steel
group with WSIC as its flagship. The new group will have a
combined annual steel output of 8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials believe the merger will further consolidate
WSIC's position as the largest steel producer in central China and
is conducive to the development of all three parties.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this merger, Handan Iron and Steel Company (HISC), a
medium-sized steel producer in Hebei Province, took over Wuyang
Iron and Steel Company, a debt-ridden company in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The event has generated much publicity because it was the
first major trans-regional merger case in the country's
metallurgical sector. The merger reportedly would not have
happened without support from the central government.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the financial burden of HISC after taking over
WISC, the government has promised to arrange the listing of HISC
on the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
The biggest merger brewing in the Chinese steel industry is the
much-rumored union of Baoshan Iron and Steel Company (BISC) with a
number of iron and steel firms in Shanghai. The Baoshan merger is
said to have gained the support of MMI and the municipal
government of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations on the issue are under way," said Xie Qihua,
general manager of BISC.

<TEXT>
<P>
If the Baoshan merger occurs, annual sales revenue of BISC
would reach 100 billion yuan, Xie said, adding that this would
enable the company to come a step closer to the goal of becoming
one of the world's top 500 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi, minister of MMI, said that the union will enable BISC
to become the country's largest steel producer which would be
capable of participating in international competition.
</P>
<P>
Other planned mergers include the union of the Anshan Iron and
Steel Company and the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, both located
in China's northeastern Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
As Anshan and Benxi, both among the top 10 steel producers in
China, are so closely located geographically, said Liu, there is
often a conflict of interest between them.
</P>
<P>
There long has been criticism of the irrational structure of
the Chinese iron and steel industry. A recent survey shows there
are more than 800 iron and steel producers in the country, of
which most are too small to have economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China called for speeding up the establishment of
trans-regional, trans-industry and trans-national enterprise
groups with multiple ownerships in the state sector of the
country's economy to meet competition in the world economic arena.
</P>
<P>
"However, none of the 34 groups established in the country's
metallurgical fields in the past few years is up to standards set
for large groups," said MMI's minister Liu Qi.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that in the future many large steel
groups could be set up by merging existing iron and steel works
either according to their geographical proximity or according to
their business fields.
</P>
<P>
The country's total output of steel hit 100 million tons last
year, ranking first in the world. This year's volume is expected
to rise 6 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the industry said the recent mergers in the
Chinese iron and steel sector are just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
While encouraged by the trend, observers cautioned that the
establishment of such large groups should be established on a
voluntary basis and that excessive government intervention should
be avoided.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Chief Justice Suspended by Another Court Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The on-going intra-judicial
row in Pakistan turned a new twist today as another division bench
of the country's Supreme Court suspended Chief Justice Sajjad Ali
Shah.
</P>
<P>
In its six-page short order, the Peshawar Bench of the court
endorsed an interim order issued by the Quetta Bench Wednesday
which barred the chief justice from performing his functions.
</P>
<P>
"In consequence, thereof, he has been restrained from passing
any judicial or administrative order in his capacity as Chief
Justice of Pakistan," the Peshawar Bench said.
</P>
<P>
The Quetta Bench Wednesday questioned the 1994 appointment of
Chief Justice Sajjad, saying he was not the most senior judge when
promoted by the government of former Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Reacting within hours of the Quetta Bench's ruling, Sajjad
Wednesday night issued an order declaring the bench's verdict had
no legal effect because proper procedures were not followed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Quetta Bench issued another order late Wednesday
night, saying the earlier order by the bench concerning the
suspension of the chief justice "still holds the field."

<HEADLINE> Sexual Diseases, Drug Abuse Blamed For HIV/AIDS Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome) cases is climbing in China because of
a "sharp increase" in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and
drug abuse, according to a medical report from a national AIDS
surveillance center.
</P>
<P>
"The infection rate of human immune deficiency virus (HIV)
which leads to AIDS, among sexually active people and drug abusers
has been rising over the past year," the report said, adding that
the situation could worsen if preventive measures are not taken.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the center under the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine, which established a national HIV/AIDS
surveillance network.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the network's report as saying that, out of 21
stations for monitoring patients visiting STD clinics across the
country, three stations found people infected by HIV in the first
six months of this year, compared with only one station in the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Out of 16 stations for monitoring prostitutes, four reported
women who tested HIV positive this year. None was reported last
year.
</P>
<P>
More than 187,800 STD cases were reported across the country in
the first half of this year, a rise of 12.5 percent over the same
period last year, the report quoted the National Center for STD
Control as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AIDS epidemic is rising among drug addicts, not
only in southwestern China's Yunnan Province, but also in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and other parts of the country, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the HIV infections in China are the result
of contaminated syringe needles used for taking drugs, 40 percent
to 60 percent of which usually are shared by drug users.
</P>
<P>
Out of 12 stations for monitoring drug addicts, seven found
people who were infected by HIV this year, compared with three
last year.
</P>
<P>
"China is facing a great risk of an AIDS epidemic because of
the rapid spread of STDs, since the majority of prostitutes in
China fail to take protective measures, such as using condoms,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reported cases of HIV infection in China had reached 8,277 by
the end of last September, including 168 AIDS cases, according to
the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is estimated that China has had at least 150,000
to 200,000 people infected by HIV," the report said.

<HEADLINE> New Drug To Cut off Blood Supply to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- American scientists have found
that starving a tumor by cutting off blood supply to it has a
chance of working.
</P>
<P>
Tumors need blood vessels to provide them with nutrients and
growth factors which they use to grow unchecked. The idea of
starving them to death by targeting the blood vessels has been
around for 25 years. However, new and more powerful agents have
become available only recently.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that the mice treated with Endostatin, an
inhibitor of new blood vessel formation, did not develop
resistance to the drug. Normally tumors respond to drugs by
developing resistance, and the more courses of treatment are
tried, the more resistant they become.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Boehm and colleagues from the Dana Farber Cancer Center
and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, reported in the Nature
magazine that repeated use of Endostatin did not provoke
resistance in mice.
</P>
<P>
They were able to make lung cancers shrink even after six
successive cycles of treatment. In between treatments the cancers
were allowed to grow, then were treated again to test for
resistance.
</P>
<P>
None developed, and, most strikingly, all the treated
tumors became dormant even when treatment ceased. Why this
happened is not known.
</P>
<P>
Endostatin, the most powerful inhibitor of blood vessel growth
known, is a protein that has to be injected. It is expensive and
may have toxic long-term side-effects.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sets Up Fund to Promote IT Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore said today it has
set up a Multimedia and Information Technology (IT) Co-Investment
Fund of 50 million Singapore dollars (about 31.25 million U.S.
dollars) to beef up the country's efforts to become a center of IT
innovation.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the establishment of the fund at the National IT
Industry Summit, Minister for Education and Second Minister for
Defense Teo Chee Hean said the fund was to help build a vibrant
local industry for IT innovation and multimedia content
development in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be jointly managed by the National Computer Board
and the Singapore Federation of the Computer Industry (SFCI), he
said, adding that the fund will be used to co-invest in promising
start-up companies in multimedia and IT innovation which find it
difficult to raise capital to expand and grow.
</P>
<P>
By taking a stake in these start-up companies, which need not
necessarily be based in Singapore, the local industry can acquire
new technology and capabilities, and gain access to overseas
markets, Teo stressed.
</P>
<P>
Established mechanisms such as the IT Local Industry Upgrading
Program will be used to identify suitable candidates within the
SFCI member companies to enter into partnership with foreign
technology companies that can augment their capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Teo also said that in the next five years, the country will
focus on three areas to develop Singapore into the IT hub of the
Asia Pacific region: developing the Singapore people,
strengthening the country's connectivity with the world, and
establishing Singapore as a center for IT innovation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's home ownership of computers has gone up steadily
and now stands at 41 percent of the households compared to 27
percent four years ago. In addition, 14 percent of the homes are
now connected to the Internet and the number of Internet dial-up
accounts in Singapore had increased from 17,000 in 1995 to 233,000
by the end of September this year.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Forces Mobilized in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Angola's general staff of the
armed forces disclosed here today that the country's former rebel
movement UNITA is mobilizing its militia forces and weapons in
certain areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angola News Agency, the general staff said to
the local press that the military mobilization is taking place
mostly in Bie in the central part, Kuando-Kubango in the south
east, Uige in the north and Lunda-norte in the north east.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the operation started on October 29 when the
United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution to impose
sanctions on the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, some unidentified planes had invaded at
least 80 times Angola's territorial space, providing military
goods and equipment for the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, white mercenaries have concentrated in the area.
They not only offer military consultation to the UNITA forces,
but are also ready to launch attacks against the government army.
</P>
<P>
In Malange and Uige provinces in the north, soldiers belonging
to Mobutu Sese Seko, the late president of the former Zaire are
stationed on the UNITA's side, whereas in Cabinda province in the
north, forces loyal to Mobutu and former Congolese President
Lissouba also take the side with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the general staff of Angolan army also indicated
the unstable situation in Cunene and Huila provinces in the south
of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China achieved yet another
good harvest this year despite a severe drought north of the
Yangtze River, according to a leading official from the Ministry
of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
This summer's drought in north China, the worst since the
1970s, affected more than 33 million ha. of farmland and caused a
loss of 47 billion kilograms in grain output.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Autumn has failed to relieve the drought
situation, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Autumn precipitation has been less than normal, with water
levels in north China's rivers falling by as much as 20
percent. One section in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has
remained dry for 222 successive days.
</P>
<P>
Water storage in the region's reservoirs has dropped by as much
as 33 percent, with water level in plains falling between 0.5 to
2.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
The recent rainfall in north China provided only slight
relief for the drought situation in Henan and Anhui provinces, as
well as in parts of Shaanxi, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
The drought has affected some 4.33 ha of winter wheat, and 1.6
million hectares of farmland remain fallow.
</P>
<P>
China has allocated over 9.44 billion yuan in the construction
of water conservancy projects. A record 75 million people have
worked to consolidate river dykes and reservoir and water
conservancy projects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Overseas Hong Kong Emigrant Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
said he hoped all Hong Kong emigrants living overseas would
contribute more to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with 36 leaders of overseas Hong Kong communities
in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Li Peng
extended a warm welcome to them, saying he hoped more Hong Kong
emigrants would come to visit China's inland areas and would
undertake mutually beneficial economic cooperation and cultural
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to enhance understanding is to see with your own
eyes and tour yourselves," he said, adding he held the conviction
that through their tour this time they would see that China is
no longer what it was.
</P>
<P>
Especially in the past 20 years since the reform and
opening-up, he said, great changes have taken place, as China's
comprehensive strength has been greatly reinforced and the
people's living standard improved.
</P>
<P>
"The good momentum of China's stable political situation and
economic progress will continue," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
As all of the community leaders were emigrating out of Hong
Kong to the four countries, he said, they should be very concerned
about the Chinese government's policy toward Hong Kong and the
region's future development.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you all responsibly that the Chinese government
will adhere to its policy of `one country, two systems,' `Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy,
which it is now practising in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed: "We're full of confidence in Hong Kong's future
development."
</P>
<P>
He offered his wishes for success to the leaders in their
careers in countries where they live and that they would make more
efforts to improve relations between China and these countries.
</P>
<P>
Leaders present at today's meeting said that, although they
live overseas or hold foreign nationalities, they still cherish a
deep feeling for their native land and will always care about
China's modernization drive and the progress of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their confidence in the development of the
inland areas and Hong Kong, adding that this was the first time
they organized an inland visit and that they believes more
emigrants will come.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are ready to contribute more to the
friendly relations between China and the countries they live in.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, director of the Office of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs under the State Council, attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are more than 1 million Hong Kong
emigrants living in the United States, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
These leaders represent more than 40 overseas Hong Kong
organizations, in which most of the members emigrated out of Hong
Kong in the 1970s and 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- As Thanksgiving day
approached, turkeys sold well at Beijing's large shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
In the supermarkets in the city's eastern section where many
foreigners live, a frozen turkey sold for 300 yuan. Roast turkeys
were even more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Inn shopping center received more than a dozen
orders for turkeys today, and in the past week it sold more than
30 of the holiday fowl.
</P>
<P>
A clerk said turkeys were selling better than any previous
year. She said orders from businessmen and importers began as early
as August.
</P>
<P>
Of seasonal commodities on Beijing's market, orders for turkeys
are not significant, but they sell more easily. "The customers
are all foreigners," the clerk said.
</P>
<P>
A saleswoman at China Grand Hotel supermarket said that no
Chinese customers had bought a turkey in her store.
</P>
<P>
The main reason, she said, is that Thanksgiving Day is not
celebrated like Christmas, which is observed by some Chinese
people. She also said that her Chinese customers are not fond of
turkey meat.

<HEADLINE> HK's Oldest Retailer Opens New Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sincere, one of Hong Kong's
oldest retailers, opened its seventh department store here today
despite a slump in the local retail business in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Covering a total floor space of 2,300 square meters in a
newly-built commercial complex in Mongkok, Kowloon, the new store
offers men's and ladies' wear, shoes, handbags, accessories,
cosmetics and crystals.
</P>
<P>
Mongkok, a densely-populated area where the Kowloon-Canton
Railway and the subway meet, has a significant potential in
consumer spending, said Philip Ma, managing director of Sincere
Group, at the opening ceremony of the new store.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Although the recent slowdown in tourism and decrease
in local consumption are undermining Hong Kong's retail sector, we
are confident that the downturn will only be temporary."
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the seventh store reflects our confidence in
Hong Kong's long-term economic prospects as well as our commitment
to the retail business," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Founded and owned by the Ma family, Sincere set up its first
department store in Hong Kong in 1900 and has since evolved into a
diversified group with retail outlets and property interests in
Hong Kong and inland areas of China.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM to Sue ABC over Bribery Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate will sue the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) and former government adviser Mujo Sefa for a
television report on Wednesday evening which alleged he authorized
payment of bribes.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's spokesman Chris Branwell told the
Australian Associated Press that defamation writs would be issued
in the Supreme Court in Brisbane today.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Skate sought an injunction in Brisbane late
Wednesday to try to stop the ABC report from going on the air but
failed because it was lodged too late, Branwell said.
</P>
<P>
He said further revelations would be made after Skate was
briefed by his lawyers when he returned from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' informal meeting in
Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We will issue other statements after the PM has had time to
have discussions with legal representatives in Brisbane," Branwell
said from Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Skate is very distressed over the matter. Not only for
himself, but also for the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ABC report was based on secret video tapes made by Sefa in
his Port Moresby office.
</P>
<P>
One of the videos shows Sefa and Skate discussing payment of
1,300 U.S. dollars to Internal Affairs Minister Thomas Pelika.
</P>
<P>
A meeting taped later shows Sefa telling Pelika that the prime
minister had authorized the payment.
</P>
<P>
Pelika is filmed accepting an envelope from Sefa.
</P>
<P>
Both Skate and Pelika have denied the bribery allegations and
labeled Sefa a blackmailer.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 549 new companies
were established in the first three quarters of this year, 0.7
percent less than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that those new companies have a total registered
capital of 120 million patacas (about 15.2 million U.S. dollars),
down 39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of new companies established in the third quarter
alone was 171, with a combined registered capital of 59.3 million
patacas (about 7.5 million dollars). The amount of capital was
29.9 percent more than the same quarter of last year and 69.8
percent more than the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the increase in capital in the third quarter may
be a sign of a slow recovery of the economy from a three-year
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Of the newly-established firms, 42.1 percent are wholesale and
retail and trading businesses, restaurants and hotels while others
are involved in construction and public engineering and the
service sector.
</P>
<P>
Of the new companies established in the third quarter, nearly
90 percent were small ones, each with a registered capital of
100,000 patacas (12,666 dollars) or less and most of their capital
came from local residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 17 companies with a registered capital of 2.64
million patacas (about 334,000 dollars) were disbanded between
July and September. They were in businesses such as manufacturing,
construction and civil engineering, wholesale and retail,
restaurants and hotels.

Omwony Ojwok, the UAC director-general, said his organization

Addressing a national consensus workshop on the strategic

the UAC official underlined the need to create a function to

</P>
<P>
The UAC has a good reputation for its dealing with the
epidemic, Ojwok said. But still, there is a need for commitment
of resources, involvement of all stake holders, a five-year
common platform and a need to come up with a strategic framework
from 1998 to 2002, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sponsoring the opening ceremony, Jaberi Bidandi Ssali, the
local government minister, underlined the need to deal with the
adverse impact of the epidemic because it leads to loss of highly

<HEADLINE> Spink's Auction in HK Reaps 2.7 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The two-day auction of rare
coins and stamps by the Spink, a dealer in fine arts, has yielded
almost 21 million HK dollars (2.7 million U.S. dollars), proving
that the Hong Kong market is "still strong."
</P>
<P>
At the Spink's coin and banknote auction on Tuesday, 77 percent
of the lots were sold by value, which was described by Spink
Director Mark Rasmussen as "a great achievement" under the
circumstances of the recent currency and stock market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The top lot of that day's auction was a rare Queen Victoria
Hong Kong Silver Pattern One Tael, sold to an Asian buyer at
667,000 HK dollars (86,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among the banknotes, the top lot obtained 414,000 HK dollars
(53,000 U.S. dollars), more than double its estimated price. This
5-dollar Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation note was
issued on January 1, 1867, the first date of issue for this type,
making it an extremely important banknote in the Hong Kong
currency series.
</P>
<P>
At the stamps and covers auction on Wednesday, a
double-surcharged Chinese Red Revenue stamp issued in 1897
garnered 552,000 HK dollars (71,000 U.S. dollars) while three
precious Hong Kong stamps were sold for over 100,000 HK dollars
(13,000 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Neill Granger, specialist for the Spink's Stamp Department,
commented: "The Hong Kong market is still very strong but is
selective, with top quality and rare items in strong demand from
international buyers."
</P>
<P>
The Spink, an old art dealer based in London, stages auctions
annually in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> International Meeting on Gender Studies Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- An International Conference
on Gender and Development in Asia opened here today at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong to examine the role of women in the fast
growing economies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Fanny Cheung, chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission
of Hong Kong, addressed the opening ceremony of the three-day
conference, the first major one of its kind in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Social changes and economic development in Asia are affecting
the roles and lives of women. "While there are increased
opportunities, barriers remain and gender disparity is still
common," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, as in many other parts of Asia, promoting equal
opportunities and eliminating discrimination are still at a very
early stage, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The Equal Opportunities Commission is a relatively new
organization in Hong Kong. The commission and the Sex
Discrimination Ordinance went into full operation about one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Four distinguished scholars, including Professors Tani Barlow
of University of Washington, Esther Chow of American University,
Elisabeth Croll of University of London, and Maria Mies from
Germany are invited as keynote speakers.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are some 100 people from Hong Kong,
China's inland areas, Taiwan, Malaysia, India, Singapore and some
North American and European countries. More than 50 papers
focusing on three major themes -- gender and political
development, gender and social change, and gender, sex and
violence -- will be presented.

<HEADLINE> ADB Loan to China to Improve Xiamen Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) announced here today that it has approved a 50 million U.S.
dollar loan to China to improve the Xiamen Port.
</P>
<P>
With the ADB loan, the strategically-located port of Xiamen in
China's Fujian Province will be expanded, it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-based bank said the project will expand the port's
break-bulk and bulk cargo handling capacity and rationalize its
cargo handling operations to meet increasing demand from the
growth of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone and provide market
access to resource-rich but less-developed neighboring inland
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will carry an interest rate to be determined in
accordance with the bank's pool-based variable lending system for
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is repayable over 24 years, including a four-year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ADB will provide a technical assistance grant
of 575,000 dollars, financed by the Japan Special Fund, to help
restructure the Xiamen Harbor Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Exit From IMF by Yearend: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
reiterated that the Philippines will exit from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) by the end of this year, a news release from
the Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told the Financial Times of London during an interview in
New York that there are only two pieces of legislation to be
approved by Congress for the Philippines to be ready to say
"goodbye" to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
These are the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program and the
Agricultural Modernization Law.
</P>
<P>
These two programs, which are the preconditions for the country
to exit from the IMF's 35-year tutelage, are now being harmonized
by the bicameral Conference Committee and are expected to be
passed soon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is in New York for an overnight visit after attending the
5th leaders' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Ramos said the Philippines will likely
surpass its export projection this year because the country had
already achieved 25 billion U.S. dollars during the first nine
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the projection of the gross national product
(GNP) growth has been lowered by one percentage point following
the financial turmoil in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The revised target is from 5.5 to 6.5 percent for 1997. Last
year, the GNP grew by 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also said that foreign investments continue to come in
despite the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"We targeted 500 billion pesos (14.5 billion US dollars) for
1997 (but in) the first nine months, we had already achieved 613
billion pesos (17.8 billion dollars) of registered investments in
our Board of Investments," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Large Business Groups Begin Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korean business groups
have begun belt-tightening restructuring efforts to adapt to
expected changes in the business environment following the
introduction of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans.
</P>
<P>
The Samsung Group, one of the nation's best-performing
conglomerates, Wednesday announced a set of retrenchment measures
aimed at coping with the economic crisis and bolstering its
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
It would shed 30 percent of its organization, dispose 34
business lines involving 2,000 employees, reduce 30 percent of its
original investment, reduce the executives' salaries by 10
percent, freeze the wages of the entire staff, and shorten
decision-making processes.
</P>
<P>
The group would also intensify efforts to restructure its
business portfolio. Some marginal businesses would be abolished,
with others to be handed over to small-sized firms and resources
generated from this process would be channeled into promising
"seed" business lines inside the group.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Hanwha Group also disclosed a
restructuring plan highlighted by a 10 percent reduction in
investment, the lay-off of executives and staff, the sell off or
collaboration of three companies and a scale down of its 400
billion-won (about 0.364 billion U.S. dollars) building complex
plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other business groups, including Hyundai, LG and
Daewoo, were also reexamining their investment plans for next year.
</P>
<P>
As a desperate way out, Halla Engineering &AMP; Heavy Industries
Ltd., one of the core companies of the 12th largest Halla Group,
announced on Tuesday to halve its 6,000-strong workforce to 3,000,
withdraw from unprofitable businesses, sell off real estate and
reduce the wages of its remaining workers and executives, thereby
preparing for a possible deterioration in cash flow.
</P>
<P>
Business experts predicted that Halla's decision to lay off
about 3,000 workers, the single largest announcement ever by a
South Korean company, would have a ripple effect on other
cash-strapped companies, which fear liquidity crunch in the wake
of the IMF's restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
They were worrying that as much as 20 percent of the 890,000
employees working in the top-ten large conglomerates may lose
their jobs during the restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Strengthen Campaign Against Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will strengthen its
campaign against child labor, which is on the increase in the
country due to a vicious cycle including poverty and diseases,
Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a report of the Parliamentary
Committee on Women, Youth and Child Development as saying that
many children engaged in child labor are orphans of AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Zambia is one of the countries hardest
hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and it is estimated that between
80,000 and 100,000 people will die of AIDS this year alone.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Labor and Social Security Minister Syacheye Madyenkuku
told parliament Wednesday that the ministry will now direct more
of its efforts toward the scourge of child labor with a view to
eliminating it.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to provide information on those
employing or encouraging child labor so that they could be
brought to book.
</P>
<P>
MP Nakatindi Wina from the ruling party said child labor in
the country is rampant and seems to be on the increase mainly as
a result of poverty.
</P>
<P>
She deplored the unavailability of statistics on child labor
at both the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development and
that of labor and social security.
</P>
<P>
Independent MP Austin Chewe said Zambia has attained economic
growth through private sector initiative which needs to be backed
by supporting the children.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Select Committee criticized the ever
increasing number of child vendors that have flooded the
country's streets.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Set up Pilot Task Forces to Combat Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will establish two pilot
interdiction task forces in the provinces of Nghe An and Lai Chau
respectively to help law enforcement agencies combat drug
trafficking, the country's police chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the police, the customs and border guards in
the two provinces will join hand in assisting law enforcement
agencies in fighting drug trafficking, general director of the
People's Police Truong Huu Quoc told a two-day workshop on
cooperation among anti-drug law enforcement agencies.

Over the past five years, 15,176 drug cases involving 24,453
people were reported in Vietnam, with a seizure of 170 kilograms
of heroin, 7,108 kilograms of opium, 10,718 kilograms of
marijuana, and millions of narcotic ampoules and pills, according
to figures released at the workshop, which started today.
</P>
<P>
50 percent of the drugs were seized along the Lao border in Lai

<HEADLINE> OAU to Enhance Women's Role in Africa: Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
said the OAU is exerting maximum efforts to enhance women's role
and contribution in peace building efforts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the three-day workshop on
documented best practices of women in peace building and
non-violent means of conflict resolution here Wednesday, Salim
noted that over the previous years OAU has been giving much
attention to the promotion of the role of African women in
socio-economic and political endeavors in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, OAU has been working toward the establishment of
the African women's committee for peace called for in the 1993
Kampala action plan on women and peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee is intended to serve as a framework to
facilitate the participation of women in institutions and
mechanisms created by the OAU for conflict prevention, management
and resolution as well as in all other policy organs and sectoral
fora of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)
and OAU.
</P>
<P>
''Women are equitably represented in the executive body of the
secretariat,'' Salim pointed out, adding that one of the guiding
principles of the OAU is to give priority to female candidates
among candidates of equal competence and experience.
</P>
<P>
He urged OAU member states to include women in their
delegations at the various meeting of the secretariat so as to
ensure that women are given appropriate consideration with the
OAU policy organs at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Women activities drawn from Burundi, Congo Brazzaville,
Liberia, Mali, Rwanda, Sudan, Somali and Ethiopia as well as
representatives of government and inter-government organizations

<HEADLINE> Mandela Reiterates Need for Single Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today reiterated his view that South Africa need a
single capital city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after receiving the Freedom of the City of Cape Town
at a ceremony in the city hall, Mandela said he was confident
the Captonians would help the country grapple with this complex
but urgent question.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was referring to the argument about relocation of the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest survey, the majority of urban South
Africans want parliament to stay in Cape Town rather than to be
moved to Pretoria, the administrative capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has three capital cities: Pretoria (executive),
Cape Town (legislative) and Bloemfontein (judicial).
</P>
<P>
Lots of time and money were wasted as government officials and
parliament members have to shuttle between the capital cities.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has been studying the possibility
of relocating the national legislature to save the government
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
However, relocating parliament is no easy job. According to
independent assessment, moving parliament from Cape Town to
Pretoria could cost 3.5 billion Rand or 745 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Seminar Marks 25th Anniversary of China-New Zealand Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Fruitful political, economic
and security cooperation between China and New Zealand is not only
in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but will also
promote prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Officials, experts and scholars attending today's seminar
marking the 25 anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and New Zealand reached a consensus that the two
nations have complementary economies and vast potential for
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the development of cooperation in all
fields, including economic and trade areas, will facilitate the
further advancement of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enjoyed smooth cooperation since forging
diplomatic relations in 1972. Statistics through the end of
September show that the bilateral trade soared to 453 million US
dollars, up from 9.7 million US dollars in 1972. China is
currently New Zealand's fifth largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
China's investments in New Zealand have increased dramatically
over the past few years, with the majority of funds going to the
forestry sector. New Zealand is one of China's primary targets for
overseas investment, with contractual investments from the former
flowing into the latter standing at 277 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Teng Teng, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, noted that China, the largest developing country in the
Asia-Pacific Region, has enjoyed sustained political stability
and economic growth accompanied by social stability.
</P>
<P>
He added that China's vast potential market will enable New
Zealand to expand economic and trade contacts in the Asia-Pacific
Region.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, a developed country, has abundant experience in
development, utilizing and processing farm and primary products,
and advanced technology, said Teng. He said China can learn a
great deal from New Zealand in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Paul Clark, director of China Studies and the University of
Auckland, and Bryce Harland, New Zealand's first Ambassador to
China and current director of the New Zealand Institute of
International Affairs, also addressed the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The University of Auckland and the Institute of Asia-Pacific
Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences are jointly
sponsoring the two-day seminar.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Hopeful of Solution to Political Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said today that he was hopeful of a solution to the
political impasse arising from the Congress party demand for
removal of three ministers from the United Front government, the
Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers belong to the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham
(DMK), a regional party in Tamil Nadu which was indicted for being
linked with the 1991 assassination of former prime minister Rajiv
Gandhi by a judicial inquiry report.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has pressed for their ouster from the Gujral
government, warning that it will otherwise withdraw its crucial
support to the minority government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after holding a brief meeting with
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri in the parliament house
here today, Gujral said: "I am always hopeful of a solution."
</P>
<P>
But he evaded questions as to whether he would send a formal
reply to Kesri's second letter handed over to him last night
reiterating the party's demand to sack the DMK ministers.
</P>
<P>
Gujral on Monday had rejected a similar Congress demand
conveyed by Kesri in his first letter to the prime minister last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Gujral, Kesri evaded all
questions but remarked: "one thing I have to say, that is, I am
totally opposed to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha (the lower
house of Indian parliament)."
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Beef up Affirmative Action by Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South African employers
could be fined up to 900,000 Rand or 187,000 U.S. Dollars for
failing to implement affirmative action, under the Employment
Equity Bill unveiled in Pretoria Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to local media today, the bill provides for
employers having more than 50 employees to take active steps to
ensure that employees at the company reflect the racial
composition of the South African population.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the population are blacks and about 14
percent are whites.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, companies would be required to draw up a plan
according to which it planned to remove inequalities in this
composition and submit this plan to the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
The plan had to specify what measures would be taken to
identify and eliminate employment barriers, including unfair
discrimination which adversely affected blacks, measures to train
blacks, a policy of affirmative action and measures to
accommodate blacks.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for a fine of 500,000 Rand or 104,000
Dollars to companies refusing for the first time to comply with
the act, up to a maximum of 900,000 Rand for a company which has
four previous convictions for contravening it.
</P>
<P>
A Commission for Employment Equity would be appointed with a
chairman, who is to be named by the labor minister, with the duty
of advising the minister and doing general research on equality.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department will listen to comments on the bill until
February next year and then it hopes to push it through
parliament by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The system of apartheid had left South Africa with a legacy of
inequality and workplace discrimination was still a fact, local
media reported.
</P>
<P>
The wealthiest 10 percent of households, mostly white, capture
50 percent of national income while only 1.5 percent of the
national income was distributed to the poorest 20 percent of
South Africa's population. Blacks occupied the lower grades of
employment with whites occupying 96 percent of top positions.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Back From APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, returned here today after attending the Fifth Informal
Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Tung told reporters that the
meeting, held in Vancouver on November 24 and 25, was of
particular significance to Hong Kong as this was the first time
for Hong Kong to participate in the meeting under the name of
"Hong Kong, China" under the policy of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
He said President Jiang Zemin, who also attended the meeting,
reaffirmed to him the importance of the policy of "one country,
two systems" and expressed his concern over Hong Kong's measures
to deal with the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, leaders of the 18 APEC members exchanged
views on the situation in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were optimistic about the long-term development of
the economy in the Asia-Pacific region despite the fact that some
economies were affected by the recent financial turmoil, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that the Asia-Pacific region will still be an
important region in the 21st century which can match North America
and Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders discussed the financial volatility in the region
and agreed that the best way is to deal with it under the
leadership of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
"I have taken this opportunity to brief other leaders of APEC
members on Hong Kong's economic development, the SAR government's
determination to maintain the linked exchange rate and why we have
confidence in this policy," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed the liberalization and facilitation
of trade and investment and the deepening of economic and
technological cooperation in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Vancouver, Tung also met with overseas Hong
Kong people and informed them of the present situation and future
development of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Confident of Early Recovery of Asian Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today expressed confidence that the Philippine stock market
and other stock markets across Asia will recover from the effects
of the currency crisis soon.
</P>
<P>
With the commitments of the world's leading economies to assist
the most distressed economies in Asia under the International
Monetary Fund framework, stock markets in the region are bound to
recover, Ramos said at a video conference with members of his
Cabinet in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is on a working visit to New York now.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the assessment of the APEC leaders, the
"basic qualities of Asia-Pacific economies remain strong and
solid, these most affected economies are bound to bounce back."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a news release from the Presidential Palace quoted
Ramos as saying that apprehensions over an "Asian meltdown" as a
result of the ongoing currency turmoil were "grossly exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, the problems are no mere passing headache for
Asian economies. But I believe, to paraphrase Mark Twin, that all
the talk of an Asian meltdown is grossly exaggerated," Ramos told
300 business leaders and financial analysts in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Asian leaders consider the current financial crisis
as more of a wake-up call than a turning-point on the road to high
growth.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic fundamentals of most countries in East Asia
are still strong, it would be obviously premature to write East
Asia off from the investors' business calculations, Ramos pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
To substantiate his view that East Asia remains conducive to
investments, Ramos said the World Bank has just forecast an
average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 7.6 percent
for the region over the period of 1997 to 2006.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Audit Senior Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
ordered the audit of senior civil servants in all ministries,
parastatals and agencies.
</P>
<P>
A list of such staff should be compiled and forwarded to the
presidency not later than December 12, says a government
circular.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the audit is to "aid communication within
federal government establishments" as the circular demands an
up-to-date record of each ministry or agency for inclusion in the
1997 Federal Office Directory.
</P>
<P>
The submissions should include designations, names, office
telephones and addresses of those to be audited, it says.
</P>
<P>
But some senior civil servants are apprehensive of the motive
of the exercise, the national newspaper This Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is sure of his job any longer. Not after names of
those to be sacked before an upward review of salaries can be
effected," a senior official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fresh order followed a similar government directive at the
instruction of the head of state General Sani Abacha for the
rationalization of federal workers as a precondition for salary
increase.
</P>
<P>
The rationalization is needed because the government believes
the existence of a big number of "ghost workers" in government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The impending cut in the number of civil servants after the
rationalization has aroused anxiety among government staff at low
levels.
</P>
<P>
The audit, according to the newspaper, would also enable the
government to know the various officers manning strategic
positions in government with a view to encouraging
professionalism in the service.
</P>
<P>
The circular ends with a threat that ministries and agencies
which do not return the submissions will not only be listed, but
will also face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But it does not specify what kind of sanctions would be faced.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that this is another major move of the Abacha
administration in its effort to streamline the government over
the recent two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday last week, Abacha ordered immediate dissolution of
the 36-member cabinet. Only three ministers remain in their
posts. The new cabinet is expected to be establish soon.

<HEADLINE> 4 Percent Growth Expected for Lebanon's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow by 4 percent in real terms in
both 1997 and 1998, a report of HSBC James Capel said today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's nominal GDP in 1998 is estimated to rise to 17.20
billion dollars from 15.15 billion dollars expected for 1997,
according to the report issued by the leading brokerage house of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It predicted per capita GDP in 1998 will reach 5,228 dollars
from 4,749 dollars this year and that the inflation rate will ease
to 8 percent from the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the James Capel report cited the country's trade
deficit, growing domestic debt and high budget deficit as the
major concerns.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has witnessed a negative trade balance since the end of
the civil war in 1990 due to surging demand for imports of
construction materials.
</P>
<P>
But the report hailed a cut of trade deficit to 49.5
percent of the GDP in 1996 from 65 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Lebanon's foreign debt will arrive at
3.05 billion dollars by the end of 1997, or 20 percent of the GDP,
which the report said is not so serious a problem as the domestic
debt.
</P>
<P>
"Net domestic debt is expected to reach 10.8 billion dollars by
the end of 1997, or 71.3 percent of the GDP," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said unemployment in 1996 was around 18 percent, and
productive sectors, mainly industry and agriculture, contributed
less than 25 percent to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Activity on the Beirut Stock Exchange could be boosted by new
listings over the next months and estimated the over-the-counter
market at 25 percent of the official market in value.
</P>
<P>
It expected that Lebanese companies will continue raising funds
on international market meet the needs of expansion. Six Lebanese
banks and financial institutions have collected a total of 1.085
billion dollars on the markets since mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's current account deficit fell to 36.1 percent of the
GDP in 1996 from a record high of 65.9 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese Central Bank said that Lebanon has an
overall positive balance of payment amounting to 743 million
dollars in 1996 despite the high current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a recent report that Lebanon has 6.08 billion
dollars of foreign exchange reserves by the first half of November
compared with 5.885 billion dollars at the end of 1996.

BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China sincerely hopes the
Australian government will adopt effective measures to prevent
events which might in any way harm Sino-Australian relations,
according to Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks during this afternoon's regularly

act recently passed by the Australian Senate. The act demands that
the Australian government appoint a "special coordinator for

"We strongly resent the fact that the Australian Senate passed
an act designed to interfere in China's internal affairs," said
Tang, adding that China firmly opposes any move to create a
so-called "special coordinator for Tibetan Affairs."
</P>
<P>
The fact that Tibet is an inseparable part of China has been
readily acknowledged by the international community, said Tang. He
emphasized that no foreign country should or has the right to
interfere in the Tibetan affairs which are purely internal affairs
of China.
</P>
<P>
The act passed by the Australian Senate runs counter to the
good momentum in the development of Sino-Australian relations,

-- One in 100 adults in 15-49 age group in the world is infected
with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, and only one in 10 persons
infected with HIV is aware of his/her HIV status, said a new United
Nations World AIDS Day report published on Wednesday, which warns
that the HIV epidemic is far worse than previously thought. Updated
surveillance techniques uncover 16,000 new infections a day, while
30 million people now live with HIV/AIDS, according to the report
published by Professor Peter Piot, general director of UNAIDS
program.

-- The French government is ready to present the first draft law
on the reduction of work week to 35 hours from 39 hours by the year
2002 for all salary-earners. For enterprises with more than 20
workers, the reduction of working week will start from January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
-- The AIDS epidemic continues its ravage in the world with only
the industrialized world having controlled the expansion of the
disease, said the annual report by the UNAIDS program on Wenesday.
Ninety percent of the HIV/AIDS patients live in developing
countries. In Africa, 8 percent of people of 15-49 age group are
carrying HIV virus. India is the country most touched by AIDS with
three to five millions HIV/AIDS virus carriers. The epidemic risks
to expand considerably in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Reduce Govt Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
decided to reduce 59,000 employees by the end of 1999 in
accordance with its revised public service reform program (PSRP),
the state-owned Zambia Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first 7,000 employees are to be laid off by the end of
December 1997 while another 8,000 jobs will be phased out by
April 1998, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Peter Machungwa, labor and social security minister,
as saying in parliament Wednesday that the government has worked
out two separate package schemes under which employees will be
laid off and compensated for the loss of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
There is a voluntary separation package scheme to be given to
permanent and pensionable civil servants while the second option
will be a compulsory separation package scheme for classified
workers.
</P>
<P>
Among other measures the government has put in place to
facilitate the PRSP include an immediate staff recruitment
freeze, payroll clean-up, reviewing and terminating recent
appointments of all non-professional workers aged 55 years and
above.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said, the government will not continue awarding
salary increases to a "bloated" public service because it takes
away resources from productive sectors to personal benefits.
</P>
<P>
The considerable reduction of staff, together with large-scale
privatization of state-owned and parastatal industries, will
certainly deteriorate the poor country's employment situation and
keep high the unemployment rate, which is estimated
conservatively at about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PSRP was launched four years ago by President Frederick
Chiluba in an effort to reduce the redundant staff and government
expenditures in salary and promote efficiency in public services.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Nominate Presidential Candidate Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos will announce his choice of a presidential candidate, the
standard-bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD, within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is currently on a visit to New York, made the
announcement in an interview with the Financial Times of London, a
news release from the Presidential Palace said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I will announce within 10 days the person I will endorse for
the presidency, including the entire ticket of Lakas, or as soon
as we get home," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will fly back to Manila on December 2.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos said he has not made up his mind yet on who to
endorse for the presidency because the selection process is still
going on.
</P>
<P>
The formal endorsement of the administration party's
presidential bet will be made during the party convention in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are eight Lakas presidential aspirants seeking the
endorsement of the president, but Lakas spokesman Alberto Lumauig
said the choice has been narrowed down between Speaker Jose de
Venecia and former defense secretary Renato de Villa.
</P>
<P>
The other six are Chairman Manuel Morato of the Philippine
Charity Sweepstake Office, Senator Ramon Magsaysay, Senator
Heherson Alvarez, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, Bulacan
Governor Roberto Pagdanganan and Economic Planning Secretary
Cielito Habito.
</P>
<P>
Despite reports that the choice will be between De Venecia and
De Villa, Ramos is not saying anything, keeping everyone,
including his close aides, groping in the dark.
</P>
<P>
The Lakas-NUCD conducted consultation caucus earlier this month
and gave the president a blanket authority to pick the standard
bearer of the party.
</P>
<P>
The presidential elections will be held on May 11, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos can no longer run for reelection since he is barred by
the 1987 Constitution. A move to amend the charter was abandoned
amid nationwide protests.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Produce Instant Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is interested in
producing instant coffee, "The People" quoted a senior official
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Abel Rwendeire, the state minister for trade and industry,
told Allain Gauze, the president of Inter-Africa Coffee
Organization (IACO) and the trade minister of Cote d'Ivoire at a
meeting that Uganda has a two-year plan to attract foreign
investors to create the value adding industry.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held during 37th annual assembly of the
Inter-Africa Coffee Organization between November 24 and 26.
</P>
<P>
Almost all coffee producing countries except Uganda export
instant coffee, and Uganda hoped to join them in producing the
value added goods and has its own impact on the international
market within two years, the state minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Coffee earns 65 percent of foreign exchange for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Allain gauze called upon all African coffee producing
countries to form a consortium and start exporting instant coffee
so as to have an impact on the international market.
</P>
<P>
His country produces about 20,000 tons of both instant and
non-processed coffee a year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Cote d'Ivoire are the first two main coffee
producing countries in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops to Four Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shot
down through 0.6800 US dollars in the afternoon trading today to
hit a new four year low.
</P>
<P>
The currency settled at 68.06 US cents, almost half a US cent
lower than 68.55 late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling against the Japanese yen sparked the move, and
the local unit bottomed at 67.93 US cents in the second half of
the session.
</P>
<P>
That marked a new low for the Australian dollar for 1997 after
it reached 68.18 US cents last month and the lowest level since
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Paul Macarounas, treasury manager of Rothschild Australia, said
the selling had come on top of already bearish factors for the
Australian dollar, including the deepening crisis in Asia, falling
gold prices and much lower-than-expected private capital
expenditure figures released today.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the local currency closed at 86.55 from 87.15.
 Against the mark, the Australian dollar was at 1.2011 from
1.1983.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A sharply stronger Tokyo
share market and a sturdy performance by Australia's
telecommunications giant Telstra helped offset further falls in
gold stocks today, winching the local bourse off its early lows to
finish slightly down.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 0.8 points softer at 2462.3,
after at one stage dipping 18.1 points to 2444.2.

861.1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold was trading in Sydney 1.70 US dollars lower at
296 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The gold index obviously took a battering," Reynolds &AMP; Co's
Grant Williams said.
</P>
<P>
"But Telstra was very strong and that probably helped give a
bit of confidence to other stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index slipped 8.3 points to a close of 1051.8
and the industrials sector climbed 7.3 to 4229.7.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda coffee export is
expected to decline from 4.15 million bag last financial year to
4 million bags this financial year, "The People" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline is resulted from El Nino phenomenon, the paper
quoted a local specialist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Each bag contains 60 kilograms of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The overall coffee export earning of the country decreased
from 358.3 million U.S. Dollars in 1995/1996 to 336.6 million in
1996/1997, an earlier report from Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports are expected to reach 5.0 million bags in
1999/2000 financial year during which the high yielding clonal
robusta coffee planted now will mature, local experts said.
Coffee is the main foreign exchange earner of Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Moves to Reduce Farmers' Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
taken measures to reduce grain farmers' losses as the torrential
rains pounding the country have hampered maize and wheat
harvesting, according to a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
W.K. Koitaba, managing director of the National Cereals and
Produce Board, was quoted as saying that grain farmers in the
country had incurred heavy crop losses and unexpected drying
charges because of the heavy rains in the past one month.
</P>
<P>
To reduce their losses, he announced, the board has reduced by
half its drying and cleaning charges "during this critical and
unfavorable weather period".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that the board had also raised the
moisture limit to 18 percent for maize delivered to depots with
dryers while depots without drying facilities would continue to
accept maize with a moisture level of up to 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, central, northeastern and western regions of the
east African country continued receiving high rainfall amounts
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kenya's Meteorological Department yesterday

<HEADLINE> Lower Tariffs Benefit China's Balanced Growth of Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China's constant and extensive
lowering of tariffs will promote a balanced growth of China's
imports and exports, and will not initiate a situation in which
imports influence its macro-economy, experts say.
</P>
<P>
China has reduced import tariffs five times since 1992. The
average tariff level was reduced from last year's 23
percent to 17 percent on October 1, 1997. Earlier this week,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pledged that China will lower the
average level to 10 percent by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the measure is to help increase imports and lower
the trade surplus so as to create a better balance in China's
foreign trade, according to Professor Li Yushi from the
International Trade Research Institute under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's exports have grown much faster than imports over the
past two years. Exports climbed by 26 percent by the end of June
this year compared with the same period of 1996, while imports
remain at last year's level. The nation's trade surplus
reached 17.8 billion US dollars for the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
To obtain a rapid economic development, China needs the
importation of more advanced technology and equipment, as well as
resources in short supply, said Li, adding that China hopes the
tariff cuts will reduce import costs and promote the growth of
imports.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, deputy director of China's Foreign Trade Office, said
that the establishment of foreign-funded enterprises in China will
enable Chinese businesses to import advanced equipment, quality
raw materials and spare parts needed to upgrade product quality
and enhance market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international community will welcome
practical measures China has adopted to further open its market,
and noted that related efforts will promote the nation's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Li Yushi agreed with Li Jian, saying that the measure will
create a better environment for China's entry into the WTO. He
added that the increase of imports will alleviate
trade frictions between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li Yushi said it is unnecessary for state-owned enterprises to
worry about the pressure from the increase of imports, and noted
that imports currently hold only a small share of the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that state-owned enterprises should
strive to adapt themselves to the highly competitive international
market. He also noted the worldwide trend toward free trade and
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian said China's domestic market has, in fact, established
extensive, direct ties with the outside world. Those industries

facilities and a pension scheme for overseas Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first-ever Overseas Pakistanis Convention held
here this morning and attended by more than 300 participants from
abroad, Sharif said that the government would provide 10,000 plots
to overseas Pakistanis in different cities of the country.

He said the government had already instructed the Capital
Development Authority to allocate a full sector in the federal
capital for overseas Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
With the finalization of all arrangements, he added, overseas
Pakistanis would be invited to submit their applications for a
housing plot in Islamabad and special care would be taken to
ensure that the sector would be developed according to the needs
of overseas Pakistanis.

To meet this need, the government is introducing a pension
scheme which will extend coverage to the needy such as the old and
the disabled, Sharif said.

There is no such pension in the country for overseas Pakistanis
at present, according to the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Aquatics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The east China coastal province
of Fujian has established an export-oriented aquatics industry,
and has emerged as the world's largest eel processing center.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial aquatics department said the
sector's goal is to establish large-scale specialized production.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Fujian's 20,000 ha. of aquatic breeding bases
produced 100,000 tons of aquatic products in 1996, with the 2,000
ha. specialized eel production base recording exports of over
60,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Processed eel products from Fujian hold 40 percent of the
international market, with annual exports earnings from roast eels
standing at 450 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's 480 foreign-funded joint ventures specializing in
aquatics production involve investments of over 360 million
U.S. dollars, according to 1996 figures. Enterprises funded with
investments from Taiwan account for 50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics for the first half of 1997 show that the
province used foreign investments of over 100 million
U.S. dollars, a figure equalling the total for the previous two
years.
</P>
<P>
The official said the province is also applying for World Bank
loans of 70 million U.S. dollars to promote the sustainable
development of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The official noted provincial plans through the end of the
century call for establishing the sector as a pillar industry with
an annual output of 4.9 million tons and earnings of 39.5 billion
yuan.

Nelson Mandela has described the death of former Malawian
President Kamuzu Banda as regrettable.

for 30 years until he was ousted in the first democratic
elections in 1994.

<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Nanjing, east
China's Jiangsu Province, have revived a comatose patient
following 30 days of electrotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The course of therapy marks the first time Chinese doctors have
successfully used electrotherapy to revive a comatose patient.
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, Zhu Lixing, 36, lapsed into a coma
resulting from an intracerebral hematoma. Zhu remained in a
comatose state following removal of the hematoma, according to
today's Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the China Brain Revivification Center, affiliated
with the Nanjing Marine Medical School, conducted high-level
consultations and decided to treat Zhu by using electrotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The first procedure involved inserting a 3-cm electrode in the
patient's cervical spine. Doctors then administered one hour
courses of electrotherapy six times a day.
</P>
<P>
An electroencephalogram (EEG) conducted on the second day of
treatment indicated the patient was breathing on his own, with
doctors detecting simple movements on the third day.
</P>
<P>
The center continues to use high-pressure oxygen therapy along
with electrotherapy. Zhu has regained normal functions related to
speech and movement of the upper limbs.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the patient has completely recovered from a
comatose state.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Becomes Dominant User of Port Mombasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA) has named Tanzania the third biggest user of the port of
Mombasa among the transit countries, the East African Standard
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a statement issued by the KPA managing
director Lenny Mwangola as saying that Tanzanian traffic passing
through the port of Mombasa increased to a record 345,670 tons
last year from 91,358 tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that "this contradicts certain press
reports that the sole Kenyan port is losing business to its
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Transit traffic handled at the port totalled 1.7 million tons
in 1994, 1.9 million tons in 1995 and 2.8 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the transit countries, Uganda has recorded a steady
performance in the last three years with 915,000 tons in 1994,
1.1 million tons in 1995 and 1.2 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the biggest user of the Mombasa port while the
second largest transit user is Rwanda whose traffic amounted to
780,831 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that the KPA attaches great
importance to the Uganda market and those of the other Great
Lakes region countries and that was why the port opened a liaison
office in Kampala recently to assist shippers.
</P>
<P>
The port handled total traffic of 8.3 million tons in 1994,
8.0 million tons in 1995 and a record 8.6 million tons last year.

<P>
Erastus Mwencha, acting COMESA secretary general, said at the

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Housing Reform in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The south China city of
Guangzhou has initially established a socialized and
commercialized housing system compatible with the nation's market
economic system.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Shen Bainian said the new housing system is
characterized by the establishment and perfection of public
fund-raising and housing allocation systems.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the two systems have strengthened the role the State,
collectives and individuals play in raising funds for housing
construction.
</P>
<P>
The housing funds accumulation system introduced to more than
6,800 units by the end of April this year involved one million
workers and staff, with total funds surpassing 1.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The funds accumulation system has also played an important role
in promoting housing construction. Loans of 820 million yuan from
the public fund were used for housing construction by the end of
1996, greatly easing housing shortages for over 20,000 families.
</P>
<P>
The city has sold nearly 260,000 state-owned apartments to
residents since the introduction of housing reform, with over
three billion yuan returned to the fund during the first stage.
</P>
<P>
The city has also raised rental fees in line with market
demand. Rental costs will account for an average 15 percent of
household income by the year 2000.

of 37.8 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Apartment sales were just over 2 billion yuan, up 47.5 percent
from the same period last year. Observers say that the desire to
own an apartment will grow as the housing reforms increase,
revitalizing the market.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Government has issued a circular calling for
more effective measures to get unoccupied flats on the market and
to increase consumer spending on housing.
</P>
<P>
It states that people who buy apartments on the open market can
get a big tax cut, and prices for open-market apartments in some
parts of the province will be cut 10 percent to 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Relics Moved out of Downtown Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Some Late Stone Age relics
that were discovered at a construction site in downtown Beijing
have been moved so that work on an overseas-funded project won't
be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
A number of stoneware items and animal fossils dating back
20,000 years were discovered at the Oriental Plaza's construction
site on Wangfujing Street, at the end of last year. Archaeologists
say that they are the oldest ever found in the central part of the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
When the relics were discovered, construction work was
suspended, and archaeologists have visited the site repeatedly
since March, according to Wang Wuyu, deputy-director of the
Beijing Cultural Relics Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the site intact but not stop the construction
work, archaeologists decided to move the earth containing ancient
traces and store it in a museum in Beijing for the time being. So,
they cut a 200-sq.m. olace into 3- to 4-sq.m. pieces around the
relices, and covered them with special paper to keep their
original shape, and put them in special wooden boxes to move
them. The work took nearly 20 days.
</P>
<P>
"After an exhibition center is built on the site in the
Oriental Plaza, the earth of the ancient site will be replaced,"
Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
Li Cunxin, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute
of Archaeology, said that exhibits of pottery, stone implements,
bronzes, and other archaeological findings are not uncommon for a
museum, but it's rather difficult to put an entire historical site
in a museum.
</P>
<P>
"We can only display photos of the sites and written
descriptions, meaning a big restriction on researchers," Li
noted. But, after the ancient site is restored, Beijing will have
another Stone Age site in addition to Peking Man at Zhoukoudian,
southwest of the city.

<HEADLINE> Convict Tells Court of Plan to Kill Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A jailed convict has described
how he waited for the "right time" to detonate a Claymore mine
that would blow off Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's entire
motorcade near the National Sports Stadium in Harare.
</P>
<P>
William Namakonya, a Malawian, was giving evidence Wednesday
before High Court Judge Justice Chatikobo on the third day of the
treason trial of opposition ZANU Ndonga leader Ndabaningi
Sithole.
</P>
<P>
"I was waiting for 2 p.m. because that is when the motorcade
was going to pass," Namakonya said, adding, "the right time did
not come because I was arrested before it was time."
</P>
<P>
Asked how he had established the motorcade's time, Namakonya
said together with his accomplice Philemon Feranando, an
ex-Mozambican soldier, they had studied that 2 p.m. was the time
that Mugabe passed the stadium on his way to his rural home in
Zvimba.
</P>
<P>
He is serving 12 years after he pleaded guilty to possession
of arms of war linked to the assassination bid on Mugabe on
August 18, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Namakonya and Feranando worked for Sithole as security
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Namakonya testified that Sithole was involved in the plans to
kill Mugabe as he had sanctioned the collection of the two
Claymore mines, an AK assault rifle and ammunition from
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement to kill Mugabe was with Sithole starting from
the time we were told by Sithole to go to Chipinge of Mozambique
to collect the mines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sithole has pleaded not guilty to recruiting people for
military training in Mozambique between 1983 and 1995 in order to
overthrow Mugabe's government.
</P>
<P>
The veteran nationalist has also denied conspiring to kill
Mugabe and possessing arms of war.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Infrastructure Development Accelerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The construction of vital
infrastructure facilities in Mindanao, the southern Philippines,
has been intensified during the last five years, as a result of
focused support from the national government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by various government agencies showed that
as of this year, more than 2,200 kilometers of roads in Mindanao
have been paved, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 34 percent of these roads or a total of 773
kilometers were paved by the national government in just five
years.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao's power generating capacity increased by 44 percent or
501 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
The early completion of two major ports in the cities of Davao
and General Santos also reflects the administration's seriousness
in facilitating the development in Mindanao, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A number of airports in Mindanao were further improved and two
major airport projects in Southern Mindanao were accomplished by
the administration.
</P>
<P>
An international airport in General Santos has been completed
and is currently operational, while the Davao International
Airport was also upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration is eyeing for the construction of
the first two lines of the Mindanao railway which will connect the
cities of Davao, Cotabato, Iligan, and Cagayan de Oro.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure budget for Mindanao for 1998 will be
increased to 7.01 billion pesos (203 million US dollars), which is
almost double from the 3.6 billion peso (104 million dollar)
budget for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has economically lagged behind the other regions in
the country due to its backward infrastructure facilities and an
unstable law and order situation.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration has made great efforts in recent years
to push the development in Mindanao, especially after it forged a
peace accord with a main Muslim separatist Moro National
Liberation Front last year, which ended nearly 30 years of war in
the region.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River To Get Two New Bridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Two new bridges are being
built across the Yellow River in Lanzhou, the capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongli Bridge, named for the Zhongli Group, a Gansu
enterprise that has spent more than 10 million yuan on it, will be
a 310-m. suspension bridge, with a main tower 37 m. high. It will
be finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yintan Super Bridge, financed by the Lanzhou Economic and
Technological Development Zone at a cost of 160 million yuan, will
be 803 m. long and 25 m. wide in the central section. It will be a
cable-stayed bridge that can withstand earthquakes registering 8
on the Richter Scale, and will be finished in May of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River, China's second longest, divides Lanzhou into two
parts. The first bridge across the river, connecting the northern
and southern parts of the city, which is still in use, was built
of iron in 1907 and reinforced in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The two new bridges, which were designed by the Ministry of
Railways' No.1 Survey and Design Institute's Bridges and Tunnels
Division, will make conditions better for developing the northern
part of Lanzhou City and will relieve the traffic problem in the
city proper, local officials say.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Attends Dinner Party by Alberta Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calgary, Canada, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here today that economic cooperation between
China and Alberta, Canada, has been growing fast in recent years
and is particularly fruitful in agriculture and energy.
</P>
<P>
"All these exchanges and cooperation have vigorously enhanced
mutual understanding and friendship, thus greatly pushing forward
the development of China-Canada relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a dinner party in honor of him and
his wife Wang Yeping by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein.
</P>
<P>
"Your excellency's delegation will see first-hand that Alberta
firms are working hard to cultivate further fruitful partnerships
with the people of China," Klein told Jiang at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
"Their efforts have helped our province become the leader in
economic growth and new jobs in the country," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Klein said there have been many successful business
partnerships between the people of China and the people
Alberta. So many of China's emerging needs correspond to
Albertans' strengths, in areas such as agriculture, energy,
petrochemical and cold-weather technology.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang announced that China will soon open a
consulate general in Calgary. The new consulate general will be
the third one in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that with our concerted efforts," the friendly
relations and cooperation between China and Alberta will be
further strengthened, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is currently on a four-day state visit to Canada starting
here today.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, Jiang said, he will exchange views with
Canadian leaders on developing bilateral relations and other
issues of mutual interest and have extensive contacts with people
of all walks of life in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that my current visit will help enhance the
friendship between our two peoples and promote the establishment
of a new type of cross-century friendly relations and cooperation
between our two countries," Jiang added.

MEXICO CITY, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Argentina today
reiterated their support for economic integration between Mexico
and the South American Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Under a joint statement between Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo and visiting Argentine President Carlos Menem, the two
countries agreed to be consistent in their pursuit of a free trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the two countries back the economic
austerity measures adopted by the Brazilian government to overcome
the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, the two presidents expressed confidence
in their two countries' ability to curb economic hardship
triggered by the international financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The two governments today also signed eight cooperation
agreements, including one on avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president, who arrived earlier in the day, cut
short his state visit, as the head of his military guard,
Gen. Juan Carlos Ponce, died of heart failure in a hotel here,
reports said.

Menem will return to Argentina tonight. He is scheduled to
visit Italy following his three-day state visit to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iraq's Offer Should be Judged by UNSCOM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Reacting to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's invitation of U.N. experts and diplomats to his
palaces for weapons checking, the United States said Wednesday
that it is up to the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) to judge the
sincerity of the offer.
</P>
<P>
"UNSCOM has a job to do. That is to locate and destroy weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq. Any Iraqi offer needs to be judged by
UNSCOM against this standard," State Department spokesman James
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said UNSCOM "must be allowed 'immediate, unconditional
and unrestricted access to any and all areas' it wishes to
inspect."
</P>
<P>
The INA, Iraq's news agency, said Saddam's invitation "is in
response to the lies and falsifications of American officials."
</P>
<P>
The United States has demanded Iraq let U.N. weapons inspectors
enter 78 sensitive areas, which were said to be Saddam's
residential palaces and Villas, alleging that there might be
hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq first rejected the demand, calling it an encroachment of
"national sovereignty." But on Wednesday, Iraq decided to invite
two representatives of countries that are involved in the
inspection of its weapons and five experts or diplomats from
countries in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. State Department official said the offer seems to
be a significant breach in the Iraqi line.
</P>
<P>
"It could be a welcome step if it means real access, if it
means that UNSCOM inspectors will go into the sites and be able to
do their work in all of these sites unhindered. And that's
obviously the question that we can't answer today," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to End Tests on Food Import From SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to stop radiation tests on food imported from other
countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), Commerce Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed import policy for 1997-2000 has prescribed a total
withdrawal of radiation tests on food items imported from India,
Pakistan, the Maldives, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new import policy would ensure that the items are
produced in the countries exempted from the radiation test.
</P>
<P>
However, local businessmen and commerce officials fear that
unscrupulous traders might use the new policy to get radiated food
items into the country.
</P>
<P>
As a result, huge quantities of rice, wheat, corn, fruits and
vegetables might pour into the country unchecked, local press
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Among SAARC members, India tops the list of food exporters to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission scientists will continue to
check the radiation level in all food items imported from
countries other than SAARC members, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> China's Dairy Industry Showing Some Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The dairy industry of China
is suffering from product surpluses but has enormous potential,
people attending an international symposium held here by the
Shanghai Milk Group were told recently.
</P>
<P>
A company source told Xinhua that, since 1993, the country's
dairy industry has grown 6 to 10 percent annually, and in 1996,
produced 6.25 million tons of dairy products. That figure is
expected to reach 7.8 million tons by the year 2000 and 17 million
tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, dairy products still account for a very small part of
the country's food industry, which had an industrial output value
of 600 billion yuan in 1996, while the dairy sector merely
accounted for 0.4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita milk consumption in China is now 5 kg a year,
compared with 300 kg in developed countries, 36 kg in
developing nations, and the world average of 105 kg.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic producers face a problem of serious
over-stocking, and a large number of dairy farms are losing
money. Global milk producers compete in the Chinese market, while
local state-owned milk makers are losing their market-share.
General Administration of Customs statistics show that China imported
298,000 tons of dairy products from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
New products like fresh milk and yoghurt do well and have an
increasingly larger share of the local market, and small milk
producers have formed a number of large groups, and some private
companies are getting involved in the business.
</P>
<P>
The two companies, Inner Mongolia Yili and Beijing Sanyuan,
have become the first milk producers to be listed on the stock
market, and several other companies are planning for issuing
shares.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 37,000
refugees from Burundi have crossed into Tanzania during the past
six weeks, and the refugee population continues to increase by
400 to 500 every day, aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is tense because many refugees are crossing
into Tanzania every day," said a regional government official in
Kigoma town, quoted by local paper "The Guardian" today.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting between Pierre Buyoya's Tutsi-dominated army
and the rebels is continuing in Burundi's Makamba Province where
many Hutus are reportedly being killed.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi army is said to have killed hundreds of Hutus in
the province because they are suspected of harboring rebels
fighting to topple the Buyoya military junta which ousted the
civilian government in a coup in July last year, according to the

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Construct Roads for Major Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government plans to spend 100 billion Shillings (about 160
million U.S. Dollars) on constructing more roads to Tabora
region, a major producer of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by President Benjamin Mkapa Wednesday
during a week-long tour to Tabora in the northwest of the
country, "The Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The roads will link up Tabora with Kigoma, Mbeya, Mwanza and
Singida, Mwanza regions and other western and southern highland
areas, Mkapa said in the Urambo town.
</P>
<P>
Although Tabora is a major producer of tobacco which earns the
government a lot of foreign exchange, development of the region
is hindered by poor road conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told local residents that the African Development Bank
has agreed to fund the construction of the Itigi-Tabora road.
</P>
<P>
He said the road, leading to the Kigoma port, would cater for
transiting cargo to Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic
of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Chinese Province Pushing Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, a major heavy industrial base, is using its private
sector to invigorate its economy, which has been dominated by
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is planning Liaoning's first
provincial-level meeting of private entrepreneurs as the starting
point of its strategy to encourage the private sector, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Governor Wen Shizhen recently told a group of government
officials that the provincial government hopes to remove all
ideological obstacles in the way of private economic
development. The private sector should have its own political
status and a sound ideological and social environment must be
created for it.
</P>
<P>
Merely trying to reinvigorate large and medium-sized
state-owned firms is no answer, he said, and there is no
contradiction between developing the private sector and reviving
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to abolish or revise
local policies and regulations that block the way of developing
the private sector, while more preferential policies are being
considered, and private enterprises are being encouraged to get
involved in hi-tech industries, processing, and consumer goods,
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
For a long time now, Liaoning has been slower than other
coastal provinces in developing the private sector. According to
official sources, the non-state sector accounts for less than 20
percent of the province's entire economy.
</P>
<P>
Local private companies have been asked to pay over 40
different additional levies that have not been authorized by the
central government, but imposed by local government departments.
</P>
<P>
However, the private sector is overcoming various difficulties
and, by the end of 1996, the province had 1.15 million private
companies, employing 2.34 million people. It also produced 51.6
billion yuan worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, private businessmen have purchased or leased
34 large or medium-sized state firms and hired over 800,000 people
who had been laid off by state companies.

<HEADLINE> India's United Front Remains Firm in Standoff with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling United Front
on Wednesday night rejected a fresh demand from the Congress party
on the removal of three ministers from its government, lobbing the
ball back into the court of the Congress party, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers belong to the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham
(DMK), a key member party of the United Front, which was indicted
of being linked with the assassination of former prime minister
Rajiv Gandhi by an investigative report.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party, which lends crucial outside support to the
United Front minority government, has been demanding the removal
of the three ministers as a precondition for continued support to
the government led by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a letter sent by the Congress party President
Sitaram Kesri on November 20, Gujral rejected the demand on Monday
night but offered to talk with the party to seek a solution to the
political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of top Congress party leaders on Wednesday
night, Kesri sent a second letter to Gujral asking him to drop the
DMK ministers "immediately."
</P>
<P>
Barely two hours later, however, the United Front Core
Committee at a meeting late Wednesday night decided to stick to
its position on the DMK issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are as firm and as united as ever on the question of DMK,"
United Front Spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said after the meeting of
the Core Committee.
</P>
<P>
The United Front was unanimous that its constituents would
"sink or sail together," Reddy said, adding that the front had
authorized the prime minister to formally reply to Kesri's second
letter at an "appropriate time."

<HEADLINE> Tourism Becomes Fastest-Growing Industry in SW China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the tourism
sector in southwest China's Yunnan province has been quicker than
that of some traditional industries this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic and Technological Research Center
under the provincial government, Yunnan's annual growth rate in
the tourism sector in the past six years averaged 40 percent, 30
percentage points more than its overall economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the tourism sector was also far ahead of
that of agriculture, industry, commerce and foreign trade, whose
annual growth rates were reported at less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, tourism had generated seven billion yuan in
profits for Yunnan, accounting for five percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in Yunnan has been growing faster than tourism
nationally. In the first half of the 1990s, the annual growth rate
in the number of overseas tourists in Yunnan was 25.3 percentage
points higher than the national average. The province has now
become one of China's top ten provinces for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has the greatest diversity of ethnic groups in China,
and is known for its natural resources and ethnic culture.
</P>
<P>
A complete tourism network of hotels, restaurants, travel
agencies, transportation, souvenirs centers, and entertainment has
been formed, with 1,000 tourist enterprises employing 160,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the center predict that Yunnan's average annual
growth of tourism in the next few years will be above 25 percent,
and its tourism sector will have 16 billion yuan in annual profits
by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> The Caribbean Could Be Third Regional Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The secretary
general of the Caribbean States Associations (CSA), Simon Molina
Duarte, said today that the Caribbean countries could form the
third fully-integrated trading bloc in America by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Duarte spoke at a preparatory meeting for the third meeting of
the CSA Council of Ministers, to be held in the Colombian city of
Cartagena, which is located on the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
"I regard CSA as the third bloc in America, which will
contribute to a hemispheric integration, because by that time
there will be three existing blocs: South America, North America
and the Caribbean," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CSA was established in 1994 and started official functions
in July 1995 after ratification by its 25 member countries.
</P>
<P>
He said since its operation, CSA has set up a profitable
tourist area, coordinated countries to help natural disaster
ridden regions and implemented a program to enhance air and sea
transportation infrastructure in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Duarte also mentioned problems currently affecting the member
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Primarily, the crises in Caribbean countries are caused by the
lack of capabilities to contend with mounting globalization,
market openings and liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
CSA is comprised of 14 permanent members and 11 associate
members.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
make efforts to conclude negotiations with Hungary on its EU
membership in 2000 and Britain will endeavor to speed up this
process.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook made the remark today at a
joint press conference here after meeting with his Hungarian
counterpart Kovacs Laszlo.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the British government holds that the EU should start
negotiations first with those countries that are most ready to
meet the demands and challenges of EU membership.
</P>
<P>
While not all member states agree with the approach, the issue
will be decided at an EU council meeting in Luxembourg next month.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Britain will hold the EU's rotating presidency
when the accession talks begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
During its presidency, Britain will take the task of
establishing the European conference, an arena for dialogue
between the EU and its membership applicants. Also the conference
will help these countries in their efforts to meet membership
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived here last night for a one-day visit to Hungary,
the first stop of his three-country Central Europe tour that also
includes Poland and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Senna Trial Verdict Open On December 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A verdict on the death of
Brazilian F-1 driver Ayrton Senna will come out after nine-month
war of words on December 16, a judge said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Antonio Costanzo said he would retire to think over the
verdict after lawyers for Formula One team chief Frank Williams
and five other defendants gave their closing statements for
absolution.
</P>
<P>
Senna, a three times world champion, died during the 1994 San
Marino Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The bone of the contention was the weld on Senna's steering
column which snapped just as the Brazilian ace entered the
Tamburello curve, causing him to lose control of his car.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Maurizio Passarini made a sharp turn-around earlier
this month, letting Williams off the manslaughter charges with
three track officials shelved but refusing to absolve the two
remaining defendants: Williams' technical director Patrick Head
and former team designer Adrian Newey.
</P>
<P>
He asked the judge to sentence them for one-year suspension for
their "microscopic" error - one of the lightest sentences
available for manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
If Head and Newey are convicted they would have an automatic
right to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Ready To Increase Crude Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is ready to increase
its crude oil production up to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd)
or 200,000 bpd higher than its current production ceiling of 1.33
million bpd, a spokesman of the state oil company Pertamina said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be no problem to Indonesia's oil production if an
agreement to increase the production limit is reached at the 103rd
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) conference,"
President Director of Pertamina Faisal Abda'oe said on the
sidelines of OPEC's ministerial meeting here last night.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what OPEC will decide. If Indonesia gets higher
than its current quota, we will fulfill it because we still have
the capability to produce about 200,000 more barrels per day,"
Abda'oe said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting, which was opened here Wednesday evening, will
discuss the details for increasing the production quota despite
most of the members supported the proposal put forward by some
countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran.
</P>
<P>
OPEC needs to set a new quota in anticipation of the growing
demand on the world market which is predicted to increase by about
two million bpd, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abda'oe added that OPEC member countries should also consider
oil prices so that the new quota would not induce the decline in
oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that oil prices were currently stable, namely,
between 18.5 to 19.5 U.S. dollars per barrel although it was
reported that OPEC's oil supplies were currently exceeding the
quota.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) reported that OPEC
member countries's production reached 27.85 million bpd while
OPEC's official quota set in Vienna last June was recorded at
25.03 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
OPEC currently consists of 11 countries: Indonesia with a quota
of 1.33 million bpd, Iran (3.6 million bpd), Iraq (1.2 million
bpd), Algeria (750,000 bpd), Kuwait (two million bpd), Libya (1.39
million bpd), Nigeria (1.865 million bpd), Qatar (378,000 bpd),
Saudi Arabia (8 million bpd), United Arab Emirates (2.16 million
bpd) and Venezuela (2.359 bpd).
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting will last till December 1.

MEXICO CITY, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico`s international
reserves dropped from 25.46 billion dollars to 25.41 billion
dollars, a loss of 50 million dollars by the end of November, the
Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the drop in reserves occurred during the
third week of November, when total foreign currency reserves were
diminished by 203 million dollars to 18.17 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the drop in reserves to the federal
government's expenses which amounted to 286 million dollars, a
figure above the amount of foreign currencies obtained from
various means by the monetary authority of the country.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said it had an 80-million-dollar surplus,
due to recent changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Other foreign currencies, besides the dollar, contribute to
assets and liabilities of the Bank of Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Energy Shortage Causes Regular Blackouts in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is suffering regular
blackouts caused by severe energy shortage, Ukrainian Energy
Minister Alexy Sheberstov said today.
</P>
<P>
Power supply is suspended up to two hours per day in southern,
western and central areas of Ukraine, including large cities of
Lvov, Kharkov, Simferopol and Odessa, Sheberstov said.
</P>
<P>
Fuel reserves at power plants have fallen to a record low,
about 30 percent lower than the same period of 1996, the minister
said. Half of the plants have less than two days' coal reserves.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, the energy crisis is caused by residents and
factories who are unable to pay their electricity bills. The
arrears have so far gone up to 3.2 billion gryvnas (about 1.7
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other, the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank suspended a total of 2.8-billion-dollar loan for market
reforms in Ukraine's energy sector this year on the grounds that
Ukraine failed to cancel a 20 percent energy subsidy for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's power plants have then almost no money on hand to buy
either Ukrainian coal or expensive Russian gas from monopolistic
traders.
</P>
<P>
"Factories stop operation because of electricity cutoffs, so
that they have no cash to pay the energy bills," Sheberstov said.
"Power plants receiving no payments from customers have no money
to buy fuels, so they generate less electricity. It's a vicious
circle."

NANJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight Chinese students who
graduated from two-year college and polytechnic schools in Jintan
City, east China's Jiangsu Province, have found jobs in the
countryside and have become village leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jinhua, who graduated from Jiangsu Petrochemical College,
went to a remote village, Xiangtou, and was appointed Village
Party Secretary.
</P>
<P>
He drafted a three-year economic development plan for Xiangtou
Village together with other cadres immediately after he settled
down in a shabby office. "Becoming a village leader from a
two-year college student is an opportunity and challenge for me,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The eight graduates attended a special training course called
"How to Be a village Head" before starting their new jobs.
</P>
<P>
At the talent exchange market in August, Jintan set up a table
to attract graduates to work in the village. Twenty-four students
signed up and eight were chosen through strict examinations.
</P>
<P>
This recruitment drive is aimed at attracting high-quality
graduates to work in the Chinese countryside.
</P>
<P>
Among 400 village heads, 65 percent have a secondary school
education or lower.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dramatic change -- the students used to be very
reluctant to work in the countryside," an official said. "It is of
great importance for the students to be willing to work in the
places where they are needed most."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China's social security is
being overhauled, and work on the proposed numbering system should
begin next year.
</P>
<P>
Standards for the numbers are being drawn up by the State
Bureau of Technical Supervision, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
These standards will be public by the end of this year, said
Shu Zhongming, division chief of the bureau's Standardization
Section.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, Chinese citizens will receive their own
identification number for insurance, including medical and pension
plans.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, a person's social security number will be the same
as the number of the ID card," said Shu.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security is now sorting out the ID
numbers.
</P>
<P>
Establishing social security numbers is an essential component
in China's social security reform, leading to a standard
administration system, a Ministry of Public Security official said.
</P>
<P>
China began reforming its social security system in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The present system -- combining social and personal
responsibilities -- replaced the practice in which State-owned
enterprises covered employees' insurance, even for the retired and
the redundant.
</P>
<P>
China's new social security system is comprised primarily of
four components -- social insurance, aid, welfare and
allocation.

<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Auditors of Yamaichi (Phils.)
Inc. said the local subsidiary of Japan's Yamaichi Securities Co
Ltd. is still financially viable to continue with its local
operations.
</P>
<P>
Auditors from both the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that the brokerage
house is in good financial standing and that it has had no
violations.
</P>
<P>
"The firm has no violations at all and is very liquid.
Furthermore, all its financial and transaction records are in
order," local newspaper The Manila Chronicle today quoted auditors
as saying.
</P>

PSE officials also disclosed that the local affiliate has more

Japan decides to liquidate its equity and sell its PSE membership
seat.

Representatives from the SEC, after visiting Yamaichi's office
to determine the real financial status of the firm, also said
everything is in order.

<HEADLINE> PNG PM Denies Corruption Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinean (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate today denied corruption allegations against
him by his former adviser, saying that secretly filmed videotapes
televised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) aimed
to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
The footage, made by Skate's former adviser Mujo Sefa, appeared
to show Skate authorizing the payment of 1,300 U.S. dollars in
bribes through his internal affairs minister, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported today in a dispatch from
Vancouver, Canada,
</P>
<P>
"Any fair-minded person can see that the episode is a crude
set-up," Skate said in a statement released Wednesday from his
hotel in Vancouver, where he had been attending the Asia Pacific
Economic Corporation summit.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
should give credence to the feeble efforts of a blackmailer to
discredit the prime minister of a neighboring country," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I am seeking legal advice and will be traveling to Sydney (on
Monday) for the mining and petroleum conference to represent my
country. I have nothing to hide."
</P>
<P>
He said he had been aware there would be an attempt to
embarrass him and Internal Affairs Minister Thomas Pelika after
"pathetic" attempts to blackmail him failed.
</P>
<P>
Pelika said that he and Prime Minister Bill Skate had been the
target of a crude blackmail attempt, AAP said in a separate story
from PNG capital Port Moresby today.
</P>
<P>
The ABC last night screened video tapes filmed secretly by
former government adviser Mujo Sefa showing Internal Affairs
Minister Thomas Pelika accepting an envelope allegedly containing
1,300 U.S. dollars to pay off the local media.
</P>
<P>
Sefa alleged that Skate authorized the payments and others
totaling 17,955 U.S. dollars to ministers and backbenchers.
</P>
<P>
However, Pelika told The National newspaper today that he
returned the money after consulting Skate.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today promised to
maintain drought relief to Papua New Guinea and Australia's
commitment to Bougainville peace despite the claims against Skate.
</P>
<P>
Howard told reporters in Vancouver he had not seen the ABC
report but had been briefed on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously they are very serious allegations, but that is a
matter for Skate to respond to," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Skate phoned him last night to tell him the
allegations were going to be made.

BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications will issue a stamp which depicts a cloth tiger
to welcome the upcoming 1998, the year of tiger in the Chinese
lunar calendar, said today's China Daily,
</P>
<P>
The paper said China has a tradition of using folk handicrafts
as pictures featured on Shengxiao stamps, each carrying one of 12
animals according to the Chinese lunar calendar, to represent a
specific year in rotation.
</P>
<P>
Gao Qiuying, a village woman in north China's Shanxi province
made the cloth tiger, a traditional handicraft called Lihou
Tiger. Gao's cloth tiger handicraft was selected by postal
officials and experts from the ministry as a rough sketch for the
forthcoming Year of the Tiger stamp.
</P>
<P>
Based on Gao's handicraft cloth tiger, designers from the
ministry's Stamp Printing Bureau will design and further improve
it so that the cloth tiger will be able to be printed clearly,
artistically and beautifully on the upcoming Year of the Tiger
stamps.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Stamp Printing Bureau said bureau
officials and designers have contacted and visited Gao. All
copyright-related matters have been settled.

STOCKHOLM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ostersund placed its hope on
the Swedish sports groups on Thursday after it failed to win
support from the Swedish Olympic Committee (SOC) in a bid for the
2006 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The SOC board has voted not to back the Swedish town in its
fourth consecutive Olympic bid.
</P>
<P>
Ostersund has appealed to the SOC for reconsideration of the
decision at its joint annual general meeting with Sweden's Olympic
sports federations scheduled on Thursday in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The sports federations could reverse the decision with a
majority vote.
</P>
<P>
The SOC listed lack of improvements in the bid as the top
reason for giving the thumbs-down.
</P>
<P>
Ostersund lost to Lillehammer for the 1994 Winter Games by only
a few votes and its bids failed again in 1998 and 2002.

Statements of interest should be submitted to the International

HANOI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin Wednesday ended his three-day official visit to
Vietnam, which is believed to mark a significant improvement of
Russian-Vietnamese ties.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin is the highest-ranking Russian official to visit
Vietnam since the Russian Federation was established in June 1991
following the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he held separate talks with Vietnamese
Communist Party Chief Do Muoi, President Tram Duc Luong and Prime

</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leaders said the friendship and entensively
cooperative ties between the two countries have stood the test of
time and become "a priceless treasure."
</P>
<P>
They added that Vietnam has consistently viewed the former
Soviet Union and present Russia as a great country. The two
countries have left behind the period when they experienced
stalemate in their bilateral relations. Russia and Vietnam have
now entered a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Vietnam is a strategic partner of the Russian
Federation. Russia will do its utmost to develop the friendly and
cooperative ties between the two countries in many fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Russia hopes it will continue to get cooperation
from Vietnam which is the coordinator of Russia's relations with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries have held elaborate
discussions about bilateral economic, trade and scientific and
technological cooperation and signed a number of agreements in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Unions to Focus on Aid to Laid-off Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions at all levels
should put re-employment of laid-off workers at the top of their
agenda, Zhang Dinghu, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions, said yesterday, according to Today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Helping address the re-employment problem is of vital
importance to the country's reform, development and stability," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this September, the number of laid-off workers
exceeded 9.6 million, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Federation sources said the figure is expected to increase as
technology becomes more advanced and in-depth reform of
State-owned enterprises takes off.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Jieping, another federation official, more
than 100,000 officials have set up contacts with 20,000
money-losing firms and 500,000 families with laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The federation has allocated 12 million yuan (1.4 million US
dollars) in relief funds to be distributed to poverty-stricken
workers during the Spring Festival next year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from financial aid, trade unions nationwide have set up
more than 1,300 organizations to train about one million laid-off
workers annually, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, trade unions have set up more than 300 employment
agencies in 100 cities, helping at least 300,000 find new jobs.

<P>
PRAGUE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Housing construction in the
Czech Republic has recovered from a serious slump; a large number
of apartments have been completed during the first three quarters
of this year, a spokesman for the Ministry of Regional Development
and Housing said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the first three months of this
year, 9,500 apartments were made available to tenants, up 20
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During this year so far, about 86,000 apartments were
reportedly under construction, an increase of 17 percent from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Within the past few years, however, housing construction has
been in a major slump as a result of money shortages.
</P>
<P>
Although housing projects have been increased, the supply falls
short of demand, according to the spokesman. Some big cities are
still confronted with the lack of adequate and sufficient
housing.

SANTIAGO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Finance Minister
Eduardo Animat today ruled out the possibility that the financial
crisis in Southeast Asia would affect Chile's national budget for
1998.
</P>
<P>
But the crisis is likely to make an impact on the trading
balance, he added.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that the crisis is temporary and will not
produce serious consequences for Chile.
</P>
<P>
However, Animat said that exports may be affected because
Chile's sales to the Asian market are likely to drop, specially
those to Japan, one of its major trade partners.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Chilean government will keep a watchful
eye on any changes in the trade balance.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gross International Reserve Level Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves fell to 10.126 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of October this year from the end-September level of 10.966
billion dollars due to the payment of foreign exchange debt.
</P>
<P>
The 840 million dollar decline in reserves was also caused by
the Central Bank's dollar sales, local press reports today quoted
a statement from the bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The end-October reserves level was equivalent to 2.5 months of
imports of goods and services, it said.
</P>
<P>
The latest gross international reserves, however, are still
higher than the 9.5 billion dollar level at the end of July when
the peso fell sharply against dollar among the currency turmoil in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has sold more than 2 billion dollars to fend
off speculative attacks on the peso since the regional currency
crisis hit the country.
</P>
<P>
The reserves level once stood at 12.24 billion dollars in the
first quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Industries' Sales Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight of the Philippines' 14
major industries posted significant decline in sales for the first
11 months this year due to high interest rates and peso
depreciation, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing results of a recent survey conducted by the Federation
of Philippine Industries (FPI), the Business Daily said among the
eight industries were automotive parts production, cassava
planting and millers, and battery manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Automotive parts posted the biggest decline of 30 percent to 35
percent in the third quarter due to credit crunch in financing and
high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply of cars in the market due to trade
liberalization was also listed as a factor leading to the decline
in automotive parts sales.
</P>
<P>
Cassava producers suffered 10 percent drop in sales over the
past two years due to tariff reductions and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Battery manufacturers also complained of high interest rates
which pulled down sales by 20 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Other industries were not yet affected but they warned of
possible price increase if the regime of high interest rates
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
Local banks raised interest rates significantly in the wake of
the sharp depreciation of the Philippine peso starting this July.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Members Agree To Increase Production Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The member countries of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have agreed
to increase their respective oil production quota, Indonesia's
Mines and Energy Minister IB. Sudjana said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Wednesday at the opening day of the
OPEC's 103rd ministerial meeting held here, said the minister. But
the conference had yet to decide by how much each member country's
quota would be increased, Sudjana said, adding that the question
still needed further debate.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in production quota will of course decrease oil
prices on the international market so that it needs prudent
considerations to augment the quota," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A delegate from a Gulf state said Saudi Arabia expected that
OPEC could increase its production quota from 25.033 million
barrels per day (bpd) to 27 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait hailed the
decision. The two countries however opined that the decision to
increase the production quota should be made through a compromise
among all OPEC member countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudjana also said that Indonesia alone was ready to increase
its production quota from 1.3 million bpd to 1.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, former OPEC secretary general Soebroto of
Indonesia said OPEC should provide the details of the amount of
oil production and the tendency of oil prices on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Details of the production level would be decisive to the future
of OPEC as an organization which had the authority to govern the
oil trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd OPEC ministerial meeting opened here Wednesday
evening. Delegates from the 11 member countries attended the
conference which will last till December 1.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said, the increase of OPEC's production
ceiling and the preparation for the Third Conference of the
Parties (COP) will be main topics during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
COP meeting will be held in Kyoto, Japan, next week.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Becoming Civil Servants in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Lu Yonggang, a civil servant in
a township government office in the city of Zhangqiu in east
China's Shandong province, is one of 41 farmers who have gotten
township government posts recently.
</P>
<P>
Only four years ago, 25-year-old Lu was a farmer. Then he got
work at a small cement factory and was sent by the factory for a
two-year education program because of outstanding work.
</P>
<P>
Then he decided to take the civil service exam, the first time
that farmers were allowed to participate in the exam. 3,226 people
passed the exam.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he had never thought of being a civil servant in the
past, but now says, "My example tells other people that as long as
a farmer improves himself by getting more education, he has a
chance of holding a government post."
</P>
<P>
Now, many of Lu's friends expect to follow suit. One friend
said he had not registered to take the exam because he had no
higher education, but he's applying to study in a correspondence
school. He said he'll take part in the exams after he gets a
diploma.
</P>
<P>
Township government officials say they believe the farmers who
have become civil servants were born in rural areas and are
familiar with rural conditions and are able to do their new jobs
well.

</P>
<P>
These representatives can visit the presidential palaces "for a
period of one week or more, or for a month, so that they can find
out the truth," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The invitations were made after U.N. weapons inspection teams
said the presidential palaces are the likely targets for hiding
weapons of mass destruction, like chemical or biological weapons.

MADRID, November 27 (Xinhua) -- All first division soccer
matches this weekend in Spain will be cancelled because of a
referees' strike, a senior referee said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many referees were angered by insults from players and club
officials after last weekend's first division games, which
included hotly-disputed penalties in several high-profile games.

<P>
Jose Lopez Nieto, one of the most respected referees in Spain

<P>
"It seems we agree in this country that whoever shouts loudest
is rewarded, and it shouldn't be like that," said Lopez Nieto.
</P>
<P>
He said that the referees would stand by their decision.

"Much more tranquility is needed. After Monday we'll meet with

<P>
DOHA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- World number one Jansher Khan of
Pakistan was crashed out of the Qatar Squash International
Tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jansher lost to fourth seed Canadian Jonathon Power 15-14, 15-6
and 15-2 in a semi-final match. Power will meet third-seeded Scot
Peter Nicol in Thursday's final after Nical beat second-seeded
Australian Rodney Eyles 17-16, 15-7 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Nicol's win saw him reverse a loss to Eyles in the World Open
final in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Power became only the 15th player to beat Jansher in more than
10 years and it was only the Pakistani's 50th defeat in all
competitions since he first set out on the PSA World Tour as a
17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Jansher has won 89 major titles since then, but refused to
defend his world crown in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> People in Northwestern China Paying Less for Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Do people really need to pay
several hundred yuan for simple cold medicine? Why can't a person
get a simple prescription if he or she refuses to have an
expensive examination?
</P>
<P>
These questions have been asked by people in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region who feel they've been overcharged by hospitals
and are beginning to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Public Health in the region recently passed a
regulation dealing with these problems and effectively stops local
hospitals from overcharging patients.
</P>
<P>
It has asked hospitals to lower the ratio of income from the
sale of drugs to total income, and says that "except for the
pharmacy, no department or individual has the right to handle
medicines."
</P>
<P>
The regulation controls the use of quite expensive medical
equipment and imposes a strict ban on unnecessary fees imposed by
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
It has been praised by local people, and the hospitals in
Xinjiang have also come up with reforms to change their management
policies.
</P>
<P>
People's Hospital signed letters of commitment with 24 drug
companies and stopped doing business with companies that paid
doctors to promote the use of their drugs. Another hospital lower
the cost of certain examinations by 20 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more wards have been opened with more beds to
serve farmers, herdsman, and other people who might have financial
difficulties, and at least a thousand extremely poor people have
enjoyed free medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Doing Well in Saving Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, one of the
country's traditional industrial bases, has achieved a great deal
in economizing energy consumption during 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
Local energy consumption for every 10,000-yuan GNP during the
period dropped 32 percent from the previous five-year period. In
the past, local energy consumption was much higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Jilin, with heavy industry contributing 70 percent of the local
economy, has 643 large- and medium-size industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, the province saved 4.5 million
tons of standard coal in energy, one of the reasons for a 64
percent rise in local industrial output from the previous five
years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the province allocated special funds for energy-saving,
which will be used for an energy-efficient lighting project and
for technological improvements.
</P>
<P>
Jilin spent nearly 1.2 billion yuan on basic construction and
technological improvements for saving energy during the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
It also resorted to economic levers such as pricing, credit,
taxes and depreciation to encourage local enterprises to improve
energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The province also placed more effort on the development and use
of bio-gas, solar energy and wind power and has built up a number
of small hydropower stations with installed capacity totalling
65,000 kilowatts.

<HEADLINE> Hope Revives in Bonn for Tax Reform Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The German government today saw
new hope to push through its ambitious tax reform package after
the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) surprisingly
indicated that it would be ready to renegotiate the reform.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliament debate in Bonn today, SPD leader Oscar
Lafontaine signaled that his party would be ready to break the
tax reform impasse provided that the government also come up with
a reasonable compromise.
</P>
<P>
He also surprised the government by offering to cut Germany's
top income tax from 53 percent to 49 percent and the lowest one
from 25.9 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he
welcomed the SPD's readiness to renegotiate tax reform, but was
also disappointed that the tax cut offers made by the SPD were not
so big as sought by the government.
</P>
<P>
Waigel had proposed early this year to cut the top income tax
to 39 percent and the lowest income tax to 15 percent. But the
plan was categorically rejected by the SPD which said it was
socially unjust and would create a huge financial shortfall which
could not be offset.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform is one of the major initiatives launched by the
German government to boost investment and help cut the country's
record-high unemployment of over 4.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Looks Forward to Talk with Canadian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CALGARY, Canada, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin today said that he was looking forward to
extensive talks with Canadian leaders so as to usher China-Canada
relations into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by Canadian Governor-General
Romieo LeBlanc, Jiang said he would discuss with Canadian leaders
bilateral relations oriented towards the 21st century and major
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the luncheon, LeBlanc welcomed Jiang. The
visit is the first by Jiang as the Chinese president to Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Our citizens hold your country in great respect, and we share
with the Chinese people the goals of peace, prosperity, and
partnership in the future," LeBlanc added.
</P>
<P>
About one million Canadians are of Chinese origin, including a
sizeable community in Calgary. Thousands of young people in Canada
are studying the Chinese language, according to LeBlanc.
</P>
<P>
Mark Rowswell, a young Canadian, master the complex art of
Chinese "cross-talk." He is better known in China as "Da Shan."
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc told Jiang that his visit "will further advance our
strong relationship. It is a great pleasure for all of us to host
your visit to Canada."
</P>
<P>
In reply, Jiang expressed his appreciation at the "significant
contribution" to the China-Canada relations.
</P>
<P>
"The past 27 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties
have witnessed a tremendous development of China-Canada
relations," Jiang told the luncheon, adding the relations "have
gained a sound momentum of an all-round development."
</P>
<P>
"China and Canada have also enjoyed good cooperation in
promoting Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and maintaining world
peace, stability and development," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a 21-gun solute wellcome ceremony was held
at the airport and red carpet rolled out for Jiang. The
picturesque city of Calgary is the first leg of his five-day trip,
which will also take him to Ottawa and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"My current visit to Canada is aimed at deepening
understanding, enhancing friendship, looking into the future and
developing cooperation," Jiang said upon his arrival at the airport
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang started his visit to Canada after taking part in the
fifth leaders' informal meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Vancouver on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trip will also take him to Mexico.

<HEADLINE> US Sure of Support From Allies in Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it was confident its allies would be behind Washington
for "serious" military action against Iraq if it was deemed
necessary by Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I do feel strongly we will get the support we need when the
time comes," Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, the commander of
U.S. forces in the Gulf, told a briefing after a tour of the
region.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab world, disillusioned by U.S. pro-Israel and
anti-Iraq policies in the Middle East, has already rejected
Washington's requirement of using their bases to strike Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan has told the United States the Arab
nations would not support any U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Anhayan of the United Arab
Emirates today even said that the Arabs should forgive Saddam
Hussein's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
In his strongest bid yet to have Iraq readmitted to the Arab
world, Sheikh Zaid said a decision on reconciliation with Iraq
should be taken by a majority rather than by consensus.
</P>
<P>
Zinni made the above remarks after he met with leaders in Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and other nations in the region, following
a brief visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last week
with no result in her persuasion of Arab leaders to provide bases
for U.S. use in case there is a strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zinni repeated remarks made Tuesday by Defense Secretary
William Cohen that there would be "no more pinpricks" if the
United States decided to punish Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. "serious" military action would "put at risk
the things that mean most to Saddam... things like the special
Republican Guards that keep him in power, his own infrastructure
and command and control systems and those kinds of things."

<HEADLINE> Onassis Foundation President Attacks Athina's Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Stelios Papadimitriou,
President of the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation
and one of the trustees of the fortune of Onassis heiress,
12-year-old Athina Roussel, today criticized Athina's father for
fabricating rumours of a kidnapping plot.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Papadimitriou
stressed that a routine check by the security firm of security
arrangements for Athina had been exploited by Roussel for his own
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Roussel said recently that a kidnap attempt had been made
towards his daughter Athina, the sole heir to a fortune amassed by
her grandfather, the shipping magnate.
</P>
<P>
Papadimitriou said that Thierry Roussel and his associates had
plotted against himself and the three other members of the
foundation and of the board of trustees, Apostolos Zambelas,
Pavlos Ioannidis and Theodoros Gavriilidis, assigned by Athina's
mother, Christina Onassis, to administer the trust along with
Roussel.
</P>
<P>
They were trying to take control of the fortune, estimated at
three billion U.S. dollars, from the four other trustees, in
complete contradiction of the last will and testment of Christina
Onassis, and of rulings by the Swiss supreme court, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was founded by Aristotle Onassis shortly after
his death in 1975.

<HEADLINE> FAA Warns of Boeing 747 Electrical Surges in Wiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration today warned airlines of possible electrical surges
in wiring near the central fuel tanks of some Boeing 747 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The FAA asked airlines to install new equipment to shield
certain wiring in the fuel monitoring system in some Boeing 747s
in the next 12 months and also called on airlines to immediately
inspect wiring in some fuel pumps in older Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the measures were based on recent tests by the
National Transportation Safety Board as part of the TWA Flight 800
crash probe.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have ruled out a bomb or missile attack and have
focused on the electrical system near the central fuel tank of the
Boeing 747 that crashed on July 17, 1996 off New York City. The
TWA Flight 800 exploded shortly after taking off from New York's
JFK International Airport, killing all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The inspections will involve wiring in the Fuel Quantity
Indication System aboard 167 Boeing 747 aircraft with U.S.
registry and wiring in the scavenger fuel pump in 196 Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the recent NTSB tests found higher than expected
voltage spikes were possible because of electromagnetic
interference in the fuel indication system wiring near the central
fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
Silicone insulation found during some inspections is prone to
deterioration from fuel used to cool and lubricate the pump
motors.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the TWA Flight 800 accident, the FAA called for
inspections of all Boeing 747 and Boeing 757 fuel pumps. Last
January it required reinspection and repair of wiring leading to
fuel tank booster pumps on Boeing 747s made before 1980.

WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Kim Gye-gwan, vice foreign
minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) held
talks on Wednesday with Charles Kartman, principal deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kim made no statement to reporters as he walked through the
State Department's main entrance, flanked by aides.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Kim and Kartman, the most senior officials
of the two countries to hold talks here for the first time, were
discussing issues ranging from liaison offices to missing American
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed last week's agreement among the DPRK,
South Korea, the United States and China to begin peace talks for
the Korean Peninsula in Geneva on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said they hoped to make some progress in
Wednesday's talks but were not anticipating any major
announcement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU: WTO Takes Positive View on EU's Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) has taken a positive view on the European Union's trade
policy, said a EU official in charge of WTO questions here today.
</P>
<P>
Herve Jouanjean, director of WTO questions at the European
Commission, commended the EU's commitment to the WTO-based trading
system and its leadership role in both ongoing negotiations and in
seeking further trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of the WTO's biennial assessment, he
said that the review had confirmed the essentially open looking
path taken by the EU in its trade policies.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the WTO has given a strong endorsement to the EU's
trade policies and our commitment to future liberalization,"
Jouanjean told reporters at the press conference held at the end
of the two-day review of the EU's trade policy on November 25-26.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional areas of concern were not ignored, but the review
was able to look at the wood as a whole, and not just the trees,"
he said. "At the same time it has underlined its view that, the
EU, as the world's largest trading entity, has a particular
responsibility towards the multilateral system, and that we must
continue down the outward looking path we have taken."
</P>
<P>
"In our view, with the in-built work program of the WTO, and
with the decisions taken by ministers in Singapore, we have an
unparalleled opportunity for further trade liberalization, which
must be tackled in a comprehensive way," Jouanjean said.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip issues here
struggled in quiet trading, but stocks were mostly higher today,
supported by some encouraging economic news and a calm day on
Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.17 points to 7,794.78.
after surrendering an early 37-point gain.
</P>
<P>
But broad-market indicators edged high as trading slowed before
the holiday weekend. The stock market is closed on Thursday for
Thanksgiving and there will be an abbreviated session on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 484.06 million
shares as against 571.16 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 0.82 to 951.64, the
NYSE composite index rose 0.33 to 497.31, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 5.46 to 1,594.50.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.25 to
428.16, and the small-company dominated American Stock Exchange
composite index rose 0.69 to 662.49.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street started the day strong after share prices rose 1.1
percent in Tokyo. The partial recovery from Tuesday's 5 percent
slide helped push Hong Kong and other Asian markets higher. In
Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index rose 1.7 percent and London's FT-SE
100 rose 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. stocks also drew a boost from the bond market, which rose
after a series of reports suggesting the economic pace may remain
moderate enough to keep inflation in check.

<HEADLINE> WTO Reviews EU's Trade Policies in Past Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's single
market program and liberalization under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have generally improved access conditions for
the EU's trading partners and increased exposure of the EU economy
to international competition and structural change, WTO stated in
its report on the EU's trade policies and practices published here
today.
</P>
<P>
However, despite progressive liberalization, there are still
significant internal obstacles to efficient resource allocation,
resulting in higher costs in some industrial and services sectors
with adverse consequences on growth and competitiveness, the
report points out.
</P>
<P>
The report covers changes since the last Trade Policy Review,
held in 1995. The report prepared by the WTO secretariat, along
with a policy statement prepared by the EU itself, provided the
basis for a review of the EU's trade policies and practices in the
WTO Trade Policy Review Body on November 25-26.
</P>
<P>
Average most-favored-nation tariffs on industrial products have
fallen from six percent in 1995 to 4.9 percent in 1997, and should
be under three percent at the turn of the century, says the
report. In agriculture, average rates, although much higher, were
nonetheless reduced from 25 percent in 1995 to 20.8 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Import protection and the use of contingency measures remain
significant in particular industrial sectors such as textiles,
automobile and consumer electronics, where high tariffs may
co-exist with intense anti-dumping activity, the report points
out. Agriculture continues to enjoy the protection of high
tariffs, with peaks in cereals, meat, dairy and poultry, sugar and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report emphasizes that the review is taking place in a
period of policy development in the EU. Major changes are in
preparation, such as the movement towards economic and monetary
union, further enlargement, and additional reforms in key sectors
such as services and agriculture. These factors, together with the
perspective of continuing negotiations under the WTO "built-in
agenda", are likely to maintain pressure for further economic and
trade reforms.
</P>
<P>
After commenting on the EU's economic environment, recent
developments, trade policy by instruments, border measure,
measures affecting production and trade, trade policy be sectors,
the WTO report concludes that the EU's trade policies and
practices have generally evolved in a favorable direction.
</P>
<P>
This should benefit both the EU and its trading partners, the
report says, adding at the same time that the present transitional
period in European economic integration presents challenges both
for the EU and the multilateral trading system.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Better Lawmaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Lawmaking in the European
Union (EU) countries has made progress but a better job still
needs to be done in this regard, said the European Commission, the
EU's executive body, today.
</P>
<P>
A report, which has been adopted by the commission on measures
taken in 1997 to improve lawmaking in the EU, shows that efforts
made since the Edinburgh European Council in 1992 have borne
fruit.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted in the report that prior consultation was
becoming more frequent, the quality of legislative drafting had
improved, work to simplify and consolidate legislation was
continuing and it was now easier to gain access to Community law.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission said that law procedures should be
simplified further and it is calling all member states to
implement Community law more effectively.
</P>
<P>
It also called on its member states to strive for better
lawmaking in order to play an active part in the process of
improving the quality of legislation.
</P>
<P>
The commission also noted that the present commission had tried
to concentrate on political priorities since taking office, which
it believed had led to fewer pieces of legislation being proposed.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Hussein Invites UN Experts to Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
today invited U.N. experts to his presidential houses to make sure
if there are any weapons of mass destruction as alleged by
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by a meeting of the Revolution Command
Council and the ruling Baath Party, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two representatives from each of the 20 countries that take
part in the U.N. inspection teams, and five experts or diplomats
from each of the 15 U.N. Security Council members have been
invited, involving a total of 115 people, according to a statement
by the Revolution Command Council.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did not specify the number of presidential
houses to be inspected.
</P>
<P>
These representatives can visit the presidential palaces "for a
period of one week or more, or for a month, so that they can find
out the truth," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The invitations were made after U.N. weapons inspection teams
said the presidential palaces are the likely targets for hiding
weapons of mass destruction, like chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the tension triggered off by Iraq's expulsion of
U.S. members from the U.N. weapons inspection teams earlier this
month could be further eased with the invitations.
</P>
<P>
The crisis which threatened war was defused when
U.N. inspectors returned to work last week after Russia's
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after Saddam's
1990 invasion of Kuwait could only be lifted after U.N. inspectors
verify that Iraq is disarmed of mass destructive weapons.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urged to Compensate Holocaust Survivors in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli parliament speaker Dan
Tichon today urged the German government to find a quick solution
to the controversial issue of compensating some 3,000 Jewish
survivors of the Holocaust living in eastern Europe, Tunisia and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of justice, not money," said Tichon, who is in
Bonn on a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Germany has paid about 100
billion German marks (55 billion U.S. dollars) to Holocaust
survivors in the West since 1949. However, those Jewish survivors
living in eastern Europe had been excluded from the compensation
programs during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
International Jewish groups have been demanding that Holocaust
survivors in the former East Bloc should also be eligible for
monthly German pensions of 500 marks (270 dollars), the same as
Nazi victims in the West.
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting international pressure, negotiations between
Bonn and Jewish groups have failed to achieve any major progress
on the issue so far.
</P>
<P>
A solution should be found quickly, because most of the
Holocaust survivors would have died in the next five years due to
their old ages, Tichon said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Not Satisfied With Turkish Experts' Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed its
dissatisfaction with the proposals made by the Turkish committee
of experts on Greek-Turkish relations, saying that these proposals
did not change the situation between the two neighbors as it
stands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Greek government would study the
report and decide if and how the process would be continued.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish experts sent a report to the Greek government two
days ago, proposing that the experts of the two countries should
meet on December 10 and each side should state the issues in which
they believed some rapprochement could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that the establishment of
confidence-building measures begin at once.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reppas denied that Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis would meet with his Turkish counterpart, Mesut Yilmaz, in
Paris and said that such a meeting would be premature.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Simitis and Yilmaz discussed the bilateral
relations between the two countries on the sidelines of the first
summit meeting of leaders of the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Turkish committees of experts were set up in May this
year with the aim of reviewing procedural matters relating to
differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries have been strained for
decades over territorial disputes and the Cyprus problem, but both
sides have been trying hard to improve their ties since earlier
this year and no real progress has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> EU Aims to Boost Jobs Creation With Structural Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
structural funds should create or maintain about 880,000 jobs in
Europe's declining industrial regions until 1999, the European
Commission said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive agency Wednesday made the remark on the
structural funds programs approved in the beginning of 1997 for
the period from 1997 to 1999 in a press release issued in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The new programs all cater to the need of the declining
industrial regions for employment-intensive growth and sustainable
development, according to a Commission survey published on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the survey, EU Regional Affairs Commissioner
Monike Wulf-Mathies said, "The immediate priority for Community
assistance is -- and will be -- job creation."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner added that the EU was helping achieve this by
reducing dependence on "outdated activities, through a process of
restructuring and diversification aimed at developing a modern
indigenous business culture."
</P>
<P>
Under the programs, some 9,000 million ECUs (about 1,100
million U.S. dollars) is to be spent in the EU's declining areas,
almost half of which will go to measures to improve the growth and
competitiveness of industry and business, especially small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
Around 16.4 percent of the total population of the EU lives in
declining industrial areas, the so-called Objective-2 areas,
according to the Commission.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Qin Meets UN Chief on Human Rights Covenants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun today met with UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on human rights covenants.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ambassador Qin said that in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR shall remain in
force and be implemented through the law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that at present, China is not yet a signatory state to
the two covenants. However, in order to fully reflect the
principle of "one country, two systems," the Chinese government
will, in the light of the relevant provisions of the two
covenants, entrust its Permanent Mission to the United Nations
with transmitting the implementation report of the two covenants
by the HKSAR to the corresponding treaty bodies, so that the
treaty bodies and the international community at large can have a
better understanding of the human rights situation in the HKSAR.
