<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Forgiven for Feeding Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the Belgian city
of Bruges Tuesday decided not to file charges against Prime
Minister Jean Luc Dehaene for feeding bread to sparrows in
violation of the local laws.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was seen and filmed recently by a Belgian
television team feeding some birds in the city in northwestern
Belgium. The city happens to be the birthplace of Mr. Dehaene.
</P>
<P>
Some members from the city government, after hearing the news,
immediately demanded that the prime minister should be charged in
court as an ordinary Belgian citizen.
</P>
<P>
However, the city finally decided drop the case against the
country's top bird feeder, arguing that Mr. Dehaene was probably
not aware of the law against feeding birds, which only took effect
last December 17.

<HEADLINE> PNA-Israeli Committees to Meet Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight Palestinian and Israeli
joint committees will begin proceedings Sunday to examine some
outstanding problems that will decide the future of the peace
talks, a senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The committees were agreed to be formed during talks between
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser
Arafat Sunday night, PNA Minister of Civil Affairs Jamil Tarifi
said in an interview with the Voice of Arab radio of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Forming joint Palestinian-Israeli committees to discuss pending
differences regarding the Hebron agreement was cited in the Hebron
protocol clauses.
</P>
<P>
As the Israeli side had not taken a political decision
regarding the issue, Arafat and Netanyahu thus met recently to
reactivate this part of the deal, Tarifi added.
</P>
<P>
Tarifi hoped that the Israelis would be serious and eager to
implement the accords which were previously reached.
</P>
<P>
The eight panels will try to solve virtually 33 pending issues
ultimately related to the resumption of talks on the final status
of the Palestinian territories set for mid-March and further
implement the 1995 Interim Agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is any change in the Likud government's
policies, Tarifi said that he could not say that any change has
occurred in Israeli politics up till now.
</P>
<P>
"The actual implementation of the agreements was the main element
in the entire process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that the coming steps toward settling the
Palestinian issue depend on how the joint committees formed with
Israel will work.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Abu Dhabi television Monday, he said the
joint committees will examine all outstanding issues, namely
security, economy and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The panels include ones regarding the construction of an
airport and a seaport in Gaza, a safe passage for Palestinians
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and transferring taxes and
other funds to the financially-distressed PNA.

<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in France
created or saved 22,814 jobs with 350 projects in 1996, which
represents a 15 percent increase over 1995, said French Minister
of Management of Territory and City Jean-Claude Gaudin today.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the jobs were created by European
investors, followed by American investors with 21 percent, and the
continuously arriving Asian investors with 15 percent, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
In the northern region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, 3,517 jobs were
created by foreigners in 1996, mainly due to an investment by the
U.S. car equipment producer Delphi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Express Corporation created 1,200 jobs with
its development project of the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in
Paris, while the Dutch electronics company Philips employed 780
French workers with television and mobile phone projects.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four percent of the jobs were created in the electronics
and telecommunications sectors, followed by the automobile
industry with 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official "Invest in France" network, run by the Ministry
of Management of Territory and City, expects the number of jobs to
be created by foreign investments to increase by 15 percent this
year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Providing Shelter for Iraqi Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today denied any shelter for Iraqi agents who staged
aborted assassination against Saddam Hussein's son Uday Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference held in the
presidential palace "We have not yet understood what
assassination attempt against Saddam's son was and who did it."
</P>
<P>
Of course, the 62-year-old president said, "various factions
have accepted the responsibility."
</P>
<P>
But, he added, +Iran has no role in this issue and we would
never be engaged in terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said "the Iraqi government knows that
we did not do that even during the war. We would not do it now
and would not do it in the future."
</P>
<P>
He noted that it might be Iraq's domestic situation demands
that they raise accusations against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry had earlier denied any involvement
in an assassination attempt on the 32-year-old Uday Hussein,
terming Uday's allegation as "baseless".
</P>
<P>
However, Uday Hussein, the oldest son of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, had accused Iran of the involvement in the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Uday was wounded in a cowardly attack on December 12 while
driving his car through Al-Mansur district of Iraqi capital of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Iran and Iraq, President Rafsanjani said
"Iran and Iraq have been at war for some time but now there is
no pretext for them to distance themselves from each other."
</P>
<P>
Iranian First Vice-President Habibi met with Iraqi
Vice-President Taha Mohedin in Rome during the World Food Summit
last November.
</P>
<P>
That was the highest level contact between Iran and Iraq in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice-President Mohedin extended his invitation to Habibi
to visit Baghdad. However, Iranian Foreign Ministry last December
ruled out the possibility of the visit, saying "It is simply the
proposal by Iraq."

<HEADLINE> US Companies Cautious Selecting Job Applicants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Hiring a job candidate is no
longer a simple process for many U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Driven by costly lawsuits and a sharp rise in workplace
violence, personnel departments are turning increasingly to
detective-style background checks as a standard part of the hiring
process, according to a report of the Christian Science Monitor
today.
</P>
<P>
Companies would turn to special firms for such kind of service.
Already, services that test the personalities of job candidates
and detail their criminal, credit, and employment background are
growing by as much as 30 percent a year, say companies in the
field.
</P>
<P>
The figures offered by the National Safe Workplace Institute
show that companies lose more than 120 billion annually from
workplace theft.
</P>
<P>
Workplace homicides have risen nearly tenfold in a decade.
Murder is the second highest cause of on-the-job fatalities, and
disgruntled co-workers or clients account for 10 percent of such
homicides, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Ten to 30 percent of job applicants lie about their past, say
background-check providers.
</P>
<P>
Many companies hire workers who turn out to be poorly suited
for their jobs. This is a driving factor behind a rise in
personality tests at some firms.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that the business in pre-employment
investigations will flourish until former employers pose an
honest cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Paris Bourse Attains Record High, Doped by Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Bourse (stock
exchange) today saw its major market indicator, the CAC-40 index,
to rise by 1.2 percent to pass the line of 2,600 points for the
first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
The euphoria is attributed to optimism of investors over the
the French economy, and resulted from the dropping of long-term
interest rates of French banks and the continuous rising of the
dollar in its exchange rate with the franc, said the daily Le
Monde.
</P>
<P>
The rate of government loans dropped to 5.4 percent this
morning, the lowest since 1965, which is expected to stimulate
investments by enterprises and purchasing of homes by French
families.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said that the long-term banking interest rate in
France has never been so low since the beginning of the century,
which is 1 percent lower than that in the United States, and only
higher than that in Sweden and Japan among developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement made by finance ministers from the Group
of Seven (G-7) countries last week in Berlin to stabilize exchange
rates, the U.S. dollar today kept rising in its exchange rate with
European currencies.
</P>
<P>
The rate between the dollar and the franc this morning was one
against 5.7, and that between the dollar and the Deutsche mark
stood at one against 1.69.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the dollar reflects doubt over the capability of
Germany to reduce its public deficit to 3 percent of its gross
domestic product this year, as required by the Maastricht treaty
for joining the European single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
The British pound also rose to one against 9.35 francs this
morning, the highest since it withdrew from the European Monetary
System in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Japan, France Offer Aid to Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Japan
and France have pledged development aid to southern Africa,
sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by Japanese Ambassador Yoshizo
Konishe and SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mubuende in Namibia's
capital of Windhoek on Monday, Japan contributed about 220,000
U.S. Dollars to the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The Japanese aid, the latest in a series over the past few
years, was reportedly designed to enhance the regional
integration of the southern African countries and to assist in
strengthening human resources development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France has committed a further 28 million U. S.
Dollars in development aid to South Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
This has brought France's total aid to South Africa over one
million U.S. Dollars over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
France has since 1996 provided assistance worth about 244
million U.S. Dollars to several African countries including
Congo, Gabon, Algeria, Burkina-Faso, Cameroun, Cote d'Ivoire,
Guinea, Mauritania, the Central African Republic and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Agitation Will Not Destabilize Government: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina today dismissed the apprehension that opposition
agitation could destabilize her government or create problem.
</P>
<P>
"They might try to create some problem, even break some
vehicles, but won't succeed," she said, adding "people are now
very conscious and they can not be cheated."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party had warned that
they would launch a massive agitation program after the Muslim
Festival of Fast-breaking which fell on February 9, in protest of
the government's oppression of opposition members.
</P>
<P>
The opposition should seriously think before launching any
agitation program, the prime minister told a press conference held
here today, the first of its kind after her just-concluded visit
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina returned home three days ago after finishing her
one-week stay in the U.S., where she attended the world
micro-credit summit and held bilateral talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's position in the international arena was further
elevated with its participation in the micro-credit summit, said
the prime minister, adding that this would remain as a significant
success of her new government.
</P>
<P>
On her talks with the U.S. president, Hasina said that Clinton
has accepted her invitation to visit Bangladesh within the tenure
of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Hasina disclosed at the press conference that she will leave
for New Delhi on February 14 as the chief guest at the
international conference on "men and women - partnership in
politics and development".
</P>
<P>
"I will also hold talks with my Indian counterpart Deve Gowda
on matters of bilateral interests," she added.

<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory work to produce a
comprehensive environmental framework law for Zimbabwe has been
completed, a cabinet minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Environment and Tourism Minister Chen Chimutengwende said the law
would empower his ministry to prescribe certain penalties and fines
to be paid by polluters.
</P>
<P>
He said the framework law would delve into prevention, control and
abatement of environmental pollution by setting standards of the
levels of pollution to be permitted.
</P>
<P>
He said the law would also look into environmental impact
assessments with a view to incorporating them into all the
investments criteria for projects to be undertaken by individuals,
companies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
''The new proposal will look comprehensively into issues related
to water, air, soil, land and humans when dealing with environmental
problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The law would be assessed to ensure it did not undermine the
country's industrial and agro-based development. enditem

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Peacekeeping Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
peacekeeping mission in Angola, scheduled to expire at the end of
February, will be extended for another two months.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by Zimbabwean Defense Minister
Moven Mahachi. Zimbabwe has contributed over 800 troops to the
7,000-strong U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the extension had been given to allow more time
for Angola to form a government of national unity and a unified
military force which have been delayed mainly due to the
differences over power sharing between the government and the
former rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM, made up of peacekeeping troops and military observers,
has been monitoring the peace process in Angola since February
1995 following the 1994 Lusaka Agreement which ended nearly two
decades of civil war between the government and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pound Surges to Its Highest Since 1992 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The pound has been in its
strongest position recently in world money markets since leaving
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on September 16, 1992.
</P>
<P>
It touched a 52-month high against the Deutsche mark Tuesday
when it rose over four pfennings to 2.7462 marks from Monday's
London close of 2.7058 marks, as investors dumped marks amid
mounting concern about the outlook for the German economy.
</P>
<P>
Currency markets are reverberating from the shock news of a
rise in German unemployment in January to 4.66 million, a level
last seen in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors are said to be pouring money into Britain to
take advantage of high yields. The pound's average performance
against a basket of major currencies rose by 1.2 points to a
52-month high of 98.2.
</P>
<P>
The pound is now just three pfennings away from the bottom of
the band in which it traded against the mark during its period of
ERM membership.
</P>
<P>
The failure of Group of Seven finance ministers to come up with
a convincing message after their meeting in Berlin was reportedly
also a factor for the surge of the pound.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded with a statement claiming that the
dollar's "misalignment" was over but gave no hint that governments
would intervene to influence the direction of the currencies.
</P>
<P>
Paul Chertkow of the Union Bank of Switzerland in London said,
"The economic conditions in Europe in juxtaposition to those in
Britain look increasingly unfavorable."
</P>
<P>
"Germany's unemployment position has focused attention on the
relative strength of the UK economy and the benefit of remaining
aloof from the EMU (European Monetary Union) endeavor," Chertkow
added.
</P>
<P>
The contrast between rising unemployment in Europe and
declining unemployment in Britain was highlighted recently in a
speech by Treasury chief secretary William Waldegrave.
</P>
<P>
He said "a dramatic gap" had opened up between America and
Europe in terms of job creation. Britain's approach to labor
markets was much closer to the American than the European model,
he added.

<P>
Financial observers here believe the pound's strength will give
further cause for Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to resist calls
in the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report for a rise in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Howard Davies, deputy governor of the bank, Tuesday hinted that
it would repeat its call for a rise in rates, but played down its
differences with the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"We have been talking about a quarter percent in the
short-term, with perhaps a little more later in the year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Davies said, "Even taking the beneficial effects of
the exchange rate rise into account, we are not entirely persuaded
that on current interest rates we are on track to meet the
government's inflation target of 2.5 percent."

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Demands War Reparations From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today once again demanded war reparations from Iraq,
which fought an eight-year war with Iran from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remarks at a press conference held in the
presidential palace while answering a question on whether Iran
has adopted any measure to receive war reparations from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has suffered 1,000 billion U.S. dollars in losses as a
result of Iraqi aggression on Iran," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. experts have confirmed 103 billion dollars of the
losses. We incurred substantial damage during the oil war (in
the Persian Gulf) which should be compensated. We will try to
receive such reparations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied any shelter for Iraqi agents who staged
aborted assassination against Saddam Hussein's son Uday Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He said at the press conference "We have not yet understood
what assassination attempt against Saddam's son was and who did
it."
</P>
<P>
But he added that "Iran has no role in this issue and we would
never be engaged in terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said "the Iraqi government knows that
we did not do that even during the war. We would not do it
now and in the future."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry had earlier denied any involvement
in an assassination attempt on 32-year-old Uday Hussein, terming
Uday's allegation as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
However, Uday Hussein, the eldest son of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, had accused Iran of the involvement in the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Uday was wounded in a cowardly attack on December 12 evening
while driving his car through the wealthy Al-Mansur district of
Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Iran and Iraq, President Rafsanjani said
"Iran and Iraq have been at war for some time but now there is
no pretext for them to distance themselves from each other."
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Ministry last December ruled out the
possibility of the visit by Iranian First Vice-President Hassan
Habibi to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian first vice president met with Iraqi Vice-President
Taha Mohedin in Rome during the World Food Summit last November.
</P>
<P>
That was the highest level contact between Iran and Iraq in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries agreed and maintained a cease-fire
since August, 1988, there is no real peace between the two
rivals. During the past years, both sides reported the other's
ceasefire violations to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The state of "no war and no peace" maintains in the border
areas almost nine years after the end of the war. The two
countries still keep a large number of their armed forces along
the borders. Both sides criticized the other for lack of trust
and sincerity in talks.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Conclude Deal on Money Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) today have reached agreement on money
each side claims they are owed, according to an Israel Radio
report.
</P>
<P>
The deal, mainly on PNA's debts to Israeli institutions and
arrangements for transferring value-added tax (VAT) to the PNA for
the period of May to December 1994, was closed at an Israeli-PNA
joint economic committee meeting in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor and PNA Economic
Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath opened today's meeting, held
as agreed in the summit meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and PNA President Yasser Arafat Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meridor told Israel Radio that Israel will transfer 55
million shekels (some 16 million US dollars) VAT to the PNA,
in addition to pay some 40 million shekels (some 13 million
US dollars) owed by PNA to Israeli institutions, including the
Bezeq communications company.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said that today's meeting concluded a series of
negotiations that led to the resolution of all the problems
regarding past claims by Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was "a goodwill" on both sides
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Following today's meeting, Shaath called the deal " an
additional step forward" in relations between the PNA and the
Israeli government, after Tuesday's release of Palestinian women
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the two sides will continue to
work together to achieve peace, which, in his words, "we
have given our lives to succeed in implementing it."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinians delegations are due to
resume talks next Sunday on further implementing the Interim
Agreement to expand Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Issues on the agenda include constructions of Palestinian sea
and air port in the Gaza Strip, and safe-passage for the
Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Denies Syria's Bid for S. Africa Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Syria has not made any
bid for buying South Africa-made tank sighting control systems,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at the National Assembly in Cape Town, Mbeki
said the cabinet was considering a request by Denel, a major
corporation specializing in South Africa's arms export, to
negotiate with Syria over the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki pointed out that the South African government pursued a
Middle East policy which recognized all the countries in the
region, stressing no country in the region should be
discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a United States allegation that Syria is a
terrorist country, Mbeki said South Africa, like the vast
majority of countries, had never regarded Syria as a terrorist
nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that having normal relations with Syria would not
harm the interests of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said the cabinet had
conditionally agreed last December to sell 638 million U.S.
Dollars worth of South Africa-made tank firing control systems to
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Distribute 16,000 Tons of Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The National Seed
Industry Agency of Ethiopia announced here today that it would
distribute 16,000 tons of select seed to farmers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Gurmu Dabi, General Manager of the agency said the bulk of the
seeds will be wheat and maize, adding that the move was aimed at
fostering agricultural development in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the demand for select seed this year stands
at over 20,000 tons, which are more than the supply for the 1997/98
production year.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government should launch seed multiplication
schemes to meet farmers' ever growing demand for select seed,
said Dabi.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the National Fertilizer Industry Agency of Ethiopia
said it would supply 320,000 tons of fertilizers to farmers
throughout the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian farmers will start agricultural activities
during the small raining season beginning from February to May
this year. However, the major production season will start from
June when the big raining season begins.
</P>
<P>
The country reaped a bumper harvest in 1996 with the total
output of 11.7 million tons, two million tons more than that of
the previous year.

<HEADLINE> UN Recommends in Detail for Election in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has released
details of its recommendations for establishing a credible electoral
framework for Liberia, one week after Secretary-General Kofi Annan
made a report on the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are made following a request from Liberia's
ruling Council of State for UN assistance in formulating the framework
ahead of elections scheduled in May, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
For the presidential election, the UN recommended that a run-off
election be held between the two presidential candidates with the
highest votes if no candidate obtains more than 50 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
On the assembly election, according to the official news agency, the UN
recommended that the bi-cameral system provided for in Liberia's 1986
Constitution be retained, and that the House of Representatives be
established with 84 members, and the senate with 26 members.
</P>
<P>
The UN also suggested revising the procedure for the appointment of
electoral commissioners to establish a "clear and strict" criteria for
their nominations and the establishment of an autonomous arbitration
panel to resolve electoral disputes.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the electorates, the UN recommended a single
country-wide electoral constituency in view of the massive movements
of the population, caused by the Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
It suggested the deferment of any decision on whether refugees
would be allowed to vote so as to resolve "strong reservations"
expressed by many groups in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
On the organizational framework, it called for the relaxation of
the legal requirements for establishing political parties, residency
requirements for candidates and voting age requirements, as well as
measures to protect secrecy of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Other recommendations include the scheduling of a pledging
conference to raise funds for the process and reinforcing the
electoral law to enhance public security and protect candidates.
</P>
<P>
In his report on Liberia a week ago, the UN secretary-general said
that the recommendations were developed to make the country's
elections as inclusive, operationally-simple and cost-effective as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations, which have been sent to the Security Council,
the Economic Community of West African Countries (ECOWAS) and
Liberia's Council of State, take into account the conclusions of a UN
technical survey team, which visited the war-torn country in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
The elections will conclude the implementation of the revised
timetable for the Abuja Agreement, the peace accord designed to end
the seven years of war in Liberia and signed by factional leaders of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The war, which started in 1989, has claimed the lives of more than
150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Currently, military observers from the UN and the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force are jointly monitoring the implementation of
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Modifies Conditions for UPU's Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal council
(government) has approved a plan to modify the conditions for the
Universal Postal Union (UPU) to repay its loan to Switzerland,
according to a press release today by the federal council.
</P>
<P>
Under a treaty in 1967, the UPU borrowed 18.2 million francs
(about 13 million U.S. dollars) with an interest rate of 3 percent
for a period of 40 years. After the modification, the UPU can
enjoy the benefits in favor of international organizations based
in Geneva under new conditions for repayment adopted by the Swiss
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the UPU's reimbursement will be extended from 2010
to 2020 and will pay 2.8 million francs (2 million U.S. dollars)
less after the abolition of the interest.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai: Maintaining Security Zone Remains Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai stressed today that maintaining the "security
zone" in south Lebanon is still the best answer to defending
Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (Parliament) plenum, Mordechai lashed
out at a group of coalition and opposition lawmakers who
convened a meeting last Saturday to discuss unilateral
withdrawal from the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The group of Knesset Members (MKs), led by Likud faction
leader Michael Eitan and Labor's Yossi Beilin, held the meeting
in the wake of the recent air disaster in which two Israeli military
helicopters transporting soldiers to south Lebanon collided and
killed all 73 on board.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, visibly angry, strongly criticized the group of
MKs for cynically exploiting the air disaster to grab
headlines. He said the suggestion of unilateral withdrawal from
south Lebanon hurt the Israeli soldiers there more than the
bullets of the Hezbollah, or Party of God of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that he and the defense establishment
did not need to be preached to on the security matters, for they
were "working day and night on how to defend Israel's northern
border."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that, after studying all the options,
maintaining the security zone remained the best solution to
protecting safety of civilians living in the north.
</P>
<P>
However, the group of MKs were not impressed by Mordechai's
criticism, insisting that they would continue discussing
unilateral pullout. They held another meeting at the Likud
caucus room to counter Mordechai's charges.
</P>
<P>
Eitan said that the current situation was unacceptable and
the army should provide other alternatives. Gideon Ezra, the
Likud MK who initialed the first meeting, said the army
operations in south Lebanon lacked imagination.
</P>
<P>
"I hope each one of us, who is in charge of policy in Israel,
will take into consideration that we have to change, to change to
a lot of directions," Ezra said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Mordechai's remarks, Beilin said he was not
surprised by his charges. "I think we should initial some new
ideas ... to suggest something better than what we have right
now in south Lebanon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, a former Labor government minister, added that while
sealing peace with Syria remained the best solution to the
Lebanon issue, the option of unilateral withdrawal should also
be considered after some arrangements were made. He is proposing
deployment of European and U.S. peace-keeping troops to pave way
for Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied a 15-kilometer strip of land in south
Lebanon since 1985 under excuse of preventing Katyusha rocket
attacks at its northern border. The Hezbollah guerrilla forces
have been fighting Israeli occupation in the zone since then and
are continuing inflicting loss of lives of Israeli soldiers.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Rate Falls to 6.5 Pct in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell by
67,800 in January to 1.82 million, the lowest level for six years,
according to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) today.
</P>
<P>
This took the jobless rate down to 6.5 percent last month from
6.7 percent in December when the jobless total fell by 46,700 to
stand at 1.88 million.
</P>
<P>
The fall was much bigger than economists' forecast of a drop of
30,000, and gave the Conservative government a boost before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard welcomed
the figures, saying that the drop in unemployment was a reward for
changes made to the way Britain's labor market operates since the
Conservatives came to power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
However, Labor employment spokesman David Blunkett said the
total "hid the extent of divisions in British society."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) said the real jobless
total was "2 million greater" than the 1.82 million claimed by the
government and any "self congratulation" was premature.
</P>
<P>
"Government unemployment claims represent only the tip of the
iceberg of Britain's real jobs problem," said TUC General
Secretary John Monks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Arm Shipment to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today denied that the Sudanese government has been
receiving arms from Iran in its bid to crush opposition rebellion
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said at a press conference that "This propaganda
ballyhoo on establishing air link between Iran and Sudan is a
lie."
</P>
<P>
"Tehran has never sent any military assistance to Sudan," he
asserted at the conference attended by some 70 local and
foreign reporters in the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, "the ties between Iran and Sudan are
very close. There is no question about it."
</P>
<P>
But he denied a military bridge between them, adding "If needed
and we are asked, we might agree to sell them arms. We helped
them with food and oil in the past."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the recent events in Pakistan and Turkey have left a
dent in the relations with Islamabad and Ankara, Rafsanjani said
that the recent Shiite-Sunni skirmishes in Pakistan as well as
the conflict between Islamists and the secularists in Turkey
have not affected the two countries' relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Iran's relations with Arab countries, he
considered as "unsuitable existence of distances" between these
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that such distances stemmed from
U.S. pressures.
</P>
<P>
"I invite all the heads of Arab countries to come to Iran and
I assure them that direct talks with Iran will produce positive
results," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Tehran-Damascus ties, he said, relations between
Iran and Syria have always been "cordial and serious."

bilateral issues, and if there happen to be any problem, it
would be removed in the course of the meetings.

<HEADLINE> UK Construction Orders Rise 8 Pct in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Total new construction orders
in Britain rose by 8 percent in the final quarter of 1996, largely
in housing, private commercial and infrastructure orders, official
figures showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of the Environment said that the growth was
mainly driven by the private sector, where new orders were up by
33 percent on the previous quarter and by 43 percent on the final
quarter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The growth came despite a sharp fall in orders from the public
sector which fell 26 percent compared with the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, construction orders fell by 2 percent compared with
the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomed the figures, saying it was a sign of
sustained recovery in the building industry.
</P>
<P>
The figures coincided with the publication of the latest
business trends survey by the Building Employers' Confederation.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on replies from 600 members, showed that
construction companies were improving margins as the recovery in
the industry gathers momentum, and that output increased by 0.6
percent in the fourth quarter, the third consecutive quarter of
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, employment rose by 20,000 in the quarter, and a
further increase is in prospect in the first three months of this
year, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures 6 in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Five soldiers and a
motor-cyclist were injured in an explosion that rocked an army
bus in Lagos earlier this morning, the Nigerian Television
Authority reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the explosion occurred at about 7 a.m. in the
morning on the Ikorodu Road in the Ikeja area, when the Mercedes
army bus was conveying soldiers to their Apapa office.
</P>
<P>
The bus has been identified as belonging to the Directorate of
Finance and Administration of the Nigerian Army with a capacity
for 26 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Today's explosion is the latest of the series of bomb blasts
that hit the commercial center of Nigeria since the last quarter
of 1996, all aimed at the military force now ruling the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian police authority has accused the opposition
National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) of plotting the bombings,
but the NADECO has denied of any involvement.
</P>
<P>
Head of state General Sani Abacha has also accused the NADECO
of sabotaging democracy in the disguise of democracy and has held
it responsible for the delay of the local government elections on
party basis under the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Today's explosion also cast a shadow over the on-going voters'
registration, which started on Monday and is generally regarded
as a crucial step on the way to peace and democracy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
No arrests has been made after today's explosion, but the
report said the police is now in top gear to investigate into the
accident.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Israel Not Serious in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Queria, Speaker of the
Palestinian Council said Israel does not seem serious in honoring
its commitments to the Palestinians and the international
community with regard to establishing peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview, published here today, in
his Ramalla office with Tunisian daily Al Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was not satisfied with the summit meeting
between Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last Sunday at the Erez
checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit has merely formed eight joint committees. No
agreement has been reached. In fact, he added, the formation of
the committees may meant to water down the urgent demands of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, he went on to say, could have provided clear terms
and a specific timetable for the resolution of outstanding issues
such as the repatriation of refugees, passages, the harbor and
the airport, as well as the ending of settlements and Judaization
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that "Netanyahu is merely trying to gain time and
to publicize his meetings with President Arafat until he embarks
today on a tour of several American and European cities with an
image of having met with President Arafat or having agreed to
the so-called Hebron accord."
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Queria affirmed that "we want clear and specific
timetable to which Israel will be committed. There is no time to
waste in committee meetings that are not tied to a
timetable."
</P>
<P>
"Dangers are rampant, and Jerusalem is regularly being
Judaized, and the Aqsa Mosque is facing the threat of
collapse. Unless absolute priority is given to immediate cessation
of settlement and Judaization of Jerusalem, the whole peace
process will be in peril," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Against British FM's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus acting President
Spyros Kyprianou today asked the country's High Commissioner in
London Vanias Markides to make presentations about recent
statements on Cyprus by British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC Radio 4, aired Tuesday night,
Rifkind said there has been a "lack of real political will on
both sides" in Cyprus to reach a settlement, and he saw a
"serious possibility" of conflict between Greece and Turkey over
the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The acting president discussed the whole matter today with
the island's acting Foreign Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou, who is also Finance Minister, and Undersecretary
to President Glafcos Clerides Pantelis Kouros.
</P>
<P>
He told Cyprus News Agency that "it is unacceptable to put
Greece and Turkey on an equal footing."
</P>
<P>
"Rifkind's statement is an unacceptable tactic to create
tension and a method to exert pressure on Cyprus and Greece,"
said Kyprianou, who is also President of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, who is paying an official
visit to India, rejected Rifkind's claim that both sides were to
blame for the Cyprus impasse.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Secretary-General said in a report that
there has been no progress in the Cyprus problem due to the lack
of political will on the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said that the second reason the U.N. chief
gave "is that his good offices could not produce a solution when
one side, the Turkish side, flaunts international opinion as
expressed in U.N. Security Council resolutions".
</P>
<P>
Rifkind visited Cyprus last December.
</P>
<P>
Britain was one of the three guarantors of Cyprus' independence
under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
The island was divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and seized
the northern third of the island following a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Seeks Review of World Bank Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Finance Minister Kwame
Peprah has called for a review of the World Bank-assisted
programs in the country because they are becoming difficult to
implement.
</P>
<P>
"Our present political system, which is guided by the
constitution, is beginning to influence the country's ability to
carry out the desired adjustment required by the bank's
programs," the minister said, quoted by a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's portfolio with the World Bank was 3.3 billion U.S.
Dollars as of June last year. It consists of 39 projects and
programs with an undisbursed balance of one billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Our problem now is to build a consensus among the opposition,
labor and the civil society in implementing the projects," Peprah
told visiting World Bank President James Wolfensohn in Accra,
capital of Ghana on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These realities need to be considered seriously, he said,
adding that Wolfensohn's visit might enable the government and
the bank to review Ghana's performance and then take action.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, price distortions, high inflation,
poverty and unemployment have persisted despite 14 years of
economic structural adjustment sponsored by the bank.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic performance in 1996, he said
although the government failed to achieve its target, inflation
was reduced from 70 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to further reduce it to 15 percent by the end of the
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn arrived in Accra from Senegal on Monday on his
second-leg of a nine-day African tour which will also take him to
Mozambique and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank boss described Ghana as a "leader" in Africa
because of the extent to which it had gone in taking "difficult
economic steps" to improve its economy. enditem

Ikimi today reiterated the end-of-1997 deadline for foreign

Nigeria moved its capital from Lagos on the southwest coast to

only senior officials of each federal ministry have moved to the
new capital to date, due to the shortage of offices there and the

<HEADLINE> Moi Calls for Neutral Buffer Force for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today called for a neutral buffer force for eastern Zaire to
separate it from neighboring countries, according to a Kenya
Television Network report today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader appealed to the United Nations, the United
States and the European Union to provide a neutral buffer force
to reduce the senseless bloodshed in the Great Lakes region and
pave the way for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Moi, chairman of a group of African heads of state
entrusted by the December 16 Nairobi Summit, called for an
immediate stop by countries fuelling the armed conflicts in
eastern Zaire on February 7.
</P>
<P>
He did not name the countries which, Moi said, are directly
involved in the armed conflict or supplying weapons to the rebel
army in east Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa has repeatedly accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of
sending troops into Zaire to fight alongside the rebel army which
has seized control of a swathe of eastern Zaire since last
October.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that continued fuelling of the conflict would
definitely lead to a bloodshed, destabilization of Zaire and the
entire region.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Arab Countries Achieve Tangible Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Arab countries rose by 5.89 percent from 499.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1994 to 528.7 billion dollars in 1995, thanks to
booming oil prices and economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
An economic report by the Egyptian MENA news agency ascribed
the Arab economic growth to an increase in oil prices on world
markets and the good results from the economic reform programs of
some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which is bent on the economic reform program carried out
over the past 15 years, has realized a growth rate of about 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Successful efforts made by oil exporting countries to diversify
their production base and reduce their dependence on the oil
sector also contributed to the effect, said the report based on a
unified Arab Economic report issued by a number of Arab economic
organizations, and notably the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Investment expenditure in Arab countries rose at the rate of
6.3 percent and reached about 117 billion dollars, representing
22.1 percent of the Arab GDP.
</P>
<P>
In oil-producing Arab countries, investment expenditure reached
about 81 billion dollars, taking up 69 percent of the total
investment expenditures of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries exported goods and services valued at 180.6
billion dollars in 1995, an increase of 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Arab oil-producing countries were valued at about
128.5 billion dollars, representing 71 percent of total Arab
exports in 1995, compared to 33 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise in Arab exports to economic
reform realized by several Arab countries through liberalizing
external trade and transforming a public-dominated sector to a one
in which the private sector plays a basic role.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports registered an increase of 11 percent and
reached about 179 billion dollars, 34 percent of Arab GDP, in
1995 compared to 160 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita share of Arab GDP was about 2091 dollars
in 1995, according to the unified Arab economic report.
</P>
<P>
The total population in the Arab world was 253 million in 1995,
an increase of 6.3 million over 1994. The report expected this
figure to rise to 290 million in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
As regards the labor force in Arab countries, the report said
there were 76 million workers in 1995 (an increase of 9 million
compared to 1991) and expected this figure to rise to 90 million
in the year 2000 and 105 million in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The labor force in the agricultural sector is on the decrease
after taking a 50 percent dip during 1990-1993. It is expected to
continue to decrease owing to the use of mechanization in
agriculture and emigration from the countryside to cities.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of Arab labor was in the services
sector. The industrial sector came third after the services and
agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The report expected a drop in these sectors in a number of Arab
countries as a result of economic reform programs.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Trade Unions Urged to End National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of
Swaziland Employers (FSE) has called on the Swaziland Federation
of Trade Unions (SFTU) to end immediately a two-week national
strike and resume negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Swazi government and the SFTU address the
situation, the worsening of the economic and social fabric will
assume irreversible proportions, the Southern African
Broadcasting Associations (SABA) quoted a SFE statement as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
Gideon Mahlalela, deputy chairman of the Employers Association
said the SFTU should call off the national strike and dissociate
itself from what he described as "sabotage".
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland government should on its part withdraw legal
Notice Number 9 of 1997, which bans strikes, Mahlalela added.
</P>
<P>
The national strike gripping Swaziland, sponsored by the SFTU
has been demanding for improved working conditions and
introduction of political reforms in the kingdom of Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Mangaliso Dlamini, chairman of Swaziland's Constitutional
Review Commission (SCRC) said earlier his commission is to hold a
week-long seminar to discuss the 1968 Independence Consititution
and the 1973 decree by King Mswati III which bans political
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The SCRC has been set up by King Mswati to gather people's
views on whether to continue with the monarchy or introudce
democratic reforms, including unbanning political parties.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only country in the 12-member Southern
African Development Community which is resisting introducing
political reforms.

Dollars, the Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported today.

He said the economic growth rate, previously estimated to
increase by 4.7 percent, is expected to grow by seven percent.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Doubts Israel's Willingness to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
doubted here today Israel's willingness to resume peace talks with
Lebanon and Syria, noting the Jewish state is not ready to respond
to the two Arab countries' positions.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made the statement just several hours before Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu starts a meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Presidential Palance with Milhem Karam,
chairman of the Lebanese Journalists Association, the president
accused the Jewish state of unwilling to restart the peace process
from where it had been suspended, as demanded by Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"What has delayed the peace process is an unreadiness of the
Israelis to resume dialog and talks with Syria from where they
stopped in the last round of peace negotiations," the president
was quoted by Karam as saying.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel were suspended in
February, 1996, amid a wave of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, after taking power last June, said he was not
obliged by any unwritten commitment, and called for a resumption
of peace talks with Syria "without preconditions."
</P>
<P>
Hrawi pointed out that the Israeli government failed to put
forward any "clear suggestions" before Netanyahu's visit to
Washington, and said that he preferred to "wait and see" the
outcomes of the visit.
</P>
<P>
The president also condemned repeated Israeli air strikes at
targets in eastern and south Lebanon in the past few days, noting
they were "not only for warning, but also an operation of revenge
in the depth."
</P>
<P>
In an air raid at a radio station of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, near the Shiite Muslim stronghold of
Baalbek city in the Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon Tuesday,
Israeli jet fighters wounded a shepherd.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Processing Trade Enjoys Smooth Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The processing trade in the
Chinese capital has reported a smooth, healthy development in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
According to the local customs, in 1996, import and export
volume of Beijing's processing trade totalled 1.67 billion US
dollars, an increase of eight percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among this, 988 million dollars were for export, a rise of ten
percent, and 678 million dollars for import, an increase of six
percent.
</P>
<P>
And some 9,800 contracts were registered for processing trade
at the customs, involving a record contracted 11.135 billion yuan
(1.34 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that in 1996, the value of processing trade export
overtook that of imports by 310 million US dollars, or a rise of
two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
And the processing trade for local foreign-funded and
cooperative enterprises and joint ventures was 1.28 billion US
dollars last year, accounting for 77 percent of the municipality's
total processing trade, while the state-owned enterprises had
dropped to 336 million US dollars for the trade.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of machinery and electronics products, including
medical apparatuses and instruments, building materials, chemical
industry and telecommunications, has risen, involving 750 million
US dollars, or 45 percent of the total imports and exports of the
total processing trade.
</P>
<P>
To date, the imports and exports of local processing trade made
up approximately 30 percent of Beijing's total import and export
trade volume. But it is still below the country's average level
and far below that of the coastal cities.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Reports Good Year in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Successful innovations, rapid
economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region and a well-functioning
restructuring program have led to "a record year" for Siemens AG
in fiscal 1996, the company's president announced today.
</P>
<P>
Clearly exceeding estimates at the beginning of the year,
Siemens' orders surged 10 percent to 100.8 billion German marks
(60 billion U.S. dollars) and sales rose six percent to 94.2
billion marks (56 billion dollars) in fiscal 1996, which ended on
September 30, 1996. Heinrich Pierer, Siemens president and CEO,
announced the results at its annual shareholders' meeting in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Net income for the largest German electrical engineering and
electronics group also jumped 20 percent, to approximately 2.5
billion marks (1.49 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Behind these solid results, there were regional
discrepencies. The company's communications, components and
information segments profited most from growth in Central and
Eastern Europe, in the Americas and above all, in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Orders in Germany stagnated, but rose 17 percent abroad.
International business for Siemens now accounts for 62 percent of
the total, Pierer said.
</P>
<P>
Although net income in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 dipped
five percent, Pierer remains confident: "In the past three years
we continually improved our performance. We will reach last year's
high level of 2.5 billion marks again this year. And next year, we
anticipate a fresh increase."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- German flag carrier Lufthansa AG
today denied reports that nine major airlines plan to form a
global alliance as a response to the proposed link between British
Airways and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The German DPA news agency quoted Lufthansa spokesman Gerd
Leidinger as saying that Lufthansa had no plans in the near future
to form alliance with other airlines.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman did not rule out the possibility that
mutual stakes in like-minded companies could be acquired at some
time in the future. He said talks had opened with various airlines
on forging new partnerships, but "at present nothing can be
confirmed".
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted an Air Canada official in London as
saying that a new alliance was in the making as part of a
realignment aimed to improving efficiency and increasing yields
through closer coordination.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources reportedly said that the alliance, possibly to
be launched in mid-May, was masterminded to counter the potential
dominance of the proposed BA-American alliance.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Bank Dissipated Compensation Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 13 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 Ukrainian elderly
people employed as slave labor in German factories and labor camps
during World War Two have waited for months in vain for
compensation already paid by the German government.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million marks (62 million dollars) of the
compensation was dissipated by Gradobank, a troubled Ukrainian
bank placed under direct supervision of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 100,000 former laborers, or Ostarbeiter, waiting
for cash already been promised, another 70,000 potential
applicants have been left out in the cold. They are being denied
sums ranging from 400 to 1,000 marks at a time when the average
monthly pension is at around 25 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1993, 400 million marks intended for the former
Ostarbeiters were transferred by Germany to the Gradobank account
of a Ukrainian government fund "For Understanding and
Reconciliation", said Raisa Budko, spokeswoman of the fund. She
said 460,000 out of the 560,000 compensation receivers had got 280
million marks.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people from all over Ukraine, who have converged in
front of the fund's offices, are told by fund employees that
Gradobank is unable to fulfill its obligations in paying out the
rest of the money due to its financial insolvency.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has ordered the National Bank
of Ukraine (NBU) to resolve the problem of Gradobank and make sure
the payments are made by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the NBU, Dmitro Ritberg, said the central bank
was ready to fulfill Ukraine's commitment to the German government
to pay out the entire 400 million marks to former
Ostarbeiters. The payments would be made through other Ukrainian
banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, officials for the Understanding and Reconciliation
Fund and the NBU could not say what sanctions would be imposed on
Gradobank for failing to make the payments.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A non-clergy Iranian has
officially declared his candidacy for the seventh presidential
election scheduled for June, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Seyyed Reza Zavareh'ie, who is heading Iran's Organization of
Register of Deeds, is the first non-clergy to enter the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Persian daily Jumhuri Islami, he said
"I feel I have a responsibility to the people, to Islam and to
the revolution that I should enter the race."
</P>
<P>
Zavareh'ie is among the legal scholars of the Guardians
Council and serves as the deputy to Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi.
</P>
<P>
He will have to contend against well-known, better-supported
clergy candidates such as Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-
Nouri, former guidance minister Seyyed Mohammad Khatami and former
information minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri.
</P>
<P>
He said that his platform would be anti-liberal. "Our
history shows that the proponents of liberalism and freedom have
not been honest in practice and have not believed in the
very things that they were saying."

<HEADLINE> Major Slams IRA, Vows to Track Down Soldier's Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today slammed the Irish Republican Army (IRA) for the
killing of a British soldier and vowed to track down the suspected
IRA sniper.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old soldier was shot dead Wednesday night at a
checkpoint in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no hiding place for the culprits, none at all,"
said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the "hypocrisy" of the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, referring to a statement of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the shooting was a "tragic event which re-emphasizes
the need for all of us to redouble our efforts to rebuild the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Major has refused to talk to Sinn Fein or invite it to peace
talks until the IRA comes to a permanent halt to its 28-year-old
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
But he promised that he would not be "deflected" from the real
search for a lasting settlement and peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was also condemned by Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Patrick Mayhew as "a coward's attack which pointed up
the cynical contrast between the words of peace and the crimes of
murder."
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton described the killing as "an
outrage", and said: "The IRA campaign is anti-Irish and contrary
to the interests of all in Ireland."
</P>
<P>
The shooting came after ministers were warned that the IRA
might be planning to assassinate a leading political figure in the
run-up to the general election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the timing shows that the IRA is keen to do
something "spectacular" to let the new British government know
that it remains a force to be reckoned with, and must be invited
to negotiations without conditions.
</P>
<P>
Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist Party security spokesman,
said: "It was an act carried out by the IRA specifically designed
to provoke loyalist retaliation."
</P>
<P>
Loyalist guerrillas killed hundreds of members of the Catholic
community, from which the IRA draws support, in retaliation
against attacks by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party's shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Marjorie
Mowlam, said: "This is a sad, sad day in the efforts to bring
peace to Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
"I plead with the loyalist paramilitaries not to plunge the
people of Northern Ireland into a downward spiral of violence."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Banks Lead Asia in Disclosure Policy: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong banks have the
highest standards of disclosure in Asia, according to a survey
conducted recently by a global investment bank.
</P>
<P>
In its 20-page report, ING Baring surveys the disclose
requirements, regulatory policies and government support for banks
in eight Asian markets -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, the
Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Judging from disclosure standards, Hong Kong has risen from the
bottom four years ago to the top rank this time, thanks to the
joined efforts by investors, accountants and community leaders.
The report says that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which plays
the role of the central bank in Hong Kong, has done a lot to
improve the regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Banking Ordinance requires the publication of the
most detailed balance sheets, profit and loss accounts and cash
flow statements in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The survey ranked Singapore as the top player in terms of
overall regulatory policies, credit risk policies and capital
requirements.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Develop Face-Recognizing Computer System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A computer system that can
recognize a human face in less than a second could soon be
protecting welfare and security systems from fraud, an American
scientist told a conference that ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The system, called Photobook, takes a snapshot of a face and
sorts the principal components -- variations in facial shape and
configuration of features -- according to a mathematical
algorithm. It then compares those components to a "rogues'
gallery" of 100,000 photographs in its database, and comes up with
the most similar match.
</P>
<P>
The new system could help prevent fraud in welfare and security
systems, Professor Alex Pentland, of the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Pentland said Photobook could prevent people who were banned or
did not qualify for a driver's licence or welfare benefits from
applying again under false names. It could also have home security
applications. A front door could be programmed to open
automatically to certain people, depending on the faces that
Photobook recognized as "safe."
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to have computers that react to you like a person
does," Pentland told the conference entitled "Computers that can
see you."
</P>
<P>
Photobook, whose development has been underway for six years,
can also recognize facial expressions. For one with a poor memory
for names, Pentland envisages a camera system worn like a piece of
jewelry which whispers a name in the wearer's ear when it
recognizes the face of a person confronting the wearer.

HEFEI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 14,000 hectare of trees
have been planted in east China's Anhui province so far this year,
an increase of 13 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Leading official of the Provincial Party Committee and
government took the lead, and they personnally went to plant trees
at the sites they have been assigned. And the officials of the
provincial government have, since mid January, plunged themselves
into the endeavor to green the province in eight years, and called
on officials and the masses of people to pool efforts.
</P>
<P>
Funds have also been donated for the purchase of tree
saplings. Local sources noted that Fengyang County alone has
already raised 780,000 yuan (94,000 US dollars) for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan mapped out by Provincial Party Secretary Lu
Rongjing on behalf of the people in his province in 1989, bear and
denuded mountains and hills in the province would dispear in five
years, and the whole of Anhui would turned green in eight years.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, some 533,000 ha of hills in the province had been
donned with trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, sources added that to date, 15 prefectures and cities
in the province have completed their tree-planting task for this
Spring.

<HEADLINE> EU Seeks Final Push on WTO Telecoms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
urged all World Trade Organization (WTO) countries to make one
final effort to ensure the achievement of a world deal on opening
up basic telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
"With two days to go before the deadline, all countries must go
that extra mile in order to make the negotiations a success,"
European Union (EU) Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan. He was about
to leave for Geneva Friday morning to help shape the EU's final
position at a meeting of European trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
According to Sir Leon, the 15-member bloc and several other
countries improved their offers this week to put the deal within
reach in the WTO talks, which are due to finish on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the talks, which failed last April, could
end fruitlessly once again, even when WTO members were on the
verge of success.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to see that the talks succeed," Sir Leon
said. He believed the EU took the lead in pushing for a deal last
year and it had been pushing hard for the aim since.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that, on the basis of what had been offered
so far, no country could conceivably find justification to dilute
its offer or withdraw most favored nation (MFN) rights.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a deal this weekend would boost sales of
telecommunications services worldwide, which would be particularly
beneficial to developing countries and enable them to build
modern nationwide communications networks.

<HEADLINE> Three Saboteurs Killed in West Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Three men were killed in recent
clashes with Iranian security forces in Sanandaj, capital of
western Kurdestan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry's office in Kurdestan said today that
the three men were involved in the bombings in Tehran and aborted
bombing in religious city of Qom, 160 kilometers south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
It said that one of the men had spied for Iraqis during the
Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) and had informed in advance of an
important Iranian offensive Beit-ul-Muqqadas-2 Operation which was
launched in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian security forces have recently stepped up control
and check on the occasion of the 18th anniversary of Islamic
Revolution and plans to launch the 7th presidential elections in
June.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iranian security forces killed at least 10
outlawed members in west Iran. Most of them belonged to the
Iraqi-based armed opposition group People's Mojahedin of Iran
(PMOI). They were chased and killed by regional tribal forces
while trying to cross the border line between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMOI staged a series of bombing across the country
during the fourth parliamentary elections. Tehran government
reacted by staging an air raid on PMOI base inside the Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
The PMOI is led by Mass'oud Rajavi who now lives in Iraq. There
are about 20,000 anti-Iranian government forces in Iraq.

Immigrants
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is facing
problems in deporting illegal immigrants to Myanmar and
Bangladesh, Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said
today.
</P>
<P>
The country is facing problems in sending 8,000 illegal
immigrants back to Myanmar because that country does not regard
them as its citizens, he told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur is also facing problems in sending back 5,000
Bangladeshi illegal immigrants as the Bangladeshi government has
so far not shown any serious commitment in the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the current position of the illegal immigrants from
Myanmar appears to be that of stateless people and as long as
Myanmar refuses to recognize them as citizens it will be difficult
to deport them.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is also unable to seek the assistance of the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees as the 8,000
immigrants are not considered as refugees because no war has been
declared in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
On illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, he said his government
would hold more meetings with the Bangladeshi authorities to find
an effective way of sending back the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is facing a serious problem of illegal immigrants
whose number is estimated to be about one million.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would study the approach taken by Saudi
Arabia which had successfully deported 300,000 foreigners who
worked in that country without permits.

<HEADLINE> Iran Keen on Enhancing ties with Gulf Neighbors: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Ambassador to
Kuwait Goulam Ali Sannati has said that his country was keen on
enhancing cooperation with its Arab Gulf neighbors in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian envoy made the remarks in an exclusive interview
with the Arabic newspaper Al-Qabas, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran wants to develop relations with other
countries, especially peaceful ties with states of the region.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came amid U.S. warnings that Iran's recent
purchase of advanced Russian missile technology would pose
serious threat to the Gulf Arab countries, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Washington recently said that intelligence reports indicated
that Russia recently transferred to Iran technology for the
Russian SS-4 missile, which has a range almost three times
greater than that of any missile now in Iran's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said the warning was issued in Washington
during the talks last week between U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore
and visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Russia
reportedly denied that Moscow had authorized transfer of the
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
To dispel concern that Iran's forthcoming presidential
election would change its Gulf policy, the ambassador said
that "changing an official in the country would not change
the state's policy."
</P>
<P>
He said those who have decided to run for the presidency want
to develop relations with other countries, particularly peaceful
ties with states of the region.
</P>
<P>
The senior Iranian diplomat said exchanging visits between
Kuwait and Iranian officials reflect the strong relations linking
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Complete Solution to HK Vietnamese Boat People Problem Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
asked the British government to completely solve the problem of
Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong before China resumes the
exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang made this announcement
here today when asked to comment on the fact that the Hong Kong
High Court granted Habeas Corpus status to 11 people in four
families of Vietnamese boat people on February 5 this year. The 11
are among 4,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong who appealed
to the court for release last November.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government expressed regret over this serious
matter, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
When the Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong made the appeal
last year the Chinese government explicitly expressed its position
on this issue, Tang said. However, ignoring China's stand and the
interests of the Hong Kong residents, the British side did not
take practical and effective measures to solve the problem, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tang cited the problem of the Vietnamese boat people and
refugees in Hong Kong as the result of the British government's
erroneous policy of making Hong Kong a first shelter harbor for
refugees, saying that the British government shoulders the
unshirkable responsibility for the solving of the problem at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong are all
illegal immigrants, and they should be repatriated to the country
where they came from. But the British side, in disregard of
international conventions, has released boat people for many times
on various excuses, Tang said, adding that the practice has sent a
wrong signal to boat people and blocked smooth repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The presence of boat people in Hong Kong society, he added,
will not only add the burden to Hong Kong but also result in some
other social problems.
</P>
<P>
"So the Chinese government strongly urges the British side, for
the sake of the long-term prosperity of Hong Kong and the
immediate interests of the several million Hong Kong people, to
make sure that such an event never occur again and to solve the
problem wholly and completely before China resumes the exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997," Tang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony marking the
reopening of the former residence of Du Fu, a celebrated poet of
the Tang Dynasty (618-907), was held today in this capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Du Fu fled to Chengdu in 759 to escape civil strife. He built a
cottage in the western suburbs and lived there for three years.
</P>
<P>
He wrote some 240 epoch-making poems during this time.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's instructions to
protect the cottage, the Chengdu municipal government allocated
some 1.2 million yuan (about 145,000 US dollars) to refurnish the
building, which covers an area of 10,000 sq m.

<HEADLINE> India Willing to Dialogue with Pakistan: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda said today that India would respond constructively if the
new Pakistan government showed a positive approach to the
resumption of stalled bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Gowda made the remarks after Pakistan's prime
minister-designate Nawaz Sharif recently offered dialogue to usher
in a new era in Indo-Pakistan relations.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sharif's initial views have been favorable and I hope that
the new government in Pakistan will show a positive approach in
this regard," Gowda said while addressing troops deployed near the
line of control in the India-held Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had been at war for three times in the past
and both sides claim the Kashmir territory. They have tried to
solve their disputes over the Kashmir issue through talks, but
failed. The last round of foreign secretary level talks between
the two countries was held in January 1994 and since then their
talks have been stalled.
</P>
<P>
Gowda said that immediately after taking over as prime minister
last year, he had renewed India's offer of bilateral talks with
Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Life on Ocean Floor Records Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Animals living on the ocean
floor may be just as susceptible to climate change as
surface-dwellers, the science journal, Nature, reports.
</P>
<P>
Researchers came to this conclusion after studying the fossil
record of ostracods, minute clam-like crustaceans in deep-sea
sediment at the bottom of the North Atlantic, dating from the Late
Pliocene era more than 2.4 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Most scientists believed the ocean floor was buffered against
climate change by the water above it, but the journal's report
today questions this deep sea environmental stability.
</P>
<P>
The diversity of deep sea animals seems to wax and wane over a
41,000-year cycle, says Dr Thomas Cronin, of the Geological
Survey, Virginia, and Dr Maureen Raymo, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
That cycle corresponds to the rhythmic vibration in the tilt of
the Earth's axis of rotation, which affects seasonality.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China realized 150 billion
yuan in industrial output in January, up 10.3 percent over the
same month of last year, the State Statistics Bureau announced
today.
</P>
<P>
But the growth slowed by 2.8 percentage points compared with
last year's average monthly increase, said the Bureau in its
monthly report.
</P>
<P>
The state sector reported 90.8 billion yuan in added value
during the period, a growth of 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The collectively-owned industries saw their growth rate drop by
8.2 percentage points on annual basis to 9.5 percent last month,
generating 43 billion yuan in added value.
</P>
<P>
An increase of 16.5 was registered in the private sector and
overseas-funded ventures, up 3.4 percent from the corresponding
period of last year. It produced 2.95 billion yuan in added value
in January.
</P>
<P>
About 92.35 percent of the industrial products were sold in
January, up 0.53 percent on an annual basis. Sales of light
industrial products recovered even more quickly, and 91.95 percent
of them were purchased, up 1.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rising market demand resulted in quicker growth in the output
of durable commodities such as color TVs, refrigerator and
air-conditioners. Output of these items in January was up by 13 to
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also, about 31 percent more washing machines and 50 percent
more cameras were produced last month due to a brisker market.

TIANJIN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of
this, the biggest port city in north China, has mobilized its
4,000 branches and 400,000 members to actively take part in the
social relief work in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Last August, when Tianjin and neighboring Hebei Province
suffered heavy flooding, the Red Cross's branches and members
went all-out to fight the flood and organized medical teams.
</P>
<P>
Also, when earthquakes occurred in Yunnan Province and Inner
Mongolia the Red Cross organized teams to help relieve the
disasters there. Last year it helped collect a total of 740,000
yuan (one US dollar equals 8.3 yuan) for the earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the Red Cross initiated a campaign to look after lonely
elderly people, and helped raise three million yuan for 2,000
middle-school students and elderly people. It also helped set up
three homes for the elderly and a Red Cross school.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross paid great attention to mobilizing young
people to take part in its public-spirited activities and
sponsored branches in schools and colleges, including classes on
public health, first-aid training and help for the elderly,
the disabled and the poor.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Chenghua is searching
for a permanent meeting place for her club of widows and widowers,
the first of its kind in China that has been flooded with requests
for membership.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a retired teacher, was widowed just over two years
ago. Hoping to hook up with others who had lost a spouse, she
conducted a survey of more than 3,360 families in Nanjing, the
capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, and learned that ten
percent of those questioned had a mate who had died.
</P>
<P>
Thinking other widows and widowers might be experiencing some
of the same feelings of grief and loneliness, Zhang and two other
retired teachers organized a group and began meeting in each
other's homes.
</P>
<P>
The idea quickly caught on. Many members now regard the group
as a home where they can meet and talk, receive helpful
information about public welfare programs, and assist each other
in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
As the club's reputation spreads, Zhang finds herself with
little time on her hands. Her day begins early in the morning, and
she doesn't come home until seven or eight at night. She answers
all of her correspondence, not put off by the rapid increase in
mail. She occasionally offers financial assistance of up to 200
yuan (24 US dollars) for widowed families to help tide them over
during difficult times.
</P>
<P>
"I help to alleviate the suffering of others, which also brings
happiness to me," Zhang said. "It is a real joy for an old woman
like me to have so many friends around."

</P>
<P>
Another four UNITA members arrived at the same time to form
the government of national unity and reconciliation which will be

U.N. envoy Blondin Beye said he would be happy if all the

</P>
<P>
The UNITA members here were expected to discuss with the
current government how to draft a common administrative program,
said Isaias Samakuva, the head of the UNITA delegation in the

</P>
<P>
The arrival of the UNITA members has expressed good wishes of
UNITA for forming a government of national unity, therefore the
current government should become more flexible in talks between
the two sides, said Samakuva.
</P>
<P>
UNITA will take further steps toward national reconciliation
in the once war-torn southern African country once the
administrative program is completed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tung Urges Social Workers to Love HK, Back Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa
today called on all social workers in Hong Kong to love Hong Kong,
love the country and support the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Tung held a brief press conference at his new office in
central Hong Kong Island, which started official operation today.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the transition of members of the Hong Kong's
municipal councils and district boards, Tung said that he hoped
all social workers would love Hong Kong, which is perfectly
justified. They should also love the country, because Hong Kong is
part of China, and China's prosperity would benefit Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that all social workers should support the Basic Law
which guarantees the principles of "One country, Two systems",
"Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Tung also criticized some Hong Kong people who have been
overseas talking down on Hong Kong and casting doubt on Hong
Kong's future. "This is not in the interest of Hong Kong, nor in
the long-term interest of the six million Hong Kong people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that there are different views as to the speed of
democracy, there are different views as to where to fix the
balance between individual rights and the order of our society. It
is only natural for a community to have different views on these
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I think these are the views which should be talked through
in Hong Kong, instead of going overseas to talk about it in such a
way that creates doubt and confusion in the mind of people
overseas," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tung stated that it is not right to talk down on Hong Kong
overseas or invite foreign countries to try to tell Hong Kong
people how to do in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are Hong Kong, and we should sit down here ourselves to
talk these things through, and we should be able to find a good
solution as we move forward," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Expressways To Open for Traffic in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Two major access roads to
the new Chek Lap Kok airport will be opened for traffic here next
Thursday to provide an alternative route for motorists traveling
between Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwai Chung.
</P>
<P>
The opening of West Kowloon Expressway (WKE) and Kwai Chung
Viaduct (KCV) was revealed today by Chief Engineer (West Harbor
Link) of Highways Department Adrian Ng at a joint press conference
with the Transport Department.
</P>
<P>
WKE is a 4.2-kilometer dual three-lane expressway linking KCV
in the north and the Western Harbor Crossing, which is expected to
open later this year, in the south. KCV is a three-kilometer dual
four-lane expressway through Kwai Chung.
</P>
<P>
Ng said the two roads will serve as a direct road link between
Kwai Chung and the South Kowloon area.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of these two major roads will help relieve
existing congestion on Kwai Chung Road and in West Kowloon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Construction of WKE commenced in August 1993 while work for KCV
started in May 1993. The total cost of the two projects was 4.5
billion HK dollars (577 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nile Basin Countries to Discuss Water Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Water resources ministers of the
Nile Basin countries will hold a meeting here on February 20-22 to
discuss the projects to develop the rich resources of the world's
second longest river.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will discuss a working plan for the
project approved by the last meeting held in Tanzania in 1995,
local English-language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of the Nile Water Authority Mohamed
Nasser as saying that the plan included 22 long-range development
projects for the Nile water resources and environment protection
with investments totaling 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will approve the first stage of the working plan
to examine the water resources management and gather data on these
water resources by using remote sensing system financed by the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
Hydraulic data will also be exchanged among the countries by
satellites through a project funded by the Canadian Development
Agency and implemented by the World Meteorological Organization
with a grant of 1.5 million dollars, Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the regional framework of the Nile Basin
countries to be funded by the United Nations with a sum of 2.5
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda will be cooperation among these
countries, especially in combating the Nile hyacinth in the lake of
Victoria and training programs that Egypt would provide to its
Nile neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Nile Basin countries include Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania,
Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Flowing into Egypt, the 6,700-kilometer-long Nile fans out a
fertile valley of 24,000 square kilometers, which accounts for two
third of the Egyptian arable land and attracts 96 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement on Nile Basin countries' quota share, Egypt
has access to 55.5 billion cubic meters of Nile water, which forms
99 percent of the country's sweet water resources.

<HEADLINE> Growth in Energy Resources Output Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's energy resources
output increased by two percent on a yearly basis to top 102
million tons in January, the State Statistics Bureau announced
today.
</P>
<P>
But the growth rate was down by 4.4 percentage points from last
year's annual increase, said the bureau in its monthly report.
</P>
<P>
Some 109 million tons of raw coal was produced last month, up
only 0.6 percent over the same period of last year. The output of
raw coal grew by 6.4 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
China generated 89.1 billion kwh of electric power in
January. But the growth rate, at 4.7 percent, was down 2.3
percentage points from last year's annual increase rate.
</P>
<P>
Steel production rose 5.3 percent to about 6.9 million tons in
January, while growth in the output of ten nonferrous metals, soda
ash, and ethylene stood at 16.2, 9.7 and 15.8 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer output grew 10.5 percent to 2.25 million tons in
January, while pesticide production expanded by 10.2 percent to
top 35,700 tons.
</P>
<P>
The output of major machinery items continued to shrink in
January. The output of internal-combustion engines slipped by
three percent over the same period last year, while the production
of metal-cutting machine tools and locomotives plunged by 20.6
percent and 68.1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish market demand as a result of the state's strict
control over fixed-assets investment was mainly to blame for the
shrinking output of machinery products, a Bureau official said,
adding that massive imports also had a negative impact on domestic
machinery producers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An anti-landmine exhibition
opened today in central Luanda, the capital of once war-torn
Angola where landmines have claimed more than 70,000 lives.

the past 55 years surpassed those done by atom bombs and other
chemical weapons, according to data from the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Currently out of every 334 Angolans there is one disabled.

<HEADLINE> HK Cuts Ticket Prices to Lure Lost Public Back to Theaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong cinema operators
will slash admission prices one day a week in a bid to win back
lost audiences, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Movie-goers will only pay 30 HK dollars (3.8 US dollars) a
ticket every Tuesday starting next week, compared with current
prices of 45-65 HK dollars (5.8-8.3 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Theaters Association Chairman Chan Wing-mei said
yesterday that theaters were losing business as people hired cheap
alternatives such as videos, laser discs and video CDs.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have forgotten how exciting and fun it is to see
movies the way they were meant to be seen -- in cinemas rather
than on video or television," he said.
</P>
<P>
All 98 theaters across the territory, with 180 screens, are
involved in the price cuts, which aim to boost attendance by 80
percent on Tuesdays and by 30 percent for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
Theater attendance for all new movies has slid 23 percent in
the past three years, resulting in a nine percent drop in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 23 million people went to the movies, bringing
1.26 billion HK dollars (162 million US dollars) in box office
income, compared with the previous year's 24 million ticket sales
and 1.34 billion HK dollars (172 million US dollars) in income.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 1.38 billion HK dollars (177 million US dollars) was
generated from the sale of 30 million tickets.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first Asian city to follow the lead of the
United States, Australia, Canada and France in discounting tickets
on a traditionally slow midweek day.
</P>
<P>
Other concessionary measures, such as senior citizen and
student discounts, are also being considered to boost the
industry.

KUWAIT CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has become the
first Middle East country to use DNA technology in fighting
crimes, a security official said.

Kuwait plans to invite experts from Britain, Germany, Canada

technology, local Arabic daily Al-Watan today quoted Bader
Al-Khalifa, the director of Criminal Laboratory Department in the

based on DNA technology.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khalifa said his department has set up a specialized
database on licensed weapons possessed by citizens as a preventive
measure in crime-fighting.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to apprehend any suspect. The difficulty lies in
proving his or her role in the related crime. Our role lies in
providing the concerned authorities with necessary scientific
technical reports," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Says No Cabinet Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of South
Africa's Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the Democratic Party
(DP) said they have received no proposal on having them included
in the cabinet, the Citizen newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, PAC leader Stanley Magoba and
DP chief Tony Leon said they have responded positively to an
"overture" by President Nelson Mandela, but no substantive offer
are made to them.
</P>
<P>
Magoba said that PAC believes in non-racial unity but it is
reluctant to be part of the Government of National Unity headed
by Mandela at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel it is high priority for the party," said
Magoba, noting his party is looking for cooperation between
former allies in the struggle so that their supporters could
rediscover their unity.
</P>
<P>
He did not name who are PAC's "former allies."
</P>
<P>
PAC Secretary-General Michael Muendane said a week ago that it
will be difficult for it to join the government while former PAC
combatants are still in jail.
</P>
<P>
Questioned on whether he would accept a post in the cabinet,
DP leader Leon said he would take serious consideration if
President Mandela makes a specific suggestion.
</P>
<P>
However, Leon said, DP will not consider a move toward the
government if there is any prospect that DP's role is to be
diminished or its voice be silenced.
</P>
<P>
"We are forging ahead as an opposition party," Leon claimed

LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Presidents Gnassingbe Eyadema of
Togo and Matthew Kerekou of Benin have been here in the past day
to discuss regional issues, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
They arrived here on Wednesday and had a two-hour closed-door
meeting with Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Official Communique is expected to be issued today, and diplomatic
sources hinted of possible talks on trans-border activities among the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
Weeks ago, Benin denied being a transit for arms importation into
Nigeria, a claim Nigeria had attributed to pro-democracy exiles.
</P>
<P>
Besides trans-border exchange, General Abacha, as chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), might have
discussed the Liberian situation -- the just concluded disarmament
program and elections scheduled in May this year.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Major-General Victor Malu, commander of the
ECOWAS peace-keeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG, briefed General
Abacha last week about the latest developments in the former war-torn
west African country.
</P>
<P>
And the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia is currently meeting in
Monrovia, the Liberian capital, to discuss the issue of sending
additional troops to reinforce ECOMOG.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Home Minister, Legislators Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecutors
arrested National Assembly members Hwang Byung-tai and Kwon
Roh-kap as well as former home minister Kim Woo-suk on graft
charges in connection with Hanbo Business Group's bribe-for-loan
scandal here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors Wednesday summoned the three for questioning on
their roles in the Hanbo case.
</P>
<P>
Hwang, lawmaker of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) and
chairman of the Finance and Economy Committee of the National
Assembly, is accused of accepting 250,000 U.S. dollars from Hanbo
Business Group General Chairman Chung Tae-soo last year in return
for helping Hanbo to secure 62.5 million dollars in preferential
loans from the Korea Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Kwon, legislator of the main opposition National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP), is charged with taking a total of 300,000
dollars from Chung Tae-soo on three occasions in return for
glossing over Hanbo's irregularities in the course of
parliamentary inspection of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Kim is accused of taking 250,000 dollars in kickbacks from the
Hanbo leader on two occasions in return for favors for Hanbo,
which is the 14th largest business group in South Korea, while
serving as president of the Korea Land Development Corporation in
1993 and construction and transportation minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam appointed ruling NKP legislator Suh
Chung-hwa as new home minister to replace Kim Woo-suk this morning.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Chung Tae-soo has poured huge amounts
of money into politicians' pockets in the process of financing his
pet project to build a steel mill in the country's South
Chungchong Province.
</P>
<P>
On February 11, two ruling NKP legislators, Hong In-kil and
Chung Jae-chull, were arrested on charges of graft and influence
peddling in connection with the Hanbo loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo, who was arrested on January 31 on charges of
fraud and embezzlement, had secured 6 billion U.S. dollars in bank
loans between 1992 and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his
flagship firm, Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, which was declared
bankrupt by its creditors on January 23 after failing to honor
billions of dollars in notes.

FUZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province plans to use over six billion yuan (about 722 million US
dollars) over the next 15 years to transform scenic Meizhou Island

Located near the central part of the western bank of the Taiwan
Straits, the 14.35-sq.-km. Meizhou Island has hosted more than eight
million Chinese and overseas tourists since 1988; 900,000 of them
were followers of the legendary goddess of Mazu from Taiwan region.
</P>
<P>
Mazu, known as "the Goddess of Peace of the Strait", is

Because of its huge tourism potential, Meizhou was designated
as one of the 12 national holiday resorts in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The huge amount of funding is expected to be used to turn the
island into a resort that emphasizes the Mazu culture, and serves
as a facility for entertainment, shopping, processing and
cross-strait exchanges, provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has injected over 100 million yuan in the
construction of docks, roads, power and water supply facilities,
hospitals, and telecommunications facilities. Over 30 tourist
facilities have been completed, including hotels and scenic spots.

CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and six
others injured Wednesday night when unidentified gunmen opened
fire indiscriminately in front of a Coptic church in southern
Egypt, an official source in the Interior Ministry has said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Arabic newspaper Al-Ahram quoted the source as saying
that suspected Muslim militants launched the attack at about 8
p.m. local time at the Mary Girgis church in el-Fikria City, Abu
Kurkas district, Minya, about 240 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 victims, there are five women, two of them dead,
three others wounded, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The security forces imposed a siege on all the inlets that
lead to the scene of the incident and started a man-hunt
operations in search of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Muslim extremists have from time to time targeted Coptic
Christians on grounds they are heretics.
</P>
<P>
The attack was among the worst attacks on Christians since
1992, when Muslim extremists killed 12 Christian villagers in
Assiut, about 320 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign to establish a
strict Islamic state since 1992. Over 1,050 people have been
killed in the clashes, most of them civilians and police in the
south.
</P>
<P>
In a predominantly Muslim country, Copts make up about 10

He said newly arriving illegal immigrants were told to take
these routes which lead to places where agents will be waiting

<HEADLINE> Jordan Involved to Secure Release of Hamas leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is involved in efforts to
help secure the release of two leaders of the Hamas movement, one
of them facing extradition from the U.S. to Israel, Jordan Times
today quoted an official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source declined to confirm reports that Musa Abu Marzouk,
head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), could be sent to Jordan instead of Israel as a compromise
to avert possible Palestinian violence that could undermine the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The source, who didn't want to be identified, was commenting on
reports in the Israeli press that Abu Marzouk was to be
"transferred" from the U.S to Jordan instead of extradition to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"His Majesty King Hussein is in touch with the
U.S. administration in an effort to solve two issues -- the
continued detention of (Hamas founder) Sheikh Ahmad Yassin and
the problem of Abu Marzouk extradition," said the source.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Yassin, who is serving a life term in an Israeli prison,
is reportedly in ill health, and Palestinian leaders have warned
of violence by his supporters if he dies while in detention.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzouk, 46, was apprehended by New York immigration
officials in 1995 on grounds he violated immigration laws by not
declaring affiliation with Hamas when he obtained a
U.S. residency permit in the late 1980s.

billion yuan into the Three Gorges Project this year, an increase
of 200 million yuan over the amount spent last year.
</P>
<P>
China Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corp., the major sponsor
of this largest water-control project in the world, has scheduled
the damming of the Yangtze River for mid-November.
</P>
<P>
"The whole construction plan for this year will be centered
around the river-blocking in November," said an official with the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
As much as 26 million cubic meters of earth will be removed
from the project site this year, down two million cubic meters
from last year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth river transportation after the damming, a
detour channel will replace the main thoroughfare for ships. It
will be open on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started in December 1993 and is expected to
claim a total investment of 110 to 180 billion yuan, still needs

CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Anthrax outbreak in southeast
Australia has spread from dairy to beef cattle and from Victoria
northward to New South Wales with the Victoria state's
agricultural officials admitting the crisis is still not under
control.
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m. today, 75 cattle had died of anthrax in 37 properties
in the Stanhope and Tatura region in Victoria state, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the state Department of Natural Resources and
Environment said, 11,000 cattle had been vaccinated against the
disease on 141 properties since the outbreak began on January 26,
and the quarantine order prevents movement of cattle from the
affected farms for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Victorian state government has sought to reassure overseas
interests about its efforts to tackle the anthrax outbreak, Deputy
Premier Pat McNamara said today. Overseas markets were sensitive
and it was important "for us not to get too overly inflammatory
about this issue".
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, Health Department infectious diseases unit
spokeswoman Rosemary Lester said there was no danger to public
health, despite one knackery worker testing positive for anthrax.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Stanhope knackery worker diagnosed with the
disease Saturday was moved to the Goulburn Valley Base Hospital.
He was reported to make a full recovery after treatment with
penicillin.
</P>
<P>
However, It was the human threat of anthrax that aroused most
community anxiety. At a community meeting in Tatura area Wednesday
night, farmers and residents met with officials to air their
concerns about the disease. Elsewhere in the district, residents
were worried about their cattle, their pets and themselves, local
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The state government has vaccinated cattle to help quell fears
that the outbreak would affect dairy exports. Strict quarantine
and other measures are being taken to stop milk from infected
stock entering the human food chain.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax, which has been present in Australia since 1847, causes
rapid death in cattle, sheep and goats when they eat contaminated
soil or feed. Its spores can remain in soil for up to 80 years and
it is believed they could have germinated in hot and dry weather.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan region has been
the second largest overseas investment source after Hong Kong
region in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial sources, a total of 889 Taiwan-funded
enterprises had been established in Hebei by the end of last year
with 1.56 billion US dollars in investment, 42.3 percent of which

Over the past few years, Taiwan's investment in Hebei has been
switching from labor-intensive and simple processing projects to

joint ventures with 10 million US dollars each, 62.8 percent of
which uses investment from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the Taiwan funding has been directed toward
such projects as infrastructure facilities, transformation of old
city areas and industrial projects.

<HEADLINE> WHO Grants Uganda Money to Fight Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has given Uganda 90 million U.S. Dollars to fight
malaria, the Monitor daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Obuoforibo Abiye, a professor on behalf of the WHO chief in
Uganda, said at a one-day workshop on malaria control policy
Tuesday that the disease has drastically affected the
socio-economic development in Uganda and other sub-Saharan
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that malaria is a leading killer and a key
cause of ill-health in this eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Malaria causes 25 percent of the total outpatients attendance,
20 percent of the admissions to health facilities and 14 percent
of the death cases of the patients, they say.
</P>
<P>
Most affected by the epidemic in the country are four of all
the 39 districts -- Toror, Mubende, Apac and Rukungiri.
</P>
<P>
In Toror, 35 percent of the out-patients suffering malaria in
1996 were adults and 43 percent were children under five.
</P>
<P>
Malaria transmission in the country is mainly through
anopheles gabiac, a vector which breeds in ill-defined places and
is difficult to be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
Abiye also called for an inter-sectoral collaboration in the
general health services and for improvement of the anti-vector
special services.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Clarifies Stand on Arms Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An Envoy of South Africa to
Kenya has clarified that his government is not fuelling war in
the Great Lakes region by selling arms to Rwanda, the Kenya Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted South African High Commissioner Griffins
Memela as saying on Wednesday it is the policy of his country
that arms should not be sold to people who want to destabilize
peace in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The envoy noted that South Africa-manufactured weapons are not
allowed to be used in the abuse of human rights as Pretoria is a
firm believer in democracy.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that South Africa had cancelled its 8.5 million
U.S. Dollars arms deal with Rwanda last November immediately
after it established that the arms are to be used in war.
</P>
<P>
Memela made the remarks when he paid a courtesy call on Kenyan
Minister in the Office of the President Jackson Kalweo.
</P>
<P>
Before the November 5 Heads of State summit on the eastern
Zaire crisis, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi held a telephone
conversation with President Nelson Mandela, urging his
counterpart to suspend arms sales to Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Kenyan leader urged that countries should
immediately stop fuelling the armed conflicts in eastern Zaire by
being directly involved in or supplying weapons to combatants.
</P>
<P>
He noted that continued fuelling of the conflict would
definitely lead to a senseless bloodshed in Zaire and
destabilization in the entire region.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Ship Hits Jetty At Zanzibar Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A foreign cargo ship
hit the jetty at the Zanzibar Port on Wednesday while trying to
dock, damaging a section of the bow of the ship, reports reaching
here from Zanzibar said today.
</P>
<P>
According to director of the Zanzibar Harbor and Marine
Transport Mustafa Aboud Jumbe, the impact of the crash had
broken a huge part of the jetty and damaged a section of the bow of
the ship.
</P>
<P>
The director further said the ship loaded with containers plies
between the east African ports and the Gulf region, whose navigator
had miscalculated the speed of the ship when approaching the jetty.
But he did not say which country the ship belonged to.
</P>
<P>
Jumbe added his office is investigating the accident to establish
the costs of the damage.
</P>
<P>
Last December, a Zanzibar government owned fuel tanker, UV
Ukombozi, also hit the jetty at the isles port while trying to dock,
damaging a section of the bow.

<HEADLINE> Water Rationed in Drought-Hit Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has started
rationing water in the north due to prolonged drought that has
dried many wells and affected crops there, the official Daily
News said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at ensuring that all the people in northern
Zanzibar, one of the worst drought-hit areas in this eastern
African country, have access to water, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Owners of hotels and guest houses in the region have been
ordered to pump water from the main line to their hotels only in
two of every seven days, instead of every day previously.
</P>
<P>
Many hoteliers there are complaining that the water ration
would affect their operation since they have to spend 300 U.S.
Dollars per day on hiring water tankers to ferry water from
Kidoti, almost 20 kilometers away from Northern Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibari water authorities said that they also ferry
water to the affected areas by water tankers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Agrees to Tariff Cut Deadline on IT Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has agreed to reduce
the deadline for tariff cuts on information technology (IT)
products from 2007 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
The country has also decided to move six products from the
"sensitive list" to the "slow list", according to a report in The
Nation today.
</P>
<P>
Previously Thailand classified its IT products into three lists
according to their sensitivity on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The first was the "normal track", a list of less sensitive
products, on which the tariff could be reduced to zero by 2000.
There are now 151 products in this group.
</P>
<P>
The second group, "the slow track," covers 31 products that
needed time for a transitional process. Products in this group are
subject to a tax cut to zero by 2003-2005.
</P>
<P>
The third, "the sensitive track," covers products that will be
seriously affected by the planned liberalization. Products in this
group use domestic raw materials for local consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has included six items, such as fiber-optic
cables, telephone sets, integrated circuits and telephone exchange
equipment on this sensitive list.
</P>
<P>
Thailand made the adjustments after the Quad group, which
comprises the U.S., Canada, the European Union and Japan, insisted
that it cannot accept Thailand's deadline for a reduction in
tariffs for sensitive products by 2007, but preferred a shorter
time frame, by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
IT tariff cuts are set to be discussed in the second round of
World Trade Organization talks in Geneva on March 1, when member
countries are due to submit clear deadlines for their products
lists.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will hold the
International Investment Funds Conference in October this year,
which will provide a forum for exchanges among investment funds
associations from all over the world, the Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lo, chairman of the HKIFA, said that the conference will
be attended by 70 to 80 senior representatives from about 40
investment fund associations worldwide, who together represent
about 5.6 trillion U.S. dollars in collective investment funds.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of this annual event are to allow senior
investment industry representatives to share information on the
commercial and regulatory development of the industry in the
respective countries and to discuss issues of common concern so as
to arrive at mutually agreeable standards and guidelines for the
global investment management industry.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong Organizing Committee for the
conference Chris Russell said the conference highlights the
maturity of the Hong Kong investment funds industry and its
position as a regional fund management center, and it also gives a
clear message that Hong Kong is committed to maintaining its
position as a premier regional fund management center, especially
as the event takes place after Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
"Greater confidence in Hong Kong will encourage fund companies
to allocate more resources to Hong Kong and will attract more new
players into the market," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Zaire's Claim on Plane Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
denied sending aircraft across the Zairean border as claimed by
Zaire, which said a cargo plane with Ugandan troops crashed
Monday in eastern Zaire, the New Vision paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Zairean defense spokesman claimed Tuesday that Zairean
soldiers on Monday captured some survivors from the crash which
took place in Rwenzori mountain bordering Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"No Ugandan aircraft or personnel have flown into or are
engaged in the war in eastern Zaire," the Ugandan government said
in a statement issued here last night.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's radar did the scan in the past 72 hours but has
detected no signs of crash of any aircraft in its airspace or
beyond, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The only aircraft crossing Rwenzori mountain during these days
was a civil plane used by World Food Program to carry
humanitarian relief items, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which belonged to a Zaire-based private company,
had returned safely to Entebbe Airport in southern Uganda on
Tuesday, it added.
</P>
<P>
Local civil aviation officials say that Uganda's only cargo
plane is now under repair in France.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Has More Ports for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Overseas tourists can now go
directly to inland Anhui Province by air, rail or water thanks to
newly-built ports there.
</P>
<P>
A customs office was recently opened at the international
airport of Mount Huangshan, and has greatly facilitated the
traffic of overseas tourists visiting the scenic mountain, which
is on the World Heritage list of UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The province in central China now has two international
airports, one at the provincial capital of Hefei, and the other at
Huangshan. Last year, the chartered flights alone transported
22,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
While Hefei Airport has regular scheduled flights to Hong Kong,
and chartered flights to Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK),
Huangshan Airport has flights to Hong Kong and is negotiating
others to Japan and ROK.
</P>
<P>
Another convenience is the opening of the customs office at
Fuyang, the hub station at the new Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
Tourists who prefer traveling by water can now have greater
opportunities to do so, since the province has launched two ports
of entry, one at Anqing and the other at Wuhu.

ULAN BATOR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's foreign trade in
January plunged by 19.6 percent from that of the corresponding
period in 1996, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume in January totaled about 37 million
U.S. dollars with 21 million dollars in exports and 16 million
dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Russia, Mongolia's traditional partner, went down by
86.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believe that the slide of copper and cashmere
prices, the principal exports of Mongolia, is the main reason for
the shrinkage of trade.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Invest 300 Million Yuan on Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's largest metropolis of
Shanghai earmarked 300 million yuan (about 36 million US dollars)
for poverty relief programs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The funding was provided by governments at all levels in the
city, which has a population of 14 million, to alleviate poverty
in towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city set the minimum poverty limit at 185 yuan
(about 23 dollars) per month. But there were still over 7,500
township residents who were below the designated standard,
prompting the governmental departments to offer people who were
qualified relief funds totaling 75 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 poor retired workers were given another 40
yuan each, with the total value standing at 39 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the governments invested 44 million yuan to help
renovate homes for the elderly, and to improve community services
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
The rural social insurance system also has taken shape; the
number of villages and townships, and people taking part in the
system last year ranked the first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,200 rural households in Shanghai, involving 14,400
people, were below the minimum standard of living last year. The
local counties, townships and villages have offered 7.87 million
yuan in relief funding for them, while the counties and districts
put aside another 56 million yuan to help with their pensions,
insurance, medical care, education and temporary difficulties.
</P>
<P>
To date, the districts have collected a total of 200 million
yuan in poverty relief funds and some 4,500 governmental organs in
the city have launched the help-one-another relief campaign.

goalkeeper, Argentina beat Colombian 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier
in Barranquilla, Colombia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was Colombia's first loss in the elimination round.
</P>
<P>
Mondragon's lapse came at 10 minutes when Argentine forward
Claudio Lopez fired a shot toward the far net. Apparently
believing the shot wide, Mondragon trotted toward the ball rather
than dive.
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes into the second half, Colombia's Mauricio Serna
missed a penalty kick before 50,000 fans and his teammates missed
more than a dozen good chances.
</P>
<P>
Colombia led the South America qualifying tournament alone
before Wednesday's match but faced the prospect of being tied for
first with Paraguay, which played Peru later Wednesday.

Argentina remained in third place, but got its third win in

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Washington for Mideast Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu arrived here today for talks with U.S. leaders
on maintaining the momentum for an overall peace settlement in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Thursday morning before his early afternoon talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said Netanyahu intended to discuss with
Clinton "where the strategy for the Middle East peace process
turns."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's U.S. tour will start a new round of Middle East
diplomacy to take place in Washington. Palestinian Chairman Yasser
Arafat, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of
Jordan are all scheduled to come to the U.S. capital next month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Albright told Congress that she will ensure
Netanyahu and the other Middle East leaders that the United States
"will continue to stand with the peacemakers ... in this strategic
region."
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Hebron agreement, signed last month between
Israel and the Palestinians, could open the way to further
progress in the Middle East peace process, including Israel's
relations with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron deal led to withdrawal of most Israeli troops from
the West Bank city, and to the recent Israeli release of 30
Palestinian women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly will propose resuming peace talks with
Syria, including a possible compromise on the Golan Heights, part
of Syrian territory that was captured by Israel during the third
Middle East War in 1967.
</P>
<P>
He probably will also acknowledge understandings reached last
year between Syria and the former Israeli Labor government, but he
may insist Israel is not obliged by them.
</P>
<P>
Israel's previous Labor prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and
Shimon Peres, were reported to have agreed to return the Golan
Heights in exchange for full peace with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Netanyahu is also expected to
talk with Clinton about a possible U.S. deal to sell 100 F-16 jet
fighters to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"We view this with severity," the Israeli prime minister
said. "Arming Saudi Arabia with 100 advanced planes and advanced
weaponry is a violation of the strategic balance in the Middle
East."

HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's commercial
agricultural sector will spend more than 200 million U.S. Dollars
within the next 14 years on providing decent housing, education,
health, water and sanitation facilities to farm workers.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Labor Bureau (ALB) has endorsed the
far-reaching plan signed by commercial farmers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The development plan, coming 17 years after independence, is
mainly due to heavy criticism by the government of commercial
farmers on their poor efforts to improve their employers'
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which was hailed by cabinet ministers
Wednesday, the ALB will provide sanitation, water and health
facilities to farm workers in the first four years, and deal with
the provision of housing and education in the next ten years.

<HEADLINE> Steel Exporters Advised to Focus on Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian steel producers
should pay attention to the rapidly growing markets in Southeast
Asia and East Asia, said an expert group here today.
</P>
<P>
There will be export opportunities in Japan, the US, and
western and eastern Europe, the expert group said, adding that the
government should also facilitate exports of steel to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The expert group was formed by the Steel Ministry last year to
study the export situation of iron and steel.
</P>
<P>
The expert group has proposed the formation of a non-government
steel exporters' association, consisting of major steel exporters,
for the promotion of exports. It has suggested that the cumbrous
and lengthy procedures for the export of steel should be
simplified as they obstruct exports.
</P>
<P>
Projects with a foreign exchange earning potential of 500
million US dollars should be treated as fast track projects during
clearance by central and state governments. Development of ports
to facilitate handling of iron and steel should be taken up on a
priority basis, the expert group said.
</P>

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- US-based Destec Energy is
planning to enter the Indian power sector by investing
approximately two billion US dollars in electricity-generating
projects, industry ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A high-level team including Destec President and Managing
Director Garry Mann and its Asia-Pacific Vice-President Henry Bell
is expected to arrive early next month. The visit is aimed at
finalizing tie-ups with Indian partners.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to set up plants in West and South India and
will focus on setting up large power plants (above 500 megawatts)
as well as small captive plants for industries which require
assured power supply. Destec will rely mainly on imported coal for
power generation, said the company's Indian representative.
</P>
<P>
Destec Energy's move to invest in India comes at a time when
major foreign players have drawn up plans to invest in India's
power sector. Last week, American firm, Enron, announced plans to
invest 10 billion US dollars in India, while Japanese conglomerate
Sumitomo Corporation plans to launch a 100 percent subsidiary
which will invest in five to six power projects in the country.

<P>
XI'AN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1996, China-made
109 Yun-7 airplanes had safely flown a combined 505,000 hours and
completed 524,000 take-offs and landings, indicating they have
reached the world's advanced standard, Chinese aviation experts
announced.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Yun-7 was delivered by the Xi'an Aircraft
Industrial Corp. in 1884, the 100-plus planes have recorded no
accidents due to poor quality, technical service and product
support, the experts said, adding that such outstanding
performance is rare for so large a group of planes.
</P>
<P>
The 109 Yun-7s now are operated by either Chinese or foreign
airlines. Chinese airlines are flying a total of 72 Yun-7s on
about 100 domestic routes, making this the largest fleet on

DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's paddy output is

26.57 million tons in 1995, according to sources in the
Agriculture Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sees Lower Foreign Debt on Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign debt was
declining due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the US
dollar, official sources today quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The fall of the yen against the dollar has caused a decline in
our foreign debt because about 40 percent of the debts are
denominated in yen," Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said here
Wednesday after meeting President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the weakening yen also threatens the
competitiveness of the country's exports, especially to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor J. Soedradjad Djiwandono said recently
that Indonesia's foreign debt was about 110 billion dollars, of
which 50 percent was government debt.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's yen-denominated foreign debts fell to 22.4 billion
dollars as of last September from 24.03 billion dollars in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was worth about 100 yen in December 1995 after
dipping to its lowest level of about 80 yen in April, 1995. The
dollar continued to recover and was worth 124.20 yen on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said earlier the reduction in government foreign debt
resulted from the early repayment of high-interest debts and the
depreciation of the yen against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government has repaid 2.6 billion dollars of foreign debt
ahead of schedule since the 1994/95 fiscal year, saving the
government 1.45 billion dollars in interest.
</P>
<P>
Budget surpluses and proceeds from the sale of state
enterprises funded the early repayments, he said.

Caritas estimated that about 350,000 people nationwide are

homeless "is not romantic or voluntary, but a great evil and
unfairness." He stressed that everybody has the right to own a
roof over his head, and appealed to the government and society to
give a hand to those in need.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Increase in U.S. Foreign Affairs Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- New U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright launched today her first campaign at Congress
to increase foreign affairs spending by nearly 7 percent to 19.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before a House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing,
Albright urged Congress to approve funding for a new African
Crisis Response Force, 70 million dollars for NATO's Partnership
for Peace program and 535 million dollars to "cement" reforms in
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the African Crisis Response Force was raised
by Albright's predecessor Warren Christopher in October when he
took a trip to sub-Saharan Africa, where he received mixed
reactions from African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The United States has planned to launch the new crisis force by
April and it was the first time that the Clinton administration
mentioned the fund through Albright's testimony.
</P>
<P>
"We are placing a priority on our efforts to increase the
peacekeeping capacities of African nations through an African
Crisis Response Force," she told Congress.
</P>
<P>
The state secretary also sought 70 million dollars in military
assistance for Eastern European countries that are members of
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, so as to help bring some of
them into NATO by 1999.
</P>
<P>
NATO is scheduled to hold a summit meeting in Madrid in July to
decide which Eastern European countries would have full membership
in NATO. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are presumed to be
the first countries under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Another 535 million dollars would be earmarked for a so-called
Freedom Program, which was intended to help Russia and other CIS
states promote business, trade, investment and other activities.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Appoints New Home Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam today appointed Suh Chung-hwa as home minister after his
predecessor quit over suspected involvement in Hanbo scandal.
</P>
<P>
Suh, a National Assembly member of the ruling New Korea Party
(NKP), replaced Kim Woo-suk, who tendered his resignation
Wednesday when named as a suspect in the Hanbo Business Group's
bribe-for-loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Suh has formerly served as home minister and chairman of the
Home Affairs Committee of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kim Woo-suk, along with NKP legislator Hwang
Byung-tai and Kwon Roh-kap, a legislator from the main opposition
National Congress for New Politics, was summoned by the
prosecution for questioning on their suspected involvement in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The three are likely to be placed under arrest on bribe-taking
charges at the end of the probe as prosecutors have reportedly
secured incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
Kim Woo-suk is suspected of taking several hundred thousand
U.S. dollars in kickbacks from Hanbo General Chairman Chung
Tae-soo while serving as president of the Korea Land Development
Corporation in 1993 and construction and transportation minister
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that the Hanbo leader has poured huge
amounts of money into politicians' pockets in the process of
financing his project to set up a steel mill in the country's
South Chungchong Province. Hanbo is the 14th largest business
group in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo had secured 6 billion dollars in bank loans
between 1992 and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his
flagship firm, Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, which was declared
bankrupt by its creditors on January 23 after failing to honor
billions of dollars in notes.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by the prosecution on January 31 on charges of
fraud and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
President Kim has ordered law enforcement authorities to
strictly and fairly investigate anyone involved in the Hanbo
scandal regardless of position.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, two ruling NKP legislators, Hong In-kil and Chung
Jae-chull, were arrested by the prosecution on charges of graft
and influence peddling in connection with the scandal.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Landmine Ban Opens in Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 250 experts from 107
countries and international organizations gathered here today for
negotiations on a total worldwide ban on landmines.
</P>
<P>
"The function of the meeting will be to discuss the content of
a convention (on banning landmines) and prepare the future
negotiation," Thomas Hajnoczi, head of disarmament at the Austrian
Foreign Ministry, said before the conference.
</P>
<P>
Austria, which favors an immediate total ban, was entrusted to
draw up the draft of the convention by Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy at the 50-nation Ottawa forum last October.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting in Vienna is part of the so-called
"Ottawa Process," which will lead to a follow-up conference in
Brussels in June and another forum in Ottawa in December.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 million landmines lie buried in 64 countries around
the world. The United Nations statistics show landmines kill or
maim a person every 20 minutes, or 25,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government, host of the Ottawa forum, aims for a
legally-binding agreement in December 1997 to ban the production,
stockpiling, export and use of landmines.
</P>
<P>
However, many countries regarded the Canadian deadline
unrealistic and preferred to discuss the issue at the
U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
So far, both the "Ottawa Progress" and Geneva conference are
under way. Experts hope that multilateral negotiations can speed
up the process as they did in the signing of the nuclear test ban
treaty in 1996.

Opening the 12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting here this
morning, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, whose
country is co-chairman of the meeting, noted that "ASEAN is an
important and fast growing market for the E.U."
</P>
<P>
But he said ASEAN-E.U. trade is still smaller in terms of
volume than both ASEAN-U.S. and ASEAN-Japan trade even though the
E.U. has a larger gross domestic product than both the United
States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"There is therefore considerable room to expand ASEAN-E.U.
trade," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that ASEAN's promise is part of an Asia-wide
boom, adding that "Asia, led by China, is undergoing a historic
transformation which will shift the center of gravity of the world
economy."
</P>
<P>
While expressing ASEAN's welcome to European interest in the
region, Lee made it clear that economic cooperation is only one
dimension of the ASEAN-E.U. relationship.
</P>
<P>
"To have a more balanced relationship, we need a better
understanding of one another's sensitivities, motivations and
aspirations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that diversity of history and culture means that
"often, ASEAN and the E.U. countries will have different
perceptions of the roles of the individual and the family, the
community and the state."
</P>
<P>
"What works in Europe will not always work in the Asian
context, and vice versa," he said. "As Asian countries progress,
they will adapt, but will not copy wholesale, ideas and
institutions from Western societies, to suit their needs."
</P>
<P>
He urged both sides to accept their differences and focus on
areas of cooperation and "not to fixate on individual contentious
issues and allow them to undermine the broader relationship."
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening session, Dutch Foreign Minister
Hans van Mierlo, whose country now holds the rotating E.U.
presidency, said that "For the E.U. the cooperation between the
E.U. and ASEAN is and remains the cornerstone of the Euro-Asian
relationship."
</P>
<P>
He added that the E.U. looks forward to "fruitful discussions"
with its ASEAN partners today and tomorrow on ways and means to
deepen and diversify the E.U.-ASEAN relationship, including the
opening of new fields of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the two-day ministerial meeting are foreign
ministers of the seven ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam -- and
their counterparts from the 15 E.U. members -- Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Hits Six-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht was
under strong attack on Wednesday when it passed the psychological
threshold of 26 to the US dollar, the lowest value in six years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers say the attack was the strongest on
any currency since money-changers attacked European currencies
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The baht rose to 26.01 to the dollar during Wednesday's morning
session, compared with the mid-rate fixed by the central bank's
exchange equalization fund of 25.96 baht, the highest mid-rate
since May 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
But trading fell to 25.98 baht in the afternoon, which was
within the bandwidth set by the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The baht fell because of rumors of its devaluation and
continued appreciation of the greenback against the Japanese yen
and the German mark.
</P>
<P>
Worried about devaluation, investors unloaded baht in the swap
market, causing the swap premiums to rise as the demand for
dollars made it more expensive for investors to swap baht into the
US currency, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate on overnight loans borrowed among commercial
banks was 13 percent, slightly lower than on Monday, and well down
from last week's 20-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower interbank rate reflects higher liquidity in the money
market.
</P>
<P>
Interbank rate surged last week because the central bank was
trying to make speculation on the baht-dollar exchange rate more
costly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, a major international securities
firm, raised the probability of the baht's devaluation within
three months to 25 percent, compared with 5 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, on Wednesday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index fell 11.42 points, or 1.6 percent, to finish at 722.57
points, its lowest close since June 10,1992.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Acknowledges Deepening Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The state of poverty in Bulgaria
was 10 times worse in the past four years and many people have
lost the basic living conditions, President Petar Stoyanov told
the nation Wednesday after naming a caretaker government to end
the country's two-month-long political crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Stoyanov admitted that
the country's real living standards have dropped to about one
tenth of the level four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came hours after he appointed Sofia's
mayor Stefan Sofianski to lead a caretaker government to make way
out of a collapsing economy.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said the average monthly wage of Bulgarians has fallen
to 10 U.S. dollars in value, compared with 70 dollars four years
ago, and the monthly pension for retirees to only four to six
dollars in value.
</P>
<P>
In the six years after 1991, the country's currency, the lev,
depreciated from 28 to the dollar to 2800 to one, and inflation
amounted to 24,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's domestic debt more than tripled
last year to reach 330 billion levs (117.86 million
dollars). Taking the inflation into account, Bulgaria's internal
debt actually exceeded 3 trillion levs (1.07 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said without new loans from international financial
institutions, Bulgaria was unable to pay the debts.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bulgaria's foreign reserves only stood at around
300 million dollars, leaving the country with no means to prevent
the lev from a free fall.
</P>
<P>
The situation has worsened since the beginning of this month as
food and fuel shortages, which have prompted month-long mass
protests, further deteriorated. Food prices soared an average of
140 percent in the past 10 days, with meat price shooting up 165
percent and potato, the basic food for most Bulgarians, up more
than 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sofianski said Tuesday that the caretaker government would make
all-out efforts to get loans and assistance from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government will stay in place until early
elections are held on April 19.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Investments in Chile Increase in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chile received 135.4 million
U.S. dollars worth of investments from South American Common
Market (Mercosur) in 1996, or 76 percent more than 1995, the
Foreign Investment Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
With the increase, Brazil's total capital in Chile reached
159.2 million dollars, that of Argentina 102.8 million dollars and
Uruguay 97 million dollars, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian investments mainly went into Chile's construction
sector, Argentina's into transportation, storage facilities,
electricity and gas, and Uruguay's to the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Chile became an associate member of Mercosur in 1996, when its
government approved 137.7 million dollars worth of investment by
the group of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur began operation in January 1995 with aims to tighten
trade ties between its member countries and to promote economy
across the region.

<HEADLINE> Italy Welcomes Law on Election Results in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy hailed today the speedy
approval by the Serbian parliament of a special law reinstating
the disputed municipal election results of November 17 last year.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to annul
the results of the election, which the opposition parties claimed
to have won, triggered months of street demonstrations in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which sent a mission to Belgrade in December 1996 headed by former
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, recommended that the
results should stand.
</P>
<P>
According to ANSA, the Italian Foreign Ministry called for a
prompt implementation of the special law and said it would allow
the confrontation to be moved from the streets to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it hoped a constructive dialogue would soon
begin between the government and opposition.
</P>
<P>
Italy offered support and encouragement to both sides in the
endeavor, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Trade Deficit Rises in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Austria's trade deficit rose
five percent last year to 93 billion schillings (8.5 billion
U.S. dollars), statistics issued by the Austrian Federal Economic
Chamber show.
</P>
<P>
The volume of imports and exports both increased by six
percent, with imports reaching 705 billion schillings (64.1
billion dollars) and exports 612 billion schillings (55.6 billion
dollars), Egon Winkler, director of the Foreign Trade and
Integration Department of the Chamber, told a news briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the trade deficit was the combined result of
the rise in the country's trade deficit with European Union (EU),
and the fall in its trade surplus with Eastern Europe, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Austria's biggest trading partner. Trade between the
two accounts for two thirds of the country's total foreign
trade value. Eastern Europe is Austria's second largest trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
Austria's trade deficit with EU last year climbed to 109
billion schillings (9.91 billion dollars). Exports to the EU
increased by six percent, reaching 405 billion schillings (36.8
billion dollars) but imports rose seven percent to 514 billion
schillings (46.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade surplus with Eastern Europe fell to 19
billion schillings (1.72 billion dollars). With its market in the
region shrinking by one third, Austria's exports there increased
only one percent and imports by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Winkler forecast that in 1997, the rate of export growth would
slow further and warned that Austria must promote manufacturing
and trade exports, since service exports alone could not narrow
the trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police to Investigate Election Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ordered a special police team to investigate
election violence last Tuesday, which resulted in the killing of
government district member of Parliament Nalanda Ellawala.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources today, an opposition United
National Party (UNP) district member of Parliament, his bodyguard
and a former UNP Mayor of Ratnapura were wanted for questioning by
the police Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, a group of UNP supporters had
stopped the vehicle in which Ellawala and a fellow MP Dilan Perera
were traveling, compelled the occupants to get down and fired at
them.
</P>
<P>
Ellawala and Perera were unarmed at that time. The group that
attacked them was reported to have about 15 persons with arms of
various descriptions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident the police declared a curfew in the
Ratnapura region.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's incident, a police constable was also killed.
Ellawala's bodyguards and at least three others were injured.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the situation in Ratnapura, about 110
kilometers from Colombo, is under control.

<HEADLINE> Prodi: Italy Near Single Currency Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said today that Italy had achieved three of the five targets
set in the Maastricht Treaty to join the European single currency
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Chamber of Deputies during question time, Prodi
said most of the goals had been reached thanks to the initiative
of his center-left government.
</P>
<P>
The government's next aim was to meet the treaty's criteria on
keeping the budget deficit to within three percent of Gross
Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Regarding talks between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Massimo D'Alema, Secretary of Italy's Democratic Party of the
Left, Prodi said that he had nothing to object to, and said there
were no differences between himself and D'Alema on the strategy
for taking Italy into the European single currency as a founder
member in 1999.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema visited Germany last Thursday on the eve of Prodi's
visit to Bonn. Germany has cast doubt on Italy's entry into
European Monetary Union in 1999, saying it was far from achieving
the Maastricht Treaty targets and claiming the lira's entry would
devalue the euro.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the steep decline in Italy's inflation rate, the
prime minister said there had been a "spectacular" reduction in
the difference between German and Italian bond yields.
</P>
<P>
He told deputies that Kohl publicly acknowledged this, and
agreed to adopt a "general strategy of cooperation" between
Germany and Italy within the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Chile Bans British Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Health Ministry
launched today a ban on the import of beef and beef byproducts
from the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The ministry banned the entry of brains, marrow, tonsils,
sweetbreads, spleen and intestines of British beef which are
considered to contain risky tissued of the spongiform
encephalopathy disease, or popularly known as the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Also banned are similar products from other countries where the
mad cow disease have appeared and from those that are not
certified as being free of the disease by the International Office
of Epizootic Diseases.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow disease, like other transmittable encephalopathies
of animals, is characterized by the absence of inflammatory
lesions and an unusually long incubation period.
</P>
<P>
The British government admitted on March 27, 1996, that there
are possible links between the mad cow disease and its human
equivalent, the Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD).
</P>
<P>
Dozens of CJD cases have been reported since then in Britain
and other European nations, which aroused panic in Europe and
other parts of the world over British beef.
</P>
<P>
The European Union therefore imposed a global ban on the import
of British beef products.
</P>
<P>
Chile's ban will be lifted as soon as the World Health
Organization informs that beef from those countries no longer
poses any danger to human health, said the ministry.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A fire destroyed 380 shanties
and made 2,000 people homeless in a sub-district in North Jakarta,
capital of Indonesia, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire also burned down six pedicabs and two motorcycles but
no casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Hokar, a witness, told Xinhua today that the fire attacked
shanties abandoned by some residents who were going back to their
hometowns. The fire started flaring up at 3:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
A fire-fighter said the source of fire came from an exploding
kerosene-filled stove. It spread quickly from a shanty to other
shanties.
</P>
<P>
The local press said residents made efforts to extinguish the
fire by whatever they could use, but the fire kept burning because
the buildings were flammable and located very close to each other.
</P>
<P>
Ten fire brigade trucks put the fire out two hours later. One
of the fire-fighters estimated that the material loss might reach
one billion rupiah (about 418,410 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Attack on NATO Chief's CIS Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials today
continued their criticism of NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana's tour of four ex-Soviet republics, saying the trip had
"undeclared, behind-the-scenes" aims.
</P>
<P>
Solana's visit was an overt signal of NATO's determination to
press ahead with its plans for eastward expansion, President Boris
Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
But he was also pursuing a hidden agenda -- to resist any form
of political or military integration within the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), he said.
</P>
<P>
"The West as a whole, and the leadership of NATO in particular,
is opposed to any form of political or military integration
between the newly independent states -- the republics of the
former USSR, especially when they are initiated by Moscow," a
report by the Interfax news agency quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
No one could say that Russia and NATO were approaching each
other on the issue of eastward expansion, Yastrzhembsky added.
</P>
<P>
Solana started his four-nation tour to Moldova, Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan on Monday. He denied claims of a hidden
agenda and said that he was visiting these countries because they
were part of NATO's Partnership for Peace program designed to
forge closer ties between the alliance and its former enemies in
the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
During his address to the Georgian parliament, Solana said NATO
would try to help guarantee countries including Georgia a seat in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Russian leadership's out-of-date views
on NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to
NATO's plans since they were announced in Janury 1994. The
alliance wants to take in former Warsaw Pact member states from
eastern and central Europe, but Russia regards the plan as a
threat to its own security.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Secretary of the Russian Security Council, Ivan
Rybkin, warned that his country would have to take retaliatory
measures if NATO insisted on its plans for expanding into Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the expansion would result in great changes in the
political situation within Russia and seriously threaten the
country's democratic reform process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dmitry Ryurikov, Yeltsin's top foreign policy
adviser, pointed out that Solana's tour was a signal to the four
CIS member states that NATO's door was open to them.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Urgent Food Aid for DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program has
launched an urgent appeal for 41.6 million U.S. dollars in
emergency food aid for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
to help 1.73 million people facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Rome-based United Nations food aid agency, the
appeal is aimed at securing 100,000 metric tons of food as well as
contributions to cover the cost of transport and monitoring
distribution.
</P>
<P>
"Currently people in the DPRK are receiving as little as
100-150 grams of food a day -- about one quarter of the minimum
recommended ration -- through the ration system," said Namanga
Ngongi, WFP deputy executive director.
</P>
<P>
The food supply situation in the country has reached a critical
stage, with only half of the 5.4 million tons of cereal needed for
this year and coping mechanisms such as cash savings, livestock
herds, and wild edible plants increasingly strained.
</P>
<P>
The WFP food aid, only a fraction of total food requirements,
will go to those who are in urgent need. It will benefit 630,000
children, representing 30 percent of under-fives in the country,
for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 farmers and 850,000 dependents will receive
food for 160 workdays as part of a "food for work" program to
rehabilitate agricultural land afflicted by devastating floods in
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The floods left half a million people homeless and destroyed or
badly damaged some 400,000 hectares of crop land, causing a total
loss of two million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
The WFP "food for work" program is also aimed at helping rebuild
irrigation systems and embankments and support watershed
management schemes to mitigate the effects of future floods.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed talks between the Peruvian government and Tupac Amaru
guerrillas saying it was "a positive step" towards a peaceful
solution to the Lima hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We view this as a positive step forward because we think
there's a premium on getting to a peaceful solution of this
problem," said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
"We think that these kinds of meetings are necessary to build
momentum for a peaceful solution," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian government negotiator Domingo Palermo held
"preliminary conversations" on Tuesday with Rolly Rojas, a
spokesman for Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels who
have been holding 72 hostages in the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima for 57 days.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are demanding the release of some 400 jailed
guerrilla members.
</P>
<P>
Burns said Washington was heartened that Peruvian President
Albert Fujimori had agreed to talks during a visit to Washington
last week.
</P>
<P>
But Burns also said that the United States does not believe
that concessions should be made to the rebels.

BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai gem dealers have lost out
to Malaysian and Singaporean rivals for mining in gem-rich Pailin

</P>
<P>
Traders from Bo Rai district, Trat province, eastern Thailand,
said concession requests were rejected by Cambodian authorities
because they offered 30,000-60,000 baht (1200-2400 US dollars) per
rai (0.16 hectare) while the Malaysians and Singaporeans offered
100,000 baht (4,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
They said gem trading in Bo Rai has slumped due to scarcity of
gems and unavailability of concessions for new areas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Drops Action Against Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has dropped its
complaint against Hungary in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
over Hungarian farm subsidies, according to a senior official
here.
</P>
<P>
However, other countries including Australia, New Zealand,
Argentina and the United States are continuing with the action
under the WTO's dispute-settlement procedure.
</P>
<P>
Those four countries will ask the WTO to set up a panel to
review Hungary's agricultural export subsidies. Last May, Thailand
joined those countries along with Canada and Japan to seek
consultations with Hungary, as it appeared that Hungary was
spending more on export subsidies than it had committed under the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
Hungary made a commitment to subsidize its farm exports by 168
million US dollars in 1995, and 157.6 million dollars in 1996.
However, its actual subsidy payments totaled 280 million dollars
in 1995, and 328 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country also granted subsidies to 700 items, far more than
the 16 it had listed in its commitment.
</P>
<P>
Karun Kittistaporn, director-general of the Business Economics
Department, was quoted today by local press as saying that
Thailand decided not to pursue the complaint with the other
countries because the impact on the country from the Hungarian
subsidies was small.
</P>
<P>
He said most Thai farm exports do not compete with Hungarian
products in the same markets.

<HEADLINE> International Pact Affects Thai-Made Products: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's participation in
the International Technology Agreement (ITA) will affect 188 items
of Thai-made information technology products, Finance Minister
Amnuay Viravan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement is necessary to promote technological
transformation in Thailand and it would increase Thailand's
competitive potential in the export market, Amnuay was quoted
today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ITA calls for participating countries to eliminate tariffs
on a wide range of information technology products by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said the goods affected would be divided into two
groups, with 151 imported items having tariffs reduced to zero by
2000. The remaining 37 items would have tariffs reduced to zero by
2005 in order to give local producers more time to make
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Thailand had asked the World Trade Organization to
put six items of its products, such as answering machines and
fiber-optics on a sensitive list, meaning tariffs would remain
until 2007.
</P>
<P>
However, Thai government officials and manufacturers have since
agreed that a 2005 deadline was feasible for the six items in
question.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will begin producing fiber-optic products this year.
Fiber-optic imports are now subject to 5 percent duty.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's coffee
production dropped 40.6 percent to 4.4 million sacks during the
1996-97 season, the National Federation of Coffee Growers said.
</P>
<P>
The 4.4 million sacks, each containing 60 kilograms of coffee
beans harvested during the last season from October to January,
were a slump from the 7.5 million sacks of the last season.
</P>

Harsh winter struck the country during the first months of 1996
should be blamed for the plunge, said a report by the federation.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in yield was reported last January, when
production fell 62.6 percent to 778,000 sacks compared with the
2.1 million sacks in the same month of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, exports between October and November reached 4.2
millions sacks, representing a sharp increase from the 103,000
sacks of the same months in the previous year.
</P>

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The 12th ASEAN-EU
Ministerial Meeting opened here today with an aim to push forward
the 20-year-old relationship between Southeast Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
At their two-day meeting, foreign ministers from the seven
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and 15 EU (European
Union) countries will "review the ASEAN-EU dialogue relationship
and set future directions for the ASEAN-EU dialogue," the Foreign
Ministry of Singapore, the host, said in a press statement issued
on the eve of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN-EU dialogue is important for both strategic and
economic reasons," Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said in
a recent interview with the press. "We are working hard to ensure
that the 12th AEMM in Singapore will give an added impetus to the
relationship."
</P>
<P>
The two regional groupings have built up an extensive network
of commercial, economic and political relations since 1977 when
their ties were formalized as the EC became an ASEAN dialogue
partner and was invited to attend the First ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, the two organizations decided to open
negotiations for a cooperation agreement, which was signed in 1980
and is still in force today, having been amended to include Brunei
Darussalam in 1985. And according to the program of the coming
12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting, the accord will be further
amended to include Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam while the EU has as
its members Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a review of the ties between the two organizations,
the 12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting (AEMM) is also expected to
discuss issues such as economic relations, political issues,
development cooperation and other people-to-people activities
before adopting a joint declaration, which a Singapore Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman said "can be expected to put in place a
framework that will guide relations into the next century."

BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 readers of
the "China Youth Daily" have turned in questionnaires in response
to a public opinion poll concerning Chinese young people's

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Valley Is Another Birth Place of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologiests have
concluded that the Yangtze River valley is another area of origin
of the Chinese civilization, in addition to the Yellow River
valley region.
</P>
<P>
They announced the theory after studying a series of finds made
over the past several years along the Yangtze, China's longest
river. These discoveries include ancient cities of the Xia
Dynasty, ancient city walls, tombs and other historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sites are more than 5,000 years old, dating back to
the New Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies show that the Chinese civilization was born in
the Yellow River valley. Some archeologists were skeptical about
this, saying there was little hard evidence to back up the theory.
</P>
<P>
Many of the new finds were unearthed in the process of China's
modernization drive, which has recently been focused on the
Yangtze valley. Extensive archeological work has been done in the
Three Gorges reservoir area over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Big rivers have been proved to be the birthplaces of almost all
the oldest civilizations in the world.

<HEADLINE> SOA Studies Environment of Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A second national survey on
the basic environmental quality of China's oceans is under way,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the State Oceanic Administration (SOA)'s
information office in Beijing as saying that the survey is
expected to be completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey results will become the foundation for the State to
draft policies to abate the deteriorating oceanic environment in
the next century, said the office.
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, the country's economy has developed
rapidly and thriving coastal areas have seen more exploitation of
oceans.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of attention paid to oceanic environmental
conservation and a delay in protective measures, the office said,
the oceanic environment has been undergoing pressure from a
prospering ocean economy.
</P>
<P>
SOA statistics show there are 217 major sources of waste water
dumping on the coast.
</P>
<P>
Some 8.6 billion tons of untreated waste water annually flows
into the sea from these outlets, carrying 1.46 million tons of
harmful pollutants such as petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1992, 300 red tides resulting from sea water
that is too nutrient-rich and rapid reproduction of algae have
occurred.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem said today that he will receive ousted Ecuadoran
President Abdala Bucaram as his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Menem said that as far as the Argentine government is
concerned, Bucaram continues to be the Ecuadoran president because
of the procedures that were followed in that country.
</P>
<P>
In a brief dialogue with reporters at the government palace,
the Argentine president confirmed that he will meet Bucaram
tomorrow at the palace or his official Olivos residence.
</P>
<P>
Menem said he had ordered Maria Ester Bondanza, Argentina's
ambassadress to Ecuador, not to attend the inauguration of Deputy
Fabian Alarcon for becoming Ecuador's interim president.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he felt Alarcon, Ecuador's top legislator,
was elected by Congress on Tuesday in an unconstitutional way.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, who was voted out by Congress last week on the the
grounds of his alleged "mental incapacity," is scheduled to arrive
at this Argentine capital tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Commercial, banking and
educational activities were resumed today in Ecuador after a
holiday, a carnival and a government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, or a political turmoil, started with President
Abdala Bucaram's ouster by Congress on the grounds of his "mental
incapacity" last week and turned the country upside down.
</P>
<P>
This morning, private and government school students returned
to classrooms after the holiday decided by authorities to protect
children in view of the recent climate of agitation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Educational activities were forced into a nine-day recess due
to the period of school vacations decreed by the carnival.
</P>
<P>
At the public sector of this small Andean nation, employees
will work normal hours until Friday, and then start nine-hour
working days from February 17 to make up for the time lost.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will also have to work longer hours to
compensate for the time lost.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight U.S. fast-food
restaurants in the city of San Pedro Sula, northern Honduras, were
attacked Tuesday night, wounding at least two policemen and
causing property damage.
</P>
<P>
The attacks occurred in that industrial city almost
simultaneously, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Two grenades exploded near the entrance of "Fridays" packed
with customers at 19:40 hours local time.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, the Burger King, Wendy's and MacDonald's
restaurants located on the Circunvalacion Avenue were also bombed.
</P>
<P>
Authorities asserted that the bombing was done with 40-
millimeter grenades made in the United States. They were similar
to those which exploded last December in several government
offices in that same city.
</P>
<P>
Police searched throughout the outskirts of the city for
those responsible but were unable to find any trace of them.

BRASILIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Vice President Marco
Maciel expressed his hope that Israel's release of a Brazilian
national earlier today will help the Middle East peace process.

<P>
"I see the liberation of Brazilian citizen Lamia Maruf as a

Maruf was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison in

assassination of Israeli Sgt. Davi Manos.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says He Can't Stop Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said on Wednesday that he can not stop congressmen, even
from his own party, from pushing for changes in the Charter.
</P>
<P>
The president said he could not order them to follow his
personal preference, unlike members of the executive branch whom
he can compel to obey his directives, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He also said there was no need for him to enter into a
gentleman's agreement with anyone because he had already declared
he would step down when his term ends in 1998. The Constitution
forbids Ramos to seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos earlier called for amendment to the Constitution
following the Supreme Court voided a winning bid of a Malaysian
firm for the sale of the historic Manila Hotel.
</P>
<P>
He also vetoed on Wednesday a provision in the 1997 budget,
which sought to restrict the use of funds for any elections or
plebiscites for the purpose of amending the Charter, fueling
opposition fears of a plot to keep Ramos in power beyond 1998.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada highly criticized Ramos the same
day for his calling for Charter change, saying that nobody is
above the law, "not even the President or myself."
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, who was reportedly the
favorite successor of President Ramos, also said that he was
against moves to rewrite the Constitution. He added that any
amendment would threaten the country's economic progress.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Finland signed

both countries, said Mexico's Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, according to a communique released by the
ministry, was signed by Mexican Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz

<P>
It foresees reductions and exemptions of income taxes in such
matters as dividends, interest payments, royalties, services,
asset sales, capital gains and international transport.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will prevent discriminatory treatment of
Mexican and Finnish nationals and will establish mechanisms for
settling disputes arising from the agreement's application.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has already signed 16 similar agreements with other
countries including Germany, Belgium, Canada, Britain, Ecuador,
Spain, the United States, France, Sweden and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Regulations on Floating Population Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The state will promulgate and
draft several national regulations on floating population and
reproductive services for women this year, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Family Planning Commission is also working on a
ministerial principle on family planning among households with a
foreign member.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be taken to rectify circulation of
contraceptives in the country, said Li Honggui, vice-minister of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the commission will continue to integrate family
planning with economic development and rising living standards
this year, education and various medical services for women and
children.
</P>
<P>
This year's goal is to maintain a low population growth and to
ensure the country's sustained economic and social development, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to populous provinces in central and
western China as well as farmers in remote and poor districts.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one million births were registered last year, one
million fewer than expected.
</P>
<P>
The natural population growth rate last year was about 10.5 per
thousand, one per thousand lower than targeted.
</P>
<P>
However, the country still faces challenges, Li said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 80 million to 100 million floating
population across the country, most of whom are of reproductive
age, with many staying away from their hometowns for a very long
time.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of the floating population has become a problem in
the urban areas.

<HEADLINE> China Recruits Civil Servants Through Open Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- All central government
administrative departments must hire all low-ranking civil
servants through open examination and merit appraisal starting
this year, today's China's Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The old method of recruitment, under which staff are mostly
appointed or transferred by order of a superior office, should be
abolished, Zhang Xuezhong, vice minister of personnel, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will make the exams more systematic and
standard in content, subject, and timetable, as well as improving
the quality of examiners in charge of oral exams.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, he noted, the Ministry of Personnel
will have set up a complete system for recruiting civil servants,
such as examination laws, classification, appraisal, and
management.
</P>
<P>
To ensure recruitment is fair and objective, a supervisory
system, including inspectors checking procedures governing oral
and written exams and physical checkups, should also be
established as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The new recruitment method will extend to all departments step
by step in the near future, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
China started the practice of screening new government
employees through open exams in 1994, with a number of central
government departments taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that central government departments hired nearly
1,000 lower-ranking civil servants through exams in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 202 departments and Party organizations hired 1,752
new staff from 17,339 candidates through open exams.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in
the Chinese mainland, 25 have adopted the new methods to recruit
nearly 6,000 low-ranking civil servants for provincial government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the other five provinces are expected to
practice recruitment through open exams when they finish
restructuring their provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, the internal recruiting exams are
designed to improve the job placement system for discharged
People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers by combining it
with the introduction of a civil servant system.

HAVANA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- French Senate Vice-President

Law that seeks to tighten that blockade is not acceptable to
France.
</P>

Cubans need to eat and to continue receiving medical treatment,
education and training and do not need any transition whatsoever.

<P>
He underlined that the political system on the island concerns
only the Cuban people.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Says US Should Limit Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States should be
more selective and cautious about committing its troops to peace
missions abroad, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He told a congress hearing that "we have to be very skeptical
in terms of those areas that we are called upon to deploy our
troops" for humanitarian missions or operations which do not
involve vital interests of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be the world's policeman," he added, "We can't
be a prisoner of world events and we may be required to respond to
some cases which do not involve our vital interests."
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who was the only Republican member of President Bill
Clinton's cabinet, was speaking before the House of
Representatives National Security Committee on Clinton's proposed
265 billion U.S. dollars defense budget for the fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been criticized by Republicans in Congress, among
whom Cohen comes from, for overextending the U.S. military in
missions they say have little national security interests.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to draw the distinctions: vital national
security interests; important interests to the United States; and
humanitarian," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that when there is vital interests for his
country, the answer for troops deployment is "yes".
</P>
<P>
"When it's important, we also ought to have very clear,
identifiable goals with the mission clearly identified, with the
right kind of force to go in and to get out," he added.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm very reluctant to recommend deployment of our forces"
for humanitarian purposes, he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the European allies of the U.S. to share
more responsibility in peace keeping in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are promoting a concept called ESDI, the European Security
and Defense Identity," he indicated. "And that is to allow the
Europeans to operate amongst themselves and to solve some of the
problems that are purely European in nature."

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Cancels Some Overseas Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines,
threatened by a pilot strike, is canceling Friday night overseas
flights, airline officials said today.
</P>
<P>
While negotiations were continuing between the airlines
management and the pilots union, the White House said a strike
would have major economic consequences for the nation.
</P>
<P>
The airline pilots' union has set a Friday midnight strike
deadline, and American was preparing by making sure its planes
would not be sitting in other countries if the pilots walked out.
</P>
<P>
The airline has been urging the Clinton administration to
intervene in the matter, but union said it would prefer Clinton
stay out of the dispute over pay and job security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, noting that the issue had huge implications for the
nation, had ordered staff members to study the potential economic
impact of a strike, a possible step toward intervention.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton hoped that negotiators would mediate it rather than
waiting for any outside effort.
</P>
<P>
Airline and union negotiators met through the day. But Ken
Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said, "It is going
slowly and with increasing difficulty."
</P>
<P>
The contract has been argued by the union and the company since
it became amendable in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The union presented a list of new pay proposals for pilots
flying Boeing 737s, 777s and regional jets.
</P>
<P>
The company proposal made a few changes to a tentative contract
rejected last month by a majority of the company's 9,300 pilots.
</P>
<P>
The initial offer was to increase pilot pay by 3 percent on
August 31 and 2 percent on August 31, 1999. Also, pilots would get
options to buy 3 million shares of stock at 10 U.S. dollars below
market price when the contract was signed and 2.75 million shares
at the August 31, 1998, price.
</P>
<P>
The new offer would increase the raise in 1999 to 3 percent,
but drop the options to buy 2.75 million stock shares.
</P>
<P>
Union president Jim Sovich said the offer was a step backward,
offering 43.1 million dollars less than the rejected contract.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Plans to Review Policy towards Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, unhappy about Turkey's relations with some
Islamic states, threatened on Wednesday that the United States
plans to review its policy towards the U.S. NATO ally.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before Congress, Albright said: "Things are going on
there which we do not approve of... in terms of their approaches
in foreign policy." She was apparently referring to the close ties
Turkey maintains with Iran and other countries, blacklisted by the
United States as terrorism-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, suspicious of the
West, has pursued closed ties with Islamic states, including Iran,
since his Refah party came to power last year.
</P>
<P>
Albright, showing her hard-line approach, also demanded that
Turkey remain "a secular state", saying: "The evolution of Turkey
is important to us... It is important for it to continue to be a
secular country."
</P>
<P>
She said she had "made clear" to Erbakan during her visit to
Turkey last July that "Turkey remain a secular state."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the United States, making a U-turn of keeping
criticism private, publicly blasted Ankara for its threatening
of military action against the Cypriot government for its
purchasing Russian anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the United States was alarmed by Turkish
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller's warning that Turkey would block
NATO enlargement if the European Union closes the door to full EU
membership for Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government to Let 10 Bureaus Open in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
announced today that it has permitted ten U.S. media organizations
to open news bureaus in Cuba, with the CNN's Havana bureau to be
the first to open as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said that the administration
decision was in keeping with the policy stated by the president in
October of 1995 of supporting an increased flow of information to
and from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The administration believes that news gathering and
reporting by U.S. news organizations will keep international
attention focused on the situation in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said U.S. permission for Havana bureaus was extended to
The Associated Press and Dow Hones News Services, television
networks CNN, ABC, CBS, Univision, and newspapers The Miami
Herald, Cuba Info, the Chicago Tribune and the Sun-Sentinel of
Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
</P>
<P>
CNN applied to Havana in the summer of 1995 to open a bureau
there and received permission in August 1996. McCurry said the
administration hopes the other organizations will be cleared.

<HEADLINE> Rolls-Royce Signs Tech-Transfer Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A technology transfer agreement
between Rolls-royce and Belliss India was signed today,
Rolls-Royce Company announced.
</P>
<P>
The Tech-transfer agreement means Belliss India will be able to
supply steam turbine power generation packages of up to 30MW in
India.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce Company is one of the world's leading power systems
companies, operating through its aerospace and industrial power
groups.
</P>
<P>
The company has more than 10,000 steam turbines operating
worldwide and is particularly successful in waste-to-energy and
cogeneration schemes.
</P>
<P>
Belliss India which is 40 percent owned by Rolls-Royce, has
supplied more than 1,800 units for both Indian and export
customers.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement will develop both companies' ability to
supply the growing demand for small, independent cogeneration and
captive power schemes.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Indian companies can gain a secure source
of power and have a potential to export into the grid system in a
modern and environmentally friendly process.
</P>
<P>
Richard Buckland, one of the Managing Directors in Rolls-Royce,
said: "The agreement is an important part of the Rolls-Royce
strategy to cover the developing requirement for small power
plants."

<HEADLINE> Albright Endorses Food Assistance to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Wednesday endorsed U.S. food aid to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a House Appropriations subcommittee, Albright
said: "It is important to give some food assistance to North Korea
through the World Food Program because instability in North Korea
is not to anybody's advantage."
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program on Tuesday issued its third
international appeal since the past year to provide a total of
100,000 metric tons of food, valued at 41.6 million U.S. dollars
for relief of grain shortage in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Albright did not say how much aid the United States might
contribute but experts have said Washington was expected to donate
at least 8.425 million dollars; South Korea, about 3 million
dollars, and Japan, about 6 million dollars-- roughly the same as
last year.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has negotiated with Cargill Inc. a Minneapolis-based
grain trader, for importing 500,000 tons of grain, but has not
struck a deal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the
humanitarian assistance would not be linked to the stalled
negotiations between the DPRK and Cargill Inc.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the negotiations had no bearing on a decision
to contribute to the World Food Program effort, he said.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parliament Speaker Says Special Law Puts End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Serbian parliament speaker
Dragan Tomic said Wednesday that parliament's special law which
reinstated opposition victory in local elections had put an end to
the local crisis.
</P>
<P>
The special law, passed by the parliament on Tuesday, finalized
preliminary results of November 17 municipal election in keeping
with the findings of a mission of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno has been leading daily street
protest over the past 11 weeks to demand the recognition of their
victories in the local elections. Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic instructed the government early this month to draft a
special law concerning the reinstatement of opposition victory
which has just been passed by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Tomic told Belgrade State Radio that there was no reason to
continue protests in Serbia and no reason why Belgraders should
not return to work and free the city of problems and difficulties
caused by the protesters blocking the traffic.
</P>
<P>
"This has been more than disturbance of the population, this
has been violence of a special kind, a threat to the people who
think different, there have been slogans and shouts that could
intimidate any peaceful person," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Serbian government decided to reinstate
opposition victory because Milosevic took the view that the
municipal elections are essentially less important than Serbia's
relations with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition demonstrations and Belgrade university
students rallied on Wednesday in the capital city despite the
adoption of the special law recognizing opposition victories in
November 17 municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
They have stated a new demand -- that proceedings be initiated
against those who "beat people and broke into the faculty
building."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders also vowed to continue their daily
protests until their other demands are met -- the freedom of mass
media and democratization in the country.

NEW YORK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a
34-month high against the mark, after dropping sharply during the
New York trading Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A sell-off in the Swiss franc and a surge in the U.S. stock
market also helped boost the dollar, as the Dow Jones industrial
average surged more than 100 points to almost pierce through the
7,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.6940 marks, the
strongest since May 1994, before settling at 1.6846 marks in New
York, up from 1.6766 marks Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Against the Japanese yen the dollar reached an intraday high of
124.45 yen, near its four-year high of 124.70 yen reached last
Friday, before settling in New York at 124.17 yen, up from 123.15
yen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The British pound cost 1.6321 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6369
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most European nations have welcomed the dollar's rise because
it helps European exporters by making their products cheaper in
the U.S. market, according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Representative Meets French Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A representative of Zaire's
Tutsi-led rebels claimed here today that he had had meetings with
French officials in charge of African affairs in Paris.
</P>
<P>
But both the French presidential office and foreign ministry
denied any knowledge about the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Gaetan Kakudji, who is in charge of "foreign and cooperation
affairs" of the rebels, told the Agence France Presse (AFP) that
this was the first time for the rebels to get in contact with
French officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French officials, whose names were not
provided, recommended "the biggest discretion" in talking about
their meetings.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the offensive of the rebels against
government forces would not stop as long as the government of
President Mobutu Sese Seko refuses to hold talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebels were not hostile to either France or
the French interests in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that France is no longer counting on President
Mobutu to put the situation in his country under control, after
the failure of the Zairean government forces to recapture the land
they lost to the rebels in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac Tuesday met with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni, who is believed to be backing the
rebels in their war against Mobutu.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio
Cotti announced today that the Swiss government has formally
agreed to set up a special fund for Nazi Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
The fund would initially comprise the 100 million francs (about
71 million U.S. dollars) set aside on February 5 by three biggest
Swiss banks and further infusions from other branches of the
economy. But he said that the government would not contribute to
the fund until an independent investigation commission of experts
has presented its findings of Switzerland's financial wartime
role.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Cotti also proposed that a foundation broader
than the special fund should be set up before the summer. "By that
time, we should also dispose of the results of the priority
clarifications of the commission of experts chaired by professor
Bergier," Cotti said. "Within the coming months, professor Bergier
will already be submitting the results of his studies on the gold
transactions carried out by the Swiss National Bank, as well as on
Swiss refugee policy."
</P>
<P>
Cotti said that the government had decided to meet with the
board of directors of the Swiss National Bank in order to
thoroughly discuss the questions still pending.
</P>
<P>
The World Jewish Congress hailed the move as a turning point in
relations between the Jewish community and Switzerland. But U.S.
senator Alfonse D'Amato sharply criticized the move, saying that
it was outrageous that the Swiss government should manage a fund
to which it had not contributed.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gets Closer to 7,000 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average shot toward 7,000 today as the stock market rallied into
the close.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said strong earnings report from major technology
companies helped stem the recent profit-taking in that sector. But
there was not any news which could really spur the rebound.
</P>
<P>
The Dow jumped 103.52 points, or 1.5 percent, to 6,961.63. It
was the fifth biggest point-gain ever for the Dow, bringing its
gain for the year to nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Dow moved within 40 points of the 7,000-mark less than four
months after the blue-chip barometer's first close above 6,000.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume increasing to 563.55 million
shares from 480.61 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also rallied over the last two hours of
trading, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list breaking above the
800-mark for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 13.18, or nearly 1.7
percent, to close at 802.77, jumping past 800 a little more than
four months after its first move above 700. The NYSE's composite
index, which is also dominated by larger companies, rose 5.79 to
419.88, padding Tuesday's record high.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.45, or about 2 percent, to
1,358.96, but remains about 30 points shy of a new high.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.86 to
593.10.
</P>
<P>
The advance came without any significant developments on the
economic outlook and despite a weak day in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
A report in the afternoon showing money continued to pour into
mutual funds last month helped cooled down investors' concern
about the market outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's strongest issues included Merck, Boeing, Eastman
Kodak, and United Technologies, which padded Tuesday's 3-point
gain. Oil shares also boosted the Dow, continuing to rebound from
the recent profit-taking in that sector.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Ensure Netanyahu U.S. Stands by Peacemakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Wednesday promised to stand by Middle East
peacemakers as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu headed to
Washington as part of U.S. effort to maintain momentum for an
overall peace settlement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at a House Appropriation subcommittee hearing,
Albright said she will ensure Netanyahu and the other Middle East
leaders due to visit Washington that the United States "will
continue to stand with the peacemakers and against bomb-throwers
in this strategic region."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will be followed to the White House next month by
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the Hebron agreement, signed last month between
Israel and the Palestinians, could open the way to further
progress in the Middle East peace process, including Israel's
relations with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron deal led to withdrawal of most Israeli troops from
the West Bank city, and to recent release of Palestinian women
prisoners from Israel' jail.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will first meet Albright on Thursday morning before
his early afternoon talks with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said Netanyahu, when meeting with Clinton, will
present proposals for resuming peace talks with Syria, including a
possible compromise on the Golan Heights, part of Syrian
territory, captured by Israel during the third Middle East war in
1967.
</P>
<P>
It was said Netanyahu will acknowledge understandings reached
last year between Syria and former Israeli Labor government, but
he will insist Israel is not obligated by them.
</P>
<P>
Israel's previous Labor prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and
Shimon Peres, reportedly had agreed to return the Golan Heights in
exchange for full peace with Syrian.

<HEADLINE> White House Commission Unveil Air Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The White House's
Commission on Aviation Safety and Security today announced 53
recommendations on air-travel safety including setting up systems
against missile attacks on commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
At a White House gathering marking the release of the
commission's report, Vice President Al Gore, Chairman of the
Commission, challenged government and industry to work to cut the
fatal aviation accident rate by 80 percent within a decade.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, meanwhile, announced that National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its technology
will become part of the stepped-up aviation safety effort.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested assigning a federal task force to
develop a plan on protecting civilian flights from surface-to-air
missile attacks and finding ways to keep such missiles out of the
hands of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The new safety measures for air travelers call for modernizing
the U.S. air safety system by 2005, a decade ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The panel apparently has scrapped one of the more expensive
ideas -- that of matching all luggage to travelers -- a proposal
critics say would greatly impact airport functions.
</P>
<P>
The Commission was appointed by Clinton after TWA Flight 800
crashed off Long Island, New York, last July, killing all 230
people aboard. Investigation was still under way to find out what
caused the explosion of the plane shortly after takeoff.

<HEADLINE> German Industry Sees More Benefits than Losses from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Detached over the strengthening
U.S. dollar, the leading German industry and trade federation DIHT
said today that in general, a strong dollar would bring more
benefits than losses for the export-driven German economy.
</P>
<P>
After the "frost for the exports" due to the overvalued mark
two years ago, the current development on the currency markets
amounted to a "comfortable thawing season", the DIHT said.
</P>
<P>
In the current situation, the benefits resulting from cheaper
exports would outweigh the rising costs of imports, the DIHT said.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Association of Chemical Industry also welcomed the
strength of dollar, saying that it would enhance the
competitiveness of Germany's chemical sector in the dollar area.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Association of Wholesale and Foreign Trade,
meanwhile, said that the rising dollar would not exert a dramatic
impact on the country's import and export in the short run.
</P>
<P>
It noted that only about 10 percent of Germany's foreign trade
were traded in dollar.

<HEADLINE> S. African Official on Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said today that his country's
decision to cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan "had been
inevitable".
</P>
<P>
In an interpellation debate in the National Parliament in Cape
Town, Pahad said the government had appointed a special committee
to deal with the future South Africa-Taiwan relations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced last November
that his government would cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan at the
end of 1997 and establish full diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said in its discussions with Taiwan, the committee would
take into account all concerns raised on the importance of ties
with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa's interests would be placed first in all these
discussions," he noted, adding "the decision to cut ties with
Taiwan had been inevitable".
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the National Party's remarks that party politicking
had influenced the government to severe ties with Taiwan were
untrue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "Reality in the international arena played a
major role in our decision to cut ties with Taiwan."

LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Most major stock markets in
Europe surged ahead and ended sharply higher Wednesday, with

on Wall Street.

British shares on the London market finally erased the day's
losses and closed unchanged at 4,304.3 points on the FTSE 100

gilt prices.

In Frankfurt, German shares had hit a record trading high of
3,228.58 on the DAX-30 index before ending at a new closing high
of 3,216.14, up 28.56 points in response to the dollar's ongoing
strength, which was favorable for German exports.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, share prices ended the session 17.24
points up at 2,599.33, just below the key 2,600-point level,
supported by opening gains on Wall Street and the dollar's
strength.
