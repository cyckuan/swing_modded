<HEADLINE> Clinton Not Offended by Disagreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Denying reports of friction, President Clinton  
said Thursday that ``I will take no offense'' if Vice President Al 
Gore -- or likely Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton for that 
matter -- disagrees with him in the heat of political campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a dreary world indeed if we all agreed on  
everything,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed to be ``frankly bewildered'' by recurring stories  
that he is hurt and angry that Gore has distanced himself on 
questions of Clinton's moral character and ``the wasted time'' of 
the long impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton complimented Gore as the most experienced Democratic  
candidate for president in terms of foreign policy, arms control 
and domestic policy ideas that ``have made America a better 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said, ``I have nothing bad to say'' about former  
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival. But at the same time 
Clinton did not offer any praise, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at a news conference with visiting Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak in the Old Executive Office Building next 
to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the  
Republican presidential nomination, would be marching in step with 
other GOP leaders if he declined to accept federal campaign money 
and the spending limits that go with it. ``The leadership of the 
Republican Party in general are unanimously hostile to campaign 
finance reform,'' the president said. ``They don't believe in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of White House friction have exposed tensions between  
Clinton's and Gore's staffs as the vice president tries to 
establish his political identity for the 2000 race. After a series 
of stories, White House chief of staff John Podesta told Clinton's 
aides to remain silent if they have a problem about Gore's campaign 
or an opinion about his relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been frankly bewildered by those reports ... and I  
honestly do not know what the source of the stories are but they 
are not in my heart or my mind,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising Gore as the only candidate who has stated his views on  
issues, Clinton gave the vice president a pass to express 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want him to get out there, and if he disagrees with a  
decision that I make as president during the next year and a half, 
then of course he will have to say so, and I will take no offense 
at that,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the first lady may have to state publicly where she has  
disagreed privately with him if she runs for the Senate from New 
York. ``That's the way democracy works,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left an opening for Mrs. Clinton to disagree with  
administration-backed Medicare belt-tightening measures that have 
pinched New York teaching hospitals and other health care 
providers. Clinton suggested that New York lawmakers and others 
concerned with the problem should raise their concerns ``because I 
do think that's a legitimate issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, formally beginning his race for the White House, told  
Tennessee reporters last month that there have been many occasions 
when he disagreed with Clinton over the past 6 1/2 years. Clinton said 
that ``I didn't ask Al Gore to become vice president so that he 
would agree with me on everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said of Gore, ``There is nobody in the race who is  
running or who could run who has had as much experience in as many 
different ways. ... No one has had anything like that level of 
experience with that level of positive impact on the people of our 
country.''

<HEADLINE> Actress Sylvia Sidney Dies at 88 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sylvia Sidney, the waiflike star of the 1930s  
who specialized in playing victims and got an Oscar nomination in 
1973 for a comeback role in ``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams,'' died 
Thursday of throat cancer. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sidney made her professional theater debut at 16 and was  
still acting 70 years later, with a brief appearance in the 1988 
hit ``Beetlejuice'' and a small role in ``Mars Attacks'' in 1996. 
She had recently signed a seven-year contract for a recurring role 
on the TV series ``Fantasy Island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After breaking into films in the late '20s, she became one of  
Paramount's top actresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The others, Marlene Dietrich, Claudette Colbert and Carole  
Lombard among them, were tough and sharp-witted -- the way Miss 
Sidney was in person. 
</P>
<P>
	But her film specialty was playing victims: the slum girl  
murdered by her fiance in ``An American Tragedy,'' the nice 
girlfriend of racketeer Gary Cooper in ``City Streets,'' the nice 
girlfriend of Spencer Tracy, falsely accused of murder, in 
``Fury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the directors she worked with were Rouben Mamoulian, in  
``City Streets,'' 1931; Josef von Sternberg, in ``An American 
Tragedy,'' 1931; Alfred Hitchcock in ``Sabotage'' (also called ``A 
Woman Alone''), 1936; William Wyler, in ``Dead End,'' 1937; and 
Fritz Lang in ``Fury,'' 1936, ``You Only Live Once,'' 1937, and 
``You and Me,'' 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	But she tired of being typecast as a victim, referring in an  
interview years later to ``the days when they used to pay me by the 
teardrop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She enjoyed her infrequent comedies, such as ``Merrily We Go to  
Hell,'' 1932, and ``Thirty-Day Princess,'' 1934. And she turned 
away from films more and more, returning to the stage in such 
productions as ``The Gentle People'' in 1939; ``Angel Street'' in 
1941; ``The Fourposter'' in 1951; and ``Enter Laughing'' in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't leave Hollywood because of anybody but myself,'' she  
once said. ``I just got disgusted with myself. I didn't know who I 
was, as an actress or a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her return to the screen was in the 1973 drama ``Summer Wishes,  
Winter Dreams,'' in which she played Joanne Woodward's doomed 
mother. She was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, she won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for an  
Emmy for ``An Early Frost,'' a TV movie in which she played the 
grandmother of an AIDS patient. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Beetlejuice,'' Miss Sidney played a cranky otherworldly  
adviser to a husband and wife who die and must learn the ways of 
the spirit world. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sidney, a descendant of Russian Jews, was born Sophia Kosow  
in New York City on Aug. 8, 1910. She began taking dancing lessons 
at age 10 and was a teen-ager when she made her professional stage 
debut in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	She married three times, to publisher Bennett Cerf, actor Luther  
Adler and publicist Carlton Alsop. All three marriages ended in 
divorce. Jacob Adler, her only child, died in the mid-1980s of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. After he 
fell ill, Miss Sidney became a volunteer for the National ALS 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sidney also was an accomplished needlepoint artist and  
wrote two books on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	She has no survivors. A memorial service was scheduled for Aug.  
9 at the National Arts Club in New York.

<HEADLINE> FAA Investigating Wing-Clipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two American Airlines jets clipped wings on the  
ground at O'Hare International Airport, causing minor damage to the 
planes. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage on one of the Boeing 767s delayed 173 passengers bound  
for Sweden overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened as the Federal Aviation Administration  
began a four-month review of safety and pilot training at American, 
the nation's second-largest airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The review was prompted by six fatal accidents and other serious  
incidents, including the June 1 crash of an American plane in 
Little Rock, Ark., that killed 11 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the accident at O'Hare on Tuesday night  
apparently happened when American Flight 80, bound for Stockholm, 
swiped the wing of another plane as it was taxiing toward the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	The second plane was carrying no passengers and was being driven  
by mechanics who were working on it. It was standing still in an 
authorized ramp area but apparently accidentally had one wing 
protruding into the taxiway that Flight 80 was using.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: World Economy Growing Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite the recovery of most financial  
markets and clear signs of stability in Asia, the world economy is 
still growing slowly and the poorest countries continue to suffer 
the most, according to a U.N. report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Japan still in recession, economic growth in North America  
and Europe have kept the world economy going, though overall world 
growth is only expected to be 2 percent in 1999, said Nitin Desai, 
U.N. undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown has essentially stopped signs of growth that were  
evident in the first half of the 1990s in sub-Saharan Africa and 
some of the growth in the so-called transition economies of Eastern 
Europe, he told a press conference to launch ``The World Economy in 
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, economic growth this year in developing nations is on  
track to be lower than any year this decade, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggest that a per capita growth rate of about 3  
percent a year needs to be sustained to allow progress in raising 
living standards and reducing poverty. Only 13 developing countries 
are forecast to meet that benchmark in 1999, compared to 39 
countries in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And 32 countries are forecast to see per capita output fall in  
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial crises of the past two years, and ensuing  
economic slowdowns, have dealt a stunning blow to world development 
prospects,'' Desai said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were ``clear signs of recovery in Asia,'' Desai said. But  
weakness was registered in Latin American and the former Soviet 
republics known as Commonwealth of Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth rate in developing countries is expected to be 2.5  
percent this year compared to 1.7 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding China and India, which didn't experience a  
slowdown this year, ``the picture looks extremely bleak,'' for 
developing countries, Desai told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The transition economies have lost their momentum after  
achieving an average growth rate of 2.4 percent in 1997, the report 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	World growth, expected to be 2 percent in 1999, was 1.9 percent  
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The report follows an appeal from Secretary-General Kofi Annan  
to the world's industrialized powers to shore up international 
financial structures and take greater account of the needs of the 
world's poor.

<HEADLINE> Starr Turns Attention Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Whitewater officially over, Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr is trying to wrap up two other parts of his 
investigation -- the White House travel office firings and 
accusations by presidential accuser Kathleen Willey, according to 
legal sources familiar with the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr ended his nearly five-year Whitewater probe Wednesday by  
obtaining a pair of guilty pleas from presidential friend Webster 
Hubbell, who was sentenced to a year's probation by U.S. District 
Judge James Robertson, a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. Clinton considering a Senate bid and no longer facing  
a possible court appearance at Hubbell's now-scuttled August trial, 
supporters of the president and first lady cheered the end of 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr has finally acknowledged after all this time and all  
this money that there was never anything there in Whitewater, 
despite Republican accusations and innuendo over the last five 
years,'' former White House special counsel Lanny Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr now turns his attention elsewhere. Legal sources familiar  
with the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
his office was dealing with: 
</P>
<P>
	--The 1993 purge of the White House travel office and whether  
Mrs. Clinton directed the firings. She says she did not. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nathan Landow, a Maryland developer and Democratic Party  
contributor. A recently released FBI polygraph report says Kathleen 
Willey, who has accused Clinton of groping her at the White House, 
has alleged that Landow suggested possible testimony she could give 
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. Landow denies any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	A defiant Hubbell, the former No. 3 official at the Justice  
Department, insisted Wednesday that ``what I pleaded to has nothing 
to do with Mrs. Clinton,'' even though the broadly worded felony 
charge to which he pleaded guilty accuses him of concealing legal 
work he and the first lady performed on a fraudulent Arkansas land 
project in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In the plea agreement, the single specific listed by Hubbell was  
failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest to federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Robert Ray said in court that ``proof'' at a  
Hubbell trial would have reflected the concealment of work by ``the 
1985-86 billing partner,'' a reference to Mrs. Clinton. Starr 
underscored that later, issuing a written statement saying the 
wide-ranging charge to which Hubbell pleaded guilty concerned his 
and ``Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationship'' with a real estate 
project. Federal regulators say it was riddled with sham 
transactions and fictitious land sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to  
pay income tax in a deal that also dropped tax charges against his 
wife, his accountant and his tax attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``After five years, it's over,'' Hubbell said outside the  
federal courthouse. ``The office of independent counsel has finally 
agreed to leave me, my family and my friends alone. And our lives 
can begin again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said the guilty pleas ended the Arkansas phase of his  
investigation that looked at the Clintons' Whitewater real estate 
investment and other business and private dealings. He said he was 
trying to wrap up other aspects in an ``orderly fashion'' but that 
a federal grand jury was still looking into certain allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's efforts have resulted in convictions of 14 people,  
including the Clintons' Whitewater business partners James and 
Susan McDougal and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, and led to 
the president's impeachment by the House last winter on charges 
related to the Monica Lewinsky sex and cover-up scandal. Clinton 
was acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hubbell's sentencing that immediately followed his guilty  
pleas, Starr acknowledged that incessant criticism of his $40 
million investigation played a role in his decision to reach a deal 
with the former associate attorney general. He told the judge that 
the controversy had ``found its way into the hearts and minds of 
prospective jurors'' and could have affected Hubbell's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also cited the end of the independent counsel law, which  
expired Wednesday because Congress did not renew it. Under a 
grandfather clause, Starr can keep investigating.

<HEADLINE> Record Co. Charged in Payola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's largest independent Latin music  
record label has been charged along with two of its executives with 
offenses involving payola, or paying radio stations to play certain 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged Fonovisa promotion chief  
Jesus Gilberto Moreno with making improper payments for radio play. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonovisa president Guillermo Santiso was charged with a  
payola-related tax violation, and the record label was charged with 
a tax offense for allegedly falsely reporting promotional expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits radio stations from taking money to play  
specific songs without disclosing the payment to listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman and attorneys for the record company had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, Moreno paid $2,000 to a program director to have  
Fonovisa records added to the station's play list, court records 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges come after a two-year investigation of Fonovisa,  
which is owned by Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa and ruled 
Spanish-language airwaves in 1997 with hits from such artists as 
Enrique Iglesias and Marco Antonio Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	The label was accused of making illegal payments to radio  
stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Televisa said last year that it reported the alleged  
illegal activities to the U.S. government and cooperated with the 
investigation.

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Thirty years ago, when the Trinity Baptist  
Church was destroyed by arson, members say the front lawn got so 
hot that snakes slithered out of the ground to escape. Grounds once 
graced by oaks, magnolias and dogwoods were strewn with ash. Only a 
solitary purple plum tree was left standing. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Sunday, congregants gathered on that lawn to plant a  
second purple plum. Black and white as before, they prayed, giving 
thanks that their church, one of the first integrated congregations 
in Lexington, has survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to remember that God hasn't called on us to quit,  
but to keep going,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Jay Robison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedric Boaz, a deacon who is black, said in prayer: ``I thank  
you for the ground that Trinity has stood on: for breaking the 
segregation barrier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sharyn Dowd: ``We thank you that Trinity was a church that  
scared people and made them mad.'' Dowd, a white church member and 
former professor at Lexington Theological Seminary, was about to 
begin a job at Baylor University in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The firebombing that destroyed Trinity's modern, A-frame  
sanctuary and an attached educational wing early on the morning of 
June 14, 1969, has never been solved. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the civil rights movement was cresting and tensions  
were high. Many congregants believe Trinity was attacked because it 
was integrated. Some believe whites burned the church, others think 
blacks. Some believe the blaze was retaliation for the outspoken 
views of the church's pastor, the late Rev. Bob Brown, on the need 
for church-state separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Church members agree that, whatever the arsonist's identity and  
motive, what's most important is that the act of terror did not 
close the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Whites and blacks, men and women, sit on Trinity's board of  
deacons. The church's youth minister, Chuck Fletcher, is black. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city with a 12 percent black population, Robison estimates  
that 20 percent of his congregation is black, with a handful of 
Hispanic members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most truly integrated church I know of,'' said Tony  
Curtsinger, a former member who gave the invocation at the June 13 
commemoration service. ``I think you'd find that in the majority of 
churches we have a tendency to segregate ourselves, not only by 
color, but by money and other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Eileen Lindner, editor of the Yearbook of American and  
Canadian Churches, says no good data are available on how racially 
integrated U.S. churches are, but anecdotal evidence indicates the 
typical Sunday service ``remains a highly segregated hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity, started in 1947, developed a progressive identity under  
Brown, who led the church from 1958 until his death in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity reached out with programs for the poor and the  
handicapped. Brown held summertime ``Come as You Are -- Sit in Your 
Car'' services in a shopping center parking lot. He spread his 
liberal religious and political views on radio and television and 
was active in state educational politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Kentucky never experienced the civil rights-era turmoil  
that rocked states like Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas, 
Lexington was as segregated as any Deep South city. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in the mid-1960s, ``Brother Bob'' decided to try to  
change that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just felt it was the Lord's will,'' Brown's widow, Helen  
Brown, said. ``He was before his time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church was burned shortly after Brown began advocating a bus  
ministry to transport black residents who wanted to attend Trinity 
services but did not own cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the way the building exploded, ignited by a  
Molotov cocktail, indicated a carefully planned attack, with at 
least one person spreading flammable materials inside the church 
before setting it afire. 
</P>
<P>
	Though some in the black community were angry over Brown's  
attempt to attract black worshippers, Mrs. Brown believes Trinity 
was burned by white anti-integrationists. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the fire became a rallying point for church members.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a disaster, but we came out of it stronger,'' Mrs.  
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members who spoke at the anniversary service agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was a new Christian, and I got a lesson about what the  
church was,'' said one. It was ``the people standing on the hill 
that morning (after the fire)'' 
</P>
<P>
	Services continued at a school for two years while Trinity  
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown proceeded with his bus ministry. In the early 1970s, the  
church would sometimes bring in more than 300 Sunday worshippers 
from Lexington's East End. 
</P>
<P>
	Boaz, now 33, rode the Trinity buses as a child. He said Brown  
guided the congregation toward integration. ``The church willingly

	Today, though Trinity remains part of the Southern Baptist  
Convention, the congregation and its leaders say they are dismayed 
by the convention's steady rightward shift over the last two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Robison, pastor for less than a year, was asked whether he  
considers Trinity outside the Baptist mainstream. ``We're in 
another ocean,'' he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to revive the spirit Trinity enjoyed in its heyday.  
With Fletcher, he attends meetings of Lexington's Black Church 
Coalition. He is tinkering with the service liturgy and music, 
trying to make them more appealing across racial and cultural 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``For folks who are un-churched, I think they can say, `You  
Christians say God created everyone, and yet there's not 
inclusivity there,''' Robison said. ``We can say, `At least we're 
striving.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Spain, led by Alberto Herreros' 28 points, upset  
Lithuania 74-72 Thursday, earning a semifinal berth against France 
in the European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	France, sparked by late heroics from Laurent Foirest, reached  
the final four with a 66-63 victory over Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlado Scepanovic came off the bench to score 17 points as  
two-time defending champion Yugoslavia beat Germany 78-68 to set up 
a semifinal game against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Myers scored 22 points and forward Gregor Fucka added  
19, leading Italy past Russia 102-79. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching the semifinals, Italy, France and Spain also  
qualified for next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, silver medalists at last year's worlds, Germany, Turkey  
and Lithuania can still qualify for the Olympics in playoffs among 
losing quarterfinalists. Germany will play Russia, while Turkey 
will meet Lithuania, and the winners will qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams, plus Yugoslavia, qualify for the Olympics.  
Yugoslavia qualified by winning the World Championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis in early foul trouble,  
Spain led in a close game. Sabonis got his fourth foul with 16:44 
left. He returned seven minutes later, but fouled out seconds 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain led by 10 with less than five minutes remaining, but  
3-point goals by Sarunas Jasikevicius and Arturas Karnisovas cut 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With 18 seconds remaining, Karnisovas nailed another 3, tying  
the score 72-72. Alberto Anguilo hit two free throws with 11.1 
seconds left. With time running out, Jasikevicius, who led 
Lithuania with 22 points, missed a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Karnisovas had 17 points, while Sabonis had only three and three  
rebounds in 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's defense, anchored by Vlade Divac, limited Germany's  
Dirk Nowitzki to 11 points. Drazan Tomic, who scored a 
tournament-high 32 points in Germany's victory over Croatia, was 
held to four. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Femerling led Germany with 13 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Italy, silver medalist behind Yugoslavia at the Europeans two  
years ago, overwhelmed Russia with tough defense and good outside 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasily Karassev led Russia with 22 points, hitting 5-of-7 from  
3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	France trailed Turkey most of the game until Foirest hit a  
3-pointer with 1:02 left for a 61-59 lead. He then converted a 
Turkish turnover for another basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederic Weis, the French center drafted by the New York Knicks,  
played less than four minutes and missed one shot.

<HEADLINE> Video Poker Machines Close in La. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- Jerry Henderson breathed a sad sigh of  
relief as he put his last dollar into a video poker machine at 
Cajun Circus Casino, his favorite stop after work. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sad because he would miss the game, pressing his luck to  
try for a royal flush instead of settling for a lesser hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was relieved that he would no longer spend his nights  
feeding cash into the machines, chancing part of the salary he 
earns from the machine shop down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should be home sleeping,'' Henderson said after an  
unsuccessful night of wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, he will be.  
</P>
<P>
	At 12:01 a.m. today, 4,874 of the state's 15,000 video poker  
machines were shut down simultaneously in 33 parishes, including 
the 50 devices at the Cajun Circus truck stop. They were turned off 
by a computer program at Louisiana State Police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the largest shutdowns of legalized gambling in the nation  
came more than two years after voters in the parishes approved a 
referendum to turn off the machines. Thirty-one parishes voted to 
keep video poker. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's it. That's the end of gaming,'' said Andrew Flood,  
director of gaming at Cajun Circus. ``I'm feeling a bit sad. There 
was a lot of work that went into building this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Machines in riverboat casinos in and around New Orleans,  
Shreveport, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles were not affected. Video 
poker machines also will stay on in the New Orleans French Quarter 
and in bars, racetracks and off-track betting parlors throughout 
the state where video poker remains legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how they can just vote my job out,'' said Kim  
Hammell, a cashier at Lucky Chance in Slidell, where the machines 
were shut down. ``It angers me enough to where I ought to go apply 
for welfare and food stamps. If they don't mind taking my job away, 
why not let them support me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Police estimate that state and local governments will lose  
$72 million a year in taxes from the machines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Gonzales, taxes from video poker has helped pay for a  
retirement home, a new town hall and new police cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Video poker operators had worked hard in recent weeks to keep  
the machines running, filing several lawsuits. But state and 
federal judges refused to overturn the 1996 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislators legalized the machines in 1991, saying video  
poker would help small businesses. The machines went online in the 
summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study by a group of economists found that of the $630  
million bet in the machines in 1998, only $27.5 million was wagered 
by out-of-state residents. Critics called video poker the ``crack 
cocaine'' of compulsive gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents hailed the shutdown as evidence states can remove  
entrenched forms of gambling. On Wednesday, lawmakers in South 
Carolina, the state with the most video gambling machines, approved 
a bill to let voters decide whether to ban the games.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Germany 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- This one came from the heart.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing at halftime, the United States responded with two goals  
off corner kicks -- by defenders Brandi Chastain and Joy Fawcett, no 
less -- to beat Germany 3-2 in the Women's World Cup quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans advanced to a Fourth of July semifinal at  
Stanford, Calif., against Brazil, which edged Nigeria 4-3 in 
overtime. It will be a rematch of a men's World Cup game at the 
same venue on the same date in 1994, which Brazil won 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the United States and Germany also qualified for the 2000  
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up a late goal in the opening half, the Americans  
responded with a sensational second period in their toughest test 
by far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of how we played for each other and dug deep  
and reached into our heart,'' Fawcett said. ``It's good to know we 
have it in ourselves, and I think we know it. But as long as we 
give it everything on the field, and do it for each other, we're 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before a festive crowd of 54,642 that included late-arriving  
President Clinton and family, the Americans stormed back and wore 
down the Germans. The United States misfired often, but once again 
its precision on corner kicks paid off as the Americans loaded the 
penalty area and converted twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been pretty good on set plays,'' Fawcett said. ``It  
comes from knowing each other so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain made up for an egregious error in the opening minutes  
by volleying in a corner kick to tie it in the 49th minute. Mia 
Hamm, who took a physical beating throughout the game, took the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen very big-time performers make mistakes like that  
and that takes them out of the game,'' coach Tony DiCicco said. 
``Brandi not only played, she got the tying goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who almost never joins the attack -- she had 18 goals in  
140 internationals heading into the World Cup -- was positioned 
perfectly for a side header past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper 
Silke Rottenberg. Shannon MacMillan, who entered the game seconds 
earlier, sent the corner kick ``just where I wanted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Shannon likes to go near post if there is no one in  
front of me,'' Fawcett said. And when the ball glanced off her 
head, Fawcett ``knew it was in. I was in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From there, it was a matter of holding off the dauntless  
Germans, who also lacked accuracy with their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took too many shots at the keeper rather than playing the  
ball back to let the trailing player shoot,'' coach Tina 
Theune-Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Theune-Meyer felt the difference came on the set pieces.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have great timing and position,'' she said of the  
Americans. ``We just needed to wake up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As has been their habit following all four victories thus far,  
the Americans took a victory lap around Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. 
They looked very relieved as they waved to the fans and clapped 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they met Clinton in their locker room and invited him to  
the final on July 10 at the Rose Bowl. Of course, they have to get 
there first. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, runnerup to Norway in the 1995 tournament, also jogged  
around the field at the conclusion and received warm applause for 
its game effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans' penchant for sloppiness early in games became  
downright embarrassing in the fifth minute. Chastain, who late 
would sustain a mile ankle sprain, 
</P>
<P>
	played a loose ball in the penalty area back to goalkeeper  
Briana Scurry. But Scurry wasn't there and the ball skittered into 
the net before she could grasp it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brandi and Bri have been together a number of years,'' DiCicco  
said. ``It was just the tension of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That goal seemed to spark the United States, which had several  
good chances on the flanks. But the American goal came down the 
middle after Michelle Akers' pass went off defender Steffi Jones -- 
who has an American father but was born in Frankfurt -- and into 
space. That space quickly was filled by Tiffeny Milbrett, who fired 
a low right-footed shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	From that goal in the 16th minute, the hosts controlled play for  
about 20 minutes. But the Germans regained their composure and 
struck suddenly for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In injury time, Bettina Wiegmann, the best player on the field  
in the opening half, made a neat move around Cindy Parlow and sent 
a 22-yard rocket into the top left corner of the net. That stunned 
the lively crowd, which grew silent -- except for a German band that 
celebrated the score. 
</P>
<P>
	The band didn't play in the second half, when the United States  
came alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla (Overbeck, the U.S. captain) said that everything we  
done in this lifetime comes down to these 45 minutes,'' co-captain 
Julie Foudy said. ``We had 45 minutes to make a difference. That's 
it and we had to leave everything on the field.''

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Needs Elbow Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reliever Mark Wohlers, trying to find the  
strike zone and resurrect his career with the Cincinnati Reds, has 
torn an elbow ligament and will have reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, will be sidelined for up to 18 months after  
completely tearing the ulnar collateral ligament while throwing a 
pitch in a minor league game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt a burning sensation after the pitch and became concerned  
when the elbow didn't improve in the last few days. A magnetic 
resonance imaging test detected the career-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers was the closer on the Atlanta Braves' World Series  
championship club in 1995, but lost his ability to throw strikes 
last season. He was traded to the Reds for John Hudek on April 16 
and was trying to regain his control and a place in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else can happen to the guy?'' said starter Denny Neagle,  
who was a teammate in Atlanta. ``I feel for him. People say you're 
only given as much as you can handle, but how much can one person 
handle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers struggled to keep his emotions in check Thursday after  
the injury was disclosed. He thought he'd improved during a minor 
league rehabilitation assignment and was close to a callup. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what's so frustrating,'' he said, averting his eyes  
from reporters. ``I had made tremendous strides. I was at a point 
where I was on the mound and feeling good about myself and making 
good pitches and everything was feeling fine emotionally, 
physically and mentally. I felt I was a few appearances away from 
coming up here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've climbed bigger hurdles in my life. It's just another bump  
in the road that I'm just going to have to meet head on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews will replace the torn ligament with one from  
another part of Wohlers' body -- so-called Tommy John surgery. 
Wohlers could begin throwing in four months and is expected to be 
out for 12-18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The positive thing is that Mark's hopefully got a lot of life  
left in his arm,'' Dr. Timothy Kremchek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers hopes the Reds give him the chance to try for a  
comeback. Otherwise, he intends to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't want me, I don't want to play anywhere else,''  
Wohlers said. ``That will just be it. Hopefully, they'll bear with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers' voice wavered as he mentioned the possibility his  
career could be over. General manager Jim Bowden said there were 
tears when the two of them met in his office late Wednesday night 
to discuss the MRI findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I were sharing tears in my office last night,'' Bowden  
said. ``It's a shame because Mark worked so hard to come back. He's 
only 29 years old and the way those surgeries are today, a lot of 
those guys come back. He's made it clear he wants to do it with the 
Reds and I think that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers set a Braves record with 39 saves in 1996 and had 33 the  
following season. He pulled a muscle in his left side early last 
year and lost his control in May. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to Triple-A Richmond twice to try to regain his  
touch, but never found it. Wohlers seemed to be back on track 
during spring training, but started struggling once the season 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Braves tried to send him back to the minors, he  
declined the assignment, prompting the trade to the Reds. The 
Braves agreed to pay Wohlers' $5.2 million salary this season and 
the $800,000 buyout for next year, the last on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	After the trade, Wohlers was put on the disabled list with  
anxiety disorder and tried to work out flaws in his delivery. He 
was pitching for Double-A Chattanooga when he suffered the injury, 
which was initially thought to be tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> Disabled To Earn More, Keep Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beginning Thursday, people with disabilities  
may earn up to $700 per month -- $200 more than the old limit -- 
before losing their federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration estimates the change will  
benefit about 27,000 people and cost $1.2 billion through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first increase in earnings allowed since 1990 and is  
part of the Clinton administration's effort to encourage the 
disabled to work. The Social Security Administration made the 
adjustment through regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Senate just passed legislation giving people  
with disabilities other incentives to work, including the ability 
to keep government health insurance. Similar legislation, which 
President Clinton supports, is pending in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules affect both of the federal government's disability  
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Disability Insurance program aids people of  
all incomes who have worked for at least 10 years before becoming 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, applicants to the program may earn up to  
$700 each month and still qualify, and they may earn that much once 
they are on the program and still keep their benefits. If they 
exceed $700, all benefits cease. 
</P>
<P>
	The program pays an average of $722 per month to 4.7 million  
beneficiaries and 1.6 million members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will affect only the application process for  
Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, which aids poor people with 
disabilities. Applicants may earn up to $700 a month and still 
qualify. But the program, which is based on income, already reduces 
benefits by $1 for every $2 earned above $65, and that will not 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, nearly 400,000 people collecting disability benefits  
work in some way, but many others do not try for fear of losing 
cash and medical benefits, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	The change does not affect workers who are blind. They already  
may earn $1,110 per month -- a figure set in legislation and which 
rises with inflation each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the program, John Trollinger, said that more  
than 3,000 public comments, an unusually higher number, were 
received about the proposed change. Only one person opposed the 
change.

<HEADLINE> Major Exchanges Agree To Coordinate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leaders of the major U.S. stock markets appear  
ready to cooperate with one another, to appease regulators, as they 
move to extend stock trading into the late evening and early 
morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
	At a summit in Wall Street's back yard Wednesday, Securities and  
Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt stressed that all U.S. 
markets should open and close at the same time, despite varying 
proposals from the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock 
Exchange. Levitt said it would be too confusing for investors to 
have different exchanges open different hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our collective goal to maintain the integrity of the  
markets and to protect investors,'' Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading markets also may pick the same date to launch longer  
sessions. That means Nasdaq may have to push back its aggressive 
September time frame to match the NYSE's more conservative target 
of the third quarter next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zarb, head of the National Association of Securities  
Dealers which governs the Nasdaq, indicated he would be willing to 
apply the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We generally agree on the principle that the industry should  
do this in a coordinated way,'' Zarb said. ``It is very likely we 
would aspire to a uniform date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators and stock market officials attending the summit  
formed four working groups to study the effect of extended hours on 
the finance industry and investors. Preliminary recommendations are 
expected within 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For Wall Street firms and employees, the longer hours will be  
nothing short of a revolution. And some workers worry they won't 
have much time for family dinners or tucking the kids into bed. 
</P>
<P>
	With U.S. markets' current hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern  
time, investors on the West Coast get shut out after lunch. Between 
20 percent to 25 percent of online trades by individual investors 
are placed after hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets around the world are moving toward  
round-the-clock trading and electronic trading businesses are 
offering added competition online to the U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending hours is expected to put additional stress on the  
financial service industry, which is currently scrambling to fix 
any potential Year 2000 computer problems and switch next year to 
stock prices quoted in decimals instead of fractions.

<HEADLINE> Nemechek Captures Daytona Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- In better days, they called him  
``Front Row Joe.'' The nickname fits once again for Joe Nemechek, 
who won the pole position for the Pepsi 400 Thursday night, his 
first top qualifying effort in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek took his Chevy around Daytona International Speedway's  
2.5-mile trioval at 194.860 mph early in the qualifying session for 
Saturday's race. It was reminiscent of his successful 1997 season, 
in which Nemechek earned his nickname by winning two poles and 
qualifying second three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek has made 170 Winston Cup starts without a victory. Like  
any driver, he would like to break that string at NASCAR's most 
famous track. Of course, he knows that qualifying and the actual 
race are always different at Daytona, one of two tracks that 
require carburetor restrictor plates to reduce speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's two separate deals,'' Nemechek said. ``You go fast with a  
qualifying package for basically two laps. For racing, you've got 
to get a package where you can hold the pedal down for a whole 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the outside pole will be Ricky Rudd, an owner-driver who  
qualified at 194.574 mph just hours after learning his nine-year 
sponsorship deal with Tide will be terminated after this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess this doesn't hurt anything,'' Rudd said of his effort  
to find a new sponsor. ``It's good advertising. What I'm proud 
about is that I took a pretty bad slap in the face for our team 
effort. The guys on our team are good. We just need time to 
mature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In third was Mark Martin, who qualified at 194.376 mph. Martin  
is seeking his first restrictor-plate victory since 1997 at 
Talladega, when his Ford, helped by an aerodynamic edge, averaged 
188.354 mph in an accident-free race on the circuit's fastest 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like we've got the best shot at a race at  
Daytona that we've ever had,'' said Martin, who has never won a 
main event at the track. ``We've got great horsepower. This is the 
most I've had on any restrictor plate that I can ever remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to Martin will be Chad Little (193.690 mph), with Rusty  
Wallace and Tony Stewart in the third row. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who won the pole and the Daytona 500 in February,  
qualified 11th. Dale Earnhardt was 10th and series points leader 
Dale Jarrett was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll all be chasing Nemechek, who has endured a difficult  
year, falling to 37th in the driver standings and with just one 
top-10 finish over the first half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The successful qualifying coincides with team owner Felix  
Sabates' decision to put team manager Tony Glover back in charge of 
Nemechek's car, after moving Nemechek's former chief, Scott 
Eggleston, onto teammate Sterling Marlin's crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The results showed immediately, with Nemechek's pole coming two  
weeks after Marlin won the pole in Pocono. 
</P>
<P>
	``Felix walked into the shop and said we were going to make some  
changes, some big changes,'' Nemechek said. ``All of the sudden, we 
were swapping crew chiefs. Getting hooked back up with Tony is 
good. At the end of 1997, we ran strong. Tony and I really started 
clicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 fastest qualifiers locked up starting spots in the 43-car  
field, with the rest of the lineup to be set Friday in the final 
round of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers who failed to make the top 25 and will have to  
either try again Friday or stand on their first-day laps were Terry 
Labonte, who was 39th, and Steve Park, last among the 44 who made a 
qualifying attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Wallace also failed to qualify. He had to use an untested  
car after getting into an accident in practice. Wallace was able to 
drive in qualifying, but the car did not survive the accident.

<HEADLINE>  Ryan Ready for Hall Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Saying he's tired of being introduced as  
a future Hall of Famer, Nolan Ryan is looking forward to his 
induction on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said Thursday he'll take about 150 people to the ceremony,  
including more than 100 aboard a special Southwest Airlines flight 
dubbed the ``Nolan Ryan Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing on his long career in the majors, Ryan said he  
regretted never having pitched to Ted Williams or playing on 
Cincinnati's ``Big Red Machine'' of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has plenty of special memories from his time with four  
teams. Ryan won a World Series title with the 1969 New York Mets, 
pitched four no-hitters for the California Angels, commuted from 
home and pitched his fifth no-hitter during nine years with the 
Houston Astros, then reached 5,000 strikeouts and 300 wins during 
five seasons with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan also pitched his sixth and seventh no-hitters while he was  
with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the accomplishments, Ryan's favorites were the seventh  
no-hitter and the 5,000th strikeout, ``because they happened here 
and the way the fans reacted and supported me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who leaves for Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 23, already has  
been given a guided tour of the Hall. He said ``it was a neat 
feeling'' seeing an exhibit of seven caps from his seven 
no-hitters, and said he never really thought about getting into the 
Hall until Don Sutton won his 250th game in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a 300-game winner that didn't make the  
Hall,'' Sutton told Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got me to thinking about how they do view Hall of Famers  
and what criteria that people use when they vote,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan appeared on 98.79 percent of the ballots cast by 10-year  
members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, well above 
the 75 percent needed, 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's tailor has made him a new suit for the induction, but the  
pitcher said he hasn't written an acceptance speech. He said it 
would run ``somewhere between 2 minutes and an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He looks forward to meeting other Hall of Famers, including  
players he faced decades ago. As for fellow Hall inductees George 
Brett and Robin Yount, he called them two of the best hitters he 
ever faced.

<HEADLINE> What-To-Wear Lessons for Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- There were no X-ray thin models, no  
can't-wear-that-in-real-life outfits and no blaring runway music. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a fashion show all the same, staged by the National  
Women's Political Caucus -- a nonpartisan group dedicated to putting 
women in public office and in charge of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aren't there more important issues for politically-minded women  
to tackle? 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had a fashion show, and that's not part of our  
main agenda,'' said Deane Bonner, chairwoman of the NWPC black 
caucus. ``But the point is that you must look the part. We 
understand how important image is to a political campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NWPC held the event Thursday during a convention that also  
features programs on education, diversity, and women's health, 
along with speakers Liz Abzug, daughter of the late congresswoman 
Bella Abzug, and Susan McDougal, the Whitewater figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the caucus said substance wasn't compromised by the  
show of style. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to let women know that the better they feel  
about themselves, the better they're going to present themselves,'' 
said Judith Schotzko, a Republican from Minnesota who ran last year 
for secretary of state. She modeled a pale pink suit with pearls. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was staged in coordination with Nordstrom department  
store. Carolyn Bankston-Gamble, a wardrobe consultant for the 
store, said this was the first Nordstrom show where the focus was 
on campaign attire. 
</P>
<P>
	In the political arena, she said, ``it's presentation,  
presentation, presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caucus President Anita Perez Ferguson said studies have shown  
that voters can make up their minds very quickly about whether they 
will support a candidate based on appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candidates frequently ask about image issues during training  
programs. They don't want to look glamorous,'' she said. ``But they 
want to make sure they're well-received.''

<HEADLINE> U S West To Discuss Qwest Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell phone  
company at the heart of a three-week takeover battle, said Thursday 
it would explore a $34.7 billion offer from Qwest Communications 
International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's decision follows a similar move Monday by Frontier  
Corp., the fifth-largest long-distance company, which is weighing a 
$11.8 billion takeover bid from Denver-based Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, however, both U S West and Frontier have merger  
agreements with Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday Global Crossing gave U S West permission to  
provide information to Qwest so that they can discuss the rival 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sol Trujillo, U S West chairman, president and CEO said in a  
statement, ``The Board remains committed to acting in the best 
interests of U S West shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing and Qwest are building worldwide networks to  
carry high-speed Internet traffic. They are fighting for U S West 
and Frontier in order to secure the customers and sales to drive 
their business plans. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just the latest in a series of recent bidding wars in  
the communications industry. In May, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's 
largest long-distance company, won a bidding war against Comcast 
Corp. for MediaOne, a large cable company. And in Europe, upstart 
Olivetti SpA won a fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of 
Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the aggressive offers is a sea change in technology,  
which is forcing telephone, cable TV and computer companies to 
offer many of the same services. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest chairman and CEO Joseph P. Nacchio said the company hopes  
to begin discussions with U S West as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe a combination of U S West and Qwest will  
significantly benefit the shareholders, customers and employees of 
each of our companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, based in Bermuda, offered $10.9 billion in cash  
and stock for Rochester, N.Y.-based Frontier and about $31 billion 
in stock for U S West. The deal with U S West, however, hangs on 
the success of the Frontier acquisition. If Frontier backs out, it 
could scuttle Global Crossing's plans to buy U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest is the victor, Frontier and U S West would have to pay  
about $1 billion in breakup fees to Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's announcement came after the markets closed. The  
company's stock ended the day unchanged at $58.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where Frontier's shares rose 31 1/4 cents to $58.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Global Crossing's shares fell $2.65 1/4 to $40.

<HEADLINE> Contenders Salute N.H. Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich proclaimed the joys of  
dogsled racing. Pat Buchanan pleaded not to be sent back to 
``Crossfire.'' And Sen. Bob Smith whipped together a Christmas 
jingle, just in case the first-in-the-nation primary comes before 
the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all part of a tribute to the political tradition of the  
state of New Hampshire -- or ``Nuevo Hampshire'' as Vice President 
Al Gore called it Wednesday night at a gala dinner filled with 
presidential hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	The crop of contenders saluted the role New Hampshire -- and its  
voters -- have played in presidential elections in years past, 
keeping in mind that the state's role will be equally important 
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, taking a cue from David Letterman, compiled her  
top 10 ways to woo New Hampshire voters. Among them: ``Claim to 
have invented the New Hampshire primary,'' ``Wear a plaid shirt and 
leave the state'' and ``Change my middle name to 'dubya.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Others described how they have already mastered the art of  
getting up close and personal with the people of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lamar Alexander walked across the state while campaigning  
in 1995, he met a woman on a cigarette break from her job inside a 
shoe factory job. Alexander told her he wanted to be her next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all we need, another president,'' the woman responded,  
blowing smoke onto Alexander's flannel shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, New Hampshire's favorite son, drew laughs for poking fun  
at the possibility that the state's primary may be held in 
December. The New Hampshire governor signed a bill Tuesday which 
would allow the primary to be held this year, in order to stay a 
week ahead of the other states. 
</P>
<P>
	His rendition of ``Twas the Night Before the Primary'' touched  
nearly every candidate with rhymes like: ``Is it Libby or Liddy, 
Elizabeth or Ma'am. It's your last name dear lady that's got you in 
a jam,'' and ``George Junior's left Austin, with endorsements and 
dough, his views on the issue we still do not know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not exempt himself from his own humor, acknowledging  
that his poll numbers show he is ``no sure thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Single digits, no name ID, so say the polls. But there's many  
more Smiths than Bushes and Doles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others engaged in self-mockery as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore used his turn at the stump to point out that the event was  
being held in the taxpayer-financed Ronald Reagan Building. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we can all say 'I paid for this microphone' ... but I'm the  
only one who can say I invented this microphone,'' Gore quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who lost to George Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996,  
begged for mercy from their family members -- who have become his 
new nemeses in the upcoming race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth, don't send me back to 'Crossfire' again,'' Buchanan  
said. ``Ted Turner is getting fed up with this act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the no-show contenders at the event didn't go unscathed  
altogether. Gore opened his shtick by reporting on one of the 
absent, but just recently added, competitors to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orrin Hatch called to say he'd be late, and we should start  
without him,'' Gore said. ``I think we already did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event was held to raise money for the Library and Archives  
of New Hampshire's Political Tradition, which has a collection of 
election campaign papers and paraphernalia from five decades of New 
Hampshire primaries.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils High-Tech Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush unveiled his high-tech  
agenda for Silicon Valley donors today, proposing lower taxes on 
the industry and relaxed immigration regulations to allow 
additional highly skilled workers into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate lavished praise on an  
industry that is enjoying increasing political clout and 
fund-raising power. The GOP front-runner collected about $1.7 
million at fund-raisers heavily attended by high-tech workers in 
San Francisco and here. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry ``speaks to the spirit of America,'' Bush told  
about 500 supporters. ``It not only talks about new technologies 
that shape our lives, but it speaks about daring and enterprise and 
the ultimate American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor embraced federal legislation that would stem  
a flood of lawsuits from Y2K-related computer breakdowns -- ``the 
biggest potential ambulance chase in the millennium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush praised President Clinton for signaling that he will sign  
the bill. But he took a swipe at Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, by suggesting that 
Clinton had dragged his feet before supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this administration, wisdom comes so rarely that we  
should not complain even if it comes too late,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Intel Corp. Chairman Andrew Grove complained  
about the protracted negotiations with the White House over the Y2K 
liability protections, describing Gore's support for the high-tech 
industry as superficial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's reputation is already somewhat tarnished by the Y2K  
issue,'' he said. ``Gore's counting on Silicon Valley very 
strongly, and that matters to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Bush visited Silicon Valley, the Clinton administration  
announced Thursday it will relax overseas exports of some of the 
most powerful computers -- an important issue for the high-tech 
industry and one that its billionaire executives have been actively 
lobbying in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, computer and high-tech industry political  
action committees have favored Republicans by a 2-1 margin. In the 
1996 presidential election, Republicans received $2.1 million from 
the PACs, compared to $1.1 million for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1999, Bush had taken in $86,450 from the  
computer industry as compared to $76,250 for Gore. A second-quarter 
breakdown was not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush stayed Wednesday night at the home of Thomas F. Stephenson,  
a partner in Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that helped 
fund Yahoo! in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a position paper Thursday, he called for freeing the Internet  
from duties and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said after the speech that Bush is  
still considering whether commerce on the Internet should be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called for a permanent federal research and development tax  
credit, something many in this valley have long sought, and a 
reduction in marginal tax rates. He has previously pledged not to 
raise federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed escalating efforts to combat intellectual property  
piracy, and called for lifting the cap on the number of 
high-skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called H-1B 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised he would reduce unspecified regulations ``that  
strangle enterprise,'' and he offered a crowd-pleasing position on 
encryption, one of the thorniest issues facing this region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said U.S. firms should be allowed to sell products overseas  
when those products are available from foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration relaxed export controls on the  
software last year, but some in the industry seek even less 
regulation.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan Confronts New Area Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technically, 212 is just Manhattan's area code.  
</P>
<P>
	But for some who live in New York City's most famous borough,  
those three numbers have become as crucial to their identity as 
Broadway, the Empire State Building and Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The digits silently -- and snobbishly -- suggest where they don't  
live: in the city's four other boroughs. The 212 cachet has even 
entered the online dating business, with some would-be Manhattan 
Lotharios declaring dates from nearby 718 area code to be 
geographically impaired. 
</P>
<P>
	However, starting today, new phone subscribers in Manhattan may  
lose some of their telephone chic. Many new hookups will be 
assigned a new 646 code or the already-used but little-known 917. 
</P>
<P>
	The beloved 212 has been pretty much used up.  
</P>
<P>
	``People do move out of the city,'' Bell Atlantic spokesman John  
Bonomo said in consolation. ``You can ask for a 212 number, and it 
might be available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change means a Manhattanite may have to dial 646 to reach a  
neighbor with an equally fine view of Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Donald Trump, who's planning a $360 million edifice he  
bills as the world's tallest residential skyscraper. It would have 
376 apartments near the United Nations, including 4,500-square-foot 
penthouses with 16-foot ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
	And, potentially, a 646 area code.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why would you want it?'' wonders Trump spokeswoman Norma  
Foerderer. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who cross the area code frontier will have to dial 1. All  
that extra tapping could wreck on a manicure. Maybe there will be a 
black market in 212s. 
</P>
<P>
	Other large cities have added area codes to meet demand: Los  
Angeles has eight, Chicago five and Boston four. 
</P>
<P>
	But 212 has been synonymous with Manhattan since the 1940s, when  
the 10-digit combination kicked in with the modern phone system. 
Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island used to be 212, but 
began their 718 reincarnation 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	New York introduced the 917 code in 1992 for cellular phones and  
pagers in all five boroughs; it's been extended to some Manhattan 
homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Service Commission ordered the new 646 code  
because of the telecommunications overload that brought in fax 
machines, pagers and computer modems. The move ensures enough new 
phone numbers in Manhattan for the next six years. Each area code 
holds up to 7.9 million phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell some of those people in Manhattan to get rid of their fax  
machines,'' suggested Alan Itzkowitz, manager of the Second Helping 
Kosher deli in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was 212 at one point, too,'' he said. The change ``wasn't  
traumatic. My life went on.''

<HEADLINE> Haney Fund-Raising Jury Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the political-money trial of a  
longtime supporter of Vice President Al Gore told jurors to keep at 
it today after the panel sent a note declaring it is hopelessly 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes reaching a unanimous verdict quickly is not easy,''  
Judge Richard Roberts wrote back to the federal jury considering 
the case of Democratic donor Franklin L. Haney. The jury had 
deliberated about four hours before sending the note. Roberts said 
that is not much time to consider a case that took more than a week 
in court, and that the panel should keep working. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution claims Haney was a savvy political fund-raiser  
who tried to mask about $100,000 in illegal political contributions 
in hopes of gaining influence with powerful Democrats. Haney 
recruited dozens of his employees, friends and people he barely 
knew to be straw donors for the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaigns, prosecutor Pamela Huff argued Wednesday, before the jury 
began deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
	The donors wrote checks that were immediately reimbursed by  
Haney in order to get around federal political contribution limits 
of $1,000 per person, Huff said. The donors' checks and related 
paperwork made it appear that the individuals, and not Haney, were 
giving money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney's lawyer, Ted Wells, did not dispute that Haney doled out  
far more than his own individual limit, but said Haney 
misunderstood the campaign regulations and did not try to hide the 
``gifts'' he gave to people who wrote political checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use your common sense,'' Wells told jurors Wednesday. ``If  
somebody thought there was something wrong they'd say, 'Here's the 
(reimbursement) check, don't say anything about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During six days of testimony, federal prosecutors tried to show  
that Haney, a law school graduate who once ran for Congress, was 
very familiar with campaign mechanics and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chattanooga millionaire whose projects include developing  
and leasing property for federal government offices was a 
sophisticated fund-raiser who hoped to wow potential business 
clients with his access to top politicians, including Clinton and 
Gore, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney knew about the political campaign limits, knew it is  
illegal to use straw donors and knew that he was lying to the 
Federal Election Commission, Huff said. Several employees and 
cohorts knew it too, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely clear that he and his employees conspired to  
do this, and they did it,'' Huff said. ``To the tune of $100,000 
they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haney pleaded innocent last November in a case brought as part  
of a Justice Department investigation into unorthodox donations to 
the Clinton-Gore re-election effort in 1996 and other campaigns. He 
faces a maximum sentence of 146 years in federal prison if 
convicted of all counts, although federal sentencing guidelines 
would reduce that to less than 10 years. He has remained free since 
his arrest last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells did not call any witnesses, meaning the jury must decide  
Haney's guilt or innocence based on documents and other evidence 
presented by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was also at the center of a Justice Department  
investigation last year into whether he paid a $1 million reward to 
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign's manager, Peter Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a former top aide to Gore, got the money shortly before  
he took the campaign job. Congressional Republicans issued a report 
in December questioning whether the money was an illegal 
contingency fee for helping get the Federal Communications 
Commission to move to a Haney development in Washington called 
Portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney and Knight both have said the payment represented legal  
fees for Knight's work on several Haney projects over three years. 
Attorney General Janet Reno declined to appoint an independent 
counsel to look at the Knight-Haney matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at Haney's trial, Knight said campaign officials  
did not notice anything amiss in the fund raising that Haney did 
for the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Gore-Bradley Might Be Real Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is threatening to put the GOP  
presidential nomination in the bank with a record-shattering 
fund-raising haul, and Al Gore faces tough a primary battle that 
could leave him financially and politically drained. 
</P>
<P>
	It was supposed to be the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 presidential campaign began with expectations that a  
dozen little-known GOP candidates would wage a bloody battle to 
face the Democratic vice president. Gore, backed by a popular 
president and the White House political machine, chased all but one 
of his Democratic rivals from the race before it began. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months later, Gore holds a wide lead in polls over former  
Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, but his financial edge is ebbing. The 
aura of inevitability is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a winning aura is gathering around Bush, whose lead in  
money, polls and endorsements is expanding every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Bush cash cow is a warning signal to all  
Democrats,'' said Democratic consultant David Axelrod, a Gore ally. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley announced Wednesday that he raised more than $11  
million. Though $7 million shy of Gore, the total virtually 
guarantees that the Hall of Fame basketball player will have the 
resources to compete with Gore deep into the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate reaction was a subtle change of tactic in the Gore  
campaign, which has begun to sharpen its knives for a 
tougher-than-expected primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised Bradley can raise money,'' said Gore adviser  
Kiki Moore. ``But going into the third quarter, things get much 
more difficult with no message and no ideas to propel him beyond 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even President Clinton joined the no-ideas chorus, noting that  
Bradley has said he won't outline his agenda until the fall. ``I 
personally believe you should begin by saying why you want the 
job,'' he said at a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also followed the Gore party line by challenging Bush's  
plans to forgo federal money and not abide by spending caps. He 
said the historic move would put the Texas governor in line with 
Republican congressmen ``unanimously hostile'' to campaign finance 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Already looking ahead to the general election, Bush's aides say  
he may have no choice but to ignore the caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``A candidate coming out of Texas, especially one who people are  
claiming his views are not well known, would not be able to compete 
with a sitting vice president unless he had the resources to do 
so,'' spokesman David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore allies say the vice president will need extra resources to  
compete against Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush is of the same ilk as Newt Gingrich and Lee  
Atwater who specialize in negative advertising,'' Democratic Party 
chairman Joe Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in years, the Democratic Party has more cash  
on hand than debt. Andrew said the party will be in a better 
position than ever before to help its nominee after the primary 
season -- especially if Bush emerges unscathed with a bundle of cash 
and no spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	If that happens, Andrew said the party will be prepared to mount  
an issue advertising campaign to counter what he expects to be an 
expensive Republican ad blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a game of chess,'' he said. ``They're going to have to  
be more careful because they're looking at a revitalized party that 
is able to respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush leads by leaps and bounds in polls of Republican candidates  
after widening his advantage in June with his first campaign swing. 
He startled GOP rivals and Gore supporters Wednesday, announcing a 
fund-raising total of more than $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
	That is nearly 10 times as much as his closest GOP competitor  
and twice as much a Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than George Bush literally falling off the end of the  
earth somewhere in the Andes Mountains, I don't see how you can 
stop him,'' said GOP consultant Rich Galen, who dressed up with a 
little hyperbole the reaction to Bush's first four months in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring spending caps in place since the 1970s would allow Bush  
to compete dollar-for-dollar with Steve Forbes, who is financing 
his GOP campaign out of his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is already airing television ads that have given him a  
modest boost in some state polls, but he is still considered a 
longshot. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bush wins the GOP race, ignoring the spending caps also would  
give him unprecedented freedom to spend money early to prepare for 
the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore says he will abide by the spending caps. If Bradley forces  
him to compete deep into the primary season, he could win the 
nomination but be left in the same position Bob Dole found himself 
after locking up the 1996 GOP race: Broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, unchallenged in the 1996 Democratic primary, used his  
and his party's money to attract mainstream voters well before 
Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Busting the caps gives Bush the opportunity to position  
himself in the race and perhaps position Gore as well,'' Axelrod 
said. ``But I don't think it will be determinative. If nothing 
else, this will spur greater giving and more of a sense of urgency 
about Gore.''

<HEADLINE> Elton Brand's Journey to the NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- With the NBA draft just a few hours away,  
Elton Brand and Ron Artest couldn't sleep. They wandered the 
hallways of their hotel, passing each other countless times as they 
paced. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the old AAU buddies sat down and started talking. They  
reminisced about the old days, when they practiced in the basement 
of the Riverside Church in a gym so small, guys ran into walls on a 
regular basis. They recalled that summer of their junior year in 
high school, when their AAU team went an incredible 64-1. 
</P>
<P>
	And they talked about how far they've come, Artest from a rough  
neighborhood in New York City, Brand from Peekskill, N.Y. Making it 
to the NBA was amazing enough. The thought of playing on the same 
team was just too incredible to even consider. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, well, well, look who's together again.  
</P>
<P>
	``That brought tears to my eyes. When they said Chicago Bulls, I  
thought, `I'm back with Elton again,''' Artest said Thursday, the 
day after he was drafted 16th by the Bulls in the first round. ``I 
just feel right at home. If I've got a problem, I can just talk to 
E.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is being together good for them, Brand said it will be  
good for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know each other's games,'' said Brand, the No. 1 pick.  
``Ron's a great player and he's going to work very hard. He's going 
to push me, and I'm going to push him. We also have Michael Ruffin 
and I know he can play, also. So I think we've got a great start so 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to rebuilding Chicago's shattered dynasty, though,  
everything begins with Brand. As a sophomore at Duke, he averaged 
16.2 points and 9.8 rebounds as the Blue Devils rolled through the 
ACC season to the NCAA championship game. He's 6-foot-8 and 275 
pounds, and his arm span is wider than some small planes. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got the biggest, softest hands general manager Jerry  
Krause has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not all. Brand said there's plenty else he can do  
that he just never got to show at Duke. Like his short-range jumper 
and his perimeter game. His body, too. Though he's already as solid 
as an oak tree, he's never really been on a serious weight lifting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to improve, athletically and  
physically,'' he said. ``I'm very eager to get in here and just get 
started. I'm looking forward to the great experience that's going 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the Bulls. When Michael Jordan retired, Scottie Pippen  
went to Houston and Dennis Rodman left on yet another wild 
adventure, Chicago went from six-time champions to the cellar on an 
express elevator. The Bulls' 13-37 record was third-worst in the 
NBA and the worst in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause was looking for building blocks in this draft, and he got  
a big one in Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be a leader in this league,'' Krause said. ``We  
think he has the special qualities we need, especially at the 
position he's going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is well aware of how big the expectations are for him. All  
he has to do is look around the Bulls' practice facility and see 
those six gold trophies gleaming in the case. Or look up to the 
ceiling and see the championship banners. 
</P>
<P>
	It's kind of like when he first arrived at Duke -- though he said  
he thinks the Bulls have a few more banners than the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down the road there's going to be a lot of pressures with  
fulfilling everyone's expectations of the No. 1 pick. Especially 
coming to a team like the Bulls with the great tradition and 
heritage and championships,'' Brand said. ``It's going to be a lot 
of pressure, but I think I can face that pressure and perform very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``At every level, I've had to face pressure and criticism and  
such, but I always prevailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been an easy road for Brand, either. His mother,  
Daisy, can't remember a summer her son took off. While his friends 
were hanging out at home, Brand was always traveling somewhere for 
a tournament or a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He once played on an AAU team in Albany, N.Y., a two-hour trip  
from his home in Peekskill. That was too far a trip to make for 
practice, so Brand just showed up for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	When he joined the Riverside AAU team, it meant a 45-minute  
train ride each way, and he made the trip at least three or four 
times a week for practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I got the express train, maybe four stops. If not, maybe 20  
stops,'' he said, smiling. ``But it was worth it. Definitely worth 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Clapton Concert Raises Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The concert was billed as Eric Clapton and  
Friends, and for 3 1/2 hours, Clapton, David Sanborn, Sheryl Crow, 
Mary J. Blige and Bob Dylan gave the crowd what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no warm-up band, no fancy set, no special effects  
inside Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, just a half-dozen 
or so musicians on a flat white stage, playing what amounted to a 
pleasing string of greatest hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton played a mix of old and new. At times his music was  
sweet with pure and shimmering notes that dripped from his fingers. 
Other songs washed the audience with waves of anguished riffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He started with songs like ``Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ``Change the  
World,'' ``River of Tears,'' ``Wonderful Tonight,'' ``Tears in 
Heaven,'' and ``Old Love.'' Then 2 1/2 hours into the show, just as 
the crowd was starting to wonder if he might not play it, he let 
rip with his signature ``Layla.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise of the evening was the appearance of Sanborn, who  
hadn't been named as a guest. He was brought on early and played 
through most of the concert, showing that he can do for the sax 
what Clapton can do for the guitar. His masterful skill during a 
rendition of ``Little Wing'' clearly delighted Clapton and Crow. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it was, friends on stage. At times Clapton took center  
stage. Just as often, he stepped back, away from the microphone and 
played his guitar. As Crow quipped, ``It isn't bad having Eric on 
back-up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was not an evening for egos. At various points, Clapton  
shared the microphone with Crow and Dylan. He and Dylan sang 
``Crossroads,'' but not ``All Along the Watchtower. And the entire 
entourage, minus Blige who didn't reappear for the encore, ended 
the show by singing ``Bright Lights, Big City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sold-out concert, with tickets priced from $35 to $250, was  
to raise money for the Crossroads Centre, a residential drug and 
alcohol treatment facility founded in 1997 on the island of Antigua 
by Clapton, who has himself fought drug and alcohol addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert will be shown on cable station VH1 on July 27.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clapton raised more than $5 million for the center by  
auctioning 100 guitars. A spokeswoman for Clapton said she didn't 
have an immediate tally of how much the concert raised.

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Down 0.9 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector expanded for  
the fifth straight month in June, and at a stronger pace than 
expected, according to a survey of corporate purchasing managers 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in new orders at the nation's factories indicated the  
upward trend will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both production and new orders exhibited significant growth  
when compared to May,'' said Norbert J. Ore, head of the National 
Association of Purchasing Management's survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is watched closely because it gives economists --  
including Federal Reserve officials -- the first reading on how the 
manufacturing sector and, in turn, the overall economy, fared in 
the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported  
construction spending fell in May for a second straight month. That 
indicated that one of the economy's strongest sectors is starting 
to slow, in part because mortgage rates have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said spending dropped 0.9 percent in May after  
falling 2 percent in April. Decreases were reported in 
single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and motels as well 
as in big government construction projects, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last 
week. It said 299,000 people filed claims, some 5,000 fewer than in 
the previous week and an indication that the labor market remains 
exceptionally tight. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers report sent the bond market falling and  
pushed the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond up to 6.00 percent 
from late Wednesday's 5.96 as investors feared that the Fed, which 
raised interest rates modestly on Wednesday, might use further 
increases to slow the economy's growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stock market shrugged off the report and the bond  
market's response, and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 81 
points at the 11,052 level in late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' survey indicated that 16 of 20  
industries reported a pickup in business last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group's monthly index of business activity rose to 57  
percent in June from 55.2 percent in May, a much stronger showing 
than the 54.4 percent analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A reading above 50 percent in the index indicates the  
manufacturing economy is expanding. The index has been climbing 
since a prolonged downturn ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Jordan, an economic analyst at Banc One Investment  
Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said the latest report showed 
``manufacturing recovering quite nicely so far'' after a weak 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the trend should continue ``as long as the global  
economy continues to come back'' from the crisis sparked by the 
collapse of Asian currencies in summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, said the report signaled ``there's still a very healthy 
economy ... without any real problems in the pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the purchasing managers surveyed said new orders  
were stronger or remained at May levels, and just 13 percent said 
they were lower. The index for new orders rose to 61.7 percent in 
June -- its highest level in two years -- from 58.9 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog of orders increased for the fourth consecutive  
month, but not as strongly as in May, the report showed. The index 
was 54.5 percent in June versus 55.5 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM said its price index reached 53.5 percent in June,  
rising above the 50 percent mark for the second consecutive month 
and indicating that the cost of raw materials continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The price index had risen to 52.2 percent in May, marking the  
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were paying higher prices for raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM represents executives who buy raw materials and  
supplies for manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Gooden Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Gooden has heard the rumblings about the  
importance of his start Friday night against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	He's heard how it big it supposedly is, and how it could be for  
his spot in the Indians starting rotation or roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, though, isn't concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they do, it's totally out of my control,'' Gooden  
said Thursday. ``I know I can pitch whether it's here of somewhere 
else. It doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden's inconsistency has the Indians on edge, and it has  
placed the right-hander in jeopardy of losing his job as 
Cleveland's No. 5 starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if crucial or critical are the right words,''  
said Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove. ``It's a big start for Doc. 
He needs to pitch well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who will be making his 15th start of the season, is 2-3  
with a 5.91 ERA. Not awful numbers, but he's coming off the 
shortest outing of his major league career -- one-third of an inning 
last Sunday in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing knuckleballer Tom Candiotti earlier this week, the  
Indians are carrying 13 pitchers on their staff. If Gooden doesn't 
pitch well, he could be sent to Triple-A Buffalo, the bullpen, 
traded or released. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden has never pitched in relief during his 15-year career,  
raising the suspicion the Indians could dump him if he doesn't turn 
it around quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an important game for him,'' Hargrove said. ``Will he be  
taken out of the rotation if he stinks? I don't know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden hasn't won since May 18 at Chicago, a span of seven  
starts. He said he doesn't feel any extra pressure to perform well, 
but knows the Indians' patience is wearing thin with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I think it's kind of unfair to say this  
is a big start or a do-or-die start for whatever they have 
planned,'' he said. ``I don't know. They're in charge, so it's up 
to them whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove and Indians pitching coach Phil Regan think the biggest  
reason for Gooden's inconsistency this season has been a lack of 
aggressiveness on the mound. Instead of attacking batters, he's 
letting them dictate their at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Doc at times has given too much credit to the  
hitters,'' Hargrove said. ``I think he's trying to be too careful. 
He has been too tentative. He just has to trust his stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who was bothered by shoulder tendinitis last season,  
agrees -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust my stuff,'' he said. ``It's been a situation of being  
inconsistent. It's been one good game, one bad game. Two bad games, 
one good game. That's the thing that really frustrates me, because 
it's the best my shoulder has felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden's inability to pitch deep into games has been taking its  
toll on the Indians' bullpen. Innings are what a No. 5 starter are 
supposed to provide, not necessarily wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need a 2.00 ERA in that spot,'' Indians general  
manager John Hart said. ``We need someone who is going to pitch 
into the fifth or sixth inning. Doc's stuff is still there.''

<HEADLINE> Emus Are Big Nuisance in NY Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Susan Roos was tooling along in her  
Land Rover when she came over a rise and hit the brakes, startled 
by a bird the size of a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually thought my eyes were bad,'' Ms. Roos said. ``I see  
this giant bird. It must have been 5 feet tall. It's running back 
and forth across the road. The long neck is going up and down like 
crazy. I slow down and stop, and then I realize what I'm seeing is 
actually real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What she was seeing was an emu, and in Pound Ridge such  
encounters are common enough -- and frightening enough -- that the 
Town Council in this well-to-do New York suburb has just doubled 
the loose-emu fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Ms. Roos had any idea she was seeing an emu. She sped  
to the Town Hall and rushed in, shouting, ``There's an ostrich 
loose!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody looks up calmly and sort of nods and says, `Oh, I  
guess there's an emu out again,''' Ms. Roos said. ``What did I 
know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The escaped emus in Pound Ridge apparently are pets. A Buddhist  
retreat keeps some on its property. Some other residents with large 
parcels of land keep emus among their exotics. None would return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ordinance, which went into effect last month, means an  
escaped emu -- or other ``livestock'' -- can cost its owner as much 
as $200. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually our problems are with crowing roosters or horses or  
cows that get loose and wander around on the roads,'' said 
Councilwoman Nancy Jane Woolley. ``We didn't even know we had emus 
until they started getting out, because they don't have to be 
registered or licensed or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emus, which are native to Australia, grow to 5 or 6 feet, weigh  
about 110 pounds and can't fly. In the early '90s their meat was 
proposed as a low-fat alternative to beef, but that market 
collapsed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can give you a real kick, and they can kick behind or in  
front. That's their defense, plus the pecking. They can hurt you. 
But normally they're not going to bother you if you're not 
bothering them,'' said Paul Kupchok, director of the Farm and 
Wildlife center at Green Chimneys in Brewster, where animals are 
used as therapy for troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Chimneys has two emus and turns away others every month or  
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emus were all the rage there for a while,'' Kupchok said. ``It  
seems there's something new every year. Vietnamese pot-bellied 
pigs, miniature horses, emus, llamas. After awhile, people call us, 
hoping we'll take the animal off their hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupchok fears some owners may simply have released their birds.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once they escape, they're not coming back,'' he said. ``Emus  
have no homing instinct.''

<HEADLINE> Ryan Ready for Hall Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Saying he's tired of being introduced as  
a future Hall of Famer, Nolan Ryan is looking forward to his 
induction on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said Thursday he'll take about 150 people to the ceremony,  
including more than 100 aboard a special Southwest Airlines flight 
dubbed the ``Nolan Ryan Express.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscing on his long career in the majors, Ryan said he  
regretted never having pitched to Ted Williams or playing on 
Cincinnati's ``Big Red Machine'' of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has plenty of special memories from his time with four  
teams. Ryan won a World Series title with the 1969 New York Mets, 
pitched four no-hitters for the California Angels, commuted from 
home and pitched his fifth no-hitter during nine years with the 
Houston Astros, then reached 5,000 strikeouts and 300 wins during 
five seasons with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan also pitched his sixth and seventh no-hitters while he was  
with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the accomplishments, Ryan's favorites were the seventh  
no-hitter and the 5,000th strikeout, ``because they happened here 
and the way the fans reacted and supported me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who leaves for Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 23, already has  
been given a guided tour of the Hall. He said ``it was a neat 
feeling'' seeing an exhibit of seven caps from his seven 
no-hitters, and said he never really thought about getting into the 
Hall until Don Sutton won his 250th game in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a 300-game winner that didn't make the  
Hall,'' Sutton told Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got me to thinking about how they do view Hall of Famers  
and what criteria that people use when they vote,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan appeared on 98.79 percent of the ballots cast by 10-year  
members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, well above 
the 75 percent needed, 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's tailor has made him a new suit for the induction, but the  
pitcher said he hasn't written an acceptance speech. He said it 
would run ``somewhere between 2 minutes and an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He looks forward to meeting other Hall of Famers, including  
players he faced decades ago. As for fellow Hall inductees George 
Brett and Robin Yount, he called them two of the best hitters he 
ever faced.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Settles Discrimination Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak announced Thursday that it had agreed  
to settle a race discrimination lawsuit filed by black management 
employees and applicants for management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which requires federal court approval, would  
create an $8 million fund to provide economic relief for the 
employees who sued. The national railroad also agreed to changes in 
its human resources and equal opportunity procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the settlement, Amtrak did not admit to any  
wrongdoing, but agreed to extensive changes in corporate practices 
designed to prevent race discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amtrak is committed to treating all employees fairly,'' Amtrak  
President George Warrington said in a statement. ``Valuing 
diversity is the right thing to do, and it makes good business 
sense for us, our employees and our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lieder, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said that the  
new practices ``will help employees of all races survive and thrive 
at Amtrak well into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Substantial changes would be made in the entire hiring process,  
including the way that positions are posted. In addition, Amtrak 
has created a new position, vice president of business diversity 
and strategic initiatives, and filled the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed last August in the U.S. District Court for  
the District of Columbia, contended Amtrak discriminated against 
blacks in filling management jobs and handling pay, promotion and 
disciplinary issues. It also alleged Amtrak maintained a racially 
hostile work environment.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Center Gets Grant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Performances past and future will benefit from  
$4 million in grants to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts 
and the Library of Congress, made by the Doris Duke Charitable 
Foundation in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Of $3 million for the Kennedy Center, $2 million will go to its  
Millennium Endowment Fund to help organize international festivals. 
The grant is to be matched by other contributors over three years. 
The other $1 million will support festivals dealing this year with 
Africa, next year with Ireland and in 2001 with Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $1 million, it was announced Tuesday, will go to  
the Library of Congress over two years so it can create an archive 
on the work of Martha Graham. She was a leading creator and 
performer of American dance who died in 1991 at age 96. The library 
will buy a collection of her papers concerning her career of more 
than 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The money also will commission the Martha Graham Company to  
reconstruct five of her works for presentation and video 
productions.

<HEADLINE> Women's Sports Getting TV Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Who needs Tim Duncan or Brett Hull? This is the weekend of women  
in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NBA and NHL seasons finished, the Wimbledon women, the  
Women's World Cup and the WNBA are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the All London Club still refuses to pay women equal  
prize money, viewers have been watching them more than the men in 
eight of the last nine tennis majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect that trend to change this year, even with Andre  
Agassi and Pete Sampras advancing deep into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not with American Alexandra Stevenson and 16-year-old Australian  
Jelena Dokic getting most of the attention so far and American 
Lindsay Davenport breezing into the semifinals. There's also a pair 
of World Cup matches on ESPN on Sunday and a WNBA game Saturday 
afternoon on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't have to worry much about the competition -- the X  
Games and some lesser-known golf tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup hasn't enjoyed the same level of success  
on television as it has with attendance, but its TV ratings still 
have been better than for regular-season NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, that's nothing to brag about.  
</P>
<P>
	``Women's sports are still difficult to succeed on weekend  
afternoons because it's so crowded and traditionally it's been the 
man controlling the remote,'' said Rob Correa, vice president of 
programming at CBS. ``You need to grow a core audience with weekday 
cable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, women's sports must be doing something right: They are  
forcing television networks to change their programming. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol has said he will show women's  
basketball, softball and soccer in its entirety at the Sydney 
Olympics. CBS will switch the women's final to the premier time 
slot for the U.S. Open tennis tournament, instead of sandwiching it 
between a pair of men's semifinals as it has done in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	And HBO, in its final year of broadcasting Wimbledon, devoted an  
unprecedented 70 percent of its coverage to women. 
</P>
<P>
	With the sudden exposure and engaging role models such as Anna  
Kournikova, Mia Hamm and Chamique Holdsclaw, girls growing up have 
a different outlook on female athletes nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
	``These girls now want to grow up and be athletes,'' said NBC  
analyst and three-time Wimbledon champion Chris Evert. ``There are 
attractive, appealing girls out there and now they realize that's 
it is OK to run around and sweat and be tough. Twenty years ago it 
was frowned upon and wasn't feminine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But just because women's sports has made it on network  
television doesn't mean it will stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still too early to tell, but women's sports could be the  
next big thing,'' said media buyer Ron Frederick of the J. Walter 
Thompson agency. ``I've been a big skeptic of soccer, but I'm not 
as skeptical about this event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OVERDUE:* It may be a year late, but CBS will finally air the  
first live network prime-time motorsports race. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildfires in Florida spoiled the network's plan to televise  
NASCAR's Pepsi 400 last summer and the race was moved to TNN last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS intends to give it another try on Saturday at 8 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is uncharted territory and we are confident that a

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Hits 30th As Clinton Watches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For Sammy Sosa, it was quite an unusual good-luck  
charm: President Clinton, standing in the owner's box with a 
half-eaten hot dog and a Chicago Cubs cap in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his 30th home run of the season Wednesday shortly after  
the president arrived at Wrigley Field in Chicago to watch Sosa, 
one of his favorite athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings good luck,'' Sosa said of Clinton. ``A big guy like  
that comes to town to see the game -- it doesn't look too good if we 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 on Sosa's solo homer.  
Clinton -- dropping his usual impartiality during sporting events -- 
cheered, waved to fans, gave a thumbs-up and mouthed hellos. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did what everybody else in the entire stadium did,'' said  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The Brewers played well, the 
Cubs played well. But the player the president takes a special 
interest in made the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the timing of Clinton's arrival and Sosa's home  
run was the president's ``latest example of a long-standing 
streak'' of luck. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Cubs general manager Ed Lynch took Clinton to  
the clubhouse to congratulate Sosa. Lockhart said Clinton and Sosa 
hadn't seen each other since Sosa came to the White House in 
January; Clinton had invited Sosa to attend the State of the Union 
address as his guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Sosa chatted for 10 minutes in the locker room and  
for another 10 minutes alone in a nearby room. Sosa gave Clinton a 
blue Cubs jacket and a red Beanie Baby bear with a Cubs emblem on 
the package. The two exchanged autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked whether his wife, Hillary, would allow him to  
keep the Cubs jacket, given her newfound loyalty to the New York 
Yankees. Clinton nodded yes -- after a slow pause. He teasingly 
chastised a reporter who asked whether the first lady was still a 
Cubs fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't play press games here,'' he said, smiling. ``This is  
about sports, not politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president went to Wrigley Field following a speech to pitch  
his new Medicare proposal to senior citizens. He was so excited 
about attending the game that he announced it at the start of his 
speech -- to the annoyance of the Secret Service, which didn't 
exactly want the world to know his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused at a local hotel to change out of his business  
suit and keep tabs on the Northern Ireland peace talks. He spoke 
for about 10 minutes with British Prime Minister Tony Blair to get 
an update, then zipped over to the game, where the score was 4-3 
Brewers in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The president settled in the Cubs' owner's box, looking relaxed  
in a yellow, open-necked shirt and brown blazer. He waved to the 
fans. Some booed, others craned to catch a view of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the seventh inning, Clinton joined in singing  
the traditional baseball anthem, ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' 
Moments later, Sosa knocked the ball over the left field wall and 
Clinton neglected his hot dog long enough to stand and applaud. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa now has reached 30 homers in a season for the sixth time.  
He has homered in four consecutive games, his longest streak since 
last June 3-8.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Retailers Look to Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Angelica Legaspi Lofgren's gut feeling told her  
importing Iranian caviar at the depths of Hong Kong's recession 
would be a tricky venture. 
</P>
<P>
	But she quit her cushy job at Deutsche Bank anyway and bought an  
importing company, Tenderloin Fine Food. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she and her husband are selling the finest oscietra caviar  
-- at $1.20 a gram -- along with Scottish salmon, Australian 
lobsters, corn-fed American beef and gourmet chocolates to Hong 
Kong's well-heeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want to make sure their families are fed well and will  
pay a lot for that,'' Lofgren said, displaying the gung-ho 
swashbuckle that marked her 17 years as a foreign currency trader. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Hong Kong stuck in recession two years after Asia's  
economic crisis hit, sales of fancy food and other luxuries just 
aren't what they were back in the boom times, when people wined and 
dined in a carefree whirl of affluence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people still don't want to be seen eating caviar while  
their friends are having a hard time,'' Lofgren said, picking out 
morsels of imported chocolate in her small shop at a local gourmet 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
	Back when Hong Kong's stock and property markets were surging  
toward what seemed like an endless series of new heights, one 
upscale auto dealer recalls selling six cars -- all Rolls-Royce and 
Bentleys -- to just one customer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three months, Spenser Lam, general sales manager at  
MD Motors, the territory's sole distributor of the handmade English 
luxury models, said he has sold only ``a few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt, Hong Kong has had to cut back on its self-indulgence.  
Unemployment is at a record 6.3 percent. The economy has fallen for 
15 months in a row. And consumer prices have slid the past seven 
months in the spooky phenomenon known as deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	While property values have stabilized, they are down as much as  
50 percent since the crisis swept Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently, pools of cash have been flowing into Hong Kong's  
financial markets from investors betting the economy is ready for a 
rebound. The blue-chip Hang Seng stock index recently hit 14,000, a 
level unseen since October 1997, when Asia's currency crisis was 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge has retailers of high-price, high-status merchandise  
hopeful that Hong Kong residents will soon step up their buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take time before people start spending in the high  
luxury sector,'' said Lam. ``But soon we'll be flying again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast, some economists caution. Whether the rise in blue  
chip stocks is just a brief spurt of optimism or a wider resurgence 
throughout the broader economy is not yet possible to judge, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``That we have bottomed out is a fair point for one reason: We  
are full of capital in Asia,'' said Guonan Ma, an economist with 
Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market's rally has shored up what Ma sees as the  
critical intangible that has eluded Hong Kong for many months: 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But retailers are being hurt by other factors. Cheap goods over  
the border in Shenzhen, China, are tempting more and more Hong Kong 
residents to shop there -- a habit that may cost the territory's 
retailers as much as 20 percent of their earnings this year, Ma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the signs of a fledgling recovery underpin the hopes of  
bullish entrepreneurs like wine importer Paolo Durazzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you're down, the only way to go is up,'' said Durazzo,  
whose 2-year-old company, Casamia, has been breaking even at best. 
</P>
<P>
	At his booth during a recent food fair, Durazzo offered a  
Gramole Barrique 1995 red wine from Tuscany. Many visitors sipped a 
free glass, then looked at the $31 price tag, smiled politely and 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will start buying again ... you'll see,'' Durazzo said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Confront Immigrant Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Laura's husband beat her until her arms  
and legs were black and blue. He pointed a gun at her and 
threatened to kill her. Then he told her if she ever tried to leave 
him, he'd keep their twin babies and have her deported. 
</P>
<P>
	She let the attacks continue for four years.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know the laws here,'' said the 31-year-old woman who  
moved from Veracruz, Mexico, to Texas' Rio Grande Valley as a 
teen-ager but speaks only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura thought if she left her husband, a legal resident, she  
would be sent back to Mexico without her 4-year-old son and 
daughter, both U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Her story is similar to those of hundreds of immigrant women in  
Texas and thousands of others elsewhere, women who stay with 
abusive husbands because they fear being deported and separated 
from their U.S.-born children. Many are not aware that spousal 
abuse is illegal in the United States or don't know how to get 
legal help. 
</P>
<P>
	A new legal project in Texas is designed to help battered  
immigrant women like Laura, who now has an application pending to 
become a legal resident and is living on her own with the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Project organizers are recruiting lawyers to take such cases pro  
bono and teaching them about federal laws designed to stop domestic 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the last few years have immigrant spouses been permitted  
to file their own petitions for legal-resident status. In the past, 
they had to rely on the spouse who was a U.S. citizen or legal 
resident to file on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	In Laura's case, her husband ``used his legal permanent resident  
status to dominate this woman and to control her,'' said her 
lawyer, Ray Gill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill is among about 400 lawyers who have participated in  
training workshops held in 10 Texas cities in the last year on how 
to use the federal Violence Against Women Act of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows an abused wife to file a residency petition on  
her own, as long as she is still married to the U.S. citizen or 
permanent legal resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Oliver, executive director of Texas Lawyers Care, said she  
wanted to jump on the opportunity the new law provided to 
immigrants facing a terrible dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were here because of being married to a U.S. citizen or  
permanent resident and totally dependent upon that person for the 
right to stay,'' she said. ``If they left the batterer, they 
probably would lose their legal status and also lose their kids, or 
have to return to their home country with kids who are U.S. 
citizens and don't have any knowledge of their home country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working with advocates at womens' shelters is crucial, she said,  
because abused women often have no money when they leave their 
husbands and wouldn't think to contact an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	In order to win residency, a woman must be able to document the  
abuse -- with police records, hospital records, affidavits from 
friends. She also has to show that she is of good moral character 
and that she would suffer hardship if deported. 
</P>
<P>
	One Mexican woman in Dallas had no problem documenting abuse.  
When she showed up at Catholic Charities Immigration Counseling 
Services, a worker took pictures of the bruises on her face, neck 
and shoulders. She had affidavits from neighbors and a police 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Susie Hoeller, a lawyer who volunteered to take the case, was  
able to win a green card for the woman, a mother of six who was 
working 60 hours a week for a landscape company. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoeller went through the training because she was sympathetic to  
the plight of such women: ``I thought they had rights that needed 
to be protected.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Mutual Fund Assets Are Down / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $7.06 billion in the latest week to $855.72 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $5.93 billion to $710.83 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $1.13 billion to $144.89 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $19.17  
billion to $572.87 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets fell by $19.18 billion to 
$525.19 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $12.3 million 
to $47.69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.429 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.455 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.35 percent from 4.28 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.31 percent from 4.30 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.44 percent from 4.37  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.40 percent from 4.39 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, down from 58 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts were 2.03 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts also was unchanged at 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.17 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.15 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.49 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.48 
percent; 4.71 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.68 percent; and 
4.89 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.85 percent.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Nomination Faces Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke's marathon nomination to be  
U.N. ambassador is facing new hurdles, even after a unanimous 
endorsement by a Senate committee. But the U.S. diplomat who's been 
standing in for Holbrooke in New York today called the committee 
action ``very good news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations, Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh told  
reporters he remained optimistic that the Senate would confirm the 
nomination by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just have to wait and see,'' he told a news conference.  
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke's supporters in Washington were a little less  
optimistic after new objections to the career's diplomat's 
nomination surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh has served as acting U.N. ambassador since Bill  
Richardson left the post last fall to take over as energy 
secretary. Burleigh has been nominated to be U.S. ambassador to the 
Philippines and the Palau Islands in the western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate approves Holbrooke's nomination, Burleigh said, he  
will remain at the United Nations until the end of August. If the 
Senate doesn't vote immediately, he said, ``I will stay here until 
Dick Holbrooke arrives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said late Wednesday that more senators had signaled 
their intent to block the nomination from coming to a floor vote in 
the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	That is in addition to a ``hold'' put on the nomination by Sen.  
Charles Grassley over an unrelated civil service dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley is protesting a State Department decision to transfer a  
senior staff member from a U.N. office in New York to a lesser post 
in Washington after she informed members of Congress about alleged 
waste and mismanagement within the United Nations. He contends the 
transfer and demotion violated a law that he sponsored protecting 
whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Grassley said the civil servant, Linda  
Shenwick, should be restored to her former job as a budget and 
administrative officer at the U.S. mission to the U.N. in New York. 
But he said he would settle for a ``mutually acceptable'' agreement 
between Ms. Shenwick and the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can work this out by the end of the week if the  
State Department wants to,'' Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department denies that it singled out Ms. Shenwick for  
punishment, but says the matter is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, other senators have come forth and put holds on the  
nomination, Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Grassley, who made his intentions known publicly, these  
senators did so anonymously, which is allowed under Senate 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartacki said he did not know who the senators were or whether  
their concerns were identical to Grassley's. 
</P>
<P>
	But their objections to moving ahead this week with the  
nomination appeared ``irreconcilable.'' Czwartacki did say the 
situation could change quickly.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Say They're Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Canadian airlines said today they  
were 95 percent finished with their Year 2000 computer repairs and 
would be all done by summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration also said that, despite a  
late start, all of its air traffic control computers had been 
repaired and tested by the agency's own June 30 deadline. A public 
declaration of success will come later this month after an 
inspection by government auditors and an outside consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	The news put the focus on two other areas that have yet to give  
a clear picture of their readiness: airports -- both domestic and 
abroad -- and foreign air carriers. Information from those sources 
is trickling in, but it may be months before it filters out to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N.-based  
group, has been collecting airport and airline preparedness data 
from foreign governments. The State Department, which has access to 
the data, may wait until this fall before warning U.S. travelers 
about areas of the world they should avoid early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association, which  
represents 265 international airlines, has been surveying its 
members. But the group's findings will remain private in an effort 
to promote full disclosure by the carriers. Passengers may not know 
which foreign airlines are having problems until later this year, 
when they start canceling flights around the New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000  
Conversion, said at a news conference he was pleased by the 
progress made by U.S. and Canadian airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	As for major U.S. airports, Koskinen said they have ``addressed  
everything from baggage handling to runway lights to gate 
assignments. The focus is increasing on the smaller airports, who 
are addressing it. Fortunately, they have more simplified and 
straightforward systems that take less time to remediate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also sought to play down concerns about the safety of flying  
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a general matter, the issue in flying internationally is  
not safety, it really is a question of congestion and timing,'' he 
said. ``If airports have to revert away from computerized air 
traffic systems, what it will mean is that there will be increased 
spacing between flights (and) some will have to be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K, or Year 2000, problem is glitch that may cause  
computers to malfunction on Jan. 1. Some computer software was 
written to recognize years in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' 
for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	There is uncertainty about what will happen when the year  
changes to 2000, since some computers may misconstrue the ``00'' 
for 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of airline readiness was made by the Aviation  
Millennium Project, a group organized in March 1998 by 102 U.S. and 
Canadian airlines to ensure airline, airport and air traffic 
control readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The group estimates that the airlines will spent over $750  
million solving the problem; worldwide the figure is expected to be 
$2.3 billion. The U.S. and Canadian systems that have been repaired 
and tested to date include everything from computerized 
reservations to crew scheduling and aircraft operating systems.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Files To Run for President </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, officially became  
the latest candidate to enter the Republican presidential race, 
filing a statement of candidacy Thursday with the Federal Election 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	By registering with the FEC, Hatch will be required to regularly  
disclose contributions and expenditures. Like many of the other GOP 
presidential hopefuls, however, Hatch is calling his campaign 
committee an ``exploratory committee.''

<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman announced last month  
that he would enter the presidential race. While acknowledging the 
strength of front-runner George W. Bush, Hatch said he wanted to be 
available in case the Texas governor stumbles.

<P>
	``It's not good to have a juggernaut in the party,'' Hatch said  
in a telephone interview Thursday. ``It's healthy to have some

<HEADLINE> HBO Studies Art and Mentally Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Living Museum,'' a documentary about  
art and the mentally ill, challenges our perceptions about both. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Jessica Yu, an Academy Award winner for her short film,  
``Breathing Lessons,'' takes an admiring but unromanticized look at 
six artist-patients who do their work in a secluded corner of a 
monolithic New York state mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, on HBO at 7:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, July 6, is a film  
infused with the hope and pain of its subjects and the vitality, 
wit and sadness of their creations. 
</P>
<P>
	Their art stands on its own, bold and perceptive and, certainly,  
individualistic. This is not basket-weaving therapy we're talking 
here. The artists, some of whom discovered their talent after 
becoming ill, also evade stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Issa Ibrahim, articulate and handsome and sentenced to  
an indeterminate stay at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens, 
N.Y., for crimes he refers to only obliquely. He draws on history, 
including his own, to create statements on race, freedom and 
deliverance. 
</P>
<P>
	David Waldorf is a skilled painter who crafts delicately  
abstract images with inspiration from Beethoven's music created in 
his later, deaf years. Waldorf finds his own severe episodes of 
illness profoundly inspiring as well. 
</P>
<P>
	On the street, he says, he sees ``these great movements of  
people. Somehow, I feel the very flight of life itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Art is a bridge between the mentally ill and the world, Waldorf  
says. His own pieces provide a kind of Rorschach test for the 
viewer, forced to consider what they are willing to see, or admit 
to seeing, in drawings born of brilliance and instability. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Sadowski, who studied at the Philadelphia College of Art,  
tells a wrenching story of depression, attempted suicide and 
estrangement from family members she says blame her for her 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadowski's paintings, in counterpoint to her chaotic life, rely  
on carefully controlled lines and blocks of pastel color. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her work represents beauty and nothing but beauty ... and that  
works for her,'' Dr. Janos Marton, who helped establish the Living 
Museum at Creedmoor and is its director, says in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Marton, The program is open to any patient at  
Creedmoor and ``is not art therapy, it's just art,'' although it 
can have a therapeutic effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Marton is our guide through the museum and a key part of the  
documentary. His appreciation for his patients' unrestrained 
talents, his gentle regard for their well-being, and his joy in his 
own work are a pleasure to behold. 
</P>
<P>
	So is the film, which takes an unhackneyed approach to its  
subject. There's none of the atonal music often clumsily used to 
``evoke'' mental illness, and the artwork is shot with the same 
care and respect accorded those who created it. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a single visit to the Living Museum for Yu to decide it  
was a place and people worth spending time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I walked in there, I was so overwhelmed by the  
art,'' she said in an interview. ``From the outside, it looks like 
the other buildings at Creedmoor ... but there's a really relaxed 
feeling in the place having to do with the people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a feeling it is their place, and in any institution  
that's a really rare feeling,'' she said. She was also intrigued by 
the artists, especially Waldorf, who tried to explain why he would 
not trade his life for one of normality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to know how this person came to this point,'' Yu  
recalls thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker spent a year filming at the museum, choosing to  
string her visits out gradually over 1997 so that the artists (who 
include both in- and outpatients) could become comfortable with her 
and her crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is that people get a sense of them as people as  
well as residents of Creedmoor,'' Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other profiled artists are John Tursi, John C. Mapp and a woman  
identified as Eileen, the most severely disturbed patient. Although 
Eileen can be disruptive, the other patients generously agreed she 
should be allowed to work with them in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	That spirit of cooperation infuses the art program.  
</P>
<P>
	``Creedmoor is really supportive of the Living Museum and that's  
unusual,'' said Yu. ``Dr. Marton is unusual, the whole existence of 
this place is unusual. You hope other hospitals are inspired to do 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Art shows the ``trial and error'' of life, and therefore belongs  
as much with those inside the hospital as those outside, Marton 
contends. ``I have this true belief that anyone can be an artist.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coroner Rules on Missing Sailors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Briton Glyn Charles and Australian John  
Dean were declared dead by a coroner Friday, six months after they 
were swept away by mountainous seas in the Sydney to Hobart yacht 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the two men were never found, unlike four other  
Australians who died in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	New South Wales state deputy coroner John Abernethy said he was  
satisfied all the sailors had died in the Tasman Sea even though 
the two bodies had not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Abernethy adjourned the inquest for a month-long hearing in  
November. In the meantime he said, tests would be conducted at the 
Australian Maritime College in Launceston to investigate the 
stability of vessels and life rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 115 yachts in the race, 70 boats withdrew because of the  
hurricane-strength winds. Seven boats were abandoned or sank.

<HEADLINE> Time To Name That Olympic Mascot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Organizers of the 2002 Winter Games will  
use the Internet and a toll-free phone line in a national naming 
contest for the three Olympic mascots, a rabbit, coyote and bear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee launched its national ``Three  
Names for the Games'' contest Wednesday. The animals, which figure 
into western Indian myth and were chosen to reflect the Olympic 
motto of swifter, higher and stronger, debuted in May. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two methods of voting: via the Internet at  
www.slc2002.org or by calling a toll-free number, (877) 3MASCOTS. 
Participants, who will be asked for a name, address and phone 
number, will be eligible for prizes from Olympic sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest runs through July. Voters will cast ballots for one  
set of three names. The winning names will be announced in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking suggestions from 42,000 school children in 1,400  
classrooms, the committee winnowed the list of possible names to 
nine and grouped those into three sets of names. Of the nine, five 
names came from students -- Copper, Cliff, Shadow, Arrow and Bolt. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference announcing the contest on Wednesday, three  
youngsters became the first to vote for mascot names via the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Aivazian, a student at Alta View Elementary in Sandy,  
and Todd Lehman, a student at Evergreen Junior High in Holladay, 
both voted for the names under Option 2: Sky, Cliff and Shadow. 
They said the names conjure up images of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindi Arko, who attends Columbia Elementary School in West  
Jordan, picked Option 3: Arrow, Bolt and Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just sounded cool to me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Option 1 names include Powder, Copper and Coal.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks touched a 21-month high early  
Friday after a gain on Wall Street. The dollar edged higher against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 91.68 points,  
or 0.51 percent, to 17,952.43 points at the end of the morning 
session. On Thursday, the average closed up 331.01 points, or 1.89 
percent -- the market's highest close since Sept. 30, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point Friday morning, the Nikkei briefly passed the  
18,000-point mark for the first time since September 1997, rising 
as high as 18,066 before falling back on profit taking, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.86 yen, up 0.10 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 120.78 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the rise on Wall Street as well as hope for  
an economic recovery in Japan boosted prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rise in share prices is likely to accelerate,'' said  
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average posted its fourth  
consecutive gain, rising 95.62 points to 11,066.42 at Thursday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said some investors are exercising caution while  
awaiting the results of the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' 
survey of business sentiment, due out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But major private sector think tanks and research institutes are  
forecasting a significant improvement in the survey results, the 
Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Friday. There is increasing 
sentiment ``that the tankan won't be bad,'' Ishikawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's government spokesman welcomed the rise in share prices.  
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence in our country's economy is being reflected in  
stocks, and I am happy about it,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu 
Nonaka said at a regular news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section rose 16.43 points, or 1.14 percent, to 
1,463.84. The TOPIX posted a 31.21-point gain, or 2.20 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved in a narrow range amid  
worries that Japanese monetary authorities may intervene in some 
form Friday, to support the euro against the yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	To underscore such fears, Japan's Vice Finance Minister for  
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara said early Friday that 
euro-yen trading was moving rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakakibara, who is leaving his post, added that authorities were  
``monitoring'' the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro dropped to a new low against the dollar in New York on  
Thursday. It was quoted at $1.0229, down from $1.0338 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, it was traded at 123.82 yen, down from 125.04 yen late  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.700  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7400 percent, driving its price 
up to 100.86 yen from 100.51 yen.

<HEADLINE> Doomed Amtrak Train Ran Red Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The engineer of one of the two Amtrak  
trains that collided early Thursday ignored a red light just 
seconds before the wreck, which injured eight passengers, a federal 
investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made a bad mistake. I made a bad judgment,'' the engineer  
radioed from the cab of his southbound Silver Palm, according to 
Russ Gober, lead investigator for the National Transportation 
Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were injured when the trains hit at 3 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	Modesto Romero, his wife Maria, and their two children were  
asleep in a cabin when Mrs. Romero tumbled to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and then I heard my wife. I jumped up and held up  
the top bunk where my kids were sleeping,'' said Romero. ``They 
were a little scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One train was headed to Miami from New York City, while the  
other was on its way to New York City from Miami. The trains, both 
called the Silver Palm, were carrying a combined 300 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound train, traveling at 55 mph, slammed into the  
northbound Amtrak train, which was moving onto a side track off the 
main rail at 14 mph, Gober said. Four locomotives and seven cars 
derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Rhodell Green of Hollywood said the wreck jolted her  
out of her seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what happened. It felt like just a big hit,''  
Ms. Green said. ``I thought we had run over a truck or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injured passengers were treated for cuts and bruises and  
released.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Waive Ron Hextall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ron Hextall was waived by the Philadelphia  
Flyers on Thursday, perhaps ending his 13-year NHL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall, the Flyers' winningest career and playoff goaltender  
and a former Vezina Trophy winner, will wait 48 hours for another 
team to claim him. If none does, the Flyers will buy out the final 
year of his contract and perhaps offer him a job in the front 
office or as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if Ron doesn't want to continue his career in  
another city, then we'll sit down and see what he wants to do and 
what we have available,'' Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said. 
``It would be nice if we could keep him in the organization. We 
like Ron a lot. We just feel that it's time for a young goaltender 
to start developing with the Flyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers picked a goaltender, Maxime Ouellet, in the amateur  
draft for the second straight year. They already have Brian Boucher 
and Jean-Marc Pelletier waiting to back up starter John 
Vanbiesbrouck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hexy was one of best goaltenders that ever played for  
the Flyers,'' Clarke said. ``When he was a young goaltender, he was 
probably the biggest reason the Flyers went to the finals. I think 
he was really a great competitor and a real good community person 
and a real good man for the Flyers. Unfortunately, like everybody, 
it's time for us to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall, 35, was drafted by the Flyers in 1982, then traded to  
Quebec in the seven-player deal in which the Flyers acquired 
superstar Eric Lindros on June 20, 1992. The Flyers traded Hextall, 
Peter Forsberg, Steve Duchesne, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris 
Simon, a first-round draft pick and $15 million to the Nordiques 
for Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was later traded to the New York Islanders, playing one  
season before being dealt back to the Flyers in 1994. His agent, 
Steve Mountain, was out of town Thursday and unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall won the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender in  
1987, when he led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup finals. This 
season, as Vanbiesbrouck's backup, he passed Hall of Famer Bernie 
Parent for the team lead with 240 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall also is No. 1 on the Flyers' career lists for games,  
playoff games and playoff victories. He was the starting goalie for 
the Wales Conference in the 1988 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers left Hextall unprotected in the expansion draft, but  
the Atlanta Thrashers didn't select him. He was 10-7-4 with a 2.53 
goals-against average last season and has a 296-214-69 career 
record.

<HEADLINE> U S West To Discuss Qwest Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell phone  
company at the heart of a three-week takeover battle, said it will 
explore a $34.7 billion offer from Qwest Communications 
International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's decision Thursday follows a similar move Monday by  
Frontier Corp., the fifth-largest long-distance company, which is 
weighing a $11.8 billion takeover bid from Denver-based Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, however, both U S West and Frontier have merger  
agreements with Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday Global Crossing gave U S West permission to  
provide information to Qwest so that they can discuss the rival 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sol Trujillo, U S West chairman, president and CEO said in a  
statement, ``The Board remains committed to acting in the best 
interests of U S West shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing and Qwest are building worldwide networks to  
carry high-speed Internet traffic. They are fighting for U S West 
and Frontier in order to secure the customers and sales to drive 
their business plans. 
</P>
<P>
	This is just the latest in a series of recent bidding wars in  
the communications industry. In May, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's 
largest long-distance company, won a bidding war against Comcast 
Corp. for MediaOne, a large cable company. And in Europe, upstart 
Olivetti SpA won a fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of 
Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the aggressive offers is a sea change in technology,  
which is forcing telephone, cable TV and computer companies to 
offer many of the same services. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest chairman and CEO Joseph P. Nacchio said the company hopes  
to begin discussions with U S West as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe a combination of U S West and Qwest will  
significantly benefit the shareholders, customers and employees of 
each of our companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, based in Bermuda, offered $10.9 billion in cash  
and stock for Rochester, N.Y.-based Frontier and about $31 billion 
in stock for U S West. The deal with U S West, however, hangs on 
the success of the Frontier acquisition. If Frontier backs out, it 
could scuttle Global Crossing's plans to buy U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	If Qwest is the victor, Frontier and U S West would have to pay  
about $1 billion in breakup fees to Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West's announcement came after the markets closed. The  
company's stock ended the day unchanged at $58.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where Frontier's shares rose 31 1/4 cents to $58.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.37 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, where Global Crossing's shares fell $2.65 1/4 to $40.

<P>
	Tuttle turned his head toward members of the victim's family,  
who watched through a window, and apologized for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my dropping my appeals has in some way began your  
healing process. This is all I can do to help you out in any way 
for the nightmare and pain that I have caused you,'' Tuttle said 
before being given a lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly sorry and I wish I could take back what I did, but  
I can't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Harris, 42, was beaten with a claw hammer in February  
1995. Her body was wrapped in blankets and squeezed into a closet 
in her trailer home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuttle, a friend of her nephew's, had been staying with her but  
had been asked to leave because he was not paying his share of the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuttle told police when he was arrested four days after the  
killing that he had been high on drugs and only wanted to knock her 
out ``like you see on TV'' to steal from her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She started screaming and I lost it,'' he told police.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuttle took Harris' pickup truck, her credit cards and her  
.357-caliber Magnum revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conversation early on the day of the murder, Tuttle told  
Harris' nephew he had watched the movie ``Natural Born Killers'' 
three times the previous day. The 1994 film is about the media's 
glorification of a pair of serial killers.

<HEADLINE> Brief Look At Republican Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Broad elements of a 10-year Republican tax cut bill that could  
reach $996 billion: 

</P>
<P>
	INCOME TAXES: An across-the-board reduction phased in over 10  
years that could include gradual cuts in all tax rates, making more 
income subject to lower tax brackets or adding a line to IRS forms 
allowing all taxpayers a new flat deduction after they've figured 
their tax. 
</P>
<P>
	CAPITAL GAINS: Retroactive to July 1, 1999, an unspecified cut  
in taxes on investments and other passive income. One leading 
proposal would reduce the top rate for longer-term investments from 
20 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	ESTATE TAXES: Cutting taxes on inheritances, either by raising  
the amount now exempt or gradually reducing the rate. 
</P>
<P>
	MARRIAGE PENALTY: Fixing a part of the tax code under which some  
21 million married two-income couples pay more than if they 
remained single. Options include boosting the standard deduction 
for married couples or adjusting income tax brackets so married 
people's earnings are subject to lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
	EDUCATION: Creating tax-free savings accounts for people to use  
for education costs and changing rules on revenue bonds to raise 
more money for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
	HEALTH CARE: Unspecified tax incentives to enable more people to  
buy health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	RETIREMENT: Increase incentives for personal savings, such as  
raising the annual limit on contributions to individual retirement 
accounts from $2,000 to as much as $5,000.

<HEADLINE> 89-Year-Old Woman Walking Across US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEATHERFORD, Texas (AP) -- There are a few things you ought to  
know about Doris Haddock before taking a walk with the 89-year-old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1: Despite her age, severe arthritis and her recent recovery  
from emphysema, she keeps a brisk pace. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2: She waits for no one.  
</P>
<P>
	And No. 3: She walks with a purpose.  
</P>
<P>
	The soft-spoken, 5-foot ``Granny D'' is nearly halfway through a  
3,055-mile walk across the country to call attention to 
campaign-finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	She set out from Southern California on New Year's Day and  
expects to finish in Washington in January, walking six days a 
week, 10 miles a day. This week, she made her way down U.S. Highway 
180 in the Texas summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Haddock said the cross-country trek was her idea, but she is  
making the walk with the backing of Common Cause, the 
Washington-based interest group that advocates campaign-finance 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The former secretary and shoe factory worker, whose only past  
political activity was participating in protests of nuclear tests 
in the 1950s, said political offices are, in effect, up for the 
highest bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our system has broken down,'' she said while walking along a  
hilly stretch of highway in Weatherford, 30 miles west of Fort 
Worth. ``To run today, even an honest man has to sell his soul to 
the big corporations to compete. And it's getting worse all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dublin, N.H., woman is so serious about taking her message  
to Congress that she braved the Mojave Desert -- she was 
hospitalized four days for dehydration -- and tapped her bank 
account for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she is trying to avoid taking money from Common Cause  
or other groups and tries to save cash by staying with people she 
meets along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	So trudges on with her backpack canteen strapped on and a big  
straw hat on her head, her son Jim and daughter-in-law Libby 
trailing her in an old Dodge van with a bed in the back. It usually 
takes four to five hours to make the 10-mile hike each day, 
including several 10-minute breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The arthritis requires her to wear a brace that causes her to  
walk hunched over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great that some people want to take the country  
back,'' said Jerry Kershman, who broke from mowing his grass along 
the highway to greet Granny D and offer her a few dollars. ``I 
don't think our kids would be the way they are if they didn't see 
all this corruption in government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is backing legislation to limit so-called soft money  
donations in federal campaigns. The measure died last September in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's happening because people are too afraid to stand up  
and say it's got to stop,'' she said. ``Everyone in Congress was 
elected under this system and they don't want to bite the hand that 
feeds them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was making her way through Texas on Wednesday when the Texas  
governor, presidential candidate George W. Bush, announced he had 
raised a record $36 million in his first six months on the campaign 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahead of Ms. Haddock lie Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana,  
Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia. She plans to reach Washington by 
her 90th birthday, Jan. 24.

<HEADLINE> Many Live With Grandchildren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 5.5 American million children live with  
their grandparents, the Census Bureau reports. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, grandma and grandpa move into their children's  
homes and the families do fine financially. But in most, the 
grandchildren go off to live with their grandparents -- often 
because the youngsters' mom and dad cannot support them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like grandparents are going, `Oh, God, I want to  
raise another family -- let me go out and grab some kids.' It's 
definitely in response to a need,'' said Margaret Hollidge, who 
runs the American Association of Retired Persons' Grandparent 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census' report, being released Thursday, is the first on  
homes with grandparents and grandchildren living together. Among 
its findings: 
</P>
<P>
	--About 5,435,000 children, 7.7 percent of America's total, lived  
with a grandparent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Three-quarters of these kids were living in homes owned or  
rented by the grandparent; the rest lived in homes maintained by 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Children living with their grandparents were more likely to  
have a series of disadvantages: More than one in four was poor, one 
in three lacked health insurance and more than half were on some 
type of public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Without a parent living with grandparents, too, it was worse:  
two-thirds of the kids were poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of children living in their grandparents' homes has  
risen from 2.2 million in 1970 to 3.9 million in 1997. Accounting 
for much of the increase is the jump in the number of homes where 
grandchildren live with their grandparents but without their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, these are families where parents no longer can  
care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason can range from death, illness, substance abuse or  
imprisonment, Hollidge said. In rare cases, a parent has to take a 
job out of town and cannot bring the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, the parent is unable to function as a  
parent,'' said Hollidge, who took in her own daughter and grandson 
for five years while her daughter went to school and found a job. 
``The grandparent steps into the gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These grandparent-maintained families are more likely to be  
poor, to live in central cities, to be black and to live in the 
South, the Census report found. 
</P>
<P>
	But these grandparents are in better shape -- younger, healthier,  
more educated and more likely to have a job -- to raise another 
generation of children compared with those grandparents who move in 
with their own kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1970, the Census Bureau has tracked homes maintained by  
grandparents. The new report is the first to look at families where 
a grandparent moves in with his or her children and grandchildren. 
Some 4.7 million grandparents were living in these situations in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, grandmothers move in after their husbands die.  
They may need help financially, with personal care -- or they may be 
lonely, said Lynne Casper, co-author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she notes, these ``sandwich families,'' where the parents  
have to care for their parents and their children at the same time, 
are not as bad off as stereotypes suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these grandparents,'' the report concludes, ``are  
capable of playing an active role in the family, contributing to 
the family income, and perhaps providing child care for their 
grandchildren while the parents work.''

<HEADLINE> Charter To Buy Bresnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Allen continues to build his Charter  
Communications cable television conglomerate, announcing a deal to 
buy Bresnan Communications for $2.1 billion in stock and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Wednesday is the latest in a series of  
purchases that have made Charter the nation's fourth biggest cable 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Bresnan is 50 percent owned by AT&AMP;T's Broadband and Internet  
Services, the former Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which will emerge with an equity stake of less than 5  
percent of Charter, has been buying and partnering with the 
nation's top cable companies to use their wires for telephone and 
Internet services. It wasn't clear with the Charter would lead to a 
similar venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which also includes the assumption of $1 billion in  
debt, will add 690,000 customers to the privately-held Charter's 
5.5 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerald Kent, president and CEO of the St. Louis-based Charter,  
said Wednesday the deal would extend Charter's reach in Wisconsin, 
Minnesota and Michigan. Bresnan, based in New York also has 
customers in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates, purchased  
Charter in July 1998 and has spent about $16 billion on cable 
purchases over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Charter bought Denver-based Fanch and Falcon Cable TV of  
Los Angeles for $3.6 billion. The buying spree has moved Charter 
behind only AT&AMP;T Corp., Time Warner Inc. and Comcast Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bresnan's other owners include founder William J. Bresnan and  
affiliates, who own 10 percent, and affiliates of Blackstone 
Capital Partners III, a New York private equity fund that acquired 
40 percent five months ago.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Hill Has Elbow Re-Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels pitcher Ken Hill, who  
underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery last summer, had his right 
elbow examined again Thursday and the team said following a CT scan 
that it will follow a conservative course of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill (3-7) allowed three runs and three hits in two innings in  
the Angels' 8-3 loss to Seattle on June 23. He did not come out to 
start the third inning because of a tight right elbow. It was his 
shortest appearance of the season.

<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- All Tribes Gathering is a church  
where American Indians can reconcile two faiths: Christianity and 
tribal beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-month-old church offers traditional Indian powwows on  
the weekends and a Tuesday night Christian service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fantastic. This is like coming home,'' said Helen  
Hillman, a 52-year-old American Indian. ``It takes the best of both 
worlds and fits me into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hillman's brother, Casey Church, is an anthropologist  
studying for the ministry and one of eight church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Smith of Phoenix said returning to traditional Native  
American ways that honor the culture but do not dishonor Christ's 
sovereignty is a delicate balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are issues we want to be careful with in incorporating  
old forms of worship,'' said Smith, an American Indian and author 
of ``White Man's Gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With customs of 550 tribes to sift through, he said, there is a  
lot of room for conflict with Judeo-Christian beliefs. One example 
he cited: artistic depictions of gods in some Indian traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But church leaders say other practices, such as burning incense,  
can be incorporated into Christian worship.

 *New Hebrew-English Bible    	
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With an assist from computer databases, the  
Jewish Publication Society has issued a new Hebrew text of the 
Bible, printed in parallel columns alongside a revised version of 
its widely used English translation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,038-page volume, titled the ``JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh,''  
is $69.95. Lower-priced editions are planned. Tanakh is a Jewish 
term for the Bible taken from Hebrew initials referring to three 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Hebrew text is based on the so-called Leningrad Codex, a  
standard full Bible in the Russian National Library that dates from 
1010. The new English text is a slight revision of the JPS 
translation published in 1985.

 *Bells to ring once again    	
</P>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- St. Vincent Archabbey Basilica, the  
centerpiece of St. Vincent College, should welcome the year 2000 
with the peal of bells from new 55-foot spires. 
</P>
<P>
	The church at the first Benedictine monastery and school in the  
United States was built between 1891 and 1905, but there was no 
money for the bells and spires atop the front towers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, fire destroyed the only other campus bells, an 1872  
landmark tower. One bell, cracked when it fell in the fire, was 
rescued and installed at the entrance of another building. It was 
rung after graduation ceremonies until it broke in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, donations will pay for the spires and bells donated more  
than 20 years ago by the Diocese of Covington to be installed in 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should definitely be ready to ring in the new millennium in  
January,'' said the Rt. Rev. Douglas R. Nowicki, archabbot and 
chancellor of St. Vincent College.

 *New Episcopal bishop    	
</P>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The Rt. Rev. Andrew Smith, 55, has been  
named bishop for the 76,000 Episcopalians in the Connecticut 
Diocese. He had been assistant bishop of the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	As bishop, he will have ecclesiastical authority over 184  
parishes, more than 500 retired and active clergy, several schools 
and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has degrees from Trinity College in Hartford and the  
Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. He succeeds the Rt. 
Rev. Clarence Coleride, who is retiring.

 *Saving souls with songs    	
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Pack up the tents and bring on the music.  
Traditional summer tent revivals have given way to outdoor gospel 
revivals where music stars shine. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our contemporary times, this new concept is a way to take  
the church outside of its four walls,'' said the Rev. Edgar Vann 
Jr. of Second Ebenezer Baptist Church. ``Churches have to be about 
the business of taking their message into the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of revival concerts started two years ago with a gospel  
revival by Greater Grace Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	The Second Ebenezer Baptist Church had its first music revival  
meeting in Chene Park on June 27 with nine-time Grammy winner 
Shirley Caesar on the bill. Two other gospel shows are scheduled 
for August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Park manager Clarence Rome said three other Detroit churches  
expressed interest in revivals but couldn't get a program ready in 
time.

<HEADLINE> Unfunny `Taming of the Shrew' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Clobber Me, Kate.''  
</P>
<P>
	That could be the new title for the frantic, physical and mostly  
unfunny revival of ``The Taming of the Shrew'' that the Public 
Theater is presenting as its inaugural attraction in Central Park 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the furious fisticuffs, not much seems to work in  
this hodgepodge production, starting with the crucial casting of 
Kate and Petruchio, the battling would-be lovers of Shakespeare's 
venerable comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay O. Sanders' Petruchio is all hale and hearty, beefy and  
blustery but without much magnetism. One wonders what Kate finally 
sees in this dull Verona jock, who at one point in the proceedings 
dons wrestling tights. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison Janney's Kate looks a bit like a young, schoolmarmish  
Katharine Hepburn, maybe because she wears spectacles and pins her 
hair in a bun. 
</P>
<P>
	Janney is a fine actress able to handle comedy and drama, as  
anybody knows who saw her in the movie ``The Object of My 
Affection'' or on stage in the Broadway revival of ``A View from 
the Bridge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the woman has been given minimal guidance from director Mel  
Shapiro who has her bellowing and barging all over the Delacorte 
stage as if she were a banshee. Janney is much too intelligent a 
performer for all that yelling. Her screeching companionship surely 
would test not only Petruchio but just about everyone else within 
earshot. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro has opted to do a more complete ``Shrew'' than usual,  
leaving in the extensive opening scenes involving drunken tinker 
Christopher Sly, played by the reliable comic, Max Wright. Often 
these moments are cut, and you can see why. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright's fussing and fuming produce scattered laughs as he sets  
up the story as a play-within-a-play. The meeting, turbulent wooing 
and eventual winning of Kate is watched from the sidelines by Sly, 
who at one point is recruited to portray a minor character in the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	If the leads make scant impressions, so do most of the  
supporting players. A romantic subplot involving Kate's sister, 
Bianca, and a young gentleman, Lucentio, fritters away much of the 
evening. The comedy is as labored as it is long, wasting several 
veteran performers including MacIntyre Dixon and Tom Mardirosian. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot is Mario Cantone, who plays Grumio, grumbling  
servant to Petruchio. Cantone creates a larger-than-life character, 
cartoonish to be sure, but as vivid and colorful as Marina 
Draghici's eye-catching costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Eigsti's setting is vaguely Italian, white or  
pastel-colored Mediterranean buildings that are nicely set off by 
the backdrop of lush park greenery, 
</P>
<P>
	One measure of the production's misplaced boisterousness is the  
periodic appearance of four singing and dancing monks. Their 
musical outbursts -- in Italian -- get English subtitles on screens 
placed on each side of the wide stage. The men even get a big 11 
o'clock number -- well, more like 10:30 p.m. song -- in which they 
seem to be imitating one of the Public Theater's better-known shows 
-- '' A Chorus Line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anything, the silly moment makes one anticipate the November  
arrival on Broadway of ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the Cole Porter musical 
based on ``Shrew.'' Porter's terrific songs should at least provide 
the buoyancy that this earthbound production sorely lacks.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foes Targeting Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Abortion opponents will look to the Senate to  
do this year what it could not accomplish last year: send the White 
House a bill that would make it more difficult for a minor to 
terminate a pregnancy by going to another state. 
</P>
<P>
	House lawmakers voted 270-159 Wednesday in favor of new  
restrictions on abortions by teens. The bill would penalize anyone 
who helps a minor avoid parental involvement laws by going to 
another state for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tally fell short of the two-thirds majority, or 286  
votes, that would be needed to overturn a threatened veto by 
President Clinton. Voting in favor were 206 Republicans and 64 
Democrats; voting against were 14 Republicans, 144 Democrats and 
one independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar bill last year, but it failed to  
reach the Senate floor after getting caught up in the end-of-year 
crush of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents are hoping the Senate will act earlier this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Life Committee, which lists the bill as a  
top legislative priority, said a majority of the 100 senators 
support the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has yet  
to act. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who  
supported the bill last year, did not return a telephone call 
Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights advocates predicted the Senate will pass the  
bill, given next year's elections. But they also are assured of 
Clinton's veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that at least enough senators will understand the  
danger of this kind of legislation to young women who are in 
crisis, to family members who may need to help these women and to 
the Constitution,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the National 
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill makes it a crime for anyone other than a parent,  
guardian or legal custodian to evade parental involvement laws by 
taking a minor to another state for an abortion. It would not apply 
if the abortion was needed to save the girl's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Violators face penalties of up to a year in jail and $100,000 in  
fines, and parents whose daughters had abortions could pursue civil 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 30 states have laws that require the notification or  
consent of at least one parent for a minor's abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill said it was more about upholding the  
rights of parents to be involved when a daughter chooses to end a 
pregnancy, and about protecting the health and well-being of 
minors, than about abortion itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued that it would do more harm than good because  
girls without supportive parents would be left to resolve the 
situation on their own. They also said nonparents who could help 
them, such as grandmothers or adult siblings, would be scared away 
under the threat of federal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets soared ahead Thursday,  
boosted by news that the U.S. Federal Reserve sees no pressing need 
to raise interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Asia's largest market, stocks closed sharply higher on  
the news that had lifted Wall Street prices on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average soared 331.01  
points, or 1.9 percent, to 17,860.75, its highest close since Sept. 
30, 1997, when it ended at 17,887.71. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter  
point on Wednesday but hinted it didn't see the need for more 
increases, thrilling U.S. traders who had worried about further 
tightening. 
</P>
<P>
	The news slightly weakened the U.S. dollar in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.82 yen by late afternoon, down 0.04 yen  
from late Wednesday and below its late New York level of 120.93 yen 
overnight.

	Prices skyrocketed on the Korea Stock Exchange, with the key  
index jumping 4.2 percent, or 36.98 points, to close at 919.98. 
</P>
<P>
	The market got a lift from the U.S. interest rate news as well  
as the Samsung Group's filing for court receivership for its 
debt-ridden unit Samsung Motors Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Kospi's highest close since 920.43 on May 27, 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the U.S. rate announcement drove the benchmark  
index to its third record close in the past two weeks. The 
benchmark Straits Times Index finished at 2214.75 points, up 47.05 
points, or 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong, Taipei and Bangkok financial markets were closed  
Thursday for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>

political concerns. The JSX Composite Index gained 1.7 percent, or 
11.017 points, to end at 673.042. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares jumped 3 percent, fueled by local

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Gun Control Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says congressional  
Republican leaders' decision to put off reconciling House and 
Senate youth crime bills is ``a grave mistake'' and that they 
should enact new gun controls ``without delay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wrote House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott on Wednesday, saying he understands the 
Republican leaders don't plan to appoint negotiators on the two 
houses' juvenile crime bills until ``some time'' after their 4th of 
July recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Members from both houses of Congress must iron out the  
differences between a Senate bill with White House-backed gun 
control legislation and a House bill that doesn't have them. The 
House rejected the measures -- including mandatory background checks 
for all gun show sales -- and then killed a bill that contained 
weaker curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert has confirmed he postponed naming negotiators from this  
week until after the Fourth of July recess, which ends in 
mid-month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a grave mistake,'' Clinton wrote, adding that closing  
the gun-show loophole will save lives. ``Congress should make such 
measures the law of the land without further delay. ... I urge you 
to put the safety of the American people ahead of the interests of 
the gun lobby and move quickly to enact a juvenile crime bill that 
strengthens our gun laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the preliminary staff work needed for the  
negotiations is taking longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intention is to appoint conferees and have this matter  
resolved one way or the other,'' Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Orrin Hatch said. ``My goal is to have this conference 
report voted on before (we) go out for August recess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats see the negotiations as one of the last chances to  
enact gun control legislation this year, and a group of Democratic 
women lawmakers said they would beat the drum for gun control back 
home in their districts over the break.

<HEADLINE> Bad News Continues for Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola has been battered by a spate of bad  
news this past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday brought word of more woes.  
</P>
<P>
	The company extended a glass bottle recall in Poland, in the  
aftermath of a major health scare in Europe over Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Atlanta-based company reported that its second-quarter  
finances will be hurt by the health crisis and by continued 
economic downturns in other key overseas markets that have been 
reeling for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the past year, regulatory obstacles delayed Coke's  
efforts to take over the French brand Orangina and most Cadbury 
Schweppes brands overseas, and four current or past employees, all 
black, filed a lawsuit charging the company with racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the last 18 months or so has been  
challenging,'' company spokesman Rob Baskin said. ``I don't know 
that it's been more challenging than other times in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, Coke in its 113-year history has been  
through the Great Depression, recessions in the United States and 
abroad, and world wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep these things in perspective,'' Baskin  
said. ``It's a matter of taking the long view and weathering the 
storms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has long been as popular on Wall Street as it is with loyal  
consumers, and its stature and reputation have helped keep the 
recent events from adding up to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have had a rough patch here,'' said Martin Romm, a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst who's followed Coke for more than two 
decades. ``I think Coke has really acted as an extremely focused 
company intent on doing the things that in the long term are in the 
best interests of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been remarkably stable in an otherwise unstable  
environment,'' said Romm, among many analysts who still give Coke a 
good long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the company believes ``that the worst is behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain extremely confident in the fundamental strengths of  
our business systems throughout the world,'' Ivester said. ``Our 
company continues to be well-positioned to emerge from the current 
economic environment with an enhanced system that can refresh more 
consumers, every day, all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series of setbacks has brought increased scrutiny on  
Ivester, who succeeded Roberto C. Goizueta, Coke's CEO for 16 
highly successful years, in October 1997 following Goizueta's death 
from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nobody is blaming Ivester for any of these  
circumstances, CEO's have been eased into premature retirement for 
less,'' an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story commented Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has been criticized for a slow response to the health  
crisis that saw authorities link 249 cases of illness to Coke 
products and three European countries temporarily ban some Coke 
beverages. Ivester took personal charge of the crisis last week, 
apologizing in Belgium and pledging that Coke would regain trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Since overseas problems began hurting Coke's sales last year,  
Ivester has insisted that Coke remains focused on long-term 
opportunities and is committed to global growth. 
</P>
<P>
	A key director said Ivester retains the board's full support.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think Doug is the right man at the right time in the right  
place,'' said James B. Williams, retired chairman and CEO of 
SunTrust Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the company's strong civic reputation, most in the  
Atlanta area have had a wait-and-see response to the discrimination 
suit filed in April alleging the company gives less pay and 
opportunity to black employees. However, subsequent disclosures 
that black executives at Coke gave Ivester, at his request, 
recommendations for increasing diversity in December 1995 and that 
the plaintiffs had made formal complaints before the suit raised 
some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprises me is that they didn't nip it (complaints of  
discrimination) in the bud any earlier,'' said state Rep. Tyrone 
Brooks, D-Atlanta, who heads the Georgia Association of Black 
Elected Officials.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation aimed at avoiding legal  
aftershocks from Year 2000 computer problems headed for a final 
vote in Congress today. The White House said the president, after 
lengthy negotiations over consumer protections, would sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill aimed at stemming a flood of lawsuits from possible  
computer breakdowns was assured of a big victory in the House 
today, followed by another strong show of approval in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's signature, which appeared solid after  
lawmakers said Tuesday they had reached a compromise agreement with 
the administration, appeared a little shakier Wednesday after the 
White House indicated it still had some problems with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House spokesman Jake Siewert said today the president  
will approve it. ``We think this bill is critical to meet a 
national priority and the president is prepared to sign it into law 
because it is narrowly tailored to deal with litigation dealing 
with the Y2K problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who has strong ties with the high-tech  
industry, which badly wants the legislation and played an active 
role in crafting the final product, told The Associated Press 
Wednesday he understood there were some last-minute problems in 
putting the deal in writing. But he said there was a ``90 percent 
chance'' they would be worked out and the bill signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he was generally satisfied with the legislation.  
``It's a compromise outcome that overall serves the interests of 
the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans stressed they had an agreement and were done  
negotiating. Sponsors of the original House bill, said Rep. Bob 
Goodlatte, R-Va., ``had to make tremendous concessions'' to win 
White House support and in the end, ``the Congress writes the 
legislation and not the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House rejected the original House-passed bill as being  
too pro-business and to the disadvantage of consumers taking legal 
action to recover losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, written by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with the  
help of Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher Dodd 
of Connecticut, was modified to address consumer concerns, but the 
White House said that it too was one-sided and would receive a 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Further changes agreed to over five days of negotiations ending  
Tuesday appeared to finally win White House approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups and the high-tech industry, warning of billions  
of dollars in lawsuits from disruptions caused by computers that 
can't differentiate the year 2000 from 1900, lobbied hard for the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore conceded he was caught between the interests of two strong  
Democratic constituents, the high-tech industry that wanted the 
bill and trial lawyers who opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the pressure was ``no more than is frequently the  
case when you have differing legitimate points of view that have to 
be reconciled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K-related  
problems before lawsuits can be filed and by encouraging mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would set punitive damage caps for small businesses,  
make it harder to file class action lawsuits and provide that, in 
most cases, a defendant can be held liable only for the proportion 
of damage actually caused by the individual or company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final negotiations, some changes were made in the class  
action and proportionate liability sections to better protect 
consumer interests, and that won over such influential Democrats as 
Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee, who opposed the original bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have now fully crafted a bill that we can all live with and  
enjoy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said he still  
thought the bill would undermine the civil justice system and would 
be used as a ``fund-raising tool'' for Republicans seeking 
high-tech donations. 
</P>
<P>
	But his Senate counterpart, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said  
the bill was ``the best we can get under these circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 775.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Lawmakers Defeat Gambling Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Handing first-year Gov. Jim Hodges a  
victory, South Carolina lawmakers have approved a deal that will 
let voters decide in November whether to ban video poker games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 75-33 House vote came early Thursday, and the Senate  
approved the measure a short time later. The bill had been blocked 
six times in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina has more video gambling machines than any other  
state -- about 34,000, nearly double that of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nov. 2 referendum fulfills a campaign pledge by Democrat  
Hodges to let the public decide whether the $2.5 billion-a-year 
industry should continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges had ordered legislators back for a special session that  
began Tuesday and, though he did not legally have the authority, 
had vowed to keep them in session until they solved the contentious 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodges was elected over Republican Gov. David Beasley, a  
gambling opponent, with the help of money and people from the 
gambling industry. Hodges promised to tax the machines, tighten 
regulations and let voters decide if they wanted the games.

<HEADLINE> INS' Role in Railroad Case Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's top watchdog will  
investigate why the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained 
a Mexican national wanted for questioning in connection with 
several murders but let him go, the INS said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency's failure to  
identify Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old drifter charged in 
two murders and linked to six other slayings, ``has raised serious 
questions about the INS' knowledge of the case and procedures used 
in encounters with'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of these questions, I have referred the matter to  
the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General,'' said 
Meissner in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman also said today that INS  
officials in Texas were contacted by Houston police about 
Resendez-Ramirez last December after the killing of a doctor during 
a burglary at her home in the Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Carole Florman said Houston police asked the INS for  
information on Resendez-Ramirez, and that INS officials provided 
photos of him to the police during a meeting in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner's statement Wednesday said the INS' office of internal  
audits was reviewing INS procedures ``in an effort to avoid any 
similar situation in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's office investigates waste, fraud and  
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said at a news conference  
today, ``I think we're going to learn a lot from this review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS arrested Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area either  
late on June 1 or during the early morning hours of June 2 for 
being in this country illegally and deported him to Mexico later 
that day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his release, authorities believe he killed a  
73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they believe 
he killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. His 
fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the scene 
of the murder of an 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials said that when Resendez-Ramirez was in the custody  
of the Border Patrol, they didn't have any information on his 
criminal records or of any outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meissner said the INS had multiple entries on  
Resendez-Ramirez in a photo and fingerprint database that provides 
immediate identification of aliens apprehended by Border Patrol. 
The system became widely available in 1997 and 1998. Prior to that 
INS relied on a text database of names. 
</P>
<P>
	INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since that 
time has been deported from the U.S. on three occasions in 1985, 
1987 and 1991. He was also apprehended by Border Patrol agents 
eight times between January 1998 and the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department will look at why  
Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS knew about 
Resendez-Ramirez criminal activities after being contacted by local 
law enforcement earlier this year.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss Franc At 8-Yr. Low Vs. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro dropped to a new low against the dollar  
Thursday after the European Central Bank chose not to follow the 
U.S. Federal Reserve's decision of a day earlier to raise its key 
interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss franc fell to an eight-year low.  
</P>
<P>
	The European currencies struggled as new evidence emerged of  
continued strength in the U.S. economy and as higher interest rates 
in the United States made returns more attractive on 
dollar-denominated holdings. U.S. stocks rose Thursday, adding to 
Wednesday's sharp gains, with broad indexes reaching new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to interest rates, the euro was hurt by the European  
Central Bank's insistence that the weakening euro wasn't a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0229, down  
from $1.0338 Wednesday. Earlier in Europe, it fell to a new low of 
$1.0200, down more than 12 percent from where the euro debuted in 
January, when it replaced the currencies of 11 nations in the 
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	While the euro tumbled, the currency did come off its early low  
amid reports that the ECB intervened in foreign-exchange markets to 
boost the struggling currency. The ECB refused to comment on the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB left interest rates unchanged Thursday. In April, when  
it lowered its key lending rate by half a percentage point to 2.5 
percent, the central bank had said that would be the last cut for 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve nudged short-term U.S.  
interest rates up by a quarter point in an attempt to cool down the 
fast-paced U.S. economy and avoid inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that diverging growth prospects in the United  
States and the European Union justify U.S. short-term rates twice 
as high as those for euro nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed raised rates and the ECB did not follow. Now the cycle  
favors the United States,'' said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign 
exchange at Republic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that its not just the euro that was struggling against  
the dollar. Other currencies -- including the Swiss franc -- have 
been selling off on expectations that European economic growth will 
lag that of the United States in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a capital movement out of all of Europe,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 1.5692 Swiss francs from 1.5479 Wednesday,  
reaching the highest level since the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	While the euro and Swiss franc struggled, the dollar got a lift  
from bullish U.S. economic data. The National Association of 
Purchasing Management reported that the nation's manufacturing 
sector expanded for the fifth straight month in June, and at a 
stronger pace than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it didn't plan on  
raising rates again in the near future, investors believe that a 
string of stronger-than-expected data like that seen in Thursday's 
report may force the central bank to change its stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4729 Canadian dollars, up from  
1.4667. The British pound rose to $1.5728 from $1.5785. Against the 
Japanese yen, the dollar was trading at 120.78 yen, down from 
120.93 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9120 German 
marks, up from 1.8914; 6.4144 French francs, up from 6.3452; and 
1,893.94 Italian lire, up from 1,872.66.

<HEADLINE> Arco: Plaintiffs Weren't Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nine people who filed a lawsuit accusing  
Atlantic Richfield Co. of denying them benefits when they worked in 
Alaskan oil fields were never employed by the company, an Arco 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit were employees of other  
companies that Arco hired to perform a variety of services in North 
Slope oil fields, spokeswoman Marylou Flynn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The response was Arco's first to the lawsuit filed last week in  
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs contend that Arco hired them as temporary workers  
and then misclassified them to avoid playing benefits. They are 
seeking the same health and pension benefits given to Arco's 
regular 18,000-member work force. At least 100 and as many as 1,500 
workers may have been misclassified by Arco, Brian Ward, attorney 
for the plaintiffs, has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward's law firm won a similar case against Microsoft Corp.,  
which was accused of hiring temporary workers to avoid paying 
benefits. The Arco case differs from Microsoft's because the 
employees in question were hired by third-party contractors, said 
Ms. Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these plaintiffs ever worked for Arco or work for Arco  
now,'' she said. ``All of them became employees of independent oil 
field service companies that hired them and provided their 
benefits. We hired these companies to do jobs for Arco.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Pick South Philly Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After months of indecision, GOP officials on  
Thursday settled on a South Philadelphia sports arena to host the 
party's 2000 presidential convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president of the United States, that woman or man who  
will lead us to the next millennium, will be nominated right here 
in this building, the First Union Center,'' Republican National 
Chairman Jim Nicholson announced at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, scheduled for the week of July 29 to Aug. 4,  
2000, is expected to draw about 40,000 people, including 15,000 
members of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials had for six months been contemplating the  
downtown Pennsylvania Convention Center, impressed by its modern 
meeting facilities and central location. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said he was ultimately swayed by the First Union  
Center's superior television production capabilities, 
accessibility, ample parking and sound equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of engineering and architectural consultants has already  
boosted First Union's capacity from 18,000 to between 23,00 to 
24,000. Mayor Edward G. Rendell has promised that one lane of Broad 
Street, which connects Center City to the sports complex, would be 
reserved for convention traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has hosted eight presidential nominating  
conventions, including the Republicans' first national convention 
in 1856.

	World Economy Growing Slowly  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite the recovery of most financial  
markets, the world economy is still growing slowly and the poorest 
countries continue to suffer the most, according to a U.N. report. 
Economic growth this year in developing nations is on track to be 
lower than any year this decade, according to ``The World Economy 
in 1999,'' which is to be released today.

	Computer Export Restrictions Eased  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is easing export  
restrictions on computers today, making it easier for the high-tech 
industry to sell more powerful systems to foreign countries 
including China which has a vast market. The industry had sought 
the change because current restrictions, designed to keep advanced 
technology out of the hands of hostile militaries, have failed to 
keep up with the advances in commercially available computers.

	SAINT-ETIENNE-EN-DEVOLUY, France (AP) -- A cable car gondola  
crashed hundreds of feet to the ground today on the slopes of a ski 
resort in the French Alps, killing all 20 people aboard. Officials 
said no tourists were riding the private cable car that was 
carrying workers to the Pic de Bure space observatory. The gondola 
fell 262 feet onto a rock-studded grass slope above 
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, 400 miles southeast of Paris. It was the 
worst cable car disaster in the country's history.

15 people in the worst outbreak of street violence since landmark

demonstrators tried to force their way into the Indonesian Election 
Commission building to protest alleged vote-rigging by the ruling

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission approved nearly  
$5.2 million in aid today for children growing up in Romania's 
orphanages, where appalling living conditions have worsened due to 
government budget cuts. These children live in ``dreadful 
conditions,'' which have become worse since the Romanian government 
decided to reduce funds for orphanages as part of belt-tightening 
efforts to reform the economy, said a statement by the Commission, 
the European Union's executive arm. Close to 150,000 children are 
in Romania's orphanages.

French banks. The couple, which was also fined a total of $29.1 
million, was tried and sentenced in absentia. Noriega is currently 
in jail near Miami, serving a 30-year term for money laundering and 
drug trafficking. Felicidad Noriega's whereabouts are unknown to

<HEADLINE> Headmaster After Fox Sitcom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Conn. (AP) -- Seth MacFarlane has been out of prep school  
for eight years now and the headmaster is still on his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The top administrator of the Kent School is leading a one-man  
campaign to get advertisers to drop ``The Family Guy,'' an animated 
TV comedy created by MacFarlane, a 1991 Kent alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on Fox, is about a  
doofus husband, his wife, their slacker teen-agers, homicidal 
toddler and trilingual pooch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Richardson Schell, headmaster at the Kent School for 18  
years, has asked such major companies as Pepsico, Philip Morris, 
Chrysler and Sprint to drop ``The Family Guy.'' At least two of 
them, Philip Morris and Sprint, have withdrawn their ads from the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Schell, who was in London on Thursday and could not immediately  
be reached by telephone, told The New York Times that he finds the 
show ``obnoxious.'' He said he also objects to the fact that the 
name of the cartoon family, Griffin, is the same as that of his 
assistant at the Kent School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Seth, and it is not a personal  
vendetta,'' Schell told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Jokes on the show have touched on subjects such as racism,  
urination and flatulence. One gag involved a toy called ``G.I. 
Jew.'' In one episode, a boy shoots the head off a John F. Kennedy 
Pez dispenser, then says: ``At least I have my Bobby Kennedy Pez 
dispenser to back him up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox network spokeswoman in Los Angeles did not immediately  
return a call for comment. McFarlane declined to comment, the Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Schell wrote the advertisers on behalf of ``Proud Sponsors  
USA,'' which he acknowledges has a total membership of one. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Shafer, a spokesman for Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint,  
said letters from Schell and others prompted the long-distance 
phone company to undertake its own review of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show is out there on the edge, in terms of subject matter  
and the way that it deals with controversial subjects,'' Shafer 
said. ``The show was risky enough that we felt it didn't match the 
advertising goals of our brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris was airing youth smoking prevention ads on the  
show. Spokeswoman Mary Carnavale said the show was inconsistent 
with the company's emphasis on diversity, in part because the main 
characters are all white and in part because of the potentially 
offensive racial and ethnic subject matter.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt testified  
Wednesday before a grand jury looking into his department's 
rejection of an Indian casino proposal in 1995 and any possible 
connection with Democratic campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-month investigation by Independent Counsel Carol Elder  
Bruce is focusing, among other things, on whether Babbitt lied 
under oath before a congressional committee about the circumstances 
surrounding the casino rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first grand jury appearance for Babbitt, who has  
denied wrongdoing. It could not be learned late Wednesday how long 
Babbitt testified, nor whether he would return for any additional 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bruce has indicated that she expects to know by  
mid-August whether any indictments will result from the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are nearing the end of our factual investigation and are in  
the process of reviewing the facts and the law in order to reach a 
final conclusion as to whether any indictment(s) should be 
sought,'' Bruce recently wrote to the U.S. attorney in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	She requested an additional 60-day delay of a federal court suit  
involving the casino so she could wrap up her investigation without 
the civil suit having any impact on it. She said she fully expected 
her investigation to be completed by Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce is also looking into whether promises of Democratic  
campaign contributions influenced the Interior Department's 
decision to reject a request by three Chippewa tribes to open a 
casino in Hudson, Wis. Other tribes opposing the casino later gave 
the Democratic National Committee nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has vigorously denied any connection between campaign  
contributions and the decision to reject the casino permit. 
</P>
<P>
	But a longtime friend, Paul Eckstein, who was a lobbyist for the  
tribes seeking the casino, testified at congressional hearings that 
Babbitt -- during a meeting the day the casino decision was made -- 
alluded to Democratic campaign contributions and pressure from the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has said Eckstein misunderstood the conversation and has  
denied misleading lawmakers about the events leading up to the 
casino decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Department spokesman Mike Gauldin referred questions to  
Babbitt's personal lawyer, Lloyd Cutler, who could not immediately 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minneapolis Star Tribune on Wednesday first reported the  
contents of Bruce's letter to the U.S. attorney's office in 
Madison, Wis.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Fireworks Ring Broken Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Five people are accused of running a fireworks  
ring that allegedly sold thousands of powerful illegal explosives 
in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about firecrackers. These are mini-bombs,''  
said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments against three of the defendants were unsealed  
Thursday, charging them with selling and transporting illegal 
fireworks. The maximum sentence is 21 years in prison and fines of 
up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was sparked by the death of Eric Pluger, 17,  
who was killed July 14 when he and his friends blew up a mailbox 
with a quarter-stick of dynamite. The Shiocton, Wis., teen-ager 
died after he was hit by metal flying from the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known if the fireworks the defendants sold were  
involved in the death. 
</P>
<P>
	Indicted were Donald R. Peters and his daughter Peggy S. Malueg  
of Green Bay and Charles J. Childers of Appleton. Rodney L. Harris 
of Appleton and Albert Castellano Jr. of Rochester, Ind., pleaded 
guilty in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the indictments did not say exactly what the defendants  
are accused of selling, authorities have seized more than 8,000 
pounds of illegal fireworks in Wisconsin over the past year, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mario F. Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fireworks included more than 65,000 quarter-sticks,  
half-sticks, M-80s and other explosives banned under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about an operation that sold, conservatively,  
hundreds of thousands of devices, and it may be in the millions,'' 
said Eric Stone, director of the legal division of the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,500 Americans received medical attention last year after  
being injured by fireworks. More than half of those injuries occur 
around Independence Day.

<HEADLINE> Woman Claims $150 Million Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- A 21-year-old woman who makes $9 an hour  
at a mortgage company called her boss to say she wouldn't be in 
because of a death in the family, then stepped forward Thursday to 
claim a $150 million Powerball lottery jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrah Slad beat 80-million-to-1 odds to win the third-biggest  
prize ever in the multistate lottery and one of the richest 
jackpots ever claimed by an individual. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad said she bought $5 worth of tickets at a store on the  
spur of the moment after stopping because her 1991 Acura Integra 
was running low on gas. She was on the way to her parents' house 
for dinner and hadn't bought any tickets since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank my parents and my car for this,'' the single young  
woman said with a big smile at lottery headquarters in this St. 
Paul suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad held the only winning ticket for Wednesday night's  
drawing, which had a jackpot of $150 million over 25 years. She 
elected instead to receive a lump sum of $78.8 million, or $50.4 
million after state and federal taxes are withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad saw the winning numbers on television Wednesday night  
while rewinding a videotape of ``Austin Powers: International Man 
of Mystery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked it over a hundred times and it didn't seem real,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Slad, who lives in Brainerd, called her boss at MorNorth  
mortgage Wednesday night and told him a family member had died and 
she wouldn't be in to work Thursday. After a sleepless night spent 
pondering the possibilities, she stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
	On her list of things to do and buy: travel to Mexico, a new  
car, a house, ``good deeds'' and possibly veterinary school. She 
also plans to buy a dream house, trucks and boats for her parents. 
And she acknowledged: ``I'm going to meet people who say they've 
known me forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hadn't even told her three siblings or her roommate in her  
$510-a-month apartment before claiming the prize. ``I wanted to 
come here to verify. I wanted somebody to tell me I am the 
winner,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Powerball jackpot ever won was $295.7 million last  
July 29. The winning ticket was bought by 13 machinists -- the 
``Lucky 13'' -- who worked together in Westerville, Ohio. An 
Illinois couple set a Powerball record in May 1998 for a 
single-ticket winner by hitting a $195 million jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest jackpot ever won by an individual was $197  
million, won by a nanny in Boston in April in the multistate Big 
Game lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Powerball, based in Iowa, began in 1992 and is played in 20  
states and the District of Columbia. Players select five numbers 
from one to 49 and a single Powerball from one to 42.

<HEADLINE> China.com Hopes To Woo US Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- What's in a name? For China's first Internet  
company that plans to go public on the U.S. stock market, it's all 
in the tempting monicker: China.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing China hype and Internet frenzy on its sleeve, the  
Chinese-language Web site partially owned by the mainland 
government hopes to raise more than $60 million in its share 
offering, which is widely expected next week on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the company would not say precisely when the 4.2  
million shares are being floated for $14 to $16 each, analysts are 
already predicting strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are just salivating at the potential of attacking the  
China market,'' says Hanson Cheah, executive director of venture 
capital firm AsiaTech Ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, whether China.com can deliver value in the long run  
remains tentative. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com is pinning its hopes on future earnings, and analysts  
say it will need more than just what seems like the perfect name if 
it is to carve out a niche in China's nascent information industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheah estimates there are 3.3 million Internet users in China  
and that just 100,000 of them use China.com -- far below the 900,000 
users logging on to market leader Sina.com, and lagging other 
middle-range players including Yahoo!, Netease.com and Sohu.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``China.com is not a leader. A 'participant' would be a better  
way of putting it,'' says Kaushik Shridharani, a media analyst at 
investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	But an infusion of capital from its IPO may help to change that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Investors will buy because of the shortage of ways of  
investing in the growth of the market,'' says Kaushik Shridharani, 
a media analyst at investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. ``I think 
it will sell. Investors are not very educated about Internet 
companies in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China.com's past performance certainly has been rocky.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have incurred significant net losses since inception and  
expect to continue to incur significant losses on a quarterly and 
annual basis,'' the company said in its prospectus for the share 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing strict regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission, neither the company nor its underwriters Lehman 
Brothers and Bear Stearns would give any detailed financial 
information -- such as the size of its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Key shareholders include Hong Kong-based New World  
Infrastructure, with 22.7 percent, and U.S. Internet provider 
America Online Inc., with 10 percent. AOL also has warrants to 
purchase an additional 15 percent of China.com. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Internet market has the potential both for huge growth  
and huge problems. The possible audience is massive, but 
disseminating information in China is a tricky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government remains cautious over the Internet,  
blocking many overseas sites it regards as politically or morally 
suspect. Beijing has repeatedly warned that state security and 
anti-pornography laws apply online as well as off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen O'Gorman, spokeswoman for China.com, declined comment on  
whether China's state-run Xinhua News Agency, which owns a 13.6 
percent stake, could exercise a heavy hand on the Web site's 
contents -- and consequently discourage users from logging on. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com can trace its origins to another company that sought  
to conquer the Chinese Internet market. China Internet Corp., 60 
percent owned by Xinhua, was set up five years ago as a 
content-controlled Web site for mainland Chinese users, with touchy 
subjects like politics and dissent filtered out. 
</P>
<P>
	When CIC failed to gain a following, CIC set up China.com based  
in Hong Kong to offer Web services, e-commerce and advertising 
focusing on mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned share offering underscores the importance of U.S.  
equity markets as a place for Chinese companies to raise capital, 
despite Beijing's on-again, off-again relationship with Washington, 
Shridharani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite doubts about China.com, the company could ultimately  
prove the naysayers wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nasdaq listing will make China.com answerable to private  
investors -- which might force the company to work harder on 
delivering profits, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Gun Cos. Sued in Accidental Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The families of two boys who accidentally shot  
themselves have sued the gun industry, claiming the manufacturers 
were negligent in making unsafe weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits filed Thursday seek $6 million for the family of  
3-year-old Jordan Garris, who died June 6, and $1.25 million for 
the family of 8-year-old Nino Jacobs, who survived after his 
accident two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason why it should be easier for a child to fire  
a gun than open an aspirin bottle,'' said attorney Andrew Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Both children found the guns tucked under mattresses in their  
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmakers Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. of Southport, Conn., and Lorcin  
Engineering Co. of Mira Loma, Calif., as well as On Target Inc., a 
Severn, Md., gun distributor are named as defendants. On Target is 
accused in the Garris suit of selling defective guns and failing to 
warn customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, Freeman contends the gunmakers negligently  
produced defective and unreasonably dangerous weapons which did not 
include devices to prevent their use by young children. The 
gunmakers also are accused of failing to adequately warn buyers of 
the dangers the guns posed to children. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said the industry developed a childproof safety grip as  
early as the 1880s, but sells guns without such safety devices or 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Jacobs case, the suit describes Lorcin Engineering as  
``one of the leading makers of handguns used by criminals in 
America.'' The suit claims the company ``pandered to its market and 
excluded these child-resistant devices that criminals do not 
desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Waldorf, president of Lorcin Engineering, said all of the  
guns manufactured by his company have safety devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the owner of the gun operates and leaves it stored in the  
proper fashion, there certainly is no risk of a child getting 
shot,'' Waldorf said. ``I have not seen the suit, but on the 
surface it appears to be another piece of frivolous litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to Ruger headquarters was not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's mother, Melissa Halliday, said she hoped the suit would  
prompt gun manufacturers to childproof all guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits are the latest in a series against gun manufacturers,  
including several filed by cities seeking reimbursement for costs 
incurred as a result of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorcin emerged from Chapter 11 protection six months ago after  
being hit with two dozen product liability suits, company officials 
have previously said.

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown Charged With Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors filed charges Thursday against  
Hall of Fame football player and actor Jim Brown for allegedly 
threatening to kill his wife and breaking her car windows with a 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	City Attorney Jim Hahn filed one count of making a terrorist  
threat and one count of vandalism, both misdemeanors, against 
Brown, 63, for an alleged incident June 15 at the couple's 
Hollywood Hills home, said Lara Bloomquist, supervising attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was arrested that night after his wife of two years,  
Monique, 25, called 911 at 6:50 p.m. He was booked at the Hollywood 
station and posted $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown later held an impromptu news conference outside their  
home and said she had ``overreacted'' and denied that threats were 
made against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, through his lawyer William Grayson, denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``His wife did not feel threatened and continues to live  
peacefully with her husband,'' Grayson said Thursday. ``They did 
have an argument but there was no violence, no injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is scheduled to appear Tuesday in Municipal Court to enter  
a plea, Bloomquist said. He faces up to 18 months in jail and a 
$2,000 fine if convicted on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown retired from pro football in 1966. Playing for the  
Cleveland Browns, he set many National Football League rushing and 
scoring records. He has appeared in several Hollywood films, 
including ``The Dirty Dozen.''

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Ringleader Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The leader of an illegal-immigrant smuggling ring  
that made about $150 million and slipped thousands of people into 
the United States was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison for 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitin Shettie, also known as Nick Diaz, ran an operation that  
smuggled about 7,200 illegal immigrants over 20 months from India 
into the United States, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shettie pleaded guilty in April to a charge of conspiring to  
launder smuggling proceeds. He was arrested in November following a 
yearlong investigation led by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, federal authorities called it the largest illegal  
alien operation ever uncovered in the United States. Immigrants 
paid $20,000 each, and were hidden in small ``stash houses'' before 
being delivered to U.S. employers seeking inexpensive labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department estimates the organization made about  
$150 million.

	BETHESDA, M.D. (AP) -- Jeane Kirkpatrick may be in the dog house  
with animal lovers after locking her poodle in her car during a 
sweltering summer day. 
</P>
<P>
	The former ambassador to the United Nations under President  
Reagan apparently left her dog Jasper in her Lincoln Continental 
with the windows rolled up as she shopped Saturday at some

Humane Society, said Ms. Kirkpatrick probably didn't know the 
dangers of leaving a dog in a locked car on a hot day. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 162-Year-Old Dam Being Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Heavy equipment began removing a  
162-year-old dam today, unleashing first a trickle, then a torrent 
of water on a portion of the Kennebec River that hasn't flowed 
freely since the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand people including Interior Secretary Bruce  
Babbitt gathered to watch the breaching of the Edwards Dam, hailed 
by many environmentalists as the first dam demolition in the United 
States done against the owners' wishes, in the interest of the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King signaled the start of the process by ringing a  
bell from the west bank of the river. 
</P>
<P>
	More bells rang from a nearby church steeple and many in the  
crowd applauded as a big backhoe ripped into a temporary cofferdam. 
Within seconds, first a trickle and then a rush of water flowed 
through a 60-foot gap that had already been cut in the 
917-foot-wide dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Dams have fallen in other states, including North Carolina,  
California and Oregon. But the Edwards Dam, which produced only a 
small amount of electricity, is the first forcibly removed under a 
policy that weighs power needs against environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam is to be dismantled by Thanksgiving.  
</P>
<P>
	``With the removal of the Edwards Dam, the Kennebec River has  
been given a new lease on life,'' said Steve Brooke, coordinator of 
a coalition of conservation and fishing groups that pushed for the 
dam's removal. 
</P>
<P>
	The process leading to the breach has been watched closely by  
dam opponents in the West, where entire salmon runs are extinct and 
others from California to Washington state are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has encouraged the opponents by saying the nation's  
75,000 dams should not be seen as immovable monoliths like the 
pyramids of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	He said today's precedent marks a new era of cooperation between  
environmentalists and dam owners. But he also called the event 
``bittersweet'' because of the role the dam played in people's 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam, about 40 miles from the ocean, has blocked Atlantic  
salmon, endangered shortnose sturgeon and other sea-run fish for 
162 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists have labored for years to restore a river that  
was so polluted and choked by industrial wastes that the Capitol 
windows had to be closed in the summer several decades ago to keep 
out the stench. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam rose amid some local opposition in 1837 along a river  
that had been known for its thriving fishery. It supplied 
mechanical power to sawmills and a riverside cotton mill, and later 
was fitted to generate hydroelectric power. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the dam argued it generated only 3.5 megawatts, or  
one-tenth of 1 percent of the state's power -- an amount, they said, 
which could be offset if 75,000 light bulbs were replaced with more 
energy-efficient types. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam's owner, Edwards Manufacturing Co., proposed upgrading  
the output to 11 megawatts. But the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission denied the company's application in 1997 and ordered the 
dam demolished, reasoning that the environmental damage greatly 
outweighed its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was the first time the government required the removal  
of a dam whose license holder wanted to continue operations. 
Congress had passed a law in 1986 requiring FERC to balance power 
generation and environmental protection when it licenses 
hydroelectric dams. 
</P>
<P>
	FERC's predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, had authorized  
the removal of several dams since the 1920s. But those license 
holders wanted to abandon the projects anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The breaching is expected to lower the Kennebec above the dam by  
about 8 feet within a day, allowing workers to begin the task of 
dismantling the structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the job is done in November, the old cribwork-and-stone  
dam will have been picked to pieces and carted off in about 7,000 
truckloads, said Bruce Skilling, supervisor in charge of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the state, which took over possession of the dam,  
see a resurgence of recreational fishing and boating as the river 
returns to its early-1800s state. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Bowman of American Rivers, part of the Kennebec  
Coalition, called Edwards the largest dam east of the Mississippi 
to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all environmentalists were cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Carter of the Forest Ecology Network said the financing  
plan for the removal compromises the overall environmental benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Private companies who raised more than $7 million to pay for  
demolition received the right to fill in wetlands downstream and 
delay construction of fish ladders on several dams upstream, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmental gains minus environmental gains equals zero  
environmental gains,'' Carter said.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Hits 30th As Clinton Watches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For Sammy Sosa, it was quite an unusual good-luck  
charm: President Clinton, standing in the owner's box with a 
half-eaten hot dog and a Chicago Cubs cap in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his 30th home run of the season Wednesday shortly after  
the president arrived at Wrigley Field in Chicago to watch Sosa, 
one of his favorite athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings good luck,'' Sosa said of Clinton. ``A big guy like  
that comes to town to see the game -- it doesn't look too good if we 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 on Sosa's solo homer.  
Clinton -- dropping his usual impartiality during sporting events -- 
cheered, waved to fans, gave a thumbs-up and mouthed hellos. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did what everybody else in the entire stadium did,'' said  
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``The Brewers played well, the 
Cubs played well. But the player the president takes a special 
interest in made the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the timing of Clinton's arrival and Sosa's home  
run was the president's ``latest example of a long-standing 
streak'' of luck. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Cubs general manager Ed Lynch took Clinton to  
the clubhouse to congratulate Sosa. Lockhart said Clinton and Sosa 
hadn't seen each other since Sosa came to the White House in 
January; Clinton had invited Sosa to attend the State of the Union 
address as his guest. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Sosa chatted for 10 minutes in the locker room and  
for another 10 minutes alone in a nearby room. Sosa gave Clinton a 
blue Cubs jacket and a red Beanie Baby bear with a Cubs emblem on 
the package. The two exchanged autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked whether his wife, Hillary, would allow him to  
keep the Cubs jacket, given her newfound loyalty to the New York 
Yankees. Clinton nodded yes -- after a slow pause. He teasingly 
chastised a reporter who asked whether the first lady was still a 
Cubs fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't play press games here,'' he said, smiling. ``This is  
about sports, not politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president went to Wrigley Field following a speech to pitch  
his new Medicare proposal to senior citizens. He was so excited 
about attending the game that he announced it at the start of his 
speech -- to the annoyance of the Secret Service, which didn't 
exactly want the world to know his plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton paused at a local hotel to change out of his business  
suit and keep tabs on the Northern Ireland peace talks. He spoke 
for about 10 minutes with British Prime Minister Tony Blair to get 
an update, then zipped over to the game, where the score was 4-3 
Brewers in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The president settled in the Cubs' owner's box, looking relaxed  
in a yellow, open-necked shirt and brown blazer. He waved to the 
fans. Some booed, others craned to catch a view of him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the seventh inning, Clinton joined in singing  
the traditional baseball anthem, ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game.'' 
Moments later, Sosa knocked the ball over the left field wall and 
Clinton neglected his hot dog long enough to stand and applaud. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa now has reached 30 homers in a season for the sixth time.  
He has homered in four consecutive games, his longest streak since 
last June 3-8.

<HEADLINE> New Gov't Investigation Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A day after the independent counsel law  
expired, Attorney General Janet Reno took authority Thursday to 
appoint special prosecutors to investigate alleged wrongdoing by 
presidents and top government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules announced by the Justice Department replace the  
21-year-old independent counsel law. That statute died after years 
of controversy over investigations such as Lawrence Walsh's of the 
Reagan-era Iran-Contra affair and Kenneth Starr's of President 
Clinton's involvement in Whitewater and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Reno and Starr urged Congress in the spring to let the  
independent counsel law lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said at a news conference  
the new rules were intended to ``strike the proper balance between 
accountability and independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these regulations will ensure integrity,  
independence and accountability in high-profile investigations,'' 
Holder said. ``It is time to move on from our experience with the 
independent counsel act and to return this nation back to the 
principles that have guided law enforcement for nearly 200 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules give Reno the sole authority to appoint a prosecutor,  
to be called a special counsel, if she determines the Justice 
Department would have a conflict of interest in investigating 
allegations of wrongdoing, and if she decides that naming an 
outside prosecutor would be in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno would outline the boundaries of the investigation, although  
a special prosecutor could ask her to expand those boundaries to 
cover new matters that surface. 
</P>
<P>
	A special counsel would not be subject to day-to-day supervision  
by the Justice Department but would be required to comply with its 
practices and seek guidance from department officials on those 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department commentary on the rules said that provision  
would ``help to guard against a special counsel becoming too 
insulated and narrow in his or her view of the matter under 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor would have to notify the attorney general before  
seeking an indictment in a sensitive case, and she could veto a 
planned indictment. Reno also would have veto power over appeals 
and in some instances over investigative steps she considered 
unwarranted or inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	If she vetoed a proposed action by a prosecutor, she would be  
required to notify Congress at the end of the investigation and 
explain why the action was not approved.

	Special counsels could be fired for good cause by the attorney  
general. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department would set a special counsel's budget. An  
outside prosecutor's final report would be submitted to the 
attorney general and generally would be kept confidential unless 
the attorney general determined it should be publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the independent counsel law, prosecutors were named by a  
three-judge panel. Although they generally were supposed to follow 
Justice Department policies, prosecutors in effect had free rein to 
decide how to handle an investigation, how much money to spend and 
what court appeals to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel law was enacted as a response to the  
1973 Saturday Night Massacre, in which two attorneys general 
resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's demand that they 
fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

<HEADLINE> Download Delays Bug Online Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- As much as $4.35 billion in  
electronic commerce may be lost annually in the United States 
because online shoppers frustrated with slow download times simply 
give up making a purchase, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Wednesday by Zona Research says one-third of  
online shoppers may not buy an item over the Internet due to the 
slowness of the experience, whether caused by their own modems or a 
failure at a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	A crash at the eBay auction Web site in early June indicated how  
costly any failure can be for an e-commerce Web site. The Web site 
was down for about 24 hours on June 10 and 11, resulting in a 
revenue loss of between $3 million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zona study found that 44.1 million people are currently  
shopping online, with some 37.5 million new online shoppers 
expected within the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent University of Texas study revealed that online shoppers  
generated nearly $102 billion in sales, or 1 percent of the 
nation's gross domestic product, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zona study said the biggest losses would be at Web sites  
with pages that take longer than eight seconds to load for users 
with a 14.4 kilobyte modem. Those sites stand to lose $876 million 
a year, the study said.

	House Passes Consumer Privacy Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Thursday to give consumers the  
right to block banks and other financial companies from sharing 
their personal data with outside firms. The vote on privacy 
measure, proposed by House Republican leaders, was 427-1. It was 
attached to sweeping legislation which would allow banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies to merge. The bill was 
passed, 343-86.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More evidence of mass killings  
emerged Thursday in Kosovo as President Slobodan Milosevic won 
conditional support from a key opposition group, furthering his 
campaign to retain power and avoid war crimes prosecution. The 
commander of U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, meanwhile, warned that 
his soldiers face a continuing threat from Serb paramilitaries who

<P>
	LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- As fighting intensified in southeastern  
Congo, Zambian officials tried Thursday to salvage stalled talks on 
a cease-fire to end the country's civil war. African foreign and 
defense ministers failed to agree on several key issues and a 
dispute among rival Congolese rebels also delayed talks, a Zambian 
official said on condition of anonymity. Mediators, headed by 
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, were shuttling among 
representatives of warring parties in an effort to resolve 
differences and end the 11-month conflict that has enveloped most 
of Central Africa, he said.

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Rival negotiators failed for a  
second straight day early Friday to form the Protestant-Catholic 
government at the heart of the Northern Ireland peace accord. But 
they agreed to meet for one final session later in the day. British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair presided over more than 12 hours of 
talks, warning during the session that the world would be baffled 
if peace slipped away. Adding to the tensions, scores of marches 
took place Thursday night across Northern Ireland to commemorate 
the slaughter of Ulster Protestants at the Battle of the Somme in 
World War I.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Exactly six months before the year 2000,  
Congress endorsed legislation Thursday to shield businesses from a 
potential flood of Y2K computer-related lawsuits. The White House 
says President Clinton will sign it. A House vote of 404-24 was 
followed by an 81-18 vote in the Senate. The Senate's main sponsor, 
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called passage ``a victory for the 
nation and for the continued prosperity of our economy as we enter

	SAINT-ETIENNE-EN-DEVOLUY, France (AP) -- In the worst cable car  
disaster in French history, a gondola plunged to the ground 
Thursday, killing all 20 people aboard a private lift that was 
carrying workers to a space observatory high in the Alps. The cable 
car was about one-quarter the way up the mountain when it suddenly 
fell 262 feet onto a rock-studded slope above 
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, a ski resort south of Grenoble.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Denver-based Baby Bell phone  
company at the heart of a three-week takeover battle, said Thursday 
it would explore a $34.7 billion offer from Qwest Communication 
International Inc. U S West's decision follows a similar move 
Monday by Frontier Corp., the fifth-largest long-distance company, 
which is weighing a $11.8 billion takeover bid from Qwest. 
Currently, however, both U S West and Frontier have merger 
agreements with Global Crossing Ltd. But on Thursday Global 
Crossing gave U S West permission to provide information to Qwest 
so that they can discuss the rival offer.

Thursday night, getting second-half goals from Brandi Chastain and 
Joy Fawcett to edge Germany 3-2 in their toughest game thus far in 
the Women's World Cup. The Americans advanced to a Fourth of July 
semifinal at Stanford, Calif., against the winner of Thursday's 
late game between Brazil and Nigeria. Before a festive crowd that 
included a late-arriving President Clinton and family, the 
Americans stormed back with a sensational second half and wore down 
the Germans.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The two parties crucial to  
forging a Protestant-Catholic government for Northern Ireland 
accused each other of spurning compromise today, threatening 
negotiations aimed at salvaging last year's peace accord. The 
talks, adjourned early today after going 18 hours straight, were 
set to reconvene at midday. Progress depends on whether the Ulster 
Unionists, Northern Ireland's major British Protestant party, would 
accept a pledge from the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party to do its best 
to deliver the Irish Republican Army's disarmament by May.

aboard, officials said. The cable car fell about 260 feet in 
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, a ski resort south of Grenoble in the 
Hautes-Alpes region of the French Alps. None of the 21 people 
riding the cable car survived the crash, officials at the regional 
prefect's office confirmed. Most of the victims were reported to be 
employees of a nearby observatory.

	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Two Amtrak trains grazed each other  
early today, injuring at least five people. ``We're still not sure 
what happened,'' said Fire Chief Ray Alfred. The accident caused 
the engine car and a baggage car to tip over. The injured were 
taken to St. Vincent's Medical Center in Jacksonville, said 
hospital spokeswoman Kim Welch. The trains were heading in opposite 
directions on the Miami-to-New York City route and were carrying a

more than five weeks of coalition negotiations, Barak announced

``did not cross Iceland's air border'' during a 15-hour training

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Find Success in Silicon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP)-- Chinese and Indian immigrants, coming to  
this country with top notch technical skills and a desire to take 
big chances, are finding great success in the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were immigrants because we were risk takers. We left our  
safe land behind and came to this place looking for something 
bigger and better,'' said Vinita Gupta, board chairman of 
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Digital Link Corp., one of the top 
companies linking businesses on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A new study from the San Francisco-based Public Policy Institute  
of California shows that highly skilled Asian immigrants are now 
senior executives at one-quarter of Silicon Valley's new technology 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	These immigrant-run companies collectively accounted for more  
than $16.8 billion in sales and 58,282 jobs in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the entrepreneurs -- including Ms. Gupta -- arrived in the  
United States after 1970 to pursue graduate studies, according to 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``People from India are highly analytical and technical, but as  
immigrants we have a hard time getting integrated into society,'' 
said Ms. Gupta. ``We have found a great niche in the Silicon Valley 
because we can use our skills and start our own businesses, rather 
than try to fit into the existing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study backs Silicon Valley leaders who persuaded Congress  
this year to provide 142,500 more visas over three years for 
computer savvy foreigners with skills that high tech employers 
contend are tough to find but vital for the industry's continued 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics argue that American workers are being overlooked in  
favor of cheaper labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said the economic contributions of immigrants are not  
limited to their direct role as engineers and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	They also create professional and social networks that  
facilitate immigrant job search, information exchange, access to 
capital and managerial know-how, and the creation of shared ethnic 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The region's most successful Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs  
rely heavily on such ethnic resources while simultaneously 
integrating into the mainstream technology economy,'' said AnnaLee 
Saxenian, the author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	K.B. Chandrasekhar, who came from India to the U.S. in 1990 and  
co-founded Santa Clara, Calif.-based Exodus Communications Inc. a 
few years later, said he mentors as many young Indian entrepreneurs 
as he can find time to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of pride for us,'' said Chandrasekhar, whose  
company has become a leading provider of network management systems 
for companies doing business online.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bankers Want Licenses Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian financiers on Thursday threatened to sue  
the Central Bank for pulling the licenses of four insolvent 
commercial banks this week, calling the move detrimental to the 
country's welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank insisted that its decision to revoke the  
licenses of Uneximbank, Mosbiznesbank, Promstroibank and 
Mezhkombank was taken under pressure from international lending 
organizations and that it was necessary so that Russia could 
qualify for badly needed foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has urged Russia to stop wasting  
scarce resources on subsidies to shaky banks and to accelerate the 
liquidation of insolvent organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president of the Association of Russian Banks, Sergei  
Yegorov, called the decision ``impulsive'' and ``anti-state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The (association) and the Russian banks will seek protection  
in the courts,'' Yegorov added. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko again argued Thursday  
that the four commercial banks had long deserved to lose their 
licenses and that ``naturally there was pressure from the 
international financial community,'' the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But he conceded that closing the insolvent banks won't be easy.  
Russia's 18 largest banks -- many of which are considered bankrupt 
and subject to liquidation -- hold some $850 million in deposits, 
Gerashchenko said. Government officials have long warned that 
shutting down the banks could provoke mass protests and public 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerashchenko said the Cabinet is drafting a bill on partial  
compensation of deposits in the banks that are to be liquidated, 
Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russians have already lost their money since the onset of  
an economic crisis in August, when several large commercial banks 
froze individual deposits or offered to repay hard-currency 
deposits in rubles at an extremely low exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have tried to sue, but usually with little success.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development Thursday, the deputy chief of the  
Interior Ministry's organized crime department, Anatoly Petukhov, 
said that Russian banks are unwittingly holding up to several 
million of counterfeit U.S. dollars on deposit, the ITAR-Tass news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Most savings in Russia are kept in stable foreign currencies,  
especially U.S. dollars and German marks, and the demand for them 
has also given rise to a large counterfeiting industry.

<HEADLINE> Crude Prices Rise; Will Gas Follow? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Crude oil prices are rising to their highest  
level in nearly two years as producers show unusual cooperation in 
working to end world overproduction, but there's no guarantee that 
prices at the pump will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumers surely must delve into their pockets for  
gasoline purchases, a number of variables make it difficult to 
determine just how deep they will have to dig, industry observers 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a wait-and-see game,'' AAA spokesman Mitch Fuqua  
said. ``There are so many factors involved, including whether the 
gas station down the street wants to compete with his neighbor on 
trying to get increased driving demand through competitive prices, 
or by raising prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retail gasoline prices fluctuate based on demand, competitive  
issues, taxes in a geographical region, refinery production and 
capacity, and both present and anticipated future crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, prices at the pump fell nationwide by an average of  
5 cents between early May and early June -- despite tightening 
inventories, which might otherwise drive the price up -- as driving 
demand remained weaker than expected at the start of the peak 
summer period. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gasoline stations  
nationwide, the national weighted average for gasoline, including 
all grades and taxes, was $1.1960 on June 25, up only 0.58 cent per 
gallon from June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, oil producers this week are enjoying the best prices  
they've seen for crude since November 1997 amid sharp declines in 
available supply and intense summer driving demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices for August crude rose 10 cents to $19.39 a barrel  
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, nearly double what it 
was trading for earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in oil prices has not translated into the same jump in  
gas prices, which are on average up 20 cents since February. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent price increase stems from an agreement in March  
between OPEC and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, 
to cut their combined daily production by 2.7 percent, or 2.1 
million barrels, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were skeptical the disparate parties could maintain such  
cuts since quota-busting has been widespread over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	But compliance has reached more than 90 percent, which provides  
a comfortable cushion from the actual production cutbacks needed to 
sustain prices, said energy analyst John Saucer at Salomon Smith 
Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, they've given themselves a lot of breathing room  
and seem to be working with levels of cooperation that we haven't 
seen in a long time,'' Saucer said. ``That means the bias is going 
to be higher for crude, at least through the end of the year, and 
to a lesser extent, for (gasoline and heating oil).'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a similar sharp increase earlier this year was nearly erased  
after refiners stressed by weak profit margins for manufacturing 
gasoline and heating oil also reduced their production of such 
products, slashing the need for crude. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that factor is unlikely to come into play in the  
future because gasoline and heating oil inventories are shrinking 
rapidly, particularly on the West Coast, where driving demand is 
strongest. And that could lead to another increase at the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some areas could see an effect on their gas prices fairly  
quickly,'' said Fuqua of AAA. ``But even in the short-term, there's 
no easy way to predict which way prices are going to turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of cuts comes on top of 3.1 million in  
reductions pledged over the past year -- moves that had little 
effect on prices at the pump amid weak demand in Asia and Europe, 
the widespread cheating on exports and increased output from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted demand also is on the rise in recovering  
Asian economies, a factor that has helped erase a year-to-year 
world oil surplus and could lead to virtually no supplies in 
storage by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	If that occurs, inventories of gasoline and heating oil also  
could fall sharply. That could result in steep price increases if 
driving demand remains relatively strong or if parts of the world 
suffer a frigid winter, Saucer said.

<HEADLINE> 162-Year-Old Dam Being Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- As church bells pealed Thursday, a torrent  
of water was unleashed through a manmade gap in the 162-year-old 
Edwards Dam in the nation's first government-ordered demolition of 
a dam in the name of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of the hydroelectric dam opens an upstream stretch  
of the Kennebec River to Atlantic salmon, striped bass, endangered 
shortnosed sturgeon and other fish for the first time since the 
1830s. 
</P>
<P>
	It is seen as a precedent for other projects, particularly in  
the West, where some dams have been targeted for similar fates. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has fixated the attention of river communities across the  
nation,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who watched from 
the river's edge with hundreds of others as silt-laden water rushed 
downstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said he was told years ago that the project ``was not  
going to happen in my lifetime. And, of course, here we are here 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Angus King started the process by ringing a bell. More  
bells ringing from a church signaled a big backhoe to rip into a 
temporary dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds, a trickle, then a rush, of water flowed through  
a 60-foot gap that had already been cut in the 917-foot-wide 
Edwards Dam, which was made of timber, rock and concrete. It will 
take until November before the demolition is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Dams have been demolished in other states, including North  
Carolina, California and Oregon, but the Edwards Dam, which 
produced only a small amount of electricity, is the first to be 
forcibly removed under a policy that weighs power needs against 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just watched a river being reborn. You don't get to see that  
every day,'' said Margaret Bowman of American Rivers, part of a 
coalition that pressed for the dam's removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy groups were not so moved.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the level of celebration and whether we're  
going to get caught up in a sort of dam hysteria that would lead to 
the removal of other projects without doing the thorough analysis 
that's necessary,'' said Linda Church Ciocci, executive director of 
the National Hydropower Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciocci's group, which represents 140 licensees, also questioned  
whether federal energy regulators had the authority to order the 
demolition. The group is trying to get the order rescinded even 
though the demolition has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the Edwards  
Dam's owners to pay for the removal and restoration of land around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a deal that bothered some environmentalists, Bath Iron  
Works and upstream dam owners agreed to shoulder the cost, putting 
up more than $7 million. In exchange, BIW received the right to 
fill in wetlands downstream and dam owners got to delay 
construction of fish ladders that enable fish to get upstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmental gains minus environmental gains equals zero  
environmental gains,'' said Jonathan Carter of the Forest Ecology 
Network, who still was glad to see the dam go. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam, about 40 miles from the ocean, has blocked sea-run fish  
for 162 years. Conservationists have labored for years to restore a 
river that was once so choked by pollution that the state Capitol 
windows had to stay closed in the summer to keep out the stench. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam rose amid some opposition in 1837 along a river that had  
been known for its thriving fishery. It supplied mechanical power 
to sawmills and a cotton mill, and later was fitted to generate 
hydroelectric power. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argued the dam generated only 3.5 megawatts, or  
one-tenth of 1 percent of the state's power. The owner, Edwards 
Manufacturing Co., wanted to increase output to 11 megawatts. But 
FERC denied the application in 1997 and ordered the demolition, 
citing compelling environmental concerns.

<HEADLINE> Auto Analyst Joins Priceline.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Maryann Keller, a respected Wall Street analyst  
and author of two books on General Motors Corp. and the auto 
industry, has joined the Internet buying service Priceline.com Inc. 
to oversee expansion of its new-car buying program. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller, the lead auto analyst at ING Baring Furman Selz LLC for  
the past 13 years, was named president of Priceline.com's 
automotive services unit Thursday. The new-car buying service is 
being tested in the New York City area and will be expanded 
nationwide by year's end, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com is an Internet service that allows consumers to  
name a price for airline tickets, hotel rooms and loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maryann Keller is in the unique position to leverage her  
extensive experience and contacts to build a world-class team and 
strategy for Priceline.com's automotive services unit,'' said 
Richard S. Braddock, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com is entering an Internet car-buying arena already  
crowded with independent companies, automakers and dealer groups. 
Industry analysts expect the number of consumers using the Internet 
to buy new and used cars and trucks to grow rapidly in the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers using Priceline.com will submit a bid for the make and  
model they want and indicate how far they are willing to travel to 
buy it. Priceline.com will then submit the bid to franchised 
dealers within that area to see if any area willing to sell at that 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other Internet car-buying services promise a low, no-haggle  
price from a participating dealer, who pays a fee for the sales 
leads. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said that while the Internet will not eliminate the need  
for dealerships, it will fundamentally change the way dealers do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely convinced it will change the way people buy  
cars,'' she said. ``The car dealership is now, in effect, open 24 
hours a day. Those that do it and do it effectively can gain share 
in their market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said that after 28 years as an auto analyst, she was  
ready to try something different. 
</P>
<P>
	Priceline.com's car-buying service will be rolled out to other  
markets gradually over the next several months, including such 
large markets as California and Michigan, Keller said.

<HEADLINE> Doomed Amtrak Train Ran Red Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An engineer's error was responsible  
for two Amtrak trains sideswiping each other and injuring eight 
people, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A southbound train rolled through a red signal light requiring  
the engineer to stop, striking the northbound train that was moving 
onto a siding early Thursday, said Russ Gober, lead investigator 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Gober said the engineer radioed: ``I made a bad mistake. I made  
a bad judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trains, both called the Silver Palm, were carrying a  
combined 300 passengers when they collided in downtown 
Jacksonville. The trains were en route between Miami and New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Four locomotives and seven cars derailed, said Jane Covington, a  
spokeswoman for CSX Transportation, which owns the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers said the accident jolted them out of their seats.  
Eight people were released after being treated at hospitals for 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound train was traveling at 55 mph, while the  
northbound train was moving at 14 mph, Gober said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and then I heard my wife. I jumped up and held up  
the top bunk where my kids were sleeping,'' said Modesto Romero of 
Newark, N.J. ``They were a little scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad crews were righting the cars and placing them back on  
the rails Thursday afternoon. The railroad's main line was expected 
to be open today.

<HEADLINE> Both Wimbledon Finals on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Rain-plagued Wimbledon appears headed  
for overtime again. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two matches were completed Thursday and, with tournament  
organizers facing a huge backlog of unfinished matches, both 
singles finals now are set for Sunday, with doubles play likely to 
spill into Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the women's singles and men's and mixed doubles finals  
are Saturday, with Sunday reserved for the men's singles and 
women's doubles finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather forecasters say Wimbledon is so popular this year that  
every rain cloud in the southeast seems to he headed for the All 
England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been scheduling chaos for referee Alan Mills and  
his crew. 
</P>
<P>
	After a virtually uninterrupted first week, the rain washed out  
Tuesday's program entirely and allowed only a handful of matches 
Monday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On what should have been women's semifinals day, organizers had  
to schedule four men's and women's quarterfinals Thursday. 
Persistent showers made it a stop-start day and only two of the 
eight matches -- Steffi Graf beating Venus Williams 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 
and Lindsay Davenport beating defending women's champion Jana 
Novotna 6-3, 6-4 -- were completed. 
</P>
<P>
	With the forecast of a rain-free day Friday, the Wimbledon  
committee hopes to complete two men's quarterfinals which had 
barely started and start two more from the beginning. They also 
have to finish two more women's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	If that goes according to plan, there should be two groups of  
semifinals Saturday and both singles finals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wimbledon seems be in the firing line of any rain that  
develops,'' said Marco Petagna, forecaster at the London Weather 
Center. ``Any rain that's around seems to be in that part of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast for the weekend is not promising.  
</P>
<P>
	``On Saturday, the rain should clear around 7-8 a.m. and it will  
be a case of bright weather with the risk of scattered showers with 
still the potential of a heavier shower,'' Petagna said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be similar Sunday with a mixture of bright spells and  
a few showers. There could well be some general rain setting in 
during the afternoon around 3-4 p.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, the tournament referee, said the club tried to be ``fair  
and evenhanded'' with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The men still have one day per round,'' he said. ``We are  
looking at a Friday, Saturday, Sunday scenario for the women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time both singles finals were played Sunday was 1989  
when Boris Becker and Steffi Graf both won to make it a first ever 
German double. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Wimbledon had to play on a third Monday was in  
1996 when Martina Hingis became the youngest ever Wimbledon 
champion at 16, teaming with Helena Sukova in the women's doubles.

<HEADLINE> Record Co. Charged in Payola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fonovisa, the nation's largest independent  
Latin music record label, was charged along with two of its 
executives with offenses involving payola, or paying radio stations 
to play certain records. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged Fonovisa promotion chief  
Jesus Gilberto Moreno with making improper payments for radio 
airplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonovisa president Guillermo Santiso was charged with a  
payola-related tax violation, and the record label was charged with 
a tax offense for allegedly falsely reporting promotional expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits radio stations from taking money to play  
specific songs without disclosing the payment to listeners. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman and attorneys for the record company had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, Moreno paid $2,000 to a program director to have  
Fonovisa records added to the station's play list, court records 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges come after a two-year investigation of Fonovisa,  
which is owned by Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa and ruled 
Spanish-language airwaves in 1997 with hits from such artists as 
Enrique Iglesias and Marco Antonio Solis. 
</P>
<P>
	The label was accused of making illegal payments to radio  
stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Televisa said last year that it reported the alleged  
illegal activities to the U.S. government and cooperated with the 
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Automakers Make Gains in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- European automakers again posted some of the  
biggest percentage gains in the U.S. market last month, while the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG saw sales fall 5 percent 
compared with record sales a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most European automakers who reported Thursday had double-digit  
gains compared with June 1998, which also was a robust month for 
U.S. sales of cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG reported its strongest June in 26 years and its  
best month overall since May 1979. Its sales were up 23 percent 
over a year ago, due in large part to the success of its redesigned 
Jetta compact sedan -- the nation's best-selling European car. VW 
sold 13,101 Jettas in June for its best month since the nameplate 
was introduced 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi AG had its most successful June since 1987 with a 44  
percent sales increase from a year ago. Its new TT sports car was 
off to a strong start in its second month. Saab AB, meanwhile, had 
a 34 percent sales increase last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in June sales for DaimlerChrysler -- which has  
brands such as Chrysler, Plymouth and Dodge and Jeep -- the 
German-American automaker said the unit posted a record first half 
with just over 1.39 million sales, and had its best quarter ever in 
April through June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the market continues to show strength, and we have a  
robust production schedule planned to match that demand,'' said 
James P. Holden, vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The comparison to June 1998 was tough for DaimlerChrysler. Big  
``loyalty coupon'' discounts that the three Detroit automakers 
offered to consumers that month generated unusually strong sales; 
the former Chrysler Corp. set what was at the time a record for any 
month that June. 
</P>
<P>
	Car sales took the hardest hit at DaimlerChrysler last month,  
down 14 percent, while truck sales were off about 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot was the Jeep division, which set a June record  
with Grand Cherokee sales up 9 percent and Cherokee sales up 20 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. posted a 5 percent gain for its strongest  
June and best-ever second quarter. Though Toyota's U.S. car sales 
were off 10 percent, its truck sales soared 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ominous for Detroit's automakers was the news that Toyota's  
new Tundra full-size pickup had the best first-month U.S. sales of 
any Toyota model ever. Toyota sold 8,011 Tundras last month, 
breaking the previous first-model record of 3,339 set by the Tercel 
subcompact in October 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, GM and Dodge have dominated the full-size pickup market  
for decades. The V8-powered Tundra, assembled in Princeton, Ind., 
is the first serious challenge by a foreign automaker in the 
full-size pickup market. 
</P>
<P>
	New models also helped boost Nissan Motor Co.'s sales up 5  
percent. The new Xterra sport utility vehicle had one of the best 
first month's sales figures in the company's history, with 5,470 
sold. The Nissan Crew cab pickup and Quest minivan also sold well, 
offsetting an 11 percent decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda Motor Co. set June and half-year records; its June sales  
increased just over 1.5 percent. The biggest percentage gains were 
for Honda's minivan and sport utility vehicles, led by a 277 
percent increase for the redesigned Odyssey minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. planned to report their  
June sales Friday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although medical science can help men with low  
sperm counts become fathers, the sons born to such men may be 
infertile, according to a study published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, appearing in the journal Human Reproduction, found  
that a type of genetic defect that causes a low sperm count is 
passed along to sons born to infertile men who use in vitro 
fertilization techniques to father children. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David C. Page, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher  
at the Whitehead Institute and lead author of the study, said that 
about 10 percent of all men who can produce little or no sperm 
suffer from a genetic defect in a part of the Y chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	When these men father children through in vitro fertilization,  
or IVF, said Page, their sons tend to inherit the genetic defect. 
Daughters are not affected since females receive from their fathers 
an X chromosome instead of the Y chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
	This means, said Page, that although IVF may help otherwise  
infertile men produce sons, it will not ensure that they eventually 
will have grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility affects 10 percent to 15 percent of all American  
couples. Men are responsible for about half of infertility 
problems, with an inadequate number of sperm being the most common 
problem. Some men with low sperm counts have a genetic flaw in a 
part of the Y chromosome known as the AZFc. 
</P>
<P>
	A normal sperm count is 50 million to 200 million per cubic  
centimeter of ejaculate. Men with the AZFc genetic mutation may 
have sperm counts of zero to only 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said the AZFc part of the Y chromosome plays a key role in  
the production of sperm. For reasons not understood, he said, some 
men develop a mutation of the AZFc. Since the condition causes 
infertility, the mutation is not thought to be inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Before IVF, such men were unlikely to father children. However,  
an IVF technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, 
enables test tube conception with a single sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICSI technique involves injecting a single sperm into an egg  
in a laboratory dish. When an embryo develops, it is transferred 
into the fallopian tube of the mother and can result in a normal 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters born from this technique are normal, but Page said  
that a genetic study of four sons born to men with flawed AZFc 
genes were found to share the flaw. The study is published this 
week in the journal Human Reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is the first to demonstrate that ICSI does result  
in some men passing the genetic flaw responsible for their 
infertility on to their sons,'' said Page. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery may lead prospective parents to ask that their  
doctor determine the gender of an embryo, said Page. Only female 
embryos would be implanted into the mother. This could ensure that 
the baby would be a fertile daughter instead of an infertile son. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said it is possible that the AZFc flaw may cause the sperm  
count to drop only with age, and that men with the genetic flaw may 
have normal sperm counts during puberty and early adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	If that is the case, he said, sperm could be collected in the  
male's youth and then frozen until he is ready to start a family.

<HEADLINE> Japan Phone Giant NTT Reorganizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese telecommunications company Nippon  
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. implemented its long-planned 
corporate reorganization on Thursday, creating a holding company 
with three phone company subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The move marks part of a major overhaul in Japan's once highly  
regulated phone and communications industry. NTT is the world's 
second largest telecommunications company after AT&AMP;T Corp. of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the restructuring, NTT split its business operations into  
two regional telephone companies and one long-distance and 
international unit, NTT spokesman Kazuhiko Nishizawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The holding company oversees Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East  
Corp. covering eastern Japan, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
West Corp. in the western half of the country, Nishizawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also manages NTT Communications Corp., a long-distance and  
international carrier, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications announced plans  
for NTT's breakup in 1996. The company long had a virtual monopoly 
on local phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, a host of new companies offering both domestic  
and international phone service have entered the market.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices collapsed  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade after forecasters predicted 
hot, dry weather will not linger in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors removed a weather premium that had buoyed the market  
earlier this week on fears that temperatures in the upper 90s 
across the Midwest and parts of the Plains would damage young 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronomists earlier had suggested corn crops in Illinois and  
Iowa, the two largest growing states, were particularly vulnerable 
since they are entering the crucial pollination period that sees 
ears beginning to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
	But while temperatures are expected to soar, beneficial rainfall  
has been and is expected to continue to fall across growing regions 
through the weekend. And the hot weather is expected to abate by 
midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean farmers this spring and early summer have  
enjoyed relatively few weather problems, putting them on track to 
harvest a record soybean crop and the fourth-largest corn crop on 
record, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.58 3/4 a bushel;  
September corn fell 8 cents to $2.08 1/4 a bushel; September oats fell 
3 3/4 cents to $1.11 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans fell 8 cents to 
$4.52 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork futures were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .25 cent to 62.37 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1.42 cents to 75.97 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .03 cent to 44.60 cents a pound; August pork bellies fell 
.30 cent to 36.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Fed Worried About Future Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of the Federal Reserve expressed  
concerns about future inflation at their May meeting, leading them 
to vote unanimously for a policy directive leaning toward an 
increase in interest rates, according to minutes of the meeting 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The minutes of the May 18 discussions showed that the members of  
the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of board members in 
Washington and regional bank presidents, were worried about a 
number of developments that seemed to suggest inflation could start 
to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed, after its latest FOMC meeting, announced on Wednesday  
that it was raising the federal funds rate, the interest that banks 
charge each other on overnight loans, by a quarter-point to 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOMC set the stage for that rate increase by changing its  
policy directive at the May meeting from neutral to one that leaned 
in favor of a rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed officially announced the change in its directive  
immediately following the May discussions, the first time it has 
done so, the minutes released Thursday revealed the internal 
discussions that led to the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members commented that they saw few signs of any moderation in  
the expansion of economic activity from the rapid pace that had 
prevailed in recent quarters,'' the minutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FOMC members agreed that recent improvement in the  
nation's productivity allowed more room for noninflationary 
economic growth, they worried that growth, which came in at a 4.3 
percent annual rate in the first quarter, was still too rapid to 
keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's May discussions occurred only days after the  
government reported that consumer prices, because of a surge in 
energy costs, shot up 0.7 percent in April, the worst showing in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The firming of oil and other commodity prices, the more  
frequent anecdotal reports of increases in some costs and prices 
and the most recent CPI statistics could be read as suggesting at 
least that the trend toward lower inflation was coming to an end 
and perhaps also as harbingers of a less favorable inflation 
performance going forward,'' the minutes said in summarizing the 
closed-door deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	FOMC members said that a key question about future inflation  
prospects was whether productivity, the output per hour of work, 
would continue posting the favorable gains of recent quarters. 
Those gains had allowed companies to pay for wage increases through 
increased output rather than being forced to raise prices to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``While an upward trend in underlying inflation had not  
materialized thus far, the members were concerned that if recent 
developments continued, especially if demand did not slow to a more 
sustainable pace, inflation was more likely to rise over time,'' 
the minutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The minutes showed the vote in May to change the policy stance  
from neutral to one leaning toward a rate increase was 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed announced along with Wednesday's rate increase that it  
had now returned the policy directive to a neutral stance, cheering 
investors who had feared that the Fed's first rate increase in two 
years could be followed by a series of increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed will reveal the vote for the increase in the funds rate  
and the change in the policy stance when it releases the minutes of 
the June 29-30 meeting on Aug. 26.

<HEADLINE> KLA Impostors Add to Kosovo Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Muharrem Halluci didn't give it a  
second thought when someone in a Kosovo Liberation Army uniform 
impounded his car. The underequipped rebel army often ``borrowed'' 
vehicles in its fight against much better outfitted Yugoslav 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Halluci, 54, went to the local KLA headquarters to get  
the car back after the war's end, rebel army officers told him they 
knew nothing about the vehicle -- or the man who had seized it. 
</P>
<P>
	KLA officials say that whenever the rebel army took civilian  
cars, they provided the owners with official papers and told them 
when they would give the vehicle back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a mess,'' Halluci sighed. ``Now a KLA soldier may not be  
a KLA soldier. He may not even be a Kosovar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the chaos of postwar Kosovo, it's difficult to tell genuine  
KLA fighters from impostors. Just 25 miles down the road in Kukes, 
Albania, KLA uniforms sell for about $30. Refugees buy them so that 
they can return home looking like heroes. Thieves and smugglers 
from across the border in Albania use them as a disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo -- where NATO has been struggling since mid-June to  
restore law and order after a 78-day bombing campaign -- has fast 
become a land of opportunity for anyone seeking a fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Yugoslav-Albanian border, routine controls have broken  
down. During the war, fleeing ethnic Albanians were stripped of 
their documents and license plates. Now, according to Albanian 
police who spoke on condition of anonymity, any Albanian-speaking 
person who claims to be a refugee is allowed to cross into Kosovo -- 
even those without passports or license plates on their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the ranks of the refugees include Albanian criminals  
anxious to take part in the looting of Serb homes or establish 
smuggling rings in Kosovo, which had a much higher living standard 
than Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Yugoslav side of the border, German peacekeepers  
routinely stop cars and tractors trying to cross into Albania 
loaded with goods that the Germans suspect have been stolen in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day, we turned back a tractor with a trailer loaded with  
used furniture,'' said German Lt. Norbert Schindler. He admitted, 
however, that it is impossible to screen every vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans also lack both the means and the legal mandate to  
arrest motorists simply on suspicion that they may have looted 
goods. If someone is turned back at the border, he can wait until 
the next shift change at the checkpoint and try his luck again. 
</P>
<P>
	``With sometimes up to 20,000 people crossing in one day, we  
simply cannot remember all the faces,'' Schindler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Germans have taken 60 prisoners, most of whom are  
accused of looting, car theft and rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are accused of serious crimes. We will keep them here  
until the court starts functioning so they can go on trial,'' said 
Lt. Col Dietmar Jeserich at the German KFOR troops' headquarters 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some 25 cars are being reported stolen every night, some  
at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	But stealing the neighbor's cows, chickens or roof tiles is  
considered a minor crime and punishment is only up to three days' 
detention. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, peacekeepers handed over to Albanian police three  
robbers who had jumped onto a bus carrying returning refugees and 
robbed them of jewelry and money. 
</P>
<P>
	For Albanians longing to travel abroad, Kosovo is now the only  
place they can visit without a visa. For some, it's also a good 
place to do business -- legal or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	In the streets of Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city, farmers  
from Albania sell fruit and vegetables out of their trucks at 
sky-high prices. Others work as unlicensed taxi drivers or offer 
black-market gasoline, brought over from Albanian at $5.20 a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the refugees are leaving Albania, the world will  
forget about us again,'' said Kadri Resuli, 35, an Albanian from a 
village near Kukes as he peddled cigarettes on a roadside. ``We 
helped them during these months, now they should help us.''

<HEADLINE> Barron Davis Arrives in Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It wasn't hard to pick out the newest  
member of the Charlotte Hornets at the team's headquarters 
Thursday. Baron Davis was the one walking around with the big 
smile, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours after the Hornets made Davis the third  
overall selection in the 1999 NBA draft, he was starting to 
appreciate the events that landed him in what looks like a 
relatively charmed spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of the NBA draft is such that the high picks  
generally go to the worst teams, and this year's draft followed 
that course -- with the exception of the Hornets and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the other top choices found themselves taken by such  
struggling teams as the Bulls, Grizzlies and Clippers, Davis landed 
with a franchise that has posted three consecutive winning seasons. 
The Hornets rallied in the second half of last season to finish at 
26-24, one game short of a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	But because they failed to qualify for the postseason, they  
wound up in the draft lottery, seemingly destined for no better 
than the 13th selection. But they beat the odds by winning the 
third pick, and now Davis has done the same thing by landing with a 
team that doesn't face a long rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sweet end of the deal,'' a beaming Davis said. ``I  
feel sorry for those other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately ahead for the 20-year-old point guard is acclimating  
himself to the NBA and the Hornets, who already have a starting 
point guard in six-year pro David Wesley. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to help Baron tremendously,'' coach Paul Silas  
said. ``He'll get a chance to work himself in, learn the league, 
learn what he can do and what he can't. There's going to be 
virtually no pressure on him to come out of the gates smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis doesn't plan to be tentative about the start of his NBA  
career. He was known as a tough, physical player at UCLA, and he 
intends to continue that style with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to take your head off,'' said Davis, who bounced  
back from knee surgery to lead UCLA in scoring, assists and steals 
in 1998-99, his second and final season with the Bruins. ``I'm 
trying to go at you all night. If it gets physical, it gets 
physical. That's what I like,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a California native who was raised in the Los Angeles  
area, said staying close to home would have been a preference for 
his pro career. Since that didn't work out, Davis said he's excited 
about coming to Charlotte and adapting to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it as an adjustment, a new beginning in life,'' he  
said. ``It's an opportunity to get away, to be out on my own, get a 
feel for life and grow as an individual. I'm looking forward to the 
challenges ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Find Child in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Archaeologists looking for the remains  
of a Confederate submarine crew under the football stadium at The 
Citadel have discovered the body of a child from the same era in a 
glass-top coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery came yesterday during a search for the crew of the  
H.L. Hunley. 
</P>
<P>
	Some archaeologists think the child may have been buried next to  
its father in the former mariners' graveyard. Its body is encased 
in an expensive coffin with a full-length glass pane for a lid. 
</P>
<P>
	``One could see the sentiment of the time, allowing the child to  
be buried there,'' said Jonathan Leader of the state Institute of 
Archaeology and Anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
	The child could have died from any number of diseases that were  
rampant in Charleston at the time of the Civil War, Leader said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gender of the child has not been determined. Archaeologists  
first thought the child was as old as 11, which, if it were a boy, 
would have made him eligible to be a cabin boy or powder carrier in 
the Confederate Navy. But a forensic dentist determined the child 
was 3 to 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologists hope to find the remains of four Hunley crewmen  
whose bodies were recovered after the submarine sank during a test 
run in 1863. Two sets of possible crewman's remains have been found 
so far in two stacked coffins in a single grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederate sailors were buried at the site when it was the  
city's cemetery for seamen. The site was covered over in 1948 when 
a 21,000-seat stadium was built at the state military college.

<HEADLINE> Exchanges, Online Brokers Wrangle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a lot simpler when stock prices went  
out over the ticker, an invention that revolutionized the 
securities market in 1867 when it came to the New York Stock 
Exchange. Electronic transmission of market data arrived in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Internet gives investors access to instantaneous  
stock quotations, but technology brings complications. Who owns the 
real-time stock quotes? The millions of online investors who 
``create'' them by trading or the stock exchanges? 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers are proposing to protect market databases from  
hackers and pirates without giving the stock exchanges ownership 
rights, and the issue has pitted the exchanges against online 
brokers such as Schwab and Ameritrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage firms pay fees to the nation's stock exchanges for  
the market data, charges which totaled an estimated $414 million 
last year. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, charges the 
firms a penny every time they tap into a real-time stock quote. The 
NYSE has proposed reducing the fee to 0.75 cent, but the brokerages 
maintain that a one-time fee would make more sense than charging 
for each use. 
</P>
<P>
	With the explosion in online investing, real-time stock quotes  
are ``like oxygen to investors,'' Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said 
at a hearing Wednesday of the House Commerce subcommittee on 
finance, which he heads. ``Stock prices are facts, just like any 
facts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oxley noted that some observers, comparing stock quotes in this  
context to sports statistics, have maintained that giving the New 
York Stock Exchange an ownership right would be akin to Major 
League Baseball asserting a property right to Ted Williams's 
batting average in a given season. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxley, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the full Commerce  
Committee, and some Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation 
that seeks to protect market databases against hackers without 
bestowing new property rights. That way, Oxley said, the measure 
would preserve investors' access to stock price information. 
</P>
<P>
	Annette Nazareth, director of market regulation at the  
Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the financial 
markets, testified that the agency supports the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	She called it ``a balanced and reasonable legislative approach  
to continue the widespread availability of real-time market 
information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A competing version, authored by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,  
would give the NYSE, the Nasdaq Stock Market and other exchanges 
more control over the databases. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Bernard, executive vice president and general counsel of  
the NYSE, said the nation's largest stock exchange needs the money 
it gets from selling data to run its operations and detect and 
prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that consumers should have ready access to all  
types of financial information, including real-time market data,'' 
Bernard testified. ``The NYSE wants to disseminate as much 
real-time market data to the public (as possible). It is extremely 
easy to obtain free real-time market data on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Carrie Dwyer, executive vice president for corporate  
oversight at Charles Schwab and Co., which calls itself the biggest 
online brokerage in the world, said the public is the true owner of 
market data and it should be fairly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees charged by the exchanges for the data unfairly  
discriminate against online brokerage firms as opposed to 
full-service traditional brokers, and are a ``hidden cost'' passed 
on to investors, Ms. Dwyer maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of market data ... is the single greatest hurdle in  
providing investors with access to market data,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And J. Joe Ricketts, chairman and Co-CEO of online brokerage  
Ameritrade, suggested it should be the other way around: the 
exchanges ought to pay the brokerage firms that provide the data to 
investors.

participate in academic activities at their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to give parents something they don't have enough of --  
time,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who has introduced 
legislation to expand the six-year-old law. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's bill has 11 Democratic cosponsors. It has drawn no  
support so far from majority Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the expansion should not add any cost to  
businesses because the 24 hours would come out of the 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave already available to care for a new child, a seriously 
ill family member or a personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The law only applies to companies with 50 or more workers, as  
would Murray's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24 hours would be available only for academic activities  
such as parent-teacher conferences, researching new schools or 
educational events; sports or other extracurricular activities 
would not be included. 
</P>
<P>
	Randel Johnson, a vice president for the U.S. Chamber of  
Commerce, the world's largest business federation, said the law 
already is troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses have difficulty replacing workers because the unpaid  
leave can taken in fragmented segments, he said. Also, serious 
illness is defined loosely, creating confusion for administrators, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems ``ought to be looked at, reviewed and corrected  
before people talk about expanding it,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray's proposal is the latest to expand the 1993 law. Earlier  
this year, President Clinton and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
the law's chief author, called for companies with more than 25 
workers to participate.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt Casino Probe Said Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An investigation into whether Interior  
Secretary Bruce Babbitt lied to Congress about the rejection of a 
proposed Indian casino -- and whether campaign contributions were 
involved -- is nearing its conclusion, according to the special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt testified before a grand jury investigating the matter  
Wednesday, but neither his spokesman nor officials of the 
prosecutor's office would provide any details or even confirm the 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Independent Counsel Carol Elder Bruce provided a  
glimpse of the progress being made in her investigation in a letter 
to the U.S. attorney's office in Wisconsin, a copy of which was 
made available Wednesday to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	She said in the letter that she was ``nearing the end of our  
factual investigation and are in the process of reviewing the facts 
and the law in order to reach a final conclusion'' on whether to 
seek any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	She estimated that she would complete the investigation by  
mid-August. She wrote the letter to request an additional 60-day 
postponement of consideration of a civil suit involving the casino 
decision. She previously had been granted three such postponements 
and wrote, ``I fully expect this to be the last request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce has been concerned the civil suit would adversely affect  
the integrity of her 14-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The special prosecutor is trying to determine, among other  
things, whether Babbitt lied under oath before a Senate committee 
about the circumstances surrounding the decision in 1995 to reject 
a casino application from three Chippewa tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce is also looking into whether promises of Democratic  
campaign contributions by opponents of the casino influenced the 
decision. Tribes opposing the casino later gave the Democratic 
National Committee nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has vigorously denied any connection between campaign  
contributions and the decision to reject the casino planned in 
Hudson, Wis. He also has denied intending to mislead senators 
during a sometimes contentious hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But a longtime friend, Paul Eckstein, who was a lobbyist for the  
tribes seeking the casino, testified to the same Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee that Babbitt -- during a meeting the 
day the casino decision was made -- alluded to Democratic campaign 
contributions and pressure from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has said Eckstein misunderstood the conversation and has  
denied misleading lawmakers about the events leading up to the 
casino decision. He also said he made one remark, referring to 
White House pressure, simply to get Eckstein out of the office, and 
that, in fact, there was no such pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt's appearance Wednesday before the grand jury was his  
first. It could not be learned how long he testified, or whether he 
was scheduled to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Department spokesman Mike Gauldin referred questions to  
Babbitt's personal lawyer, Lloyd Cutler, who did not return a phone 
call to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents of the Bruce letter was first reported Wednesday by  
the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Airways Hit by Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- More than half of Olympic Airways flights  
were grounded Thursday as employees staged a strike in protest of a 
management handover to a subsidiary of British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 46 of the 77 planned flights were canceled by the labor  
action at the troubled national carrier during the peak tourism 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Unions at Olympic called the strike after Speedwing, a  
subsidiary of British Airways, took over management in a bid to 
turn around the money-losing airline. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agreement, Speedwing will run Olympic for 30  
months, overseeing a financial rescue plan for the airline long 
plagued by debts and labor disputes. British Airways will be 
allowed to buy a stake in the airline of up to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argues Olympic cannot survive unless it forms  
partnerships with major airlines and insists the deal will not lead 
to job losses.

	Manufacturing Up; Construction Down  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector expanded for  
the fifth straight month in June, and at a stronger pace than 
expected, according to a survey of corporate purchasing managers 
released today. Growth in new orders at the nation's factories 
indicated the upward trend will continue. The National Association 
of Purchasing Agents' monthly index of business activity rose to 57 
percent in June from 55.2 percent in May, In Washington, meanwhile, 
the Commerce Department reported construction spending fell in May 
for a second straight month. That indicated that one of the 
economy's strongest sectors is starting to slow, in part because 
mortgage rates have been rising. The May decline was 0.9 percent.

	DaimlerChrysler's U.S. Sales Fall  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- European automakers again posted some of the  
biggest percentage gains in the U.S. market last month, while the 
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG saw sales fall 5 percent 
compared with record sales a year ago. Most European automakers who 
reported today had double-digit gains compared with June 1998, 
which also was a robust month for U.S. sales of cars and light 
trucks. Volkswagen AG reported its strongest June in 26 years and 
its best month overall since May 1979. Its sales were up 23 percent 
over a year ago. Audi AG had its most successful June since 1987 
with a 44 percent sales increase. Despite the drop in June sales 
for DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep brands, 
the German-American automaker said the unit posted a record first 
half with just over 1.39 million sales, and had its best quarter 
ever in April through June.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate confirmed Lawrence Summers today to  
become Treasury Secretary, elevating him from his No. 2 slot in the 
department to succeed the outgoing Robert Rubin. Senators approved 
Summers' nomination by 97-2, underlining the lack of controversy 
that had accompanied his selection by President Clinton. Summers, 
44, joined Treasury in 1993 as undersecretary for international 
affairs, and has served as Rubin's deputy since 1995.

	Computer Export Restrictions Eased

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton eased export restrictions on

to sell more powerful systems to foreign countries. ``These 
policies will strengthen America's high-tech competitiveness, while 
maintaining controls that are needed to maintain our national 
security,'' Clinton said in a written statement. The industry had 
sought the change because current restrictions, designed to keep 
advanced technology out of the hands of hostile militaries, have 
failed to keep up with the advances in commercially available 
computers.

business that's roughly $6 billion in size,'' Dell said last night. 
``Essentially, in the United Kingdom, we're pretty much tied for 
No. 1.... Our models work better there than in the U.S.'' The 
company, which sells a majority of its computers to businesses, 
governments and other public institutions, reported revenues 
exceeding $5.5 billion in the fiscal quarter that ended in April, 
up 41 percent from a year ago.

and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in 
lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the 
year. Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 
60 cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late yesterday 
predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the 
next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations. Company 
executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core 
coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't 
happen, CEO Howard Schultz said. Starbuck shares were down 10 5/8 at 
26 15/16.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Drops Rates, Hikes Monthly Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T lowered long-distance rates for basic  
residential customers, passing on savings from a government-ordered 
reduction in the fees long-distance companies pay to local carriers 
to connect calls. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company also announced that certain  
monthly charges would go up, prompting consumer groups to contend 
that these increases would offset the decline in rates for most 
residential phone users. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers not enrolled in one of the company's calling plans  
will see a drop of 2 cents, from 28 cents to 26 cents, per minute 
for Monday through Friday daytime calls. Basic rate weekend calling 
will decline to 11 cents per minute from 11.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend in the industry is that long distance rates are  
going down because of the decline in the access fee,'' said Jim 
McGann, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies also have sought to restructure the way  
such charges are passed on to consumers, by moving them out of 
per-minute rates and into flat-rate fees. AT&AMP;T announced an 
increase in the ``carrier line charge,'' which the company collects 
from residential customers to reimburse local phone companies. 
Starting July 1, this charge will rise from 85 cents to $1.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Another line-item charge, the ``universal connectivity charge,''  
which goes to a fund that supports affordable phone service in high 
cost areas and telephone service for schools and libraries, will 
increase by 6 cents to 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups say many residential phone users do not use  
enough long-distance time to balance out the increases in the 
monthly charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the vast majority of consumers, AT&AMP;T's rate reduction  
comes nowhere near offsetting these new monthly fees, leaving 
consumers with higher bills even though costs to long distance 
companies are coming down dramatically,'' said Gene Kimmelman of 
Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Only high-volume users, such as businesses, are likely to  
benefit from the changes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard said  
earlier this week the half-billion-dollar reduction in access fees 
makes available to long distance companies should be used to lower 
long-distance rates for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If consumers see higher flat fees without reduced per-minute  
rates, they may want to shop around for another long-distance 
company,'' Kennard advised. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI said Thursday that it has not yet determined how the  
reductions in access charges will be passed on to their customers. 
Previous reductions were used to offer customers 5-cents-per-minute 
calling on Sundays, instead of a decrease in basic rates, said MCI 
spokesman Brad Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do know is our customers will continue to fully  
benefit from access reductions as they have in the past,'' Burn 
said. MCI will be increasing its universal service charge -- which 
goes into the fund for schools and libraries -- from 6 percent to 
7.2 percent of the customer's monthly usage bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint was expected to announce changes associated with the  
restructuring in access charges on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Germans Find Kosovo Massacre Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- German peacekeepers today uncovered  
new evidence of mass killings by Serb paramilitary forces, some of 
whom might still be operating in Kosovo in violation of the NATO 
peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander of U.S. peacekeepers warned that his soldiers face  
a continuing threat from the Serb paramilitaries who remained in 
the province despite a peace agreement stipulating that all 
Yugoslav forces should be gone by now. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwestern Kosovo, German troops found the graves of 119  
people whom villagers said were murdered by Serbs on March 25 -- a 
day after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. The bodies were found near 
Celine and Nagafc, and local villagers said they believed more 
victims remain undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
	German troops took reporters today to Celine but were unable to  
continue to nearby Nagafc, a half-mile away, because of land mines. 
German officers said both villages appeared to have been targeted 
by Serbs who burned and buried some of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are dead bodies still lying inside houses in that  
village,'' said Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, referring to Nagafc. 
</P>
<P>
	In Celine, villagers said Myftar Zeqiri, 60, and 22 other  
members of his family were later buried by survivors in a common 
grave, about 100 yards from their house. Clothes, mattresses and 
shoes were still strewn over a path leading from the burned-up 
house to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd been hiding there when the Serbs found them and killed  
them all,'' said Hamid Rexhepi, a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, U.S. Brig. Gen. John Craddock said his troops still  
face threats from both remnants of the Serb forces and from ethnic 
Albanian rebels who don't want to disarm. He declined to say which 
was a greater threat. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that U.S. forces were investigating reports  
that Serb paramilitaries are still operating in Kosovo. American 
troops came under sniper fire twice last week but suffered no 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a dangerous environment out there,'' he said. ``There are  
elements ... who wish KFOR forces ill,'' referring to the 
peacekeepers by their acronym. ``This is not going to be a quick 
fix. There are still too many acts of violence. There are still too 
many homes burning at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 860,000 ethnic Albanians fled Serb forces and Kosovo  
beginning in March; more than half have returned since the war 
ended last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, meanwhile, the government appeared to be pursuing a  
two-track strategy: overtures to certain opposition groups while 
cracking down on others demanding President Slobodan Milosevic's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgrade military court has launched a criminal  
investigation against opposition leader Zoran Djindjic for failing 
to respond to a draft notice during the 78-day NATO bombing 
campaign, his lawyer Sinisa Nikolic said. Such an investigation is 
often the first step toward a formal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic summoned other parties  
to a meeting today to discuss how to rebuild the country. The 
invitation appeared aimed at exploiting divisions in opposition 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The invitation came on Wednesday, one day after some 10,000  
people rallied in a central Serbian city calling for Milosevic's 
resignation in the first such protest since the NATO bombing 
campaign ended on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Parties in the Alliance for Change, which organized the rally,  
were not invited to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, the moderate Serbian  
Renewal Movement, and reformists in Yugoslavia's smaller republic 
Montenegro were invited. The Montenegro reformists -- the Democratic 
Party of Socialists -- immediately rejected the offer.

<HEADLINE> House Nears Vote on Consumer Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House neared a vote Thursday on a measure  
that would give consumers the right to block banks and other 
financial companies from sharing their personal data with outside 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Disgruntled Democrats, who had pushed a stricter privacy  
provision, tried to scuttle sweeping legislation allowing banks, 
securities firms and insurance companies to merge. Their attempt 
failed on a 227-203 party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy measure was proposed by House Republican leaders as  
an amendment to the financial overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House supports in principle the proposed dismantling  
of Depression-era barriers to the combination of banks, brokerages 
and insurers, and while it objects to parts of the House bill, it 
has not threatened a veto over the privacy measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of privacy -- a new preoccupation of Congress -- has  
struck a chord with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	The desire for privacy ``runs through the veins of the American  
people,'' Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., said on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton recently urged Congress to bolster consumers'  
rights when banks and other financial companies seek to share 
information about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, including Ralph Nader, have maintained that  
the financial overhaul legislation would create serious privacy 
risks for Americans as banks, brokerages and insurers compiled 
profiles of customers' buying habits, hobbies and health 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-backed privacy provision is ``a sellout to the banking  
and financial services industry, which wants to use the private 
information of consumers to carry out wide-ranging cross-marketing 
schemes,'' Nader said Thursday in a letter to House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy protection has emerged as a key element of the sweeping  
legislation to restructure the financial service industry, which 
has come closer to enactment this year than in 20 previous years of 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation, led by Wall  
Street and the banking and insurance industries, maintain it is 
needed to keep the U.S. financial industry competitive in global 
markets and that it would save consumers millions by providing 
one-stop financial shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats, led by Reps. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and John  
Dingell, D-Mich., had pushed a provision that would enable 
consumers to stop banks, securities firms and other financial 
companies from sharing their personal data with either affiliated 
or outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee, in a surprise move, adopted the  
provision. But it was removed from consideration Wednesday by the 
House Republican leadership, which controls the rules of debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-backed alternative, preferred by the financial  
industries, would let consumers block companies from selling their 
data to outside firms, such as telemarketers, but not from sharing 
it with affiliated companies under the same corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing of customer information, such as addresses, phone  
numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and checking and 
credit card account information, is a major reason why financial 
companies want to merge. The data sharing opens numerous 
opportunities for the companies to market their services. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill also would make it a federal crime for anyone to  
misrepresent himself to obtain someone's private financial data. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Both Parties Excel at Fundraising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With control of both houses of Congress at  
stake in the 2000 election, two party committees that help 
congressional candidates are taking in record amounts of campaign 
cash this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $26  
million between Jan. 1 and June 30. The Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee took in $12 million during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, reported that it  
had finally raised enough to retire its debt from the 1996 
elections, when the DNC refunded around $3 million amid allegations 
that the contributions illegally came from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC reported taking in more than $21 million during the  
first six months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures include money raised under federal contribution  
limits that can be used to directly aid congressional candidates, 
and the unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions 
and individuals known as soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	The party committees reported their hauls a day after Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush smashed fund-raising records for presidential 
campaigns, taking in more than $36 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other main party committees -- the Republican National  
Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the 
National Republican Senatorial Committee -- declined to release 
their midyear fund-raising totals Thursday. They do not have to 
file with the Federal Election Commission until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican congressional committee's fund-raising is up 63  
percent from the first six months of 1997, when it raised $16 
million. The NRCC also paid off its $3.6 million debt from last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Set a pro-famliy, pro-growth agenda and Americans will respond  
with their hearts and wallets,'' said NRCC Chairman Tom Davis, 
R-Va. ``The NRCC's record-setting budget numbers and recent 
congressional generic ballot figures prove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One way the NRCC raises money is by inviting industry  
representatives who donate $10,000 apiece to discuss issues with 
key GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the technology industry breakfasted Thursday  
with Davis; Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House 
Commerce Committee; and Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of 
Commerce's telecommunications subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Senate committee, which raised more than $8  
million during the first six months of 1997, surpassed that total 
by almost 50 percent this year, taking in $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our supporters recognize that this is perhaps the most  
important election cycle in a generation,'' said the DSCC's 
chairman, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``They have been energized 
by the successes of the 1998 cycle and are committed to building 
the strength -- both financial and organizational -- to restore a 
Democratic majority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee reported raising more than $21  
million between Jan. 1 and June 30, enough to finish paying off its 
debt from the 1996 elections. Two years ago, the debt stood at $16 
million. As of March 31, the debt was $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The party took in slightly more than the amount of money it  
raised during the same period two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,  
John Del Cecato, would say only that the committee expected to 
reach its goal of $14 million for the first six months of 1999. 
That would be double the $7 million the committee raised during the 
same period two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican senatorial committee, which reports monthly,  
raised almost $11 million through May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee raised almost $32 million  
through May 31. Between Jan. 1 and June 30, 1997, the RNC took in 
$39 million.

<HEADLINE> Woolworth Hit With Age Bias Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woolworth Corp. fired dozens of employees in  
stores across the nation because they were over 40 years old, 
according to an age discrimination lawsuit filed Thursday by the 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal court suit alleges that between September 1995 and  
October 1997, older employees were targeted for layoffs and 
replaced by younger workers from outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The firings occurred at individual Woolworth stores and were  
approved by the company's human resource department, according to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolworth's, which opened its first store in 1879, closed its  
final shop in 1997. It has since changed its name to the Venator 
Group, Specialty, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The parent company, the Venator Group, continues to operate Foot  
Locker and other retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Venator spokeswoman Eleanor Linek declined to  
comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges that some of the fired employees had worked at  
Woolworth for several decades, including some workers who were 70 
years or older. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reductions in (work) force may be a necessary fact of economic  
life; age discrimination is not,'' said Spencer H. Lewis Jr., 
director of the EEOC's New York district office. ``Productive 
hard-working employees with 20 to 30 years experience deserve 
better than to be displaced by younger, less-experienced persons 
hired off the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-five people have claimed that Woolworth fired them because  
they were deemed too old, though the EEOC said the number may be as 
high as 300. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks back pay for the former employees, monetary  
damages and an injunction to keep the company from discriminating 
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Campus Gun Possession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- About 3.5 percent of college students have guns at  
school, a statistic that doubles among students with serious 
alcohol problems, Harvard researchers said in a study to be 
published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With 14 million students in the nation's four-year and two-year  
colleges, that means there are as many as 450,000 students with 
guns, said Dr. Matthew Miller, a senior researcher at Harvard's 
Injury Research and Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is based on a sample of some 15,000 students at 130  
four-year colleges and did not account for hunting weapons. The 
results appear in the July issue of The Journal of American College 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun possession is significantly more likely among students who  
binge drink and drive or who damage property after drinking, the 
report said. Binge drinking was defined as having five or more 
drinks at a sitting. 
</P>
<P>
	The connection is worrisome, said Henry Wechsler, principal  
investigator at the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol 
Study. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same, however, ``I don't want to give the impression that  
there are thousands of drunk college students shooting people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on 1997 questionnaires filled out  
anonymously by students. The questionnaire primarily focused on 
alcohol use, but also asked students if they had a working firearm 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
	Results showed that 3.5 percent of students surveyed said they  
owned guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall number increased to 7 percent among those who said  
they were likely to binge drink and drive or damage property after 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The study had a margin of error of 1 percentage point.  
</P>
<P>
	Although it's possible some students may have been lying or  
exaggerating on their questionnaires, Miller said he takes their 
answers seriously because the forms were anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found gun possession at college was more common  
among whites than among minority groups, and more prevalent among 
students who belonged to fraternities or sororities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun ownership differed according to the region of the country.  
</P>
<P>
	Six percent of students attending colleges in the South had  
guns, compared with 4 percent in the West and 1 percent in the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that two-thirds of the student gunowners  
live off-campus. Although most colleges prohibit guns on campus, 
researchers estimate students keep at least 100,000 guns in the 
nation's dormitories.

<HEADLINE> Victims Decry Okla. Bombing Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Victims of the Oklahoma City bombing denounced a  
decision by a federal appeals court to toss out the 12-year prison 
sentence given to Michael Fortier, the man who failed to alert 
authorities to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes me more upset than anything against Fortier is that  
this man was technically out of it and all he had to do was make 
one dang phone call to prevent it from happening,'' said Dan 
McKinney, whose wife, Secret Service Agent Linda McKinney, was 
killed in the 1995 blast. ``He's going to get slapped on the 
wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that  
Fortier's sentence should have been based on guidelines for 
involuntarily manslaughter rather than the significantly higher 
guidelines for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, pleaded guilty to having advance knowledge of the  
plot to bomb the building. He testified against Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols, admitting he helped McVeigh move and sell stolen 
weapons and lied to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said even though Fortier's conduct ``bordered  
on recklessness,'' the district court went too far using 
first-degree murder guidelines to set his sentence and $200,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesser guidelines would have put Fortier's sentence at a  
maximum of 51 months, said his lawyer, Michael McGuire. Fortier 
began serving his sentence in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, wouldn't comment  
until prosecutors had a chance to review the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing killed 168 people and injured hundreds more.  
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was convicted of murder, conspiracy and weapons charges.  
He is appealing his death sentence. Nichols was convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy and sentenced to life in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Passage of FAA Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress' scheduled summer recess only  
five weeks away, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater urged the 
Senate on Thursday to pass a bill that would renew the Federal 
Aviation Administration for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary said that the bill, which has been delayed three  
times, includes critical funding for airport and air traffic 
control modernization, management changes at the FAA and a 
long-term, stable source of income for the agency. The latest 
extension expires on Aug. 6, the day Congress is scheduled to begin 
its summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I clearly think it needs to be made more of a priority,''  
Slater said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Senate leaders to pass the bill if only so it can be  
moved into a conference committee, where it can be reconciled with 
similar legislation already passed by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	It is in such committees that most congressional horse-trading  
occurs. The committees are also a prerequisite to developing a 
completed piece of legislation for final votes in the House and 
Senate and signature by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	While Slater refused to comment, legislative sources say the  
bill is hung up in the Senate over two issues favored by Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, wants  
increased flights at airports in New York, Washington and Chicago, 
as well as 24 daily exemptions to the current 1,250-mile limit on 
flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who is running for the Republican presidential  
nomination, has said both changes would benefit business and 
consumers alike. Legislators from the surrounding areas have fought 
back, saying the changes would increase noise and create safety 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator's spokeswoman said that, like Slater, McCain wants  
the legislation resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is McCain's intention to have comprehensive legislation  
pass this year,'' said spokeswoman Pia Pialorsi. ``We're simply 
waiting for (Senate Majority Leader Trent) Lott to schedule it for 
floor action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for whether McCain remained insistent on the flight and  
perimeter-rule provisions, Pialorsi said: ``He will try to pass the 
bill that passed the committee.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 39.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, with blue chips  
inching back to record levels, as investors got their bearings in 
the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
39.58 at 11,010.38 after searching for a direction in morning 
trading. Since hitting a new closing high of 11,107.19 on May 13, 
the Dow has struggled to revisit the 11,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also reversed early losses. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.77 to 1,375.43, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 17.79 to 2,703.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices briefly faltered in tandem with bond prices, which  
dropped after the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported the manufacturing sector expanded at a 
stronger-than-expected pace in June. The report suggested the 
threats of inflation that first prompted the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates Wednesday may not have evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets rallied after the Fed followed  
through on expectations and raised rates one-quarter percentage 
point. But bonds sank today, pushing the yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond to 6.06 percent, up from 5.96 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, stocks were shrugging off the bond market's concerns.  
``A little hiccup in bond land is not likely to end the mania on 
Wall Street,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors sent the Dow up 155.45 points and the S&AMP;P 500  
and the Nasdaq to new closing highs Wednesday after the Fed's 
announcement. More than the rate increase, which was widely 
expected and frequently telegraphed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
investors applauded the Fed's policy shift to a ``neutral'' bias on 
the need for future rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet coffee company Starbucks tumbled after surprising Wall  
Street with a forecast of lower than expected earnings for the next 
two quarters and for the year. Starbucks shares fell 12 3/8 to 25 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were mostly higher, led by Eli Lilly, which gained 2  
1/16 to 73 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 382.94 million shares, ahead 
of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.89 at 649.02, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.92 at 794.01.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wife Gets $22M in Divorce Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The ex-wife of Warner LeRoy, owner of the posh  
Tavern on the Green, will still be able to eat at the finest 
restaurants thanks to a $22 million-plus divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge Wednesday granted Kay LeRoy $15 million, a house in Long  
Island worth about $5.5 million, art by Picasso and Monet and 
$65,000 a month for the rest of her life, her lawyer David Aronson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Walter Tolub, who presided over the bitter divorce trial  
last year, gave Mrs. LeRoy about 40 percent of the $47 million 
marital estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got substantially less in legal fees than they asked  
for,'' said LeRoy's lawyer, Jeffrey Cohen. ``There are substantial 
issues to be determined on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The LeRoys married in 1970 and had three children, all of whom  
are now in their 20s. LeRoy, 63, is a descendant of the movie 
moguls who started Warner Bros. Studios.

<HEADLINE> Fertility Techniques May Harm Kin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Although medical science can help men with low  
sperm counts become fathers, the sons born to such men may be 
infertile, according to a study published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, appearing in the journal Human Reproduction, found  
that a type of genetic defect that causes a low sperm count is 
passed along to sons born to infertile men who use in vitro 
fertilization techniques to father children. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David C. Page, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher  
at the Whitehead Institute and lead author of the study, said that 
about 10 percent of all men who can produce little or no sperm 
suffer from a genetic defect in a part of the Y chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	When these men father children through in vitro fertilization,  
or IVF, said Page, their sons tend to inherit the genetic defect. 
Daughters are not affected since females receive from their fathers 
an X chromosome instead of the Y chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
	This means, said Page, that although IVF may help otherwise  
infertile men produce sons, it will not ensure that they eventually 
will have grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Infertility affects 10 percent to 15 percent of all American  
couples. Men are responsible for about half of infertility 
problems, with an inadequate number of sperm being the most common 
problem. Some men with low sperm counts have a genetic flaw in a 
part of the Y chromosome known as the AZFc. 
</P>
<P>
	A normal sperm count is 50 million to 200 million per cubic  
centimeter of ejaculate. Men with the AZFc genetic mutation may 
have sperm counts of zero to only 5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said the AZFc part of the Y chromosome plays a key role in  
the production of sperm. For reasons not understood, he said, some 
men develop a mutation of the AZFc. Since the condition causes 
infertility, the mutation is not thought to be inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Before IVF, such men were unlikely to father children. However,  
an IVF technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, 
enables test tube conception with a single sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	The ICSI technique involves injecting a single sperm into an egg  
in a laboratory dish. When an embryo develops, it is transferred 
into the fallopian tube of the mother and can result in a normal 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Daughters born from this technique are normal, but Page said  
that a genetic study of four sons born to men with flawed AZFc 
genes were found to share the flaw. The study is published this 
week in the journal Human Reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is the first to demonstrate that ICSI does result  
in some men passing the genetic flaw responsible for their 
infertility on to their sons,'' said Page. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery may lead prospective parents to ask that their  
doctor determine the gender of an embryo, said Page. Only female 
embryos would be implanted into the mother. This could ensure that 
the baby would be a fertile daughter instead of an infertile son. 
</P>
<P>
	Page said it is possible that the AZFc flaw may cause the sperm  
count to drop only with age, and that men with the genetic flaw may 
have normal sperm counts during puberty and early adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
	If that is the case, he said, sperm could be collected in the  
male's youth and then frozen until he is ready to start a family.

<HEADLINE> Gun Cos. Sued in Accidental Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The families of two children who accidentally  
shot themselves in the head sued two gunmakers Thursday, claiming 
they are responsible for not making their weapons childproof. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits seek $6 million for the family of 3-year-old Jordan  
Garris, who died after accidentally shooting himself in the head on 
June 6, and $1.25 million for the family of 8-year-old Nino Jacobs, 
who accidentally shot himself in the head two years ago and 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmakers Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Company of Southport, Conn. and Lorcin  
Engineering Co. of Mira Loma, Calif., as well as On Target, Inc., a 
Severn, Md. gun distributor are named as defendants in the suits. 
On Target is accused in the Garris suit of knowingly selling 
``defective'' guns and failing to warn customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason why it should be easier for a child to fire  
a gun than open an aspirin bottle,'' attorney Andrew Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, Freeman contends the gunmakers negligently  
produced defective and unreasonably dangerous weapons which did not 
include devices to prevent their use by young children. The 
gunmakers are also accused of failing to adequately warn buyers of 
the dangers the guns posed to young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said the industry developed a childproof safety grip as  
early as the 1880s, but sells guns without such safety devices or 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Jacobs case, the suit describes Lorcin Engineering as  
``one of the leading makers of handguns used by criminals in 
America.'' The suit claims the company ``pandered to its market and 
excluded these child-resistant devices that criminals do not 
desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Waldorf, co-owner and president of Lorcin Engineering, said  
he could not comment on the specifics of the suit, which he had not 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldorf said all of the guns manufactured by his company have  
safety devices and some are manufactured with a handle grip safety 
device. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the owner of the gun operates and leaves it stored in the  
proper fashion, there certainly is no risk of a child getting 
shot,'' Waldorf said. ``We'll vigorously defend any type of 
frivolous litigation. I have not seen the suit, but on the surface 
it appears to be another piece of frivolous litigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call by The Associated Press on Thursday to Ruger  
headquarters was not immediately returned. On Target declined to 
comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Thursday, Freeman displayed a circa 1894  
Smith &AMP; Wesson handgun that incorporated a metal lever on the back 
of the handgrip which prevented the weapon from being fired unless 
it was depressed. Children are unable to fire the weapon because 
their hands are not strong enough to depress the lever and pull the 
trigger, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suits are the latest in a series against gun manufacturers,  
including several filed by cities seeking reimbursement for costs 
incurred as a result of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorcin emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six months  
ago after being hit with two dozen product liability suits, company

<HEADLINE> Monsanto To Sell Sweetener Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Pharmaceutical firm Monsanto Co. is selling its  
artificial sweetener business, which includes the best-selling 
NutraSweet brand, in an effort to reduce debt and focus on life 
science products, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto also makes Equal and Canderel brand tabletop  
sweeteners. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the St. Louis-based company also said it plans to  
sell its biogum division. Earlier this year, the company said it 
was selling its algins food ingredients division. Algins and 
biogums are used mainly to improve the texture and processing of 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales will be completed as quickly as possible, Monsanto  
spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the artificial sweetener, algins and biogum businesses  
had sales of $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the divestitures will be used to reduce the  
company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto discovered aspartame, used to make NutraSweet, which is  
200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar and has just a trace of 
calories. Nutrasweet hit the market in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the artificial sweeteners business had been expected  
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``NutraSweet is very profitable, but the bulk of its growth is  
behind it,'' said analyst William Fiala of Edward Jones in St. 
Louis. ``It was really driven by the rapid growth of the diet soda 
market, and that has really started to taper off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said Monsanto does not release specific sales figures for  
NutraSweet, but noted that it remains the world's best-selling 
artificial sweetener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an outstanding product,'' she said. ``It's just a  
shift in focus for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Monsanto said it planned to sell all divisions that  
aren't directly related to the company's agricultural or 
pharmaceutical business, which together are called the life 
sciences. Among Monsanto's best-sellers is its arthritis drug 
Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto also announced several organizational changes Thursday.  
Hendrik A. Verfaillie, 53, was named chief operating officer and 
will continue as Monsanto president.

<HEADLINE> AP Clarifies Cuban Economy Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a June 30 story on a panel discussion of the  
Cuban economy, The Associated Press quoted Arturo Villar, publisher 
of the newsletter Hispanic Market Weekly as saying Cuba's 
government would collapse amid anarchy within months if the United 
States were to lift its economic embargo. In the panel discussion, 
Villar said Cuba is now in a state of anarchy in the sense that, in 
his view, the government has no coherent economic policy beyond 
retaining power. He predicted a rapid collapse of the government if 
the embargo were lifted, an action he favors, but he is not 
predicting more anarchy.

<HEADLINE> Baby Boomers' Kids Fill Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The baby boom is back in school.  
</P>
<P>
	The millions of postwar children who flooded the nation's  
schools decades ago are filling the classrooms again -- with their 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau reports that the number of students enrolled  
in U.S. elementary and high schools reached 48.0 million in 1997, 
just short of the all-time high of 48.7 million recorded in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past few years, as the children of baby boomers reached  
school age, elementary and high school enrollments have risen, and 
this trend is expected to continue for the near future,'' said 
Gladys Martinez, one of the report's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This comes on the heels of declining enrollments in the 1970s  
and early 1980s when there was a general decrease in the 6- to 
17-year-old population,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, ``School Enrollment in the United  
States -- Social and Economic Characteristics of Students: October 
1997,'' elementary and high school students in 1997 were more 
racially and ethnically diverse than students of the baby boom 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the crest of the baby boom was in school, in 1972, for  
example, 85 percent of the student population was white, 14 percent 
was black and the remaining 1 percent was Asian or other races. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, 78 percent of elementary and high school students were  
white, 17 percent black, 4 percent Asian and the rest other races. 
</P>
<P>
	The proportion of students of Hispanic origin, who can be  
members of any race, increased from about 6 percent in 1972 to 14 
percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that in 1997:  
</P>
<P>
	--College enrollment of traditional college-age students -- those  
under age 25 -- reached a record high of 9.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 4.5 million children were enrolled in public or private  
nursery schools, up from 500,000 in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 9 million elementary and high school students had a  
foreign-born parent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Of all students enrolled in college, 81 percent were white, 12  
percent black and 6 percent Asian. Also, about 8 percent were 
Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 72 million people, more than a quarter of the nation's  
population, were enrolled in some type of school.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Defensive Coach To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE -- Jerry Sandusky, who turned Penn State into  
``Linebacker U'' in 31 seasons as defensive coordinator, will 
retire after the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	As an assistant to Joe Paterno, Sandusky has coached teams  
through four unbeaten seasons and two national championships, and 
has also had nine first-team All-Americans. As one of four 
assistants who have been at Penn State for more than two decades, 
he was seen as a candidate to replace the 72-year-old Paterno one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	In making the announcement Thursday, Sandusky said he wants to  
spend more time working with The Second Mile, a charity he founded 
for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the organization has grown, the demands for my hands-on  
involvement have increased dramatically,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``The staff has done a marvelous job of building the 
organization, which now touches more than 150,000 children 
annually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends and family said the charity would keep him plenty busy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like he's retiring,'' said his wife, Dorothy. ``But  
we'll be pleased with it. We have one grandchild and another one on 
the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nittany Lions are ranked as high as No. 1 in preseason  
polls, an expectation based in no small part because of the 
defensive unit. Nine starters return on a defense that ranked in 
the top 15 last year, including defensive end Courtney Brown, 
linebackers Short and LaVar Arrington, and cornerback David 
Macklin.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Blocks USDA Dairy Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members eager to block an Agriculture  
Department plan to overhaul the government's milk pricing program 
have cleared a legislative hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture Committee voted 32-15 in favor of a bill  
that would prevent Secretary Dan Glickman from implementing the 
system he proposed in April. The measure now goes before the full 
House, but members from the Midwest have promised to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote came after a four-hour hearing that included  
calls by some lawmakers to scrap the milk program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This backward system robs too many of our nation's dairy  
farmers of the opportunity to compete and prosper,'' said Rep. John 
Boehner, R-Ohio, who tried unsuccessfully to pass an amendment to 
phase out the system. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the nation's milk pricing regions, which are  
divided into what are called milk marketing orders. The orders set 
the price that processors pay dairy farmers, much like a minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is higher the farther a farm is from Eau Claire, Wis.,  
which was considered the center of dairy production when the 
pricing system was established more than 50 years ago as a way to 
ensure all regions had sufficient milk supplies. The higher prices 
in other areas encourage farmers in the South, for instance, to 
produce milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the current system pits region against region -- all  
to the detriment of farmers in the Upper Midwest, where prices are 
kept the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA plan attempts to close the disparity. It would increase  
the minimum price by 11 cents in Minnesota and 15 cents in 
Wisconsin from 2000 to 2006, according to a University of Missouri 
study. The price would fall 5 cents nationwide and far more in 
other states, as much as 46 cents in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers in all regions of the country ought to have the  
opportunity to make a living,'' said Rep. John Sweeney, R-N.Y. 
``This proposal ensures fair market prices for farmers and 
reasonably priced, locally produced milk for consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said supporters of the House action want  
to ``maintain our current antiquated dairy pricing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time our dairy pricing system is brought up to date,''  
Kohl said.

<HEADLINE> SNS Closes Radio-Internet Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- States News Service has closed the part of its  
operation that gathered news across the country for radio and the 
Internet. It took the move after learning some contributors were 
persistently pirating Associated Press material, says Leland 
Schwartz, SNS president and editor. 
</P>
<P>
	The service lost its only radio client, the ABC NewsWire, a  
division of ABC Radio, as a result of the discovery, he said. The 
material also was distributed by Reuters to Internet Web sites and 
portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Some part-time radio stringers were ``misusing AP copy in  
complete violation of our policy or our sense of fairness,'' 
Schwartz said Wednesday. In the worst cases, he said, they ``lifted 
parts or all of AP's news summaries and used them as their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman, Julie Hoover, said, ``We don't comment on  
our business decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service employed 10 broadcast editors in Washington and used  
65 to 75 part-time stringers around the country. Schwartz said the 
move does not affect the company's core operation, 25 years old, of 
reporting Washington news of regional interest to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	AP monitored the published reports of States News Service and  
notified the parties of copyright violations and misappropriation 
issues related to AP's intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are exploring legal action against any parties who took or  
used AP information without a license to do so,'' said James R. 
Williams III, vice president and director of AP's broadcast 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said after AP pointed out misuse of its written radio  
news reports earlier this year ``we made every attempt to make sure 
the stringers understood the rules, let alone journalistic 
honesty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a handful of them Janet Cooked us out of this  
business,'' he said. He was referring to the former Washington Post 
reporter who fabricated stories that won a 1981 Pulitzer Prize, 
later withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said the company could not effectively control the way  
its state news stories outside Washington were collected unless it 
switched to a full-time staff. The 4-year-old service ceased 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils High-Tech Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush unveiled his high-tech  
agenda for Silicon Valley donors Thursday, proposing lower taxes on 
the industry and relaxed immigration regulations to allow 
additional highly skilled workers into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate lavished praise on an  
industry that is enjoying increasing political clout and 
fund-raising power. The GOP front-runner collected about $1.7 
million at fund-raisers heavily attended by high-tech workers in 
San Francisco and here. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry ``speaks to the spirit of America,'' Bush told  
about 500 supporters. ``It not only talks about new technologies 
that shape our lives, but it speaks about daring and enterprise and 
the ultimate American dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor embraced federal legislation that would stem  
a flood of lawsuits from Y2K-related computer breakdowns -- ``the 
biggest potential ambulance chase in the millennium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush praised President Clinton for signaling that he will sign  
the bill. But he took a swipe at Clinton and Vice President Al 
Gore, the Democratic presidential front-runner, by suggesting that 
Clinton had dragged his feet before supporting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this administration, wisdom comes so rarely that we  
should not complain even if it comes too late,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Intel Corp. Chairman Andrew Grove complained  
about the protracted negotiations with the White House over the Y2K 
liability protections, describing Gore's support for the high-tech 
industry as superficial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore's reputation is already somewhat tarnished by the Y2K  
issue,'' he said. ``Gore's counting on Silicon Valley very 
strongly, and that matters to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Bush visited Silicon Valley, the Clinton administration  
announced Thursday it will relax overseas exports of some of the 
most powerful computers -- an important issue for the high-tech 
industry and one that its billionaire executives have been actively 
lobbying in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, computer and high-tech industry political  
action committees have favored Republicans by a 2-1 margin. In the 
1996 presidential election, Republicans received $2.1 million from 
the PACs, compared to $1.1 million for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1999, Bush had taken in $86,450 from the  
computer industry as compared to $76,250 for Gore. A second-quarter 
breakdown was not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Bush took in more than $36 million in the first half  
of the year. Asked about his fund raising, he said, ``I fully 
understand that elections are not won based up on contributions; 
they're won based upon ideas and hard work and hope and optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush stayed Wednesday night at the home of Thomas F. Stephenson,  
a partner in Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that helped 
fund Yahoo! in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a position paper Thursday, he called for freeing the Internet  
from duties and tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said after the speech that Bush is  
still considering whether commerce on the Internet should be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called for a permanent federal research and development tax  
credit, something many in this valley have long sought, and a 
reduction in marginal tax rates. He has previously pledged not to 
raise federal personal or corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed escalating efforts to combat intellectual property  
piracy, and called for lifting the cap on the number of 
high-skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called H-1B 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised he would reduce unspecified regulations ``that  
strangle enterprise,'' and he offered a crowd-pleasing position on 
encryption, one of the thorniest issues facing this region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said U.S. firms should be allowed to sell products overseas  
when those products are available from foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration relaxed export controls on the  
software last year, but some in the industry seek even less 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bush's backers here wore ``W2K'' pins and cowboy boots.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to learn as much as you are,'' said Ryan Payton, an  
executive at C.B. Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate firm that 
specializes in technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``My general impression is that he has a platform of strong  
values with compassion underlined with character,'' Payton said. 
``And he's obviously a pro-business guy, which gives people in 
business hope that he's going to do the right thing for Silicon 
Valley,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fresno, his last California stop, Bush signed autographs  
Thursday for a mob of yelling supporters, kissed babies and 
declared his intention to carry California. But as he took the 
stage, pro-abortion rights demonstrators chanted: ``Bush is 
anti-choice!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats began mobilizing this week in an attempt to undercut  
Bush's momentum, charging that his views are out of sync with most 
Californians on such issues as abortion.

	PARIS (AP) -- Spain, led by Alberto Herreros' 28 points, upset  
Lithuania 74-72 Thursday, earning a semifinal berth against France 
in the European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	France, sparked by late heroics from Laurent Foirest, reached  
the final four with a 66-63 victory over Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlado Scepanovic came off the bench to score 17 points as  
two-time defending champion Yugoslavia beat Germany 78-68 to set up 
a semifinal game against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton Myers scored 22 points and forward Gregor Fucka added  
19, leading Italy past Russia 102-79. 
</P>
<P>
	By reaching the semifinals, Italy, France and Spain also  
qualified for next year's Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, silver medalists at last year's worlds, Germany, Turkey  
and Lithuania can still qualify for the Olympics in playoffs among 
losing quarterfinalists. Germany will play Russia, while Turkey 
will meet Lithuania, and the winners will qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams, plus Yugoslavia, qualify for the Olympics.  
Yugoslavia qualified by winning the World Championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis in early foul trouble,  
Spain led in a close game. Sabonis got his fourth foul with 16:44 
left. He returned seven minutes later, but fouled out seconds 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain led by 10 with less than five minutes remaining, but  
3-point goals by Sarunas Jasikevicius and Arturas Karnisovas cut 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With 18 seconds remaining, Karnisovas nailed another 3, tying  
the score 72-72. Alberto Anguilo hit two free throws with 11.1 
seconds left. With time running out, Jasikevicius, who led 
Lithuania with 22 points, missed a jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Karnisovas had 17 points, while Sabonis had only three and three  
rebounds in 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's defense, anchored by Vlade Divac, limited Germany's  
Dirk Nowitzki to 11 points. Drazan Tomic, who scored a 
tournament-high 32 points in Germany's victory over Croatia, was 
held to four. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Femerling led Germany with 13 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Italy, silver medalist behind Yugoslavia at the Europeans two  
years ago, overwhelmed Russia with tough defense and good outside 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasily Karassev led Russia with 22 points, hitting 5-of-7 from  
3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
	France trailed Turkey most of the game until Foirest hit a  
3-pointer with 1:02 left for a 61-59 lead. He then converted a 
Turkish turnover for another basket.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moves To Block IMF Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Republican lawmakers took the first step  
Thursday to block the proposed sale of IMF gold reserves to help 
reduce poor countries' debt. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and Rep. Jim Saxton of  
New Jersey, vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, 
introduced legislation that would prohibit the sales unless the 
profits are returned to IMF member states. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday that Congress should  
approve the sales to help fund the debt relief initiative, which 
was approved by the world's seven wealthiest nations at their 
summit last month in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, they agreed to sell up to 10 million ounces of  
gold, worth an estimated $2.6 billion, of the IMF's 104 million 
ounces of gold reserves. But IMF rules say congressional approval 
is needed for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	With the gold prices at a 20-year low of less than $265 a troy  
ounce after several central banks announced plans to sell the 
precious metal, there are fears that the IMF sales will drive the 
price lower and hurt export earnings of poor, gold-producing 
nations, some of them in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF says it would sell the gold in a way that would have  
minimal impact on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Saxton said the plan to sell IMF gold lacks accountability.  
</P>
<P>
	``Given the choice of channeling billions to the IMF bureaucracy  
or reserving it for the taxpayers, it is virtually impossible to 
think that the Congress will endorse'' the gold sale plan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To help finance its part of the $27.5 billion debt relief  
initiative, Saxton said the IMF should borrow money from 
international capital markets as its sister institution, the World 
Bank, has done for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``However if the IMF wishes to gradually dispose of the gold at  
some future point, this bill ensures that the large, hidden 
potential gold profits are returned to the member countries and 
their taxpayers and not retained by the IMF bureaucracy for its own 
purposes,'' he said.

	Construction Spending Down 0.9 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending fell in May for a second  
straight month, the first time that has happened in two years, 
indicating one of the economy's strongest sectors is starting to 
slow down. The Commerce Department said today that spending dropped 
by 0.9 percent in May, after falling by 2 percent in April. The 
declines were fairly widespread, with decreases reported in 
single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and motels and big 
government construction projects. The decrease was not expected. 
Many analysts had expected construction spending to rise by 1 
percent in May.

Department said today that 299,000 Americans filed new claims for 
jobless benefits for the week ending June 26 -- down by 5,000 from 
the previous week. Many analysts had expected a slight rise in 
jobless claims. The four-week moving average for claims, which 
helps smooth out week-to-week volatility, also was down to 307,000, 
the lowest level since May 29 when they were at 305,500.

	Continued Manufacturing Growth Seen

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The manufacturing sector grew in June for the  
fifth straight month, and a rising backlog of orders at the 
nation's factories indicates growth should continue, according to a 
survey of corporate purchasing executives released today. The 
National Association of Purchasing Management said 16 of 20 
industries reported a pickup in business. ``Both production and new 
orders exhibited significant growth when compared to May,'' said 
Norbert J. Ore, head of the trade group's survey committee.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved lower today as investors pondered  
their course in the new interest rate environment. Just before 11

10,947.37. Broader stock indicators were posting narrower losses. 
The Nasdaq composite index was down 3.86 at 2,682.26. Bond prices 
responded most dramatically today to the Federal Reserve's decision 
to raise interest rates one-quarter percentage point. After a rally 
yesterday afternoon, bond prices sank today, pushing the yield on 
the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.04 percent, up from 5.96 late 
yesterday.

	Download Delays Bug Online Shoppers  
</P>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- As much as $4.35 billion in  
electronic commerce may be lost annually in the United States 
because online shoppers frustrated with slow download times simply 
give up making a purchase, a study says. A study released yesterday 
by Zona Research says one-third of online shoppers may not buy an 
item over the Internet because of the slowness of the experience, 
whether caused by their own modems or a failure at a Web site. A 
crash at the eBay auction Web site in early June indicated how 
costly any failure can be for an e-commerce Web site. The Web site 
was down for about 24 hours on June 10 and 11, resulting in a 
revenue loss of between $3 million and $5 million.

Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt stressed 
that all U.S. markets should open and close at the same time, 
despite varying proposals from the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New 
York Stock Exchange. Levitt said it would be too confusing for 
investors to have different exchanges open different hours.

three phone company subsidiaries. The move marks part of a major 
overhaul in Japan's once highly regulated phone and communications 
industry. NTT is the world's second largest telecommunications

closed sharply higher on the news that had lifted Wall Street 
prices yesterday. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average 
soared 331.01 points, or 1.9 percent, to 17,860.75, its highest 
close since Sept. 30, 1997, when it ended at 17,887.71. In 
Singapore, the U.S. rate announcement drove the benchmark index to 
its third record close in the past two weeks. The benchmark Straits 
Times Index finished at 2214.75 points, up 47.05 points, or 2.2

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., has been  
hospitalized since early June for treatment of an infection 
following heart valve replacement surgery, his office said 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Thurmond Upset Over Photo Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond is upset that a  
photograph of himself and Ronald Reagan sold at an auction by his 
estranged wife last month has turned up for sale on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The picture of Thurmond and Reagan in the Oval Office, taken  
Jan. 10, 1988, was bought at the auction by Andrew Gillihan of 
Anderson. Gillihan offered ``this awesome, color'' photo for sale 
on eBay, an auction-style Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond said he was concerned and wondered if a more  
appropriate place for such memorabilia was a museum or the Strom 
Thurmond Institute at Clemson University. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Moore Thurmond, a former Miss South Carolina who separated  
amicably from Thurmond in 1991, sold a number of personal items on 
June 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, 96, who is the nation's oldest and longest-serving  
senator, said his estranged wife conducted the sale without his 
involvement. ``Though I was aware she was holding this event, I had 
little knowledge of exactly what she was selling,'' he said this 
week.

million Powerball jackpot prize at lottery headquarters today. 
Farrah Slad, who lives in central Minnesota, held the only winning 
ticket for last night's drawing. She chose to collect all the money 
in a lump sum worth $78.8 million rather than the jackpot that 
would be worth $150 million if taken over 25 years. After state and 
federal taxes, she will take home about $50 million. Slad, who 
works for MorNorth Mortgage, said she doesn't have any immediate 
plans, except to possibly buy a new car.

legislation aimed at avoiding legal aftershocks from Year 2000 
computer problems. The Senate is to follow suit shortly, and the 
White House said the president, after lengthy negotiations over 
consumer protections, would sign the bill. The legislation, aimed 
at stemming a flood of lawsuits from possible computer breakdowns, 
cleared the House by a 404-24 vote. The Year 2000 problem -- also 
called Y2K and the millennium bug -- occurs because some computer 
programs, which were written to recognize only the last two digits 
of a year, may read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.

``The American people will have to make up their minds about

<HEADLINE> German Island Has Duty-free Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELGOLAND, Germany (AP) -- On the European mainland, travelers  
have lost their chance to shop duty-free. But visitors to this 
North Sea resort island on Thursday were still stocking up on 
untaxed perfume, cigarettes and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
	Helgoland is one of a handful of EU islands -- along with Spain's  
Canary Islands -- where tax-free shopping will continue despite the 
duty-free ban that went into effect Thursday within the 15 
countries of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The change made sense for the EU, where border controls have  
largely disappeared, officials have said. And EU taxpayers will get 
a boost from their governments' added revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helgoland's duty-free shop owners said they thought there  
would be those who would go out of their way for a bargain, and 
they were getting ready to greet them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shop owner Niels Pfoertner said he expected a 20-30 percent  
surge in customers, and in preparation started stocking his 
inventory months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our stores are packed because we know what we have to  
expect,'' Pfoertner said, standing in front of a display of liquor 
and fine tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of the Aland Islands, a self-governing Finnish  
region, island leaders won omission from the ban partly by arguing 
that the sale of tax-free goods was necessary to their economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a three-hour trip by speed boat from the northern city of  
Hamburg, Helgoland has long drawn visitors seeking cheap drinks and 
smokes, in addition to peaceful weekends in the island's brightly 
painted condos and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the chief of the island's tourism bureau, Martin Linne,  
was reserved in his optimism that business would increase just 
because of the tax-free status -- partly because of the $60 cost of 
the boat ride to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have many more visitors this year coming for one  
day,'' he said. ``But not so much that you could call Helgoland a 
boomtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on the industry worth about $7 billion a year does not  
effect international ferry routes and airports with flights to 
non-EU countries.

<HEADLINE> New Senior Event Fights For Place  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- As the newest event on the Senior PGA Tour,  
the State Farm Classic must fight for a premium date and attract 
the top players. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the top 10 money winners on the Senior Tour this season  
will battle for a healthy purse of $1.3 million. However, many of 
the most recognizable names will be absent when the second-year 
event tees off Friday at Hobbit's Glen. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan favorites such as Hale Irwin, Jack Nicklaus and Raymond  
Floyd have skipped this year's State Farm Classic because it falls 
on a holiday weekend and between two major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, Senior Tour Player of the Year in 1997 and 1998, is  
resting an ailing shoulder for next week's U.S. Senior Open. 
Winning last weekend's Senior Players Championship with a 
remarkable score of 21-under, Irwin gave the State Farm Classic 
immediate legitimacy by playing the inaugural event. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus also took this week off after having to withdraw from  
the Senior Players Championship. Nicklaus, who hopes to return next 
weekend, probably would not have played the State Farm Classic 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Legends Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi Rodriguez drew some of the  
largest galleries last year. Neither included the State Farm 
Classic on their limited schedules this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Senior Tour stars, Raymond Floyd and Gary Player, have  
told tournament organizers they will never play on July 4 weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Lee Trevino and defending champion Bruce Summerhays  
as the most recognizable participants. Trevino graces publicity 
posters while Summerhays is featured on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question being sandwiched between two majors is  
tough on this event,'' Trevino said. ``There's some key guys who 
aren't here this week because they needed a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senior Tour schedule will remain the same in 2000 as the  
State Farm Classic completes its three-year guaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough being the new kid on the block, but I'm sure this  
tournament will get a better date in the future,'' Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural State Farm Classic drew 93,000 fans, even though  
turnout on Saturday, July 4, was well below expectations. Executive 
director John Mathews thinks attendance will soar next year since 
the holiday falls on Tuesday, which is when optional practice 
rounds are held. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a break with the calendar next year, and hopefully in  
future years the majors will be moved away from us,'' Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Tour officials are planning to spread the majors further  
apart in 2001. Mathews, who has already initiated negotiations to 
extend the State Farm Classic contract, is hoping the event can be 
played in June every few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are positive that this event will continue. We  
have the sponsor support and the fan interest,'' Mathews said. 
``The date isn't ideal, but we've made the most of it. If life 
gives you lemons, you make lemonade. I think we've made some darn 
good lemonade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Famous players bring in the crowds, but ultimately good course  
conditions and strong competition keep a tournament on the tour. 
Summerhays pointed out that 22 of this season's top 30 money 
winners are competing here this weekend. Heading the field are 
Bruce Fleisher and Allen Doyle, tour newcomers who have both 
already topped $1 million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a topnotch field. Almost all the guys who are playing  
good right now are here,'' Summerhays said. ``John Jacobs, Dana 
Quigley and Tom Jenkins may not be recognizable names to the 
average fan, but they've all been playing great golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trevino said the seniors love Hobbit's Glen, a 7,078-yard course  
designed by Ed Ault and opened in 1967. That's because it's not 
tricked up with railroad ties, huge mounds and the other man-made 
obstructions common on new TPC courses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course is absolutely perfect for our tour,'' Trevino  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an old, vintage course that enables you to play golf the  
way it's supposed to be played. You can bump and run or different 
things. So many of the new courses force you to play an aerial 
game,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> V-Chip Deadline Met by Most TV Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The v-chip, which can block objectionable  
television programs, is now available in at least half of all new 
TV sets and should appeal to parents concerned about televised 
mayhem, a federal regulator says. 
</P>
<P>
	V-chips work with an electronically coded rating system that  
already is in place to identify programs that contain sex, violence 
or crude language. A 1996 telecommunications law required all new 
TV sets 13 inches and larger to come with the technology by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But starting today, v-chips must be in at least half of the new  
sets made. Most manufacturers met the deadline much earlier, 
according to the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has done it and everyone is ahead of schedule,'' FCC  
Commissioner Gloria Tristani said Wednesday. ``We never had any 
concerns that they wouldn't willingly meet the deadlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tristani took issue with recent reports that parents barely have  
noticed -- or even cared -- that many new TV sets now come with 
v-chips. 
</P>
<P>
	``The v-chips are just coming online. It really hasn't been  
marketed heavily,'' she said. ``I think that's changing because 
manufacturers are going to be making an effort. They see this as a 
selling point now because there is a lot of concern about 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, Tristani urged critics to be patient. Demand for new  
technology takes time to build, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened with televisions, it happened with cell phones. I  
could go on and on,'' she said. ``It's not like overnight people 
say, 'There's this new thing here, let's rush and buy it.' We have 
to start with letting people know that this tool is there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, advocacy groups and industry leaders helped  
two private organizations launch an education campaign to promote 
the use of v-chips and teach families how to use them. The Center 
for Media Education and the Kaiser Family Foundation sponsored the 
program also to help explain the electronically coded TV ratings 
system that goes with it.

<HEADLINE> Senator Chastises Women on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Ted Stevens, chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that women, wanting to 
spend money on ``touchy feely'' things, are less supportive of 
increases in defense spending than men. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's all these touchy feely things out there that they want  
to spend money on,'' Stevens, R-Alaska, told a breakfast of defense 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, who is also chairman of the panel's defense  
subcommittee, said he gets ``more questions from women who say, 
`Why? What do you spend all that money for? We have enough. We 
don't need any more military.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not as many women who support the national defense  
budget now as men,'' Stevens said. ``I really think there is a 
gender gap in the support for the large expenditures that are 
necessary to modernize the force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the women of the world wake up to the fact that we don't  
have a national missile defense system, that our current military 
systems are aging very rapidly and that if they don't watch out 
their sons and daughters are going to be going to war in equipment 
that their grandfathers built, then maybe we might see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But today there is not a unified support for a defense  
increase in the United States,'' Stevens said.

<HEADLINE> 'South Park' Tests Ratings Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was going well for awhile for Elizabeth  
Chacon and Gregory Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a parent or guardian, the 16-year-olds bought tickets,  
no questions asked, for an afternoon showing of the new, R-rated 
``South Park'' movie. Then reality hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we tried to get in, they said we couldn't. So they gave  
us our money back,'' said Chacon, standing outside the Galaxy 
Theater in Hollywood. ``We didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life imitated art as the new movie opened Wednesday: Theaters  
had to turn away children trying to sneak into a vulgar movie about 
children who sneak into a vulgar movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' may prove the biggest  
test yet to theater owners' recent agreement with President Clinton 
to strictly enforce the R rating, which bars anyone under 17 
without an adult. The recent agreement was in reaction to the 
Littleton, Colo., school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 16-year-old turned away from the Galaxy vowed to try and  
see the film somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the big deal is,'' grumbled Jose Tamayo.  
</P>
<P>
	The movie -- which has received glowing reviews -- is more about  
dirty words than dirty deeds. It thereby thumbs its nose at a movie 
rating system that prohibits kids from seeing foul-mouthed, cartoon 
8-year-olds but lets them view scenes of death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Filled with raunchy dialogue about sex, jokes about bodily  
functions and profanity that would make a sailor blush, ``South 
Park'' -- based on the controversial TV series on cable's Comedy 
Central -- had to go through several edits before it could get down 
from an NC-17 to an R rating. (An NC-17 rating means no one younger 
than 17 allowed, not even with an adult.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratings board only cared about the dirty words. They're so  
confused and arbitrary,'' Trey Parker, who with partner Matt Stone 
created ``South Park,'' told The New York Times. ``They don't blink 
twice because of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker and Stone clashed with the ratings board last year when  
their pornography industry farce ``Orgazmo'' was rated NC-17, even 
though it had no explicit sex scenes and only fleeting nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo contends the only reason they received an R rating for  
``South Park'' was because it was backed by a major studio -- 
Paramount -- which also is a member of the industry group that 
handles the ratings, the Motion Picture Association of America. 
(``Orgazmo'' was an independent production.) 
</P>
<P>
	It's a claim Paramount dismisses.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that the MPAA treats a studio different from  
anybody else,'' said Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the 
Paramount Motion Picture Group. ``You go through the exact same 
process, with the exact same people, sitting in judgment of what 
they think is right or wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the MPAA, didn't return messages  
seeking comment. In the past, he has strongly defended the 
integrity of the ratings process, while acknowledging that 
decisions are subjective. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the ``South Park'' filmmakers agreed parents should  
probably be with their kids at the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Fox, a spokesman for Comedy Central, which has aired  
``South Park'' since 1997, said the program -- shown at 10 p.m. 
Wednesdays -- is positioned for adults, but draws about 20 percent 
of it's audience from the under-18 crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it was, at the Wynnsong 10 theater in Little Rock, Ark.,  
that 46-year-old Gary Bradberry accompanied his 12-year-old son to 
``South Park.'' The elder Bradberry explained that he and his son 
both watch the TV show and discuss troubling scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it,'' the father said. ``It's a change from all other  
shows on TV.''

</P>
<P>
	The Outback line, a version of the Legacy that was designed  
especially for the U.S. market, has been given a more aggressive 
look with larger wheels and tires and lower body cladding. The 
Outback line also features liquid-filled engine mounts, a standard 
power moonroof, heated side mirrors, a front windshield wiper 
deicer and heated front seats. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar Mostly Up; Gold Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was up against most other major  
currencies in European trading Thursday, as the beleaguered euro 
fell to a record low. Gold prices rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0239, down from $1.0316 Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The euro's looking technically poor,'' said Stephen  
Woolfenden, senior dealer at the London bank Standard Chartered. 
``The market had begun to gather a bit of confidence in the euro 
but in the last two sessions, this has gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While a Thursday selloff took the euro to a new low against the  
dollar, analysts surveyed in Tokyo and London expect it to be 
higher by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We buy into the European recovery story,'' said Michael  
Metcalfe, currency economist with NatWest GFM in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates compared with late Wednesday: 121.09 Japanese  
yen, up from 120.80; 1.5669 Swiss francs, up from 1.5496 and 1.4662 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4752 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.5774, up from $1.5747.  
</P>
<P>
	At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 120.69 yen. The  
euro was trading at $1.0255 and the pound at $1.5769. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth: 1.9102 German marks, up from 1.8959; 
6.4065 French francs, up from 6.3586; 2.1523 Dutch guilders, up 
from 2.1362; and 1,891.07 Italian lire, up from 1,876.96.

<P>
	In Zurich the bid price was $262.45, up from $260.75.

<HEADLINE> E-mailer Arrested for Banking Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A man who fired off a series of e-mails  
asserting the financial instability of a bank -- triggering a run on 
the institution -- was arrested for creating financial panic, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Omar Olaya, 24, allegedly sent numerous messages from a  
Hotmail e-mail account on May 27 to private individuals and 
employees of Davivienda Bank urging all account holders to withdraw 
their funds in light of a pending government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaya's e-mail campaign caused a flood of second- and third-hand  
e-mails, exponentially spreading the misinformation, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panicked account holders withdrew $11.4 million from the bank in  
a single day, forcing the government to lend Davivienda some 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the first case of inciting economic panic via the  
Internet in Colombian history,'' said Tulio Gomez, chief of the 
special unit on electronic information of the state security 
agency, or DAS. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaya's alleged actions broke a law against inciting economic  
panic and are punishable by up to eight years in jail, said Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaya was arrested Wednesday at his home in the Pacific port of  
Buenaventura.

<HEADLINE> Minister Convicted on 'Black Tax' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A black minister has been convicted of getting  
three people to file tax returns in which they claimed a ``black 
tax'' exemption that he said was available to descendants of 
slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Foster, 35, of Fort Worth could get up to 27 months in  
prison at sentencing Sept. 14. He was convicted on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people testified that Foster told them the exemption was a  
government reparation for descendants of slaves freed after the 
Civil War. No such reparations were ever authorized. One man 
actually received a $2,300 refund two years ago by making the 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie Foster is not an American hero. You don't rope other  
hard-working people into this scam,'' prosecutor Terri Moore told 
the federal jury of three blacks and nine whites. ``He spread 
lies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Greene, Foster's lawyer, argued that the IRS was holding  
Foster responsible for its own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury took less than an hour to convict Foster on three  
counts of filing false claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster himself got $30,085.89 back from the IRS after filing for  
the ``black tax'' exemption. The IRS caught the mistake, but Foster 
never gave the money back. No charges were ever brought against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of slave reparations has circulated since the end of the  
Civil War, when Congress voted to give freed slaves 40 acres and a 
mule. President Andrew Johnson vetoed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate landed in the lap of the IRS after L.G. Sherrod, a  
journalist and economics consultant, wrote an essay in Essence 
magazine in 1993 in which she urged readers to use their tax forms 
to claim the modern-day equivalent of 40 acres and a mule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply enter $43,209 in `black taxes' and compute  
accordingly,'' she wrote.

<HEADLINE> Muti Performs 'Requiem' in Old City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Riccardo Muti sees it this way: Verdi's  
``Requiem,'' when performed against the backdrop of the stone walls 
of Jerusalem's Old City, becomes a prayer for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It asks for freedom of the soul, freedom of mankind,'' Muti  
said Thursday, shortly before an outdoor performance sponsored by 
the Jerusalem Foundation and the Italian Ravenna Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The music director of the La Scala opera company said the text  
and music of the piece reached beyond the boundaries of Jews, 
Christians and Muslims and other world religions. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance was part of a program to bring a concert to a  
different city each year. Two years ago, La Scala performed in 
Sarajevo and last year brought music to Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Music does not bring political messages, it just asks people  
to feel,'' Muti said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation aimed at avoiding legal  
aftershocks from Year 2000 computer problems headed for a final 
vote in Congress today. The White House said the president, after 
lengthy negotiations over consumer protections, would sign the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill aimed at stemming a flood of lawsuits from possible  
computer breakdowns was assured of a big victory in the House 
today, followed by another strong show of approval in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's signature, which appeared solid after  
lawmakers said Tuesday they had reached a compromise agreement with 
the administration, appeared a little shakier Wednesday after the 
White House indicated it still had some problems with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House spokesman Jake Siewert said today the president  
will approve it. ``We think this bill is critical to meet a 
national priority and the president is prepared to sign it into law 
because it is narrowly tailored to deal with litigation dealing 
with the Y2K problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who has strong ties with the high-tech  
industry, which badly wants the legislation and played an active 
role in crafting the final product, told The Associated Press 
Wednesday he understood there were some last-minute problems in 
putting the deal in writing. But he said there was a ``90 percent 
chance'' they would be worked out and the bill signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he was generally satisfied with the legislation.  
``It's a compromise outcome that overall serves the interests of 
the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans stressed they had an agreement and were done  
negotiating. Sponsors of the original House bill, said Rep. Bob 
Goodlatte, R-Va., ``had to make tremendous concessions'' to win 
White House support and in the end, ``the Congress writes the 
legislation and not the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House rejected the original House-passed bill as being  
too pro-business and to the disadvantage of consumers taking legal 
action to recover losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, written by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with the  
help of Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Christopher Dodd 
of Connecticut, was modified to address consumer concerns, but the 
White House said that it too was one-sided and would receive a 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Further changes agreed to over five days of negotiations ending  
Tuesday appeared to finally win White House approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups and the high-tech industry, warning of billions  
of dollars in lawsuits from disruptions caused by computers that 
can't differentiate the year 2000 from 1900, lobbied hard for the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore conceded he was caught between the interests of two strong  
Democratic constituents, the high-tech industry that wanted the 
bill and trial lawyers who opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said the pressure was ``no more than is frequently the  
case when you have differing legitimate points of view that have to 
be reconciled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K-related  
problems before lawsuits can be filed and by encouraging mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would set punitive damage caps for small businesses,  
make it harder to file class action lawsuits and provide that, in 
most cases, a defendant can be held liable only for the proportion 
of damage actually caused by the individual or company. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final negotiations, some changes were made in the class  
action and proportionate liability sections to better protect 
consumer interests, and that won over such influential Democrats as 
Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary 
Committee, who opposed the original bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have now fully crafted a bill that we can all live with and  
enjoy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said he still  
thought the bill would undermine the civil justice system and would 
be used as a ``fund-raising tool'' for Republicans seeking 
high-tech donations. 
</P>
<P>
	But his Senate counterpart, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said  
the bill was ``the best we can get under these circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 775.

<HEADLINE> Sonics Defend Trading Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NBA draft featured few surprises, although  
one moment stood out for the number of eyebrows it raised. 
</P>
<P>
	It came midway through the second round, when NBA vice president  
Rod Thorn walked to the podium and reeled off a series of names -- 
Corey Maggette, Dale Ellis, Billy Owens, Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the players the Seattle SuperSonics had agreed to  
send to the Orlando Magic for Horace Grant and two future 
second-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the trade sounded lopsided.  
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Seattle general manager Wally Walker defended it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We added two things that we needed: A big veteran ready to  
come in and play a lot of minutes, and $1 million in salary cap 
room,'' Walker said Thursday. ``We didn't think that anybody we 
picked at No. 13 would have come in and played much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette, who left Duke after his freshman season, was the  
player the Sonics picked 13th so they could package him with the 
three veterans for Grant. During the spring, Maggette was being 
talked about as a top-five pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the move had nothing to do with insuring against the  
possible departure of Vin Baker, who opted out of his contract 
after last season and became a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to re-sign Vin, and he has told us that he expects  
to re-sign,'' Walker said. ``We envision them playing together. Vin 
is a low post player, Horace is a high post player. We feel they 
are perfect complements to each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another draft day trade won't become official for a month.  
Toronto will send the fifth overall pick, Jonathan Bender, to the 
Indiana Pacers for Antonio Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	While some saw that trade as indicating that Toronto might be  
preparing for the free agency departure of Charles Oakley, perhaps 
to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Raptors said they expect to retain 
Oakley. If so, Davis presumably would come off the bench behind 
Oakley and Kevin Willis. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement, there is a  
moratorium on signings and trades until Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trades were made in principle Wednesday night, but they  
did not become public like the Toronto-Indiana deal. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a lot of talk at the draft that Minnesota and  
Cleveland had arranged a deal involving the sixth overall pick, 
Wally Szczerbiak. But Szczerbiak's agent said he had spoken to 
Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson and Minnesota general manager 
Kevin McHale, and no trade was forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the surprise from this year's draft concerned the fact  
that so few trades were made. Many people expected Chicago general 
manager Jerry Krause to make a move involving the No. 1 overall 
pick, but he chose to keep it and selected college player of the 
year Elton Brand of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never got to a point where we were ready to move the No. 1.  
It never got that serious,'' Bulls coach Tim Floyd said. ``The more 
we thought about it, the more we watched film, the more we became 
knocked out that this could be the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause's best smoke-and-mirror trick turned out to be his  
flirtation with Lamar Odom, including a late night workout at the 
team's practice facility Tuesday night that was suspiciously leaked 
to the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Odom was convinced that the Bulls were truly interested,  
but he ended up being chosen fourth by the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Bulls picked (Michael) Jordan, they weren't the best  
team in the NBA, either,'' Odom said of playing for the league's 
perennial sad-sack franchise. ``They have a great new arena and I'm 
going to be living in the city of Los Angeles playing basketball. 
If you ask for more than that, you're being greedy.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cos. Lost $24B Over Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American companies lost $24 billion over five  
years in international contracts in which bribes were involved, the 
State Department says in a classified report being sent to Congress 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A major problem, officials said, is that many countries still  
allow businesses to claim bribery as a tax deduction -- a practice 
the Clinton administration says it is pressuring other governments 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of state for economic affairs,  
disclosed the estimate in a briefing Wednesday on U.S. plans to get 
countries to comply with a new anti-bribery treaty signed by 33 
nations on Feb. 15. So far, 15 governments have ratified the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the five-year State Department report, an annex  
to an annual report to Congress required under treaty legislation, 
details incidents of corruption around the globe. It mentions 
bribery allegations in 294 contracts worth $145 billion between 
1994 and 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this led to the loss of billions of dollars of  
sales by U.S. companies,'' Eizenstat said. He said officials were 
able to track bribery allegations in 77 contracts worth $24 billion 
where U.S. corporations lost the bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say that each of those contracts, the reason why the  
contract was lost was because of the bribe,'' he said. ``But that 
of those contracts where there was an allegation of a bribe, 
American companies lost that many contracts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, meanwhile, in a separate report  
covering just last year and also going to Congress on Thursday, 
said there were 55 contracts worth $37 billion in which there were 
allegations of bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials are pressuring other of the 33 signatories of the  
anti-corruption treaty to disallow bribes as a tax deduction. 
Eizenstat called it a ``pernicious practice that amounts to an 
export subsidy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowing these deductions for whatever reason in our judgment  
is simply inexcusable,'' said Undersecretary of Commerce David 
Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Sweden would end the practice Thursday but it still  
remains in effect in Australia, Luxembourg, New Zealand and 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron and Eizenstat, briefing reporters at the State Department  
on progress against corruption under the treaty, said the United 
States will watch how major trading nations enforce the accord and 
tell them when their efforts fall short or need more work.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Pick Convention Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Republicans said today they will hold  
their 2000 national convention in the First Union Center, home to 
the city's basketball and hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``That woman or man who will lead us into the next millennium  
will be nominated in this building,'' the party's national 
committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision caps a selection process that began in November  
when Philadelphia was selected over Indianapolis, New Orleans, New 
York and San Antonio to be the site of the GOP convention -- the 
city's first since 1948, when it had both the Democratic and the 
Republican gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	While the city was selected, the site wasn't, until today.  
</P>
<P>
	Party officials had been said to be leaning toward the downtown  
Pennsylvania Convention Center, which is close to fancy hotels and 
restaurants and to historical attractions such as Independence Hall 
and the Liberty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials were swayed by the First Union Center's  
technological amenities, easy accessibility and ample parking. The 
3-year-old building on the city's south side, about 3 1/2 miles from 
downtown, is close to the airport and has seating for 21,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention will run from July 29 to Aug. 4, 2000, and will  
draw about 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision cheered several groups already booked into the  
convention center in the weeks leading up to the convention. They 
likely would have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans will still use the convention center for  
meetings, receptions and the PoliticalFest, an extravaganza for 
political junkies, but those events do not require nearly as much 
lead time as the convention itself.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jane Beadon, one of the leading witnesses in the  
sensational divorce case of the 11th Duke of Argyll, died 
Wednesday. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Beadon was Jane Wigham in 1963 when she gave evidence  
against her stepdaughter Margaret, the Duchess of Argyll. 
</P>
<P>
	The divorce of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, chief  
of the Clan Campbell and Hereditary Master of the Royal Household 
in Scotland, and his wife made headlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The case became notorious because of the mysterious ``headless  
man'' photographs. The pictures showed the duchess, wearing only 
three strands of pearls, taking part in a sex act with a naked man, 
whose head had been cut off by the camera. He has never been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke sought a divorce on grounds of adultery and Jane Wigham  
testified on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke was granted a divorce. The duchess, who the judge  
called promiscuous and ``wholly immoral'' in his ruling, died in 
1993 at age 80.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- William M.B. Berger, the white-bearded founder of  
the Berger Funds, died Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger came from a long line of bankers. His grandfather founded  
the Colorado National Bank in 1862. At age 26, Berger began 
managing a $100 million stock portfolio for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Berger discovered the Centennial Fund, the first  
tax-free exchange fund. It allowed investors to trade their shares 
of stock for shares of the fund without incurring a tax liability. 
The Internal Revenue Service later changed its rules to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he merged his Centennial Management Co. with Founders  
before starting the funds that bear his name eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his own commercials, Berger made appearances on  
Wall Street Week and on several of CNBC's financial talk shows.

<P>
	EPPING, N.D. (AP)-- Cindy Duehring, who won international honors  
for environmental research while being confined to her North Dakota 
home, died Tuesday. She was 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring died in her home where she lived in isolation  
because of an extreme sensitivity to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her organ system just broke down,'' said her husband, Jim, who  
was forced to live in a nearby cabin because the smells that clung 
to him after a day at work made his wife sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring was among five people honored in Sweden in 1997  
with the Right Livelihood Awards, known as the ``alternative 
Nobels.'' Her husband flew to Sweden to accept her award. 
</P>
<P>
	She founded the Environmental Access Research Network, a group  
to help people suffering from chemical sensitivity, and answered 
hundreds of research requests per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring traced her illness to the mid-1980s when an  
exterminator sprayed her Seattle apartment for fleas. Tests by a 
specialist in environmental medicine found pesticides had damaged 
her immune system.

	ELKHART, Ind. (AP) -- Frank Gach, an American imprisoned at the  
Auschwitz concentration camp for selling commodities on the Polish 
black market, died Monday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1942, Gach and a group of friends were discovered by the  
Nazis and arrested. He was taken to Auschwitz, a Nazi concentration 
camp where more than 6 million Jews and other people were executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gach suffered severe injuries to both legs, but instead of being  
killed by the Nazis, he was let go. Of thousands of Americans who 
were imprisoned, Gach was among the approximately 200 who made it 
out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in Poland until 1959, when he and his wife and five  
children returned to the United States.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John P. Howe, a physical chemist who helped  
develop the world's first nuclear reactors as part of the famed 
Manhattan Project team, died June 13. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe was a 32-year-old chemistry professor at Brown University  
when he was recruited to study nuclear energy under physicist and 
Nobel Prize laureate Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago.	   Using the code name ``Metallurgical Laboratory,'' the team 
sought to create the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain 
reaction. On Dec. 2, 1942, the Manhattan Project succeeded. By 
1944, large plutonium-producing reactors were operating in Hanford, 
Wash. Howe moved there to act as the Metallurgical Laboratory's 
liaison.

He was 56.

	Drafted in 1965 out of California State-Los Angeles, the  
6-foot-5, 265-pound tackle, once played in 167 consecutive games. 
He retired after the 1976 season.

of Zimbabwe's fight for independence from white colonial rule, died 
early today, the government said. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	State radio interrupted morning programs to play the national  
anthem and liberation songs, and broadcast a tribute by President 
Robert Mugabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkomo suffered from prostate cancer, and poor health forced him  
to largely withdraw from political life last year. Mugabe said 
Nkomo's health deteriorated sharply on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkomo was regarded by many as the guiding light of the nation's  
black nationalist movement, which fought a guerrilla war against 
white colonial rule for nearly three decades in the former British 
colony of Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the traditional leader of the minority Ndebele tribe failed  
to achieve his goal of becoming the first black leader when 
Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old lion,'' as supporters fondly called him, wept when  
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party swept to victory in 
the first democratic elections.

<HEADLINE> Administration Changes Tax Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration announced changes  
today in its broad proposal aimed at cracking down on corporate tax 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proliferation of corporate tax shelters presents an  
unacceptable and growing level of tax avoidance behavior,'' the 
Treasury Department said in a report, underscoring its intent to 
curb such tax-avoidance schemes that are estimated to cost the 
federal government billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The department tweaked its original proposal, offered in  
February, after receiving input from concerned industry groups 
representing tax attorneys, accountants and corporate tax 
executives, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	The department, for instance, eliminated a provision in its  
original proposal that would have prevented a company from 
deducting from its taxable income the fees it paid a financial 
adviser if a transaction was deemed to be a tax shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally speaking, a tax shelter is a financial arrangement  
aimed mainly at escaping taxes with no other economic or business 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also decided to drop a provision contained in its  
original proposal that would have imposed a 25 percent excise tax 
on any transaction with a clause in which a tax-shelter promoter 
promises to refund a client's fees if the government kills the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, it (the revised proposal) represents a step in the  
right direction. The earlier proposal was an excellent example of 
overreaction or overkill,'' said Timothy McCormally, general 
counsel and director of tax affairs for the Tax Executives 
Institute, whose members work in corporate tax departments. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the department added a $100,000 penalty for failing to  
disclose to the federal government information about certain 
transactions, regardless of whether it is a tax shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the changes, the department retained the core elements  
of its original proposal, said senior Treasury officials, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The core elements generally call for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing disclosure of corporate tax shelter activities.  
</P>
<P>
	--Increasing and modifying the penalties for the substantial  
understatement of income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--Disallowing the use of tax benefits generated by a corporate  
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	--Having all parties involved, such as promoters and advisers, be  
subject to liability if they facilitated a tax-avoidance 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	To be implemented, Congress must approve legislation containing  
Treasury's plan and President Clinton must sign it into law, the 
officials said. It's unclear how the proposal would fare on Capitol 
Hill. Republicans, who control Congress, agree there is a problem 
with the proliferation of tax shelters but so far haven't embraced 
the administration's proposal or offered their own.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Widow To Push for Retrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One week after a jury could not decide whether a respected  
cardiologist was negligent in her husband's death, the widow of 
Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis said the inconclusive end to 
the lengthy trial was the result of a lack of courage by the panel. 
She also vowed to push for a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking for the first time since a judge declared a mistrial in  
the malpractice trial, Donna Harris-Lewis recounted her feelings 
when the verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was numb. I was wordless,'' she said in a telephone  
interview Thursday. ``I couldn't believe the jurors did not see the 
medical evidence and did not have the courage to assign 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 15 jurors have said they were split 9-6 in favor  
of Dr. Gilbert Mudge when they told the judge they were hopelessly 
deadlocked. Thirteen would have had to agree on a verdict. The jury 
did exonerate two of Mudge's consultants, Drs. Peter Friedman and 
Mark Creager. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, 34, said she will appeal those verdicts and seek a  
retrial of Mudge, who publicly diagnosed Lewis with a benign 
fainting disorder two months before the NBA All-Star collapsed and 
died while practicing jump shots in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She sought the money Lewis could have made had he lived past 27,  
as much as $75 million, according to one plaintiff's witness. But 
Harris-Lewis scoffed at the suggestion she was motivated by greed 
or wanted to silence questions about cocaine because drug use would 
have nullified Lewis' insurance policy and contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a defibrillator had been implanted, or (proper drugs) given  
to Reggie, and he died, I would say Dr. Mudge did his best,'' 
Harris-Lewis said. ``I never said Dr. Mudge was a bad doctor ... I 
don't hate him. But I know (he) made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's exculpatory verdicts -- and inability to reach  
agreement on Mudge -- came after a nearly eight-week-long trial in 
which Harris-Lewis claimed the doctors misdiagnosed and mistreated 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises had turned to Mudge for a second opinion after  
doctors at New England Baptist Hospital told the player he had a 
life-threatening, potentially career-ending cardiac condition after 
his collapse during a playoff game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, then head of clinical cardiology at Brigham and Women's  
Hospital, delivered the good news about Lewis' condition at a news 
conference: The athlete had a normal heart and could likely return 
to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, Lewis died of an abnormal heart rhythm while  
practicing jump shots at Brandeis University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, one year after a Wall Street Journal article raised the  
issue of possible drug use by her husband, Harris-Lewis sued Mudge 
and his consultants. A third consultant settled before trial for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, now 54 and the head of the heart transplant unit at  
Brigham and Women's, has testified that two weeks before his death 
Lewis admitted he had used cocaine. The doctor said the belated 
confession made an accurate diagnosis impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis maintains her husband never used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's attorney, William Dailey Jr., could not immediately be  
reached for comment Thursday, but he has said he hopes Harris-Lewis 
will reconsider a retrial.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympian Dies in His Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARY, N.C. (AP) -- A 14-year-old Special Olympian from Egypt died  
in his sleep early Thursday, probably from an epileptic seizure, 
officials of the Special Olympics World Summer Games said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Abdul Baset Barin, a volleyball player, was pronounced  
dead in his room at North Carolina's Morrison Hall at Chapel Hill, 
N.C., after his coach called paramedics, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tragic, it is saddening, but it was also, sadly,  
unavoidable,'' Tim Shriver, president and CEO of Special Olympics 
Inc., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tim Taft, chairman of the Special Olympics' medical advisory  
committee, said Barin was an epileptic. An autopsy performed 
Thursday by the state medical examiner's office suggested his death 
was related to epilepsy. But since Barin died in his sleep, 
examiners couldn't be absolutely sure, Taft said. Taft said Barin 
was taking medication for his disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know he had an underlying seizure disorder,'' Taft said.  
``That is the most likely explanation for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Games organizers planned a moment of silence at each event venue  
Thursday night to observe Barin's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Special Olympians are all developmentally disabled, and many are  
afflicted with medical problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Freddoso, CEO of the Games Organizing Committee, said Barin  
and his teammates watched volleyball competition Wednesday night at 
Carmichael Auditorium on the North Carolina campus, then returned 
to Morrison Hall, watched television and went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Barin couldn't be awakened about 7 a.m. Thursday, his coach  
called paramedics, who pronounced him dead a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of my parents and the entire Special Olympics  
movement, we extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Mohamed 
Abdul Baset Barin,'' Shriver said. ``He showed courage in 
everything he did and was a shining example, a hero of our 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shriver said the rest of the 32-member Egyptian delegation will  
continue to participate in the Special Olympics. Barin's volleyball 
team played a match on Thursday, losing to a team from Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have asked to be allowed to continue but continue, if at  
all possible, without any outside interference,'' Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Special Olympics World Summer Games opened in the  
Raleigh-Durham area last Saturday and will end Sunday. About 7,000 
athletes from the United States and 150 other countries are 
participating. About 2,000 coaches, 15,000 friends and relatives 
and 45,000 volunteers also are involved in the Games.

<HEADLINE> Cities Report Positive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many American cities and towns report a strong  
fiscal picture and expect continuing good economies as they 
increase spending on public safety and infrastructure repairs, the 
National League of Cities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In responses to a questionnaire distributed to 317  
municipalities, 75 percent said they were better able to meet their 
financial needs than they were a year ago. And 64 percent said they 
expected to be in better financial shape next year than they are 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most cities are upbeat about where they are and where they  
seem to be going,'' said Clarence E. Anthony, the mayor of South 
Bay, Fla., and National League of Cities president. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cities picked two factors -- the strength of their tax base  
and the health of the local economy -- as the most important factors 
affecting their ability to meet their overall needs.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Move Higher / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages rose to 7.71 percent this week, the highest 
level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.63 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb for the past two  
months and have fluctuated from their low for this year of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January to their current high of 7.71 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.34 percent this week, up from the average of 7.28 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.05 percent, up from 5.93 percent the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Polhill, an American professor at  
Beirut University College, who was held hostage in the Middle East 
for 39 months, died Thursday at Georgetown University of 
complications from throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A resident of Arlington, Va., Polhill was 65.  
</P>
<P>
	Polhill was working as an assistant professor of business  
studies when he and three fellow faculty members were seized in 
January of 1987 by gunmen posing as police officers on the 
college's campus. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of his time in isolation, Polhill was chained in  
windowless rooms, receiving only occasional visits from doctors to 
treat his diabetes. He was released in 1990, as part of an effort 
to improve relations between Iran and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After his return from captivity, he was diagnosed with throat  
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of New York, Polhill attended Cornell University and  
graduated from New York University in 1961.

<HEADLINE> Magic Look To Add Athleticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With or without Penny Hardaway, the Orlando  
Magic will be a different team next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacrificing toughness and rebounding for youth, athleticism and  
potential, the club began revamping the roster Wednesday night with 
a trade to acquire the rights to flashy 19-year-old Corey Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Team officials said the move wasn't intended as a message to  
Hardaway, who officially became a free agent Thursday. But if the 
four-time All-Star decides his future is with the Magic, he'll 
return to a franchise clearly headed in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
	To acquire Maggette, the Magic sent leading rebounder Horace  
Grant to Seattle and had to accept three veterans -- Dale Ellis, Don 
MacLean and Billy Owens -- who might not remain in Orlando long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maggette is a player that we feel has a tremendous upside,''  
Magic general manager John Gabriel said. ``We think he is one of 
the elite athletes in this year's draft and will be in this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of teams across the league talked about matching the  
athleticism that is coming into the NBA year in and year out. We 
believe that this 20-year-old can do that for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actaully, the 6-foot-7 Maggette won't turn 20 until Nov. 12. He  
left Duke after averaging 10.6 points as a freshman on a team that 
lost to Connecticut in the NCAA title game and produced four of the 
draft's top 14 picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle selected Maggette No. 13 overall, knowing he was who the  
Magic wanted before they would give up Grant, who helped Chicago 
win three NBA titles before jumping to Orlando as a free agent in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no plan going into the draft to do this,'' said coach  
Doc Rivers, who expects to play Maggette at both guard and forward. 
``If he hadn't been there, Horace Grant would still be on our 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic drafted another swingman, Maryland's Laron Profit,  
with the ninth pick in the second round. They addressed the need 
for a backup point guard by acquiring Michigan's Louis Bullock, 
selected four picks later by the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens next will be influenced by Hardaway. The Magic say  
re-signing him is a priority, but several teams also are expected 
to make sign-and-trade offers for the sixth-year pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway said shortly after Orlando's early exit from the  
playoffs that he felt underappreciated and looked forward to 
possibly playing elsewhere. He apologized for the comments the 
following day, but didn't change his mind about exploring his 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic can offer Hardaway as much as $85.6 million over seven  
seasons. The most any other team would be able to pay him is $67.5 
million over six years. A sign-and-trade deal would benefit the 
player financially, while assuring the Magic compensation for 
losing Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Another priority is re-signing forward Bo Outlaw, one of the  
team's best rebounders and defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned with rebounding. I'm concerned with size,''  
Rivers said. ``There is still some time to improve rebounding. ... 
You can't get everything in one night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Maggette, though, the Magic are confident they got a player  
who will have an impact for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't just get a guy who can become a starter, we got a  
guy who can become a star,'' Gabriel said. ``He is going to need 
time, that's all. They all need time. The younger guys need even 
more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggette is excited about the opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it turned out the way it did,'' he said. ``I am going  
to do whatever it takes to get better. With my determination, hard 
work and work ethic, I believe I can do that. I don't know how long 
it's going to take. I know Orlando is going to prepare me, and I'm 
ready for that challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Tide Decides Not To Renew With Rudd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- One of the most familiar sites at a  
NASCAR track -- Ricky Rudd driving a Ford with a Tide logo painted 
on it -- will be history after this year, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble's announcement of the end of the nine-year  
relationship took Rudd by surprise and severely hindered his 
efforts to build a multi-car racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble is negotiating to take its sponsorship to  
Precision Preparation Inc., a racing company owned by Cal Wells, 
whose primary racing interest is in the CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G offered Rudd an opportunity to drive the PPI car, but he  
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a guy who walks off with my sponsor, and they say, `Do  
you want to drive for him?,' Rudd said. ``That conversation didn't 
last very long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an impromptu news conference, Rudd tried to act like a good  
sport, but it was clear this blow hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's something wrong when you allow someone who  
isn't part of this sport to walk out with one of the biggest 
sponsors,'' Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tide spokeswoman Molly Humbert said it was a bittersweet moment  
for the company, one it hoped to avoid by offering Rudd a chance to 
drive for the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked at a lot of different opportunities including Ricky,  
both in terms of him being an owner and him being a driver,'' 
Humbert said. ``We feel we're moving in a good direction with 
PPI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That company already has a sponsorship deal with McDonalds to  
run a car on the Busch series in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rudd will go in search of a new sponsor for the  
Winston Cup team he formed in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished fifth in the point standings that year, but hasn't  
seriously contended since, due to rising costs and limited manpower 
in an era of burgeoning multi-car teams. He said his plans to add a 
second car will be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, Rudd still holds the modern record for  
consecutive years with a victory, a stretch of 16 years from 
1983-98. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he sits 38th in the points standings and hasn't  
finished in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say 120 percent of my attention has been going to trying  
to make this team better,'' Rudd said. ``I used to see all the 
other stuff as trivial. But maybe it's not that trivial because 
they made a fancy presentation and now we don't have a sponsor.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Senate Send Gun Bill to Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Handgun buyers in California would be  
limited to one handgun purchase per month under a bill sent to the 
governor on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved 21-13 by the Senate, is the first gun control  
measure to pass the Legislature since lawmakers vowed to make gun 
laws tougher following an April massacre at a Littleton, Colo., 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, a person can walk into a store, buy countless handguns,  
and feed them to the black market where they're snatched by kids, 
felons and gang members,'' said Assemblyman Wally Knox, a Democrat 
and the bill's author. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis has not yet taken a position on the bill, which  
was recently approved by the state Assembly. Law enforcement 
authorities, federally licensed collectors, and security guards 
would be exempt from the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents contend limiting handgun sales would infringe the  
constitutional right to bear arms and do little to make California 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law doesn't ration guns; it rations rights. It's like  
saying you can have your freedom of speech, but only once a 
month,'' Sen. Bill Morrow, a Republican, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In support of his bill, Knox cited a study by Handgun Control  
Inc., which said about 80 percent of the guns seized by Southern 
California law enforcement officials were originally purchased from 
legal gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 40,722 handguns were sold in California in quantities  
ranging from two to 60.

<HEADLINE> Jury Considers Haney Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A longtime political supporter of Vice  
President Al Gore was a savvy political fund-raiser who tried to 
mask about $100,000 in illegal political contributions in hopes of 
gaining influence with powerful Democrats, federal prosecutors 
claimed at the close of a political money trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin L. Haney recruited dozens of his employees, friends and  
people he barely knew to be straw donors for the 1992 and 1996 
Clinton-Gore campaigns, prosecutor Pamela Huff argued Wednesday, 
before a jury began deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
	The donors wrote checks that were immediately reimbursed by  
Haney in order to get around federal political contribution limits 
of $1,000 per person, Huff said. The donors' checks and related 
paperwork made it appear that the individuals, and not Haney, were 
giving money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney's lawyer, Ted Wells, did not dispute that Haney doled out  
far more than his own individual limit, but said Haney 
misunderstood the campaign regulations and did not try to hide the 
``gifts'' he gave to people who wrote political checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use your common sense,'' Wells told jurors Wednesday. ``If  
somebody thought there was something wrong they'd say, 'Here's the 
(reimbursement) check, don't say anything about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During six days of testimony, federal prosecutors tried to show  
that Haney, a law school graduate who once ran for Congress, was 
very familiar with campaign mechanics and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chattanooga millionaire whose projects include developing  
and leasing property for federal government offices was a 
sophisticated fund-raiser who hoped to wow potential business 
clients with his access to top politicians, including Clinton and 
Gore, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney knew about the political campaign limits, knew it is  
illegal to use straw donors and knew that he was lying to the 
Federal Election Commission, Huff said. Several employees and 
cohorts knew it too, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely clear that he and his employees conspired to  
do this, and they did it,'' Huff said. ``To the tune of $100,000 
they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haney pleaded innocent last November in a case brought as part  
of a Justice Department investigation into unorthodox donations to 
the Clinton-Gore re-election effort in 1996 and other campaigns. He 
faces a maximum sentence of 146 years in federal prison if 
convicted of all counts, although federal sentencing guidelines 
would reduce that to less than 10 years. He has remained free since 
his arrest last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells did not call any witnesses, meaning the jury must decide  
Haney's guilt or innocence based on documents and other evidence 
presented by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was also at the center of a Justice Department  
investigation last year into whether he paid a $1 million reward to 
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign's manager, Peter Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a former top aide to Gore, got the money shortly before  
he took the campaign job. Congressional Republicans issued a report 
in December questioning whether the money was an illegal 
contingency fee for helping get the Federal Communications 
Commission to move to a Haney development in Washington called 
Portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney and Knight both have said the payment represented legal  
fees for Knight's work on several Haney projects over three years. 
Attorney General Janet Reno declined to appoint an independent 
counsel to look at the Knight-Haney matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at Haney's trial, Knight said campaign officials  
did not notice anything amiss in the fund raising that Haney did 
for the campaign.

<HEADLINE> 162-Year-Old Dam To Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- The beginning of the end of the Edwards  
Dam will almost certainly start with a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
	A backhoe was poised today to unleash waters in the Kennebec  
River that haven't flowed freely since the 1830s. It is the first 
dam demolition ever ordered against an owner's wishes and the case 
has drawn the attention of conservationists and utilities across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Dams have fallen in other states, including North Carolina,  
California and Oregon. But the Edwards Dam, which produced a small 
amount of electricity, is the first forcibly removed under a policy 
that weighs power needs against environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-foot-high, 917-foot-wide dam is to be dismantled by  
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the removal of the Edwards Dam, the Kennebec River has  
been given a new lease on life,'' said Steve Brooke, coordinator of 
a coalition that sought the dam's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The process leading to the breach has been watched closely by  
dam opponents in the West where entire salmon runs are extinct and 
others from California to Washington state teeter on the brink. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who was to attend today's  
ceremonies, has encouraged the opponents by saying the nation's 
75,000 dams should not be seen as immovable monoliths like the 
pyramids of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam, about 40 miles from the ocean, has blocked Atlantic  
salmon, endangered shortnose sturgeon and other sea-run fish for 
162 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservationists have labored for years to restore a river that  
was so polluted and choked by industrial wastes that the Capitol 
windows had to be closed in the summer several decades ago to keep 
out the stench. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam rose amid some local opposition in 1837 along a river  
that had been known for its thriving fishery. It supplied 
mechanical power to sawmills and a riverside cotton mill, and later 
was fitted to generate hydroelectric power. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the dam argued it generated only 3.5 megawatts, or  
one-tenth of 1 percent of the state's power -- an amount, they said, 
which could be offset if 75,000 light bulbs were replaced with more 
energy-efficient types. 
</P>
<P>
	The dam's owner, Edwards Manufacturing Co., proposed upgrading  
the output to 11 megawatts. But the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission denied the company's application in 1997 and ordered the 
dam demolished, reasoning that the environmental damage greatly 
outweighed its benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was the first time the government required the removal  
of a dam whose license holder wanted to continue operations. 
Congress had passed a law in 1986 requiring FERC to balance power 
generation and environmental protection when it licenses 
hydroelectric dams. 
</P>
<P>
	FERC's predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, had authorized  
the removal of several dams since the 1920s. But those license 
holders wanted to abandon the projects anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The breaching is expected to lower the Kennebec above the dam by  
about 8 feet within a day, allowing workers to begin the task of 
dismantling the structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the job is done in November, the old cribwork-and-stone  
dam will have been picked to pieces and carted off in about 7,000 
truckloads, said Bruce Skilling, supervisor in charge of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the state, which took over possession of the dam,  
see a resurgence of recreational fishing and boating as the river 
returns to its early-1800s state. 
</P>
<P>
	Margaret Bowman of American Rivers, part of the Kennebec  
Coalition, called Edwards the largest dam east of the Mississippi 
to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	But not all environmentalists are cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Carter of the Forest Ecology Network said the financing  
plan for the removal compromises the overall environmental benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Private companies who raised more than $7 million to pay for  
demolition received the right to fill in wetlands downstream and 
delay construction of fish ladders on several dams upstream, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmental gains minus environmental gains equals zero  
environmental gains,'' Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Capsule To Be Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The underwater salvage expert who found Gus  
Grissom's Mercury capsule at the bottom of the Atlantic two months 
ago headed back out to sea Thursday to lift the 38-year-old 
spacecraft from its watery grave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big relief'' once the capsule is aboard ship,  
said Curt Newport. ``I'll feel like the weight of a Mercury 
capsule's been taken off my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his team discovered Liberty Bell 7 on May 1 in  
3-mile-deep water about 300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral. But 
they were forced to leave it there when the cable to their robotic 
recovery vessel snapped in rough seas. 
</P>
<P>
	It took five weeks for Oceaneering International Inc. to build  
another recovery vessel. The Houston company also supplied a bigger 
ship for this trip, which is expected to last 1 1/2 to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport plans to retrieve the recovery vessel first, then go  
after Liberty Bell 7, the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a 
successful mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule splashed down with Grissom after a 15-minute  
suborbital flight on July 21, 1961. But the explosive bolts that 
blow open the hatch detonated prematurely, and the spacecraft 
filled up with water and sank. 
</P>
<P>
	If he has time, Newport will hunt for the missing hatch, which  
could answer one of the biggest mysteries of the space program: Did 
Grissom blow the hatch or did it malfunction? Grissom insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport expects Liberty Bell 7 to be on deck by the end of next  
week if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no guarantee we're going to come back with a  
spaceship,'' said Newport, 48, who spent 14 years trying to find 
the capsule. ``I think we will, but nothing can be guaranteed 
because there are so many things that can go wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two bomb experts are going along to deactivate an explosive  
navigation device that failed to go off when the spacecraft sank. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship will stop briefly at Fort Lauderdale on Sunday to pick  
up more people, including Jim Lewis, the helicopter pilot who tried 
unsuccessfully to rescue the capsule in 1961, and Guenter Wendt, 
the launch pad leader who strapped in the Mercury astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable television's Discovery Channel is financing the expedition  
for a documentary to be broadcast later this year. Production 
manager Sarah Hume estimates the return trip doubled the cost of 
the venture, which was already in the seven figures.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Activists Seek Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two vegetarian activists are seeking the right to  
appeal a judgment that they defamed McDonald's Corp. by claiming 
that its products are poisonous and cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Morris and Helen Steel petitioned Parliament on Thursday to  
allow them to appeal to the House of Lords, Britain's highest 
court, to overturn a ruling that they pay the hamburger chain 
$64,000 in damages, their supporters said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, known widely in Britain as ``McLibel,'' resulted in a  
314-day trial, the longest in English history. Now it could go on 
even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris and Steel said they were trying to defend the public's  
right to criticize companies whose business operations affect 
people's health and the environment. They argued that multinational 
corporations like McDonald's should no longer be allowed to sue for 
libel, the McLibel Support Campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's suffered an embarrassing  
public relations setback in March when an appeals court upheld the 
activists' claims that the chain sells heart-damaging food and 
treats its workers poorly. The court also did not dispute the 
original findings of a trial judge that McDonald's was responsible 
for animal cruelty and that it exploited children through its 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ultimately reduced the original damages award  
by $32,000, but upheld most of the libel verdict won by McDonald's 
against Morris and Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists hope to persuade the House of Lords that they  
should have won their case against McDonald's outright. 
</P>
<P>
	If denied the opportunity to appeal to Parliament's upper house,  
Morris and Steel said would take the case to the European Court of 
Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Study Released on Ancient Meteor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the space boulder that smashed to  
Earth to create Meteor Crater in Arizona melted upon impact 50,000 
years ago and sprayed molten material in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
	A study appearing Friday in the journal Science concludes that  
an iron meteor 100 feet in diameter and weighing about 60,000 tons 
sailed in from space at almost 45,000 miles an hour and smashed 
into the desert floor near Winslow, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision erupted with the force of a 20 megaton bomb and  
sprayed molten rock for miles around the crater, says Elisabetta 
Pierazzo, co-author of the study and a researcher at the University 
of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Left behind was a bowl-shaped crater about 4,000 feet wide and  
570 feet deep. It was the first crater on Earth to be identified, 
by earlier studies, as being caused by a meteoroid. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierazzo and her co-authors used math models and chemical  
analysis of bits of the space boulder to determine that about 85 
percent of the meteor melted upon contact. Only the back 15 percent 
of the 100-foot space rock did not melt, but, instead, broke into 
bits of that have been called Canyon Diablo meteorites. 
</P>
<P>
	The melted portion turned into grain-size particles called  
spheroids that were spread far and wide by the impact. Only a small 
bit of the spheroids and bits of unmelted meteor have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier estimates had put the impact speed of the meteor at  
about 33,000 miles per hour, but Pierazzo said that the new study 
confirms the faster 45,000 mile-per-hour speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-authors of the study included researchers from Rutgers  
University, the University of Rhode Island, the University of 
California, Berkeley, and the Australian National University in 
Canberra.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twisting his fist as if digging in a dagger,  
President Clinton complimented a reporter on his tough question at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter set up his question by congratulating the president  
on ``your success and resolve in Kosovo.'' Then he went on to ask 
Clinton if he would work as hard to return Palestinian refugees to 
their homes as he did to send ethnic Albanians back to Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns North Korea on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration used the impending  
visit of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to renew a warning to 
North Korea on Thursday that it would suffer ``serious 
consequences'' if it tested another long-range ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have detected signs in recent days that North Korea is  
planning such a test. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about North Korea's intentions are expected to dominate  
Clinton's meeting with Kim on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between the two Koreas have been accelerating. On  
Thursday, a meeting between the two Koreas in Beijing ended in 
acrimony after just 75 minutes. No date was set for a new meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	That setback occurred on the heels of a deadly clash in the  
Yellow Sea on June 15 when a North Korean torpedo boat was sunk, 
killing about 30 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the North Korean missile program, State Department  
spokesman James Foley said the United States views the program as a 
``serious threat to the region and to our nonproliferation 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've repeatedly made clear to Pyongyang that any further  
missile tests would have serious consequences for our relations 
with North Korea, with direct implications for the prospects of 
moving forward with improved relations,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea generated alarm in northeast Asia and beyond last  
summer when it fired without announcement a long-range missile over 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	That rocket was a two-stage missile and is believed to have had  
a range of about 1,000 miles. Some experts believe that a new 
missile North Korea is developing is much more powerful, possibly 
capable of reaching Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda for Friday's meeting is a discussion of Kim's  
policy of engaging North Korea. He said last week that attempts to 
pressure North Korea will only make it stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	His schedule Friday also includes a meeting with former Defense  
Secretary William Perry, who is undertaking a review of U.S policy 
toward North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim will spend the weekend in Philadelphia. During a July 4  
ceremony there, Kim will receive the Liberty Medal in recognition 
of his efforts on behalf of freedom in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	He will visit Canada Monday and early Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Continued Manufacturing Growth Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The manufacturing sector expanded at a  
stronger-than-expected pace in June, and a rising backlog of orders 
at the nation's factories indicates growth should continue in the 
months ahead, according to a survey of corporate purchasing 
executives released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said 16 of 20  
industries reported a pickup in business last month, the fifth 
straight month that U.S. manufacturing increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both production and new orders exhibited significant growth  
when compared to May,'' said Norbert J. Ore, head of the trade 
group's survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers report is closely watched because it  
gives economists -- including Federal Reserve officials -- the first 
reading on how the manufacturing sector and in turn the overall 
economy fared in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers said their monthly index of business  
activity rose to 57 percent in June from 55.2 percent in May. It 
was a much stronger showing than the 54.4 percent analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A reading above 50 percent in the index indicates the  
manufacturing economy is expanding. The index has been climbing 
since a prolonged downturn ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as the Labor Department said in Washington that  
the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
fell unexpectedly last week. The department said that 299,000 
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending 
June 26, down 5,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending  
fell 0.9 percent in May, the second straight monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The news, which overall points to a moderately growing economy,  
came a day after the Fed raised short-term interest rates a modest 
0.25 percentage point, but said it did not appear that any more 
increases were needed to restrain the economy and inflation in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, said the purchasing managers' report signaled that ``there's 
still a very healthy economy ... without any real problems in the 
pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said he did not expect the Fed's decision raising  
interest rates would have a significant impact on manufacturing. 
``The biggest problem for manufacturing isn't interest rates but 
the value of the dollar,'' he said, noting that a strong dollar 
hurts manufacturers' ability to export. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM said its price index reached 53.5 percent in June,  
rising above the 50 percent mark for the second consecutive month 
and indicating that the cost of raw materials continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The price index had risen to 52.2 percent in May, marking the  
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were paying higher prices for raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of those surveyed said new orders were stronger or  
remained at May levels, and just 13 percent said they were lower. 
The index for new orders rose to 61.7 percent in June -- its highest 
level in two years -- from 58.9 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlog of orders increased in June for the fourth  
consecutive month, but not as strongly as in May, the report 
showed. The index was 54.5 percent in June versus 55.5 in May. 
Indicators above 50 indicate growth. Still, just 16 percent of 
those surveyed reported a reduced backlog of orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM represents executives who buy raw materials and  
supplies for manufacturers.

<HEADLINE>  Woman Leads America's Cup Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dawn Riley can handle a jib or a spinnaker, just like any other  
sailor. The difference, however, is this deckhand also balances her 
boat's books. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, the first woman to head an America's Cup team in the  
history of that yachting competition, also works in the middle of 
the crew of 16 on her yacht, ``America True.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But why is the boss in the middle of the boat instead of up  
front? 
</P>
<P>
	``Because,'' she said, ``I don't have enough brain cells to  
steer the boat and the syndicate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley is an accomplished sailor, the only American to sail in  
two Whitbread Round-the-World races and two America's Cups. A 
two-time winner of the Santa Maria Cup, she's now involved in the 
challenge of a lifetime. It's not the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the only woman on the 1992 team,'' she said. ``That was  
unique, an unbelievable experience. I was a rookie. It was my first 
America's Cup. Everything was new. I got to sail with the best in 
the world. Occasionally, there were days when I felt I didn't fit 
in. There was a lot of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America3 won the Cup that year and three years later, Riley was  
back in the boat, this time as captain of an all-women's crew in 
the 1995 Cup competition, won by New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Riley has a bigger stake in the challenge. Beyond her  
responsibilities on the crew, she's also in charge of the money 
side of this operation. The price tag is $20 million, a 
considerable sum until Riley puts the figure in relative terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do you get for $20 million in the NBA?'' She said. ``A  
couple of players? We've got a new boat, a training boat, 16 on the 
crew and between 22 and 30 persons on the overall sailing team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Baylis works alongside Riley on the boat and is amazed by  
the boss' energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's cool, a very determined person,'' Baylis said. ``She's  
tough. She gets the job done and she's not afraid to dig in. It's 
not like she's the CEO and above all this. I've seen some of them, 
when the boat hits the dock, off they go. Whatever needs to be 
done, she does it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've sailed against her and she's always the last person off  
the boat. It's amazing to think with so many things to be 
responsible for that she has so much energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are three other American teams as well as challengers from  
Italy, Japan, Spain, France, Switzerland and Australia. They will 
begin elimination races in October to pick a challenger for the Cup 
series beginning Feb. 19. Riley wants it to be her yacht, which is 
on its way to Auckland, New Zealand. She will follow next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``By Oct. 18, it'll be time to put your boat where your mouth  
is,'' she said. ``We have a realistic chance. We have the boat. 
We're confident in the design. We have plenty of time to get ready. 
We know our plan. Right now, we're finalizing the sailing team. 
We'll be in the water pretty much every day, off one day in 10. 
It's all very positive. The next step is to be first across the 
finish line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley sailed at Michigan State, where she was captain of the  
crew, a trailblazer at a time when there were very few woman 
skippers and none assembling America's Cup challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, in the midst of all the detail work involved in  
organizing this massive operation, Riley, 34, allows herself a 
moment to think about her own private fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be a housewife,'' she said. ``I want to do gardening  
outside a house with a picket fence and a dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then she paused.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not really,'' she said. ``What I want to do is be in the water  
and win the Cup.''

<HEADLINE> Audit: Russia Misreported Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia misreported its foreign currency  
reserves to the International Monetary Fund by $1 billion in 1996, 
according to an audit of the Russian Central Bank's dealings with 
an offshore investment company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, citing sources today, said the audit by the  
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers was ordered to provide IMF 
officials with full disclosure of Russia's dealings with the 
offshore firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the IMF, which has poured billions of dollars  
into the Russian Central Bank's reserves to help bolster economic 
reform, are in Moscow this week discussing a possible new loan 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the audit have been presented to the Central Bank and  
the IMF but the bank's chairman has resisted making the audit 
public, the Post quoted sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF spokeswoman in Washington, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said, ``We have not received the final report. We've 
only seen a draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the IMF would like the Central Bank to make the final  
report public. 
</P>
<P>
	The case in which Russia is alleged to have misled the IMF  
involves a $1 billion internal loan that the Central Bank made to 
the Russian government in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank was given a promissory note in exchange for the  
loan, but the note was then sent to an offshore firm, which skewed 
the Russia's reports to the IMF on the size of its hard currency 
reserves, the Post said.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Bids Farewell to Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- The German Parliament bid farewell to Bonn  
today before heading off to its prewar seat in Berlin, one of the 
last acts in the government's transition back to Germany's historic 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower chamber's last session in the small town on the Rhine,  
which became then-West Germany's postwar capital in 1949, caps four 
decades that saw Germans build their first stable parliamentary 
democracy and reunite with East Germany after communism fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving to Berlin, but not into a new republic,''  
declared former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who united Germany in 1990. 
``That is why we should not talk about a `Berlin Republic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In a sweeping speech, his first in parliament since his election  
defeat last fall, Kohl appealed to the nation to remain committed 
to the drive for European unity -- especially the inclusion of 
eastern Europe after the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, let us resist the temptation to show off our  
increased influence in a self-important way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also defended the move to Berlin against concerns over the  
symbolism of returning to the former capital of the Nazis and the 
Prussian military state. The decision to move narrowly passed in 
parliament eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, he said, must have its seat in its historic  
capital, ``where the wound of the division in the midst of Germany 
and Europe hurt, and where it is slowly healing today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse opened today's session  
with an assurance that ``the basic coordinates of German policy'' 
would not change with the government's return to Berlin in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The democratic and federal structures developed in Bonn will  
live on in Berlin as long as we ... continually create the 
conditions for it with our political will and the engagement of the 
citizens,'' he told fellow lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	After ``the best 50 years in German history,'' the nation now  
also needs to work on overcoming the gap between former communist 
East Germany and the West, Thierse said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last session culminated with the inauguration of Germany's  
new president, Johannes Rau. 
</P>
<P>
	Rau, a member of the governing Social Democrats, said he would  
use the largely ceremonial post to promote tolerance of Germany's 
more than 7 million foreign residents and to ``help minorities find 
their voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged industry and the government to focus on fighting  
double-digit unemployment. ``It remains the most important task of 
our society to create jobs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening, Schroeder and other leading politicians were  
expected for a festive farewell ceremony in front of Bonn's 
18th-century city hall, with an orchestra playing a symphony 
composed for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 669 parliamentarians and their staff start  
packing boxes for shipment to Berlin over the summer break. The 
legislature resumes sessions in the remodeled Reichstag building in 
central Berlin in the second week of September.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 20; Nasdaq Is Up 6 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 20  
points in today's early going. Advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange hold a 4-3 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up six points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up a fraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks will have a hard time adding to yesterday's relief rally,  
after the Fed announced its decision on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally left the Nasdaq composite and the S&AMP;P 500 at record  
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	And it gave the Dow its third straight gain of more than 100  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	But some profit-taking in the bond market is pushing the yield  
on the 30-year bond back up above the key six percent level. 
</P>
<P>
	And that in turn is putting some downward pressure on equities  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	On the corporate earnings front, Starbucks warned that its  
results for the next two quarters would be below estimates.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Prodigy Offering Free PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. and Prodigy Communications  
Corp., two major providers of Internet access, have joined an 
industry push to offer consumers free personal computers if they 
agree to sign up for online service. 
</P>
<P>
	While smaller companies started giving away PCs last year, AOL  
and Prodigy are the biggest examples yet of how the plunging price 
of computers is fast making them into just a delivery mechanism for 
services and software. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it would give a $400 rebate on selected eMachines Inc.  
computers to people who agree to subscribe to its $21.95-a-month 
CompuServe Internet access for three years. The lowest-price 
eMachines computer is $399, in effect making it free, but the 
monitor isn't included. The deal also applies to all computers 
bought at the Circuit City retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Prodigy announced a similar three-year deal for computers  
bought at Best Buy consumer electronics stores. Its Internet access 
costs $19.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to help AOL finally bolster the subscriber  
base of its CompuServe service, which has only 2 million 
subscribers compared to its flagship AOL service, with 17 million 
subscribers. It is intended to reach out the millions of Americans 
who haven't yet bought PCs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the arrangement may not be as attractive as it seems. In the  
Internet industry, three years is an extremely long time to lock 
into a contract for online service, and new bargains are springing 
up all the time.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR, CART To Work on Diversity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jesse Jackson's push for greater minority  
inclusion in professional American sports got a boost Thursday as 
leaders from two top car racing organizations, NASCAR and CART, 
agreed to work to better diversify the $5 billion-a-year industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and her husband, Bob, announced  
the formation of Joyner-Kersee Racing, a joint partnership with 
Kurt Roehrig and Roehrig Motorsports. The team plans to compete in 
Winston Cup next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they succeed, the Kersees would become the first black  
owners to enter a car on NASCAR's top circuit since Wendell Scott 
in the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Kersee will run the coaching and planning part of the  
business while his wife, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, will 
be in charge of marketing and trying to find a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``NASCAR's goal and my job are to increase the number of racing  
enthusiasts to the broadest possible audience,'' said Brian France, 
senior vice president of NASCAR, the sanctioning body for stock car 
racing, one of the nation's fastest-growing sports. 
</P>
<P>
	France said his organization would begin a diversity management  
council within its group to help address the needs of minority race 
drivers, mechanics and support staff who say they have been 
overlooked by the white race structure for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came during a two-day seminar, sponsored by  
Jackson's Rainbow-Push organization, that is intended to increase 
minority participation in the business end of sports. 
</P>
<P>
	France said his group would also start an internship program  
with historically black colleges and universities to increase its 
outreach. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Craig, chairman and CEO of the CART Indy-car racing  
organization, said his group will begin work with a black North 
Carolina racing team to build a training program that will identify 
three black drivers to drive and train under CART experts and 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The selected drivers will get written evaluations but won't be  
guaranteed a ride in CART events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its a social issue. Its just the right thing to do. We want  
the sport to represent America,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the audience said they weren't impressed by the  
announcements and said more should be done to bring blacks into 
motorsports. France and Craig said their actions are limited 
because, as sanctioning bodies, they can't tell sponsors who to put 
behind the wheel or repair the race cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't create a race team for anybody,'' France said. ``But  
we can provide access to mentors and people who know the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While car racing is enjoying its greatest popularity nationally  
in the grandstands and in television ratings, blacks have felt 
locked out of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its a matter of exposure. We like most people like  
cars. But when it comes to racing them, its almost like hockey. We 
just don't take to it,'' said Ron Waters, president of the 
Quartermasters Drag Racing Team, an integrated racing outfit based 
in Capitol Heights, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson recalled his own South Carolina upbringing not far from  
some of stock car racing's major tracks. He said that while poor 
black youths could freely sell peanuts and popcorn at other 
sporting events, the all-white nature of the car race tracks 
precluded that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just couldn't go there. But today is another matter,''  
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference is being organized by Rainbow Sports, a division  
of Jackson's Rainbow-Push Wall Street Project, which is working 
with the sports industry to develop specific standards and 
practices for greater diversity.

<HEADLINE> Co-Pilot Sentenced in Fatal Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- An Army pilot has been convicted of  
misappropriating a helicopter that was involved in a Bahamas crash 
that killed his wife and the wife of another pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Riddell was reprimanded Wednesday  
by a military judge and sentenced to $4,500 in fines and pay 
forfeiture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased with the judge's decision,'' said Riddell,  
accused along with another pilot of taking their wives on a joyride 
that turned tragic aboard the UH-60 Blackhawk last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Kenneth Pangburn, acquitted Riddell of  
conspiracy and dropped dereliction of duty charges. Riddell could 
have received two years in prison and been dismissed from the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell was charged along with Chief Warrant Officer David Guido  
-- the pilot -- and Sgt. William Westgate, who were in the Bahamas 
for a drug-interdiction mission. The July 6, 1998, crash on Grand 
Exuma Island killed Rebecca Riddell and Pam Guido. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell testified that he took his wife on the flight as a  
reward for what she had put up with during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido was convicted last month of conspiracy, wrongful  
appropriation of an aircraft and violation of a lawful general 
regulation. He was sentenced to a reprimand plus fines and 
forfeited pay totaling $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Westgate, an avionics technician, is scheduled to be court  
martialed July 8. He is charged with conspiracy and willful 
dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell testified that he believed mechanical problems -- not  
pilot error -- caused the crash. An Army board concluded the cause 
was pilot error. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Doug Andrews said Riddell punishes himself  
every day for the loss of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Riddell is ready to accept your sentence,'' Andrews said.  
``Your sentence, regardless of what it is, can't be harsher than 
what he's already been through.''

<HEADLINE> Republicans Promise Massive Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the federal government awash in money,  
House Republicans promised today to pass a massive tax cut that 
includes broad income tax relief and cuts in taxes on capital gains 
and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the size of projected  
federal surpluses should allow Congress and President Clinton to 
ensure the future solvency of Medicare and Social Security as well 
as cut taxes over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the largest surplus in history,'' Hastert told a  
Capitol Hill rally. ``As we commit ourselves to finding ways to 
secure our retirement programs, we also commit ourselves to 
bringing fairness to the tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without announcing specifics, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the  
House Ways and Means Committee chairman, said the tax bill would 
include broad income tax relief for ``everyone who made this 
surplus possible,'' as well as changes to fix the ``marriage 
penalty'' in which millions of two-income couples pay more than 
they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said that  
options for the broad-based income tax cut under consideration 
included reductions of 1 percent a year across the board -- for a 
total of 10 percent over the decade -- and upward adjustment of the 
lowest 15 percent bracket so that more people would pay at a lower 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Archer said the measure would phase out estate  
taxes, reduce capital-gains taxes on investments retroactively to 
today, increase the amount of money people can contribute to 
Individual Retirement Accounts and extend expiring business tax 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans today are paying higher taxes than any time in  
peacetime history,'' Archer said. ``They have the right to pay 
less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Archer this week had said the bill could reach $1  
trillion or more, new Congressional Budget Office forecasts for the 
10-year surplus would leave Republicans just short of that figure. 
The budget resolution passed earlier by Congress envisions tax cuts 
of $778 billion over the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., called the plan  
``totally irresponsible'' because it would not eliminate the public 
debt and would prevent investments in areas such as education. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really have left out the important priorities that we  
ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``We do need a 
tax cut. It can be far less expensive than this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, as budget surplus projections keep rising, fewer members  
of either party are seriously suggesting there should be no tax cut 
at all. The argument is increasingly becoming how large and who 
stands to benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's money for more things,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan of New York, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet moderate House Republicans told Hastert at a lunch Wednesday  
that they oppose using improving budget surplus projections to add 
to the $778 billion, 10-year tax cut already envisioned by the 
GOP's budget blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have a very large tax cut,'' said Rep. Michael  
Castle, R-Del. ``We're struggling to increase all our 
appropriations bills for education, health, the welfare of the 
country. ... My own personal vote is we should not increase the tax 
cut at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment is shared by many Senate Republicans, who say  
they would prefer a bill that can attract Democratic support and 
that could be signed by Clinton, as opposed to a political 
statement aimed at the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a decision to make,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.  
``Do we align ourselves with some kind of symbolic statement ... or 
do we fashion a doable measure? Let's move this forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For conservative Republicans, a tax cut of up to $1 trillion is  
a clear signal to voters they want to stop government from 
expanding through new spending out of the surplus, which they 
consider an overpayment by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a trillion-dollar overage,'' said Rep.  
J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. ``It's important for us to show that we are 
here to provide much-needed tax relief for American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats are also beginning to craft alternatives as the  
tide of surplus cash erodes their arguments that Social Security 
and Medicare cannot be made solvent for the future if Congress 
passes a massive tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., co-sponsor with Coverdell of a  
more modest tax package that embraces some of the House bill's 
concepts, said up to 15 Senate Democrats could support a tax cut if 
it is no larger than $500 billion over 10 years and is targeted to 
the middle class. Clinton has indicated he might sign a moderate 
bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There clearly is considerable momentum building for a  
middle-income tax cut,'' Torricelli said. ``The fight is becoming 
not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the dividend.''

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Down 0.9 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending fell in May for a second  
straight month, the first time that has happened in two years, 
indicating one of the economy's strongest sectors is starting to 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that spending dropped by 0.9  
percent in May, after falling by 2 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The declines were fairly widespread, with decreases reported in  
single-family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and motels and big 
government construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease was not expected. Many analysts had expected  
construction spending to rise by 1 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity, driven by low  
mortgage rates, were a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. Sales of new and 
existing homes had hit record highs during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pace of home sales has cooled in recent months,  
reflecting rising mortgage rates. Sales of new homes fell 5.1 
percent in May and sales of existing homes dropped 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, worried that the economy was not slowing  
quickly enough to keep inflation under control, announced Wednesday 
it was increasing short-term interest rates by a quarter point. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Fed, in a pleasant surprise for financial markets,  
signaled this increase may be enough to slow economic activity to a 
more sustainable rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rebounded after the increase was announced Wednesday  
but was barely on the plus side in late morning today although 
hovering near the 11,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report, the Labor Department said today the number  
of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional evidence of the economy's strength came today in a  
report from corporate purchasing executives. The National 
Association of Purchasing Management said 16 of 20 industries 
reported a pickup in business in June -- the fifth straight month of 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction report showed that spending on residential  
building fell 0.5 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $320 billion with both single-family homes and apartments 
showing declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending for all private building projects fell 0.7  
percent, the second straight month of decline, something that has 
not happened for three years. Spending on factories, hotels and 
hospitals all saw declines. But spending on office buildings showed 
a gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on government construction projects fell 1.6 percent in  
May, the third straight monthly decline, the first time that has 
happened in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the report on jobless claims, the Labor Department said  
299,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits for the 
week ending June 26 -- down by 5,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts had expected a slight rise in jobless claims. The  
drop below the 300,000 level indicated that the labor market 
remains exceptionally tight. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which helps smooth out  
week-to-week volatility, also was down to 307,000, the lowest level 
since May 29 when they were at 305,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The government on Friday will report on unemployment for the  
month of June and many analysts believe the rate will stay at 4.2 
percent, a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said that for the week ending June 19, 29  
states and territories reported declined in jobless claims, while 
23 had increases. The state data lag a week behind the national 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed indicated that it was not contemplating further  
rate increases at this time, many economists believe that if the 
economic picture remains strong the central bank will raise rates 
again later this year.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Loses Colleague's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Gov. Lamar Alexander, publicly  
upbeat even as his campaign for the Republican presidential 
nomination lags, has lost some support in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., announced Thursday that he no longer is  
backing Alexander and is throwing his support to Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush instead. The six other Republicans in the Tennessee 
congressional delegation continue to support Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I strongly believe that as president, George W. Bush can lead  
the way in reversing the spiritual and moral decline that worries 
so many American families,'' Wamp said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delay in the announcement of my support for Governor Bush  
was simply caused by my genuine desire to not hurt my friend and 
fellow Tennessean Lamar Alexander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding, Alexander's political director Brian Kennedy said,  
``We're proud to have the support of the rest of the Tennessee 
delegation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chip Saltsman said he was  
``a little surprised'' by Wamp's move but that it would not sway 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people in Tennessee are supporting Lamar for  
president,'' Saltsman said. ``The party has been neutral and we 
will continue to be neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Alexander officially announced his campaign March 9, each  
member of the Tennessee Republican delegation gave Alexander 
permission to use his name as an honorary campaign vice chairman, 
Alexander spokesman Bo Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next week, Bush's campaign claimed Wamp's endorsement,  
prompting a statement from the third-term Tennessee congressman 
that he supported Alexander but had attended an event for Bush, 
``whom I admire very much.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Easing Cuba Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is threatening to  
veto a $12.7 billion foreign aid package that slashes many 
international programs, including the Peace Corps, while providing 
unrequested funds for a Kosovo security force. 
</P>
<P>
	Before passing the overall spending bill late Wednesday, the  
Senate rejected, 55-43, a proposal that would have eased 
restrictions on American citizens who want to travel to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors said nearly 40 years of sanctions have failed to  
produce much impact on the policies of Cuba's Fidel Castro. But 
opponents argued that it would undermine long-standing U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the time for lifting any of the sanctions on  
Cuba,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. ``This is the time for us to 
hold the line on our policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill for the first time slightly reduces overall aid for  
Israel and Egypt, by far the largest U.S. aid recipients. 
Assistance to Israel was reduced by $60 million and aid to Egypt by 
$40 million. Israel is to receive $1.08 billion in economic aid and 
$1.86 billion in military aid, and Egypt is to receive $775 million 
and $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would provide $535 million to Kosovo and other  
Balkan and Eastern European states next year, mostly for 
reconstruction. Peacekeeping funds would be included in a separate 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is threatening a veto of the overall bill,  
mainly on grounds that it cuts too much from what it views as 
critical programs, including the Peace Corps. The legislation makes 
a $50 million, or 19 percent, reduction to President Clinton's 
request for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1.9 billion less, overall, than Clinton  
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	That would result in ``severe underfunding of a number of  
crucial programs,'' said a statement from White House Budget 
Director Jacob Lew. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill was approved 97-2.  
</P>
<P>
	One section opposed by the administration would add $20 million  
for a security force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House statement on Wednesday said this provision  
``could be interpreted as aimed at training and equipping the 
Kosovo Liberation Army'' and that this was ``diametrically at 
odds'' with the recent agreement by the KLA to disarm under NATO 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, told the Senate, 
``Members of the KLA may very well be included in a security force, 
but that is not a decision for us to make.'' He said the measure 
does not provide express support for arming or supporting the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has yet to act on similar legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed bill also denies any foreign economic aid to  
Russia unless Moscow agrees to serve completely under NATO command 
in the Kosovo peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
	It also cuts $15 million from the administration's $55 million  
request under a 1996 program designed to provide North Korea with 
oil for conventional power plants to dissuade it from advancing its 
nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also ignores the Clinton administration's request for  
$500 million to support the Wye River peace agreement between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors of easing the restrictions on flights to Cuba contended  
it made no sense to penalize Americans by not letting them visit 
Cuba and that the presence of more Americans on the island might 
have a beneficial effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the purpose of a further isolation (of Cuba) if in 40  
years it hasn't produced a change?'' asked Sen. Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., the prime sponsor of the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal would have given all U.S. citizens the same access  
to Cuba that journalists, humanitarian organizations and government 
officials have. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, there are no regular flights from U.S. airports to  
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct charter flights to Cuba were legal until 1996 when Cuba  
shot down two Miami-based civilian planes flown by members of a 
Cuban exile group. Four men died in the incident off the Cuban 
coast. Clinton retaliated by banning such flights, but reinstated 
them in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government imposes sharp restrictions on who can  
travel, mostly limiting travel rights to those who have families in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., opposed the move to relax these  
restrictions. Even under the current setup, some 100,000 Americans 
a year have been visiting Cuba, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our argument with Fidel Castro is not over,'' Torricelli said.

<HEADLINE> Soggy Chaos for Wimbledon Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- The most important match of their  
lives turned into soggy chaos Thursday for Wimbledon upstarts 
Jelena Dokic and Alexandra Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Stevenson swept through the first set of the  
quarterfinal 6-3, hitting seven aces and capitalizing on five 
double faults by the 16-year-old Australian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Focus, Alexandra,'' shouted Stevenson's mother, Samantha,  
during the second set. 
</P>
<P>
	The young American did just the opposite.  
</P>
<P>
	Regaining her serving touch and hammering Stevenson from the  
baseline, Dokic took a 5-1 lead and was serving at 40-30 for the 
second set when a light shower forced the court to be covered -- the 
second time the match was stopped by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only 3:24 p.m. and 2,000 fans on Court 2 were still  
hoping to see the light rain stop, the match concluded -- and maybe 
see Andre Agassi vs. Gustavo Kuerten later on the same court. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget it.  
</P>
<P>
	Dokic and Stevenson will finish their quarterfinal Friday as  
only two matches were completed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will become the first woman qualifier to reach the  
semifinals in Wimbledon's 113-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a messy chronology:  
</P>
<P>
	4:58 p.m. -- After waiting in the locker room for 1 hour, 34  
minutes to end the second set, this year's two Wimbledon prodigies 
return to warm up. Stevenson is greeted again by a small sign held 
up in the first row behind the umpire's chair: ``Alex the Great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	5:01 p.m. -- A light mist returns and the covers come back on  
after they each hit about 40 practice shots. 
</P>
<P>
	6:05 p.m. -- The showers have stopped for 30 minutes but there's  
no move to remove the covers. A small group of Brazilians entertain 
with Samba chants and lead the crowd in a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	7:32 p.m. -- Referee Alan Mills walks onto Court 2 as the covers  
are pulled back. He brushes his hand across the grass. Too wet. 
``It is not playable,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	7:35 p.m. -- Fans Lira Estrella and Alex Daza get up to leave.  
Alex is satisfied to have seen two of tennis' best young players 
for only 8 pounds, about $13. ``That was a good deal even with 
rain,'' 
</P>
<P>
	His girlfriend disagrees. She arrived late and saw on only four  
minutes of play. ``I got only 30 pence worth,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	7:40 p.m. -- Stevenson and Dokic agree to try finishing their  
match on Court 1, which -- like Centre Court -- is reported to be 
drier than Court 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, it's not all that dry. Tim Henman and Cedric Pioline  
decline to continue their quarterfinal there with Henman leading 
1-0 in the first set. Quarterfinalists Nathalie Tauziat and Mirjana 
Lucic also turn down the court and stay on Court 18. 
</P>
<P>
	8:07 p.m -- A message on the electric signboard on Court 1,  
posted after Henman and Pioline leave, reads: ``There will be no 
further play on this court today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	8:08 p.m -- The message is erased. In its place goes: Miss  
Stevenson vs. Miss Dokic. 
</P>
<P>
	8:11 p.m. -- Dokic and Stevenson arrive at Court 1. They are  
greeted by a standing ovation by 200 fans in the 11,500-seat 
stadium, almost all of them taking flash pictures -- prohibited at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	8:14 p.m. -- The two warm up in light conditions similar to a  
public park at dusk. A Stevenson practice serve whizzes by Dokic 
and she glances up at the dark sky. 
</P>
<P>
	8:19 p.m. -- A clearly unhappy Dokic marches over to the umpire's  
chair to say it's too dark. It's also raining again when all play 
for the day is called off.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Driver's License Laws Tougher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Mercedes Santana made it to Florida's driver's  
licensing office just in time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dominican Republic native who had been using a driver's  
license from her home country got a state license hours before 
tighter requirements took effect. As of today, it is harder for 
teen-agers and undocumented aliens to get a Florida license. 
</P>
<P>
	Santana arrived at the licensing office before it opened early  
Wednesday to beat the long lines. Eight hours later, she had her 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I (had not) gotten it today,'' Ms. Santana said, ``I would  
have driven without a license.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning today, applicants who don't have a valid U.S. or  
Canadian driver's license must show one of five official documents: 
a U.S. birth certificate, a valid U.S. passport, an Immigration and 
Naturalization Service green card, an employment authorization card 
or a Justice Department proof of non-immigrant classification. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, they must show a secondary piece of identification  
from a longer list of acceptable documents, including baptism 
certificates, marriage certificates, Social Security cards, family 
Bible records or birth announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law brings Florida into compliance with other states.  
Since a license is usually enough identification for a credit card 
or bank account, it should make it harder to open false accounts, 
said Janet Dennis, spokeswoman for the Department of Highway Safety 
and Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old law, applicants could present almost any form of  
identification bearing their name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think about a family Bible record and a baptism certificate --  
those are easy to come by and they are also easy to (fake),'' said 
Ms. Dennis. ``This is really going to help us prevent fraud in 
Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Tapes May Be Admissible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal judge who will preside over former  
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros' trial showed little patience 
Thursday for the defense argument that none of the 88 tapes 
secretly recorded by Cisneros' ex-mistress should be allowed into 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because all the tapes are copies, in some cases edited to  
delete certain passages, doesn't mean prosecutors shouldn't have 
the right to play snippets of conversations between Cisneros and 
one-time paramour Linda Jones, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't accept your position here that because some tampering  
has gone on, there cannot be the introduction of any tapes,'' 
Sporkin told Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon, offering the first hint 
of his thinking on the recordings' admissibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes are crucial to Independent Counsel David Barrett's  
case that Cisneros, while being considered for a post in the 
Clinton Cabinet, conspired with Ms. Jones to understate how much 
money he gave her after their extramarital affair ended. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cisneros acknowledged during his Cabinet background check  
that he gave her financial support after publicity about their 
affair destroyed her marriage and career as a political 
fund-raiser, prosecutors contend he falsely told the FBI he never 
paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges he paid her  
more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. He has pleaded innocent. 
His trial is scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin, who has not heard any tapes but has read some written  
transcripts, said prosecutors should have the right to offer up 
recordings in which Cisneros discusses financial arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some statements here that would indicate  
acknowledgment by the defendant that there have been payments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge must rule on the tapes' admissibility at the  
conclusion of a pretrial hearing expected to continue through next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge throws out the tapes, the prosecution would have to  
rely heavily on bank documents and the testimony of Ms. Jones, who 
acknowledged again and again from the witness stand last week that 
she lied repeatedly to federal agents investigating Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' lawyers contend all of the tapes are inadmissible  
because they are copies of since-destroyed originals and because 
Ms. Jones had an unlawful intent in making them. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the government's own tape expert, Simon sought to show  
that all 88 had potentially been edited. Prosecutors say Ms. Jones 
altered only five to remove sections where she threatened Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're permitting phony, tampered evidence to come in,'' Simon  
said heatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Snapped Sporkin: ``I'm not buying today, I'm not buying that  
argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones herself ran afoul of Barrett's investigation, in part  
because she misrepresented the tapes to the FBI and Internal 
Revenue Service as unaltered originals. She is serving 3 1/2 years in 
prison.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV lures Viewers in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Every television viewer knows that, come  
September, broadcasters deliver an orgy of new series and season 
premieres. But that's not the only time for networks to trot out 
big new projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable has its own ``shadow season,'' and we're smack in the  
middle of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable executives put forth their best material in the summer to  
steal viewers when the big networks are showing reruns. The 
strategy gets more popular every year, and it's paying off with 
some gaudy ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the time for us to sort of move in for the kill,'' said  
Eileen Katz, executive vice president of programming at Comedy 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time this year, Comedy Central set aside one week  
to premiere several shows. The timing -- in mid-June, less than a 
month after the broadcast season ended -- was no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Comedy Central's new programs, ``The Man Show,'' scored  
higher ratings than any other premiere in the network's nine-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV is launching 10 series this summer, and existing shows like  
``Real World'' and ``Celebrity Death Match'' have started their 
seasons. The results? In June, MTV recorded some of its highest 
viewership levels ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though MTV is one of the most profitable networks in the  
business, executives see no sense in trying to compete with big 
network marketing budgets in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``This network was started as an alternative to what we called  
`real TV,''' said Judy McGrath, MTV president. ``We were always 
looking for an opportunity when broadcasters didn't see them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TNT pulled in viewers with ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' its  
movie about the computer industry's pioneers, and will try again 
next week with ``The Hunley,'' a Civil War drama. ``The Count of 
Monte Cristo'' last week gave Bravo its best ratings ever for an 
original production. 
</P>
<P>
	The History Channel, frequent home to war documentaries, offers  
``The History of Sex'' next month. Discovery scares swimmers with 
its annual shark week, and the usually staid Bravo profiles '70s 
rock icons ABBA and David Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO starts several series during the summer, such as ``Sex in  
the City'' and ``Oz.'' The Travel Channel, USA, The Food Network, 
TBS, The Learning Channel and Lifetime also bring forth new 
original material. 
</P>
<P>
	While cable watches its numbers soar, the audience for broadcast  
networks has plummeted. The average prime-time audience for CBS, 
NBC, ABC and Fox was 33 million last week, down from 47 million in 
mid-May, Nielsen Media Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau predicts that this  
summer, for the first time, basic cable networks will overtake the 
top four broadcasters in viewers. Just five years ago, the four 
networks held a nearly 3-to-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters are painfully aware that they bleed viewers in the  
summer, many of whom never return. But the economics of the 
business prevent them from presenting more than a handful of new 
shows. Programming is so expensive that networks generally lose 
money on shows unless they have a chance to rerun them. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, broadcasters seem to be rushing the seasons. They  
began advertising their new fall programs before summer even began. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the industry predict the days of a uniform fall season  
opening are numbered, and all networks will sprinkle new shows 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``During such a competitive time when there are so many  
choices,'' said MTV's McGrath, TV executives ``can't really afford 
to go fishing for that many months.''

<HEADLINE> Three Free Agents Stay with Sharks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Goalie Mike Vernon, defenseman Bill  
Houlder and right wing Tony Granato have decided to remain with San 
Jose Sharks, signing up for option years rather than pursuing free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon, a Stanley Cup winner with both the Calgary Flames and  
Detroit Red Wings, posted a 16-22-10 record with a 2.27 
goals-against average in 49 games last season. He holds the team's 
career shutout mark with nine and is third in career wins among 
active goalies with 347. 
</P>
<P>
	Houlder has scored 64 points -- 16 goals and 48 assists -- in 158  
games for the Sharks. and 203 points -- 50 goals and 153 assists -- 
in 530 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Granato is tied for 16th on the Sharks all-time scoring list  
with 77 points -- 47 goals and 30 assists -- in 170 games since 
joining the team in August of 1996. He returned to the NHL after 
missing the final 32 games of the 1995-1996 season while recovering 
from brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also announced they picked up the option on the  
contract of right wing Ronnie Stern.

<HEADLINE> AOL, Microsoft Offer Free PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major Internet services and computer makers are  
joining forces to offer a seemingly unbeatable deal to entice 
millions more people to join the Web revolution: free personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the freebies have conditions, a flood of offers this month  
will hasten the day when PCs are routinely given away just like 
cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, Microsoft and Prodigy, three of the biggest  
names in Internet access, are promising free personal computers to 
anyone who agrees to buy their service for three years. Other major 
Internet providers are expected to add similar deals with computer 
makers later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The giveaways don't provide a $100-$300 monitor and demand a  
3-year commitment to the Internet services, which adds up to as 
much as $790. 
</P>
<P>
	But home computers, which used to cost as much as a used car,  
are clearly hitting bargain basement levels. While smaller 
companies started giving away PCs last year, announcements on 
Wednesday by AOL and on Thursday by Prodigy show how plunging 
prices are fast making PCs into just a delivery mechanism for 
services and software. A steady drop in prices of parts, such as 
microprocessors and hard-disk drives, has helped make giveaways 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be nearly universal,'' said Roger Kay, an  
industry analyst with the International Data Corp. research firm. 
``It's like the old AT&AMP;T model, where they gave you the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said it would give a $400 rebate on selected computers made  
by eMachines Inc. to anyone who subscribes to AOL's $21.95-a-month 
CompuServe Internet access for three years. The lowest-price 
eMachines computer is $399, in effect making it free, but the 
monitor isn't included. The deal also applies to all computers 
bought at the Circuit City retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement is expected to help AOL finally bolster the  
subscriber base of its CompuServe service, which is targeted to 
small businesses and home office users, but has only 2 million 
subscribers. AOL's flagship online service has 17 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy announced a similar 3-year deal for any brand of  
computer bought at Best Buy consumer electronics stores. Its 
Internet access costs $19.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. is offering a $400 rebate to customers who buy a  
personal computer at Staples Office supply stores. The one-week 
trial ends Saturday, but Microsoft officials said they are 
considering extending the offer, as they did with a 3-month old 
offer at the small computer chain Micro Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The major PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard Corp. and Compaq  
Computer Corp., are expected to announce similar deals with 
Internet service providers later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves will squeeze already thin profit margins at PC makers,  
which may be forced to offer lower-priced machines to compete with 
eMachines' budget product. 
</P>
<P>
	But they may have little choice. EMachines, a startup in  
Fremont, Calif. that launched its first major sub-$600 PCs last 
September, has vaulted into No. 5 among PCs sold at retail with 9 
percent of the market in May, according to the research firm PC 
Data. Compaq was No. 1, followed by Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer 
Corp. and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	A chief reason many consumers don't want to spend a lot is  
because many use PCs mainly for Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to look at the Internet expense as a  
monthly annuity, just as you pay the telephone company,'' said 
Stephen Dukker, the chief executive of eMachines. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the Internet, people are quickly getting conditioned  
to free stuff. Nowadays, it's possible to get free Internet access, 
e-mail, faxes and voice-mail messages sent to your computer for 
playback over its speakers. Many of these freebies require users to 
watch advertising or give up personal information to marketers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the PC offers are without risks. Signing up for a  
three-year contract is a lifetime in Internet time. New methods of 
accessing the Internet far faster than traditional telephone 
modems, such as through cable TV lines, are becoming available to 
more Americans. And customers who break their three-year contracts 
with Internet providers face penalties.

	UN Chastises World Chiefs on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations sharply criticized NATO  
governments today for having spent billions to bomb Yugoslavia in 
the name of returning ethnic Albanians to Kosovo but refusing now 
to pay for their resettlement. The U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees has received only $140 million of the $400 million it says 
it needs to help repatriating refugees rebuild their homes and 
lives in Kosovo, said Soren Jessen-Petersen, the deputy high

on the limits of their peacekeeping role in Kosovo, NATO officials 
said. The Russians, led by Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov, sought to 
extend their political powers within the wartorn province and 
establish a voice in the chain of command. They also want to expand 
their peacekeeping presence into two more sectors, NATO officials 
said. NATO officials, however, would prefer to keep the Russians in 
the decision-making background.

Congress emphatically endorsed compromise legislation today to 
shield businesses from a potential flood of Y2K computer-related 
lawsuits. The White House says President Clinton will sign it. A 
House vote of 404-24 was followed several hours later by an 81-18 
vote in the Senate. The Senate's main sponsor, Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., called passage ``a victory for the nation and for the 
continued prosperity of our economy as we enter the new 
millennium.'' One of the top legislative priorities of the business 
community this year, the bill would give them 90 days to fix Y2K

<HEADLINE> Continued Manufacturing Growth Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The manufacturing sector expanded at a  
stronger-than-expected pace in June, and a rising backlog of orders 
at the nation's factories indicates growth should continue in the 
months ahead, according to a survey of corporate purchasing 
executives released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said 16 of 20  
industries reported a pickup in business last month, the fifth 
straight month that U.S. manufacturing increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both production and new orders exhibited significant growth  
when compared to May,'' said Norbert J. Ore, head of the trade 
group's survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers report is closely watched because it  
gives economists -- including Federal Reserve officials -- the first 
reading on how the manufacturing sector and in turn the overall 
economy fared in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers said their monthly index of business  
activity rose to 57 percent in June from 55.2 percent in May. It 
was a much stronger showing than the 54.4 percent analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	A reading above 50 percent in the index indicates the  
manufacturing economy is expanding. The index has been climbing 
since a prolonged downturn ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came as the Labor Department said in Washington that  
the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits 
fell unexpectedly last week. The department said that 299,000 
Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending 
June 26, down 5,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending  
fell 0.9 percent in May, the second straight monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The news, which overall points to a moderately growing economy,  
came a day after the Fed raised short-term interest rates a modest 
0.25 percentage point, but said it did not appear that any more 
increases were needed to restrain the economy and inflation in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St.  
Louis, said the purchasing managers' report signaled that ``there's 
still a very healthy economy ... without any real problems in the 
pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said he did not expect the Fed's decision raising  
interest rates would have a significant impact on manufacturing. 
``The biggest problem for manufacturing isn't interest rates but 
the value of the dollar,'' he said, noting that a strong dollar 
hurts manufacturers' ability to export. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM said its price index reached 53.5 percent in June,  
rising above the 50 percent mark for the second consecutive month 
and indicating that the cost of raw materials continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The price index had risen to 52.2 percent in May, marking the  
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were paying higher prices for raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of those surveyed said new orders were stronger or  
remained at May levels, and just 13 percent said they were lower. 
The index for new orders rose to 61.7 percent in June -- its highest 
level in two years -- from 58.9 percent in May. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Summers Confirmed for Treasury Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly  
confirmed Lawrence Summers to succeed Robert Rubin as treasury 
secretary, promoting the man who helped lead the Clinton 
administration's effort to combat the recent global currency 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	In a vote that highlighted the lack of controversy surrounding  
his nomination by President Clinton, senators approved Summers in a 
97-2 vote. Only Sens. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., and Bob Smith, R-N.H., 
voted against him, while Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old Summers joined Treasury in 1993 as  
undersecretary for international affairs and has served in the 
agency's No. 2 job since 1995, when Rubin became secretary. Rubin 
announced his resignation on May 12, and Clinton immediately named 
Summers to be his successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers will assume the top job Friday following a swearing-in  
ceremony, Treasury Department spokeswoman Michelle Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a millionaire Wall Street investment banker before  
joining the administration, has not said what he will do next. He 
led the Treasury Department during a time of historic levels of 
economic growth, debt reduction, job growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Wednesday that Summers had a close working  
relationship with Clinton and that the handling of economic matters 
would be in good hands with Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is extraordinarily bright, extraordinarily insightful about  
the economy,'' Rubin told NBC News. ``It is very interesting to 
watch him talk with the president because when he starts to say 
something, the president just hones in on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate PBS interview, Rubin stressed that Summers had  
also developed a close working relationship with Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. Rubin said he and Summers had met weekly 
for the past several years with Greenspan over breakfast or lunch 
and exchanged views on a wide range of economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That relationship has been enormously useful when we have had  
to deal with crises and with serious issues,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin called ``totally untrue'' the suggestion in the PBS  
interview that he had considered resigning from the administration 
because of his unhappiness with Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president made terrible mistakes. He acknowledged he made  
terrible mistakes,'' Rubin said. But he said he still had ``a great 
deal of respect'' for the way Clinton kept focused on issues such 
as the Asian financial crisis and other duties during the 
impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has said he sees no need to change any of Rubin's  
policies on issues facing Treasury, including Social Security and 
Medicare reform, the health of the U.S. steel industry, Japan's 
worrisome economy and the dismal U.S. savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers is a native of New Haven, Conn., and was a Harvard  
economics professor and the World Bank's chief economist before 
joining Treasury. He was also a domestic policy economist on 
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors from 1982 to 1983.

<HEADLINE> Cubans' Arrival Generates Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Angry protests transformed into a celebration as  
six Cuban refugees were released from a detention center a day 
after they attempted to swim past circling Coast Guard boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The men clasped hands in victory Wednesday night as they emerged  
from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows that in this country there is democracy and that  
justice still prevails,'' said Raul Sosa, 36, a tow truck company 
owner who had waited hours in the rain outside the center. 
</P>
<P>
	The swim on Tuesday set off violent demonstrations and prompted  
the Coast Guard to investigate its own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Television reports showed the Coast Guard blasting the refugees  
with a hose as they stood in their 14-foot rowboat about 150 yards 
from shore. The agency then swarmed after the group jumped 
overboard and swam towards shore. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the swimmers was doused with pepper spray. Two reached  
the beach and four were plucked from the water and detained aboard 
a Coast Guard cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, up to 3,000 people gathered at the Coast Guard's  
Miami Beach station, blocking the main access road between trendy 
South Beach and downtown Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators held signs saying ``U.S. Coast Guard: Pigs like  
Castro'' and waved Cuban flags as they sang the Cuban national 
anthem. In Hialeah, the police chief needed stitches after he was 
hit in the head with a rock and the mayor was shown on camera 
grabbing a man and punching him several times. 
</P>
<P>
	Under existing policy, foreigners who reach U.S. shores are  
allowed to seek asylum, while those intercepted at sea are 
generally kept out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The men say they set out from Cuba unaided last Thursday, using  
paddles and a sail to propel their small wooden skiff. The U.S. 
Border Patrol is investigating and the Coast Guard has promised an 
internal probe of its actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The men will be allowed to stay with family members while  
awaiting a ruling on their asylum application. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has picked up 826 Cubans so far this year,  
compared with 1,047 in 1998. That was the first year to break 1,000 
since the exodus of more than 37,000 Cubans in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Timothy Leary Cooperated With FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Counterculture guru Timothy Leary cooperated  
with FBI agents investigating a radical leftist group in 1974 and 
informed on group members who just four years before had helped him 
escape from prison, newly released FBI records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught, incarcerated again and facing up to 25 years in jail,  
Leary told an FBI agent he wanted to see ``if I can work out a 
collaborative and ... an honorable relationship'' with 
``intelligence and law enforcement people that are ready to forget 
the past,'' according to a transcript of FBI interviews with Leary 
in May 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get out of prison as quickly as I can,'' Leary said  
in a meeting with an FBI agent, a Drug Enforcement Administration 
agent and two California state law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	His information identified his collaborators in a 1970 prison  
escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen pages of Leary's FBI file, including interview  
transcripts and FBI reports, were published on the Internet this 
week by The Smoking Gun, an online site that publishes documents 
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI confirmed 
their authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the FBI released 585 pages, said Bill Bastone, editor of  
the Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	Leary, who died of cancer in 1996, described for the FBI how  
members of the leftist Weather Underground helped him escape from a 
California prison in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	In one passage, an agent said, ``You've mentioned numerous  
Weathermen so far, is it correct to assume that each one of them 
knew ...they were aiding in your escape?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no question about it,'' Leary responded.  
</P>
<P>
	The identities of those Leary named were blacked out.  
</P>
<P>
	Leary wrote in his 1983 autobiography that the FBI wanted him  
inform on the Weather Underground but that he did not ``want to be 
called a snitch.'' He wrote that he told the FBI ``the story of my 
hair-breath escape,'' but he gave no details in the book of what he 
told the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that Leary was cooperating with the FBI circulated in  
1974, and left-wing leaders said the ``high priest of LSD'' was 
simply lying to federal agents to get out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Gitlin, a New York University professor and author of a  
book about the 1960s, said the disclosure that Leary cooperated and 
provided names was ``surprising but not shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not a man of political principles,'' said Gitlin.  
``He'd do anything to get out of jail -- he'd escape with the 
Weathermen or inform on them, whatever it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former Harvard lecturer who was kicked out of the university  
after he conducted experiments with psychedelic drugs, Leary became 
the foremost prophet and proselytizer of LSD during the turbulent 
1960s. The drug inspired Leary's most famous line: ``Turn on, tune 
in, drop out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His advocacy of drug use brought numerous run-ins with the law.  
In 1970 he was serving a 10-year sentence for marijuana possession 
when a band from the Weather Underground helped him in a daring 
escape from a jail in San Luis Obispo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Leary fled the country and bounced from country to country. U.S.  
agents eventually caught up with him in Afghanistan. He was sent 
back to prison in California in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	In May of the following year he met with FBI agents for a series  
of interviews, the documents show. The bureau was conducting an 
investigation into passport fraud and crimes in connection with 
Leary's jail break and flight from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Leary told the FBI that the group helped get him false IDs and  
helped plan his escape out of the country. He identified some of 
his collaborators through photographs and was even taken from jail 
and driven to places to identify safehouses where he was hidden 
after his escape. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI document shows that the agents believed the Leary  
interviews ``provide the basis for some federal action against 
culpable principals and conspirators in this and other matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing Leary told the FBI resulted in any criminal charges,  
said Douglas Rushkoff, Leary's literary agent and a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushkoff said too much was being made of the FBI files. He said  
they simply confirm what Leary had said in his writings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to be a productive member of society and not stuck  
in jail,'' said Rushkoff. ``It's just so funny that this stuff is 
being used to discredit him.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A maverick opposition governor could upset  
Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in the 2000 
presidential election, a new poll showed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vicente Fox of the pro-business National Action Party would be  
in a near tie with the top two contenders from the ruling party, 
known as the PRI, if the vote were held today, the Indemerc Louis 
Harris poll said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the PRI nominated Tabasco state Gov. Roberto Madrazo, he  
would narrowly beat Fox 37 percent to 33 percent. Former Interior 
Minister Francisco Labastida, widely believed to be President 
Ernesto Zedillo's favorite, would be in a statistical tie against 
Fox, 36 percent to 34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Indemerc Louis Harris, a Mexican firm associated with New  
York-based Louis Harris, questioned 4,500 people between ages 18 
and 64 in cities and towns across the country in June. The margin 
of error was 2.5 percentage points.

	Jose Omar Olaya, 24, allegedly sent numerous e-mails on May 27

	``This is a historic moment for Brazil and Bolivia and for the  
integration of other Latin American countries,'' Banzer said at a 
ceremony in Rio Grande, where the pipeline begins.

	The pipeline took a little more than a year to build.

<P>
	Banzer said Thursday that the pipeline will have an important

through Corumba, Brazil, to the cities of Sao Paulo, Curitiba and

<HEADLINE> Broughton Dairy Plant To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Broughton Foods Co.'s new parent  
company plans to close its Charleston dairy plant later this year, 
idling about 120 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Marietta, Ohio-based Broughton was acquired last week by Suiza  
Foods Corp. of Dallas, one of the nation's largest dairy 
manufacturers. Among Suiza's other holdings is Morningstar Foods 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Products made at the Charleston plant, including sour cream,  
dips, dressings and coffee creamer, will be made at Morningstar 
plants in Wisconsin, Maryland and Texas, said Dan LaValley, senior 
vice president of Morningstar Foods. 
</P>
<P>
	LaValley said Wednesday the plant will close in three to four  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charleston plant dates to 1930, when it was run by Blossom  
Dairy. Broughton bought the plant in 1965 and converted it to its 
present use as a high-temperature processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a reflection of the employees. It's a reflection  
of the facilities, which are outdated and obsolete,'' said plant 
manager Ron Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearby Broughton distribution center is unaffected by the  
move, company officials said.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jane Beadon, one of the leading witnesses in the  
sensational divorce case of the 11th Duke of Argyll, died 
Wednesday. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Beadon was Jane Wigham in 1963 when she gave evidence  
against her stepdaughter Margaret, the Duchess of Argyll. 
</P>
<P>
	The divorce of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, chief  
of the Clan Campbell and Hereditary Master of the Royal Household 
in Scotland, and his wife made headlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The case became notorious because of the mysterious ``headless  
man'' photographs. The pictures showed the duchess, wearing only 
three strands of pearls, taking part in a sex act with a naked man, 
whose head had been cut off by the camera. He has never been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke sought a divorce on grounds of adultery and Jane Wigham  
testified on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	The duke was granted a divorce. The duchess, who the judge  
called promiscuous and ``wholly immoral'' in his ruling, died in 
1993 at age 80.

	DENVER (AP) -- William M.B. Berger, the white-bearded founder of  
the Berger Funds, died Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger came from a long line of bankers. His grandfather founded  
the Colorado National Bank in 1862. At age 26, Berger began 
managing a $100 million stock portfolio for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, Berger discovered the Centennial Fund, the first  
tax-free exchange fund. It allowed investors to trade their shares 
of stock for shares of the fund without incurring a tax liability. 
The Internal Revenue Service later changed its rules to stop the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he merged his Centennial Management Co. with Founders  
before starting the funds that bear his name eight years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his own commercials, Berger made appearances on  
Wall Street Week and on several of CNBC's financial talk shows.

	EPPING, N.D. (AP)-- Cindy Duehring, who won international honors  
for environmental research while being confined to her North Dakota 
home, died Tuesday. She was 36. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring died in her home where she lived in isolation  
because of an extreme sensitivity to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her organ system just broke down,'' said her husband, Jim, who  
was forced to live in a nearby cabin because the smells that clung 
to him after a day at work made his wife sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring was among five people honored in Sweden in 1997  
with the Right Livelihood Awards, known as the ``alternative 
Nobels.'' Her husband flew to Sweden to accept her award. 
</P>
<P>
	She founded the Environmental Access Research Network, a group  
to help people suffering from chemical sensitivity, and answered 
hundreds of research requests per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Duehring traced her illness to the mid-1980s when an  
exterminator sprayed her Seattle apartment for fleas. Tests by a 
specialist in environmental medicine found pesticides had damaged 
her immune system.

Auschwitz for selling commodities on the Polish black market, died 
Monday. He was 83.

<P>
	In 1942, Gach and a group of friends were discovered by the  
Nazis and arrested and taken to the concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Gach suffered severe injuries to both legs, but instead of being  
killed, he was let go. Of thousands of Americans imprisoned by the 
Nazis, Gach was among the approximately 200 who made it out alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in Poland until 1959. He and his family settled in  
Chicago, where Gach worked at Marshall Field &AMP; Co. before retiring 
in 1978. He and his wife, Helen, moved to Elkhart in 1994.

</P>
<P>
	Howe was a 32-year-old chemistry professor at Brown University  
when he was recruited to study nuclear energy under physicist and 
Nobel Prize laureate Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago.	   Using the code name ``Metallurgical Laboratory,'' the team 
sought to create the world's first self-sustaining nuclear chain 
reaction. On Dec. 2, 1942, the Manhattan Project succeeded. By 
1944, large plutonium-producing reactors were operating in Hanford, 
Wash. Howe moved there to act as the Metallurgical Laboratory's

	Drafted in 1965 out of California State-Los Angeles, the  
6-foot-5, 265-pound tackle, once played in 167 consecutive games. 
He retired after the 1976 season.

	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Vice President Joshua Nkomo, the father  
of Zimbabwe's fight for independence from white colonial rule, died 
early today, the government said. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	State radio interrupted morning programs to play the national  
anthem and liberation songs, and broadcast a tribute by President 
Robert Mugabe. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkomo suffered from prostate cancer, and poor health forced him  
to largely withdraw from political life last year. Mugabe said 
Nkomo's health deteriorated sharply on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkomo was regarded by many as the guiding light of the nation's  
black nationalist movement, which fought a guerrilla war against 
white colonial rule for nearly three decades in the former British 
colony of Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the traditional leader of the minority Ndebele tribe failed  
to achieve his goal of becoming the first black leader when 
Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old lion,'' as supporters fondly called him, wept when  
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party swept to victory in 
the first democratic elections.

<HEADLINE> Monsanto To Sell Sweetener Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co., seeking to reduce debt and focus  
strictly on life science products, is getting out of the artificial 
sweetener business. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for a buyer or buyers of the company's tabletop  
sweeteners, which include the best-selling NutraSweet brand, begins 
immediately and will be completed as quickly as possible, Monsanto 
spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the St. Louis-based pharmaceutical and  
agricultural products company also announced plans Thursday to sell 
off the biogum division. Earlier this year, Monsanto said it would 
sell its algins food ingredients business. Biogums and algins are 
used mainly to improve the texture and processing of foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the artificial sweetener, algins and biogum businesses  
had sales of $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the divestitures will be used to reduce the  
company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto discovered aspartame, used to make NutraSweet, which is  
200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar and has just a trace of 
calories. Nutrasweet hit the market in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of the artificial sweeteners business had been expected  
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``NutraSweet is very profitable, but the bulk of its growth is  
behind it,'' said analyst William Fiala of Edward Jones in St. 
Louis. ``It was really driven by the rapid growth of the diet soda 
market, and that has really started to taper off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said Monsanto does not release specific sales figures for  
NutraSweet, but noted that it remains the world's best-selling 
artificial sweetener. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an outstanding product,'' she said. ``It's just a  
shift in focus for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Monsanto said it planned to sell all divisions that  
aren't directly related to the company's agricultural or 
pharmaceutical business, which together are called the life 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Monsanto's best sellers is its arthritis drug Celebrex.  
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto also announced several organizational changes Thursday.  
Hendrik A. Verfaillie, 53, was named chief operating officer and 
will continue as Monsanto president.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 4, Nigeria 3, OT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Sissi scored the first sudden-death  
overtime goal in Women's World Cup history, a 22-yard free kick in 
the 104th minute to give Brazil a 4-3 victory over Nigeria in 
Thursday night's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	After blowing a 3-0 halftime lead, Brazil advanced to meet the  
United States in the semifinals when Sissi's blast found the upper 
right corner of the net for her tournament-high seventh goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory put the Brazilians into a Fourth of July semifinal  
against the United States at Palo Alto, Calif --the same date and 
same venue as the Brazil-United States second-round match at the 
men's World Cup five years ago. The United States advanced with a 
hard-fought 3-2 victory over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the prohibitive favorite, won that match 1-0 and went on  
to capture the Cup. When the women meet, the United States will be 
the favorite -- but not overwhelmingly so -- because of a Brazilian 
team with plenty of flair and a midfielder with a powerful free 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi was involved in every Brazil goal, getting two assists and  
helping set up another score in addition to her ``Golden Goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cidinha scored twice and Nene once, all in the first half, for  
Brazil before Nigeria rallied with goals from Prisca Emeafu, Nkiru 
Okosieme and Nkechi Egbe against a suddenly flat Brazilian defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 54,642 at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, Sissi set up the first  
score in the fourth minute with a free kick from the right of the 
penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Ann Chiejine headed the kick straight to Brazil's  
Raquel. Raquel's first shot was blocked by a defender, but her 
second was deflected by teammate Cidinha into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Cidinha got her second goal in the 22nd minute when she headed  
Sissi's chipped cross at the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi got another assist in the 35th, making the final pass  
before Nene's 40-yard chip shot from the right of the box. Chiejine 
jumped too soon, allowing the ball to float over her head at the 
far post. Four minutes later, she was replaced in goal by Judith 
Chime. 
</P>
<P>
	Emeafu put Nigeria on the board in the 63rd with a short solo  
run after a defensive blunder, and Okosieme put in her own rebound 
after a cross from Patience Avre in the 72nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria tied the game on Egbe's 14-yard strike inside the far  
post in the 85th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria played the final minutes with 10 players after Avre was  
ejected in the 87th when she received a second yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
	As a consolation, Nigeria qualified for the 2000 Olympics with  
its second-half rally. A 3-0 defeat would have eliminated the 
Nigerians, but a one-goal loss makes Russia the lone World Cup 
quarterfinalist not to earn a place in Sydney.

<HEADLINE>  Queen Opens Scottish Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- In a colorful ceremony melding  
populism with ancient tradition, Queen Elizabeth II today opened 
Scotland's first Parliament in nearly 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``My prayers are with you all as you embark on this new and  
historic journey,'' the queen declared, inaugurating the 129-member 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have trust in the good judgment of the Scottish people ... I  
am confident in the future of Scotland,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-political monarch made no direct reference to the hopes  
of independence-seeking nationalists that the new body will lead to 
the breakup of her kingdom, which unites Scotland with England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party, the largest group in  
the assembly, hopes the restoration of the Parliament will preserve 
the United Kingdom -- but in a new form, with power decentralized 
from the government in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to speak at the Edinburgh opening, Blair canceled to remain  
in Northern Ireland, where he struggled to persuade Protestants and 
Catholics to set aside their differences and form the local 
government envisioned in last year's peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen opened Wales' new assembly last month.  
</P>
<P>
	In Edinburgh, the monarch rode to the Parliament building in an  
open, horsedrawn carriage, escorted by members of the Household 
Cavalry from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, her Scottish residence. 
She was accompanied in the carriage by her husband, Prince Philip, 
and heir, Prince Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	In an informal note, lawmakers strolled to the ceremony in  
brilliant sunshine, wading through crowds that included 
schoolchildren carrying banners from across Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	They all -- monarch and subjects -- followed the same steep,  
cobbled Royal Mile that lawmakers walked or rode when Scotland's 
Parliament last met three centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen did not wear the crown or glittering robes in which  
she opens Parliament in London. Instead, she sported a purple coat 
and hat over a green dress, topped with a stole incorporating a 
design based on the Scottish emblem of the thistle. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ceremony, the key song was the 18th-century poet  
Robert Burns' ``A Man's a Man For A'That,'' instead of the ``God 
Save The Queen,'' the British anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've waited 300 years for this -- I feel so proud,'' said  
Deborah Gillespie, 26, as she watched the Duke of Hamilton, head of 
Scotland's top aristocratic family, bring the Crown of Scotland to 
the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Parachutists floated down and a 21-gun salute boomed over the  
city, decked out with Union Jacks,the British flag, and Scotland's 
blue and white flag of St. Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood legend Sean Connery, an ardent Scottish nationalist,  
arrived in full Highland dress, after declaring the event was 
better than winning an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Power devolved formally to the Parliament on Thursday, enabling  
it to raise taxes and legislate on a range of domestic functions, 
including education, health, legal affairs and local government. 
</P>
<P>
	England and Scotland have shared a monarch since 1603, a century  
before their 1707 union under a single Parliament in London.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Gonzalez To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs right-hander Jeremi Gonzalez will  
have surgery in Los Angeles on Friday, his second elbow operation 
in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lewis Yocum repaired a ligament in the elbow and transposed  
the ulnar nerve last August. He will operate again. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 24, was 0-1 with a 2.52 ERA in eight rehabilitation  
starts this year at Single-A Daytona, Double-A West Tennessee and 
Triple-A Iowa. An MRI last month showed abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez was 7-7 with a 5.32 ERA in 20 starts for the Cubs last

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mostly Higher; Dow Up 39.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, with blue chips  
inching back to record levels, as investors got their bearings in 
the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
39.58 at 11,010.38 after searching for a direction in morning 
trading. Since hitting a new closing high of 11,107.19 on May 13, 
the Dow has struggled to revisit the 11,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also reversed early losses. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.77 to 1,375.43, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 17.79 to 2,703.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices briefly faltered in tandem with bond prices, which  
dropped after the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported the manufacturing sector expanded at a 
stronger-than-expected pace in June. The report suggested the 
threats of inflation that first prompted the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates Wednesday may not have evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets rallied after the Fed followed  
through on expectations and raised rates one-quarter percentage 
point. But bonds sank today, pushing the yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond to 6.06 percent, up from 5.96 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday, stocks were shrugging off the bond market's concerns.  
``A little hiccup in bond land is not likely to end the mania on 
Wall Street,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors sent the Dow up 155.45 points and the S&AMP;P 500  
and the Nasdaq to new closing highs Wednesday after the Fed's 
announcement. More than the rate increase, which was widely 
expected and frequently telegraphed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
investors applauded the Fed's policy shift to a ``neutral'' bias on 
the need for future rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet coffee company Starbucks tumbled after surprising Wall  
Street with a forecast of lower than expected earnings for the next 
two quarters and for the year. Starbucks shares fell 12 3/8 to 25 
3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were mostly higher, led by Eli Lilly, which gained 2  
1/16 to 73 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 382.94 million shares, ahead 
of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.89 at 649.02, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.92 at 794.01.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Disney Discuss Theme Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong and Walt Disney Co. officials said  
Thursday they will need four more months of discussions to resolve 
economic issues before reaching a deal on a Disney theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about dating any more -- we're talking about  
money,'' Stephen Ip, Hong Kong's secretary of economic services, 
told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials declined to go into details of their  
negotiations with the entertainment giant, citing a confidentiality 
clause. Disney had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ip and Hong Kong tourism commissioner Mike Rowse said they  
were confident enough about success that the government will seek 
to rezone part of outlying Lantau Island as a tourism area with 
space for ``a major international theme park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz over Disney has been the talk of the town for months,  
boosting sentiment on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and offering 
hopes that the project could help lift the territory out of 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	A Disney park would provide jobs -- both as it is built and after  
it is open -- and bring in more tourists, although some economists 
say the impact on Hong Kong's economy would not be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowse disputed suggestions that a deal with Disney has been  
delayed, even though Hong Kong officials had originally sought to 
wrap up talks by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Hong Kong media reports say Disney was demanding various  
concessions including free land, free reclamation and low-interest 
loans on the project that would cost the territory an estimated 
$640 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowse said that when Hong Kong's finance secretary, Donald  
Tsang, had formally announced the negotiations with Disney in 
March, he had indicated that the original deadline of Wednesday was 
the date to either reach a deal, give up or seek an extension of 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have gotten as far as discussing such vital but  
mundane details as road layout, rail links and land reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contract documentation for projects like this is enormously  
complicated,'' Rowse told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong officials would not say how much money they have spent  
courting the Burbank, Calif.-based Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	If Disney were to locate in Hong Kong, it would be the company's  
second theme park in Asia after Tokyo Disneyland. Officials in 
Shanghai have also said they would like to have a Disney park.

<HEADLINE> Gore Adds Staff for Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore, shuffling his campaign staff to brace  
for stiff competition in the Democratic presidential primaries, is 
adding several new faces to his inner circle, including respected 
consultant Carter Eskew and another pollster. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not termed a shakeup, advisers said the changes are part  
of a major reorganization that will diminish the roles of some 
aides and create the potential for personality conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are defining roles and responsibilities and we're adding  
strong members to the team when appropriate,'' campaign chairman 
Tony Coelho said in a telephone interview when told that Democratic 
officials were privately leaking word of the hirings. 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed the addition of Eskew, pollster Celinda Lake and  
policy coordinator Lauren Choi, saying several more new advisers 
will be hired soon. Denying reports he plans to clean house, Coelho 
said, ``There will be no dismissals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lake's hiring gives beefs up Gore's polling operation, run by  
Mark Penn. The survey shop includes pollsters Paul Maslin and Mark 
Mellman. ``I expect we'll use a range of talent in the polling 
area,'' Penn said in a separate interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Eskew adds an awkward personal dynamic to Gore's  
inner circle. He and the vice president's current top strategist, 
Bob Squier, are former partners who had a bitter falling out. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that their relationship has mended, and it  
was unclear how Squier would accept the changes, officials familiar 
with the hirings said. Coelho said the ill will between Squier and 
Eskew shouldn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that I'm interested in is that they both share  
with me one common desire and that is to get Al Gore elected,'' the 
former California lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	As word of the reorganization spread throughout the Gore  
campaign, aides became fearful that they would lose their jobs or 
chunks of their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Though nobody will be fired, some staff members face significant  
changes in their duties. ``Every presidential campaign puts 
together a media team and we're in the process of building one 
now,'' Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials compared Coelho's plans to efforts by former  
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta to reshape President 
Clinton's staff after a shaky start to his first term. Heads didn't 
roll, but Panetta retooled many job descriptions and drew clear 
lines of authority in the West Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew's hiring is a big piece of the changes in Gore's campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Squier, who has been Gore's primary media strategist, is  
expected now to focus now on his specialty -- political advertising. 
Eskew will try to refine Gore's message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob is a key strategist, adviser and friend of Al Gore's. He's  
been that for years and he will remain that,'' Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew, in his mid-40s, is a longtime confidant of Gore and  
worked on Clinton's 1992 campaign. He is a partner in the issues 
advocacy firm of Bozell Eskew. His clients include pharmaceutical 
manufacturers, a life insurance foundation and Empire Blue 
Cross/Blue Shield, New York state's largest health care company. 
</P>
<P>
	He also produced a multimillion dollar advertising campaign for  
the tobacco industry that is credited with helping kill the 
Senate's tobacco bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier was quoted by The Washington Post as saying, ``He  
certainly would not have been allowed to represent a client like 
this inside our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho said he's prepared to settle any strategy disputes  
between the pair. ``Ultimately these media decisions will end up in 
the lap of the general chairman and I'll have to make decisions,'' 
Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gore is not worried about establishing warring factions  
within the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this says about Al Gore is he's not afraid to go outside  
the box and bring in people with different views,'' the adviser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move also suggests that Coelho, little more than a month  
into his tenure, is moving quickly to get the campaign on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds a wide lead over Bill Bradley in polls of Democratic  
voters, but the former New Jersey senator has raised a surprising 
amount of money to ensure that he can challenge Gore throughout the 
primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican front-runner George W. Bush is casting a long shadow,  
raising twice as much money as Gore and beating him in head-to-head 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew and Squier did not return telephone calls.  
</P>
<P>
	Lake often teams with a GOP pollster to produce bipartisan  
surveys that are well-regarded by operatives in both parties. Choi, 
who worked for the 1996 Clinton campaign, is moving from a senior 
post at the Treasury Department.

<HEADLINE> 'South Park' Tests Ratings Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It was going well for awhile for Elizabeth  
Chacon and Gregory Contreras. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a parent or guardian, the 16-year-olds bought tickets,  
no questions asked, for an afternoon showing of the new, R-rated 
``South Park'' movie. Then reality hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we tried to get in, they said we couldn't. So they gave  
us our money back,'' said Chacon, standing outside the Galaxy 
Theater in Hollywood. ``We didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life imitated art as the new movie opened Wednesday: Theaters  
had to turn away children trying to sneak into a vulgar movie about 
children who sneak into a vulgar movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut'' may prove the biggest  
test yet to theater owners' recent agreement with President Clinton 
to strictly enforce the R rating, which bars anyone under 17 
without an adult. The recent agreement was in reaction to the 
Littleton, Colo., school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 16-year-old turned away from the Galaxy vowed to try and  
see the film somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the big deal is,'' grumbled Jose Tamayo.  
</P>
<P>
	The movie -- which has received glowing reviews -- is more about  
dirty words than dirty deeds. It thereby thumbs its nose at a movie 
rating system that prohibits kids from seeing foul-mouthed, cartoon 
8-year-olds but lets them view scenes of death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Filled with raunchy dialogue about sex, jokes about bodily  
functions and profanity that would make a sailor blush, ``South 
Park'' -- based on the controversial TV series on cable's Comedy 
Central -- had to go through several edits before it could get down 
from an NC-17 to an R rating. (An NC-17 rating means no one younger 
than 17 allowed, not even with an adult.) 
</P>
<P>
	``The ratings board only cared about the dirty words. They're so  
confused and arbitrary,'' Trey Parker, who with partner Matt Stone 
created ``South Park,'' told The New York Times. ``They don't blink 
twice because of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker and Stone clashed with the ratings board last year when  
their pornography industry farce ``Orgazmo'' was rated NC-17, even 
though it had no explicit sex scenes and only fleeting nudity. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo contends the only reason they received an R rating for  
``South Park'' was because it was backed by a major studio -- 
Paramount -- which also is a member of the industry group that 
handles the ratings, the Motion Picture Association of America. 
(``Orgazmo'' was an independent production.) 
</P>
<P>
	It's a claim Paramount dismisses.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that the MPAA treats a studio different from  
anybody else,'' said Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the 
Paramount Motion Picture Group. ``You go through the exact same 
process, with the exact same people, sitting in judgment of what 
they think is right or wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Valenti, president of the MPAA, didn't return messages  
seeking comment. In the past, he has strongly defended the 
integrity of the ratings process, while acknowledging that 
decisions are subjective. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the ``South Park'' filmmakers agreed parents should  
probably be with their kids at the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Fox, a spokesman for Comedy Central, which has aired  
``South Park'' since 1997, said the program -- shown at 10 p.m. 
Wednesdays -- is positioned for adults, but draws about 20 percent 
of it's audience from the under-18 crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	And so it was, at the Wynnsong 10 theater in Little Rock, Ark.,  
that 46-year-old Gary Bradberry accompanied his 12-year-old son to 
``South Park.'' The elder Bradberry explained that he and his son 
both watch the TV show and discuss troubling scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like it,'' the father said. ``It's a change from all other  
shows on TV.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Strikes Down Part of Megan's Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has invalidated  
key provisions of Megan's Law, including the requirement that 
residents be told when sexual predators move into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled Wednesday that the law improperly presumes  
certain people are guilty by classifying them as ``sexually violent 
predators'' for life. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania had a two-tiered system under its version of  
Megan's Law, named for a New Jersey girl who was raped and killed 
by a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sexually violent predators'' -- those guilty of the most  
serious offenses, including kidnapping or raping a minor, forcing a 
child into prostitution, or raping an adult -- had to alert 
authorities of their whereabouts until death. Police kept 
communities notified of their location. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the court's ruling, they will have to check in with  
authorities for 10 years and notify police if they move, provisions 
required of the less serious ``sexual offender'' class. Police are 
not required to notify communities of the presence of ``sexual 
offenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen Zappala said he found the law's presumption that  
a person is a sexually violent predator and the requirement that 
the offender rebut the presumption to be ``constitutionally 
repugnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The attorney general, who helped write the law when he was in  
the Legislature, is disappointed that the court has diluted it,'' 
said Sean Connolly, spokesman for state Attorney General Mike 
Fisher. ``We believe there is a need for appropriate safeguards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ronald Castille said the law  
``is a mere sentencing scheme and does not create a separate 
criminal offense'' that would violate the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 states have some version of Megan's Law, said Ronald  
Chen, associate law dean at Rutgers University. He said New 
Jersey's law, the first in the nation, has been revised to meet 
constitutional tests and the burden of proof is on prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> Bush Shatters Fund-Raising Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush's record $36 million  
fund-raising haul likely will enable him to forgo federal funds for 
his primary campaign, a historic step that could give opponents a 
campaign issue even as it magnifies Bush's own financial advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	By refusing to accept the money, Bush would not be bound by the  
spending limits that candidates agree to in exchange for the 
federal funds. This would enable him to spend as much money as he 
could raise in the early caucus and primary states, allowing him to 
try to keep pace with millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who is 
not taking the matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he would be handing both Republican and  
Democratic opponents a campaign issue to use against him. Two 
presidential candidates, Sen. John McCain, a Republican, and former 
Sen. Bill Bradley, a Democrat, have touted their support for 
overhauling campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Bush, he has to do a cost-benefit analysis: Will the  
political cost of being criticized be outweighed by the huge 
advantage he has being able to raise and spend unlimited amounts of 
money?'' said Paul Hendrie of the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
Washington-based research group that studies campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides an overall spending limit, candidates who receive  
federal funds can spend only a certain amount in each state. The 
limit in 2000 is projected to be $1.1 million each in Iowa and 
$669,160 in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, on the other hand, can spend millions. Without the  
federal funds, Bush has the money to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's facing another guy who's not going to take federal  
matching funds,'' Republican consultant Jack Cookfair said. ``Steve 
Forbes is going to make an early push. If W. can come through those 
early primaries, he's going to lock this thing up quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's total for the first six months of the campaign through  
Wednesday was nearly 10 times as much as his closest Republican 
rival and twice as much as Vice President Al Gore. And the 
six-month total could go even higher. Two huge boxes of mail -- some 
containing checks -- arrived Wednesday at Bush's campaign 
headquarters in Austin, Texas, said Karen Hughes, a campaign 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those boxes are in our possession before the deadline and  
they count,'' Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bush becomes only the third major party candidate after  
Forbes and former Texas Gov. John Connally to refuse to limit 
spending in exchange for federal matching funds, he could open 
himself up to criticism for rejecting one of the major 
Watergate-era campaign finance reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's pledge to spend his presidential campaign talking about  
overhauling the campaign finance laws gives him an opening to 
attack Bush on the issue, said Herbert Alexander, professor 
emeritus of political science at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps explain why McCain says he's going to use campaign  
finance as his main theme,'' Alexander said. ``He will probably 
criticize Bush. He will say Bush could do with much less and 
doesn't have to obligate himself to all these people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Gore, signaling a potential line of attack against Bush,  
said he has never considered forgoing the matching money. ``I 
support the system of campaign finance reform and I think our 
reforms should go further,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, pollster John Zogby said campaign finance isn't the kind  
of issue that will decide an election. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a general kind of skepticism that says if A is a  
person who has lots of money and B is a candidate or political 
party, then A is going to find B and B is going to find A no matter 
what laws are on the books,'' Zogby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially among GOP primary voters, Bush is likely to be  
praised rather than criticized for refusing to take federal funds, 
Cookfair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People on the whole do not want public financing of  
elections,'' Cookfair said. ``Republicans especially feel that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their part, the other GOP contenders said it didn't matter  
how much Bush raised as long as they had enough money to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political battlefield is littered with the bodies of rich  
candidates or millionaires who lost their elections,'' said Ari 
Fleischer, a spokeswoman for former American Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Dole. ``Money's important. It's not everything.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Continues Abortion Funds Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Thursday to continue barring  
federal workers' health-insurance plans from covering most 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	By 51-47, senators approved language banning the benefit and  
included it in a $27.7 billion measure financing the Treasury 
Department and several smaller agencies in the coming fiscal year. 
The overall bill was approved by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also leaves open the possibility that members of  
Congress will allow themselves a cost-of-living pay raise of about 
$4,600 next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an annual pay raise unless they  
vote to deny it. The Treasury bill is the traditional vehicle for a 
provision doing that, and so far it contains no such prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the measure, approved only by a subcommittee  
so far, also lacks language that would block the pay raise. 
Lawmakers currently earn $136,700, a level they reached two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion prohibition for federal employees would allow  
exceptions for cases of rape, incest and when the woman's life is 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, sponsored the abortion ban, saying 73  
percent of the cost of federal workers' health plans comes from 
taxpayers' dollars. He said abortions ``violate the conscience of 
many taxpayers'' and federal dollars should not be used to pay for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the 1.2 million women  
affected by the prohibition would lose coverage for a procedure 
that privately employed women have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't repeal her right to choose, take away her ability  
to pay for what is legal,'' Boxer said of her opponents' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said in a written statement the  
White House ``would strongly oppose'' the prohibition, but did not 
mention a veto threat. The ban has been included in the bill all 
but two years since 1983, DeWine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill includes $8.2 billion for the Internal Revenue  
Service, nearly $200 million less than this year. And it would cut 
President Clinton's $195 million request for an anti-drug media 
campaign by $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also moved toward approving $411 million in federal  
contributions to the District of Columbia's city budget. The 
measure bans the use of federal or district funds for most 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee approved a $14.1  
billion measure financing federal land and cultural programs, and 
an $8.45 billion bill for military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The land bill provides nearly $1.2 billion less than Clinton  
wants, cutting his requests for land and water conservation, 
purchase of property for federal and state parks, restoration of 
Florida's Everglades and energy conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved an amendment by Rep. Lucille  
Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., that would allow women to breast-feed in 
national parks or cultural institutions covered by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Handover Met by Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao unveiled a  
black, tower-like ``reunification monument'' Thursday and said Hong 
Kong has stayed prosperous and free in the two years since its 
return to China. Hundreds of protesters didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The official ceremony marking the second anniversary of Hong  
Kong's July 1, 1997, handover was dignified, although chants of 
dissent from two small groups of anti-China protesters were clearly 
audible from outside the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Hong Kong are undoubtedly capable of  
administering Hong Kong well,'' Hu told an audience of officials, 
including Hong Kong's leader, Tung Chee-hwa, as he unveiled the 
monument. ``The previous social and economic systems as well as the 
way of life in Hong Kong remain unchanged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrators outside demanded an end to China's one-party  
communist system and the release of political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	There were minor scuffles as police tried to block the  
protesters from getting too close. Police later confiscated the 
protesters' megaphones, saying they were responding to residents' 
complaints of noise. No one was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Hu took a boat trip through Victoria Harbor, only to come  
alongside more protesters who had sailed in to complain about a 
land scam in China. 
</P>
<P>
	The handover anniversary is a public holiday, but few Hong Kong  
residents were celebrating amid a recession and accusations that 
the affluent territory is fast surrendering its autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's there to celebrate? They are wasting our money on the  
celebrations,'' said Lau Kam-wah, a retiree who was out walking 
early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After 156 years of British rule, Hong Kong was reunited with  
China at the height of its financial prowess. The tiny territory, 
now China's ``special administrative region,'' has kept its 
free-market economy and British-style judiciary and civil service 
under a formula dubbed ``one country, two systems,'' which 
guarantees Hong Kong autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people agree that Beijing has largely kept to its hands-off  
pledge, but critics say Hong Kong is chipping away at its own 
independence, partly by asking for Beijing's help in a recent legal 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled in January that Hong  
Kong's mini-constitution, called the Basic Law, granted Hong Kong 
residency to any mainland Chinese with one Hong Kong parent, even 
if the parent gained residency after the child was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing an immigrant influx would overwhelm Hong Kong's  
resources, Hong Kong asked Chinese lawmakers to pass a final 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese congress ruled Saturday that Hong Kong's justices  
had erred in their ruling -- a decision that could lower the number 
of potential immigrants in the next decade from 1.6 million to 
200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 'two systems' are being blurred,'' said lawmaker Martin  
Lee, leader of the opposition Democratic Party. ``The 'one country' 
is more important than 'two systems.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government, increasingly unpopular, was the target  
of late afternoon protests, staged by hundreds of marchers claiming 
the territory was having a ``second-year handover funeral.''

<HEADLINE> General Defends Apache Aviator Memo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The commander of the 24 Apache attack  
helicopters sent to Albania defended an internal memo in which he 
suggested pilots assigned to fly against Serb forces were 
undertrained and underequipped. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Richard Cody told members of a House Armed Services  
subcommittee on Thursday that his memo was ``an honest assessment 
of strengths and weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the June 16 memo, intended for the incoming Army chief of  
staff, Cody complained that the first three weeks in Albania ``were 
painful and high risk.'' The document said that ``over 65 percent 
of assigned aviators had less than 500 hours'' of training, and not 
one was trained to use special goggles that would help with night 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Apaches flew against Serb forces. But two crewmen  
were killed when two helicopters crashed in a night training 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand by the points and recommendations I made,'' he said at  
the hearing of the military readiness subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., the subcommittee chairman, thanked  
Cody for ``your professionalism and candor in imparting information 
no one wanted to receive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody told the subcommittee his e-mail memorandum, entitled  
``Lessons Learned in Albania,'' was not intended for public 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of my memorandum ... is to make a great Army even  
better,'' he said. It was intended for the incoming Army chief of 
staff, Eric K. Shinseki. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody emphasized that, once the helicopter crews received the  
on-site training they needed, they became proficient. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the lack of training of the aviators on the general  
decline of military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Across the Army, we are seeing the results of many years of  
declining resources and resource constraints, in terms of funds for 
training and equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Oliver H. Hunter IV, commander of an Apache unit sent to  
Albania from Illieshiem, Germany, told the subcommittee one reason 
the pilots lacked adequate training was because of German 
government restrictions on night flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody said that lack of preparation was of particular concern  
because of the geography of the region. ``This is the toughest 
terrain I've seen in 27 years, and I've been flying attack 
helicopters all over the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a break for a vote, Cody told reporters that, because of  
the publicity surrounding the Apache force, he felt like a sitting 
duck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew exactly where we were. The Serbs knew where we  
were. They knew how far we could fly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Backer Acquitted in Money Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A longtime benefactor of Vice President Al  
Gore was cleared of all charges Thursday in a political money case 
involving about $100,000 in contributions to Gore, President 
Clinton and other politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin L. Haney was accused of using straw donors to mask his  
own political donations, and lying about it in filings to federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Tennessee developer admitted he gave the money,  
but argued that Haney misinterpreted a confusing set of rules on 
how to raise and record political donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply gratified with today's verdict,'' Haney said in a  
statement. ``We had faith that this day would come.'' He declined 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney dabbed his eyes as the jury foreman read the verdict --  
innocent on 42 counts. Smiling wanly, he turned to hug his sobbing 
wife, then embraced their five children in turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from the Justice Department's campaign finance task  
force did not comment after the trial. During six days of 
testimony, prosecutors argued Haney tried to dodge campaign rules 
by reimbursing friends, employees and even strangers who made 
political donations at his behest. 
</P>
<P>
	Paperwork sent to the Federal Election Commission listed the  
individuals because federal campaign finance rules limit individual 
donations to $1,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her closing argument to the jury Wednesday, prosecutor Pamela  
Huff likened the case to schoolchildren instructed not to peek at 
an upcoming assignment. If you leave your assignment face down on 
your desk but persuade the kid at the next desk to desk to flip it 
over, you are guilty of cheating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is third-grade stuff,'' Huff said.  
</P>
<P>
	The defense did not present any witnesses. Defense lawyer Ted  
Wells argued to the jury Wednesday that prosecutors did not prove 
Haney knowingly did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Haney believed that it was permissible, and in no way that  
he was violating the law,'' Wells said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells called the reimbursements gifts, and said Haney had made  
no attempt to hide the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated about six hours Wednesday and Thursday, and  
at one point told U.S. District Judge Richard Roberts they were 
``hopelessly deadlocked.'' Roberts told the jury to keep working. 
</P>
<P>
	The case centered on Haney's role as a fund-raiser for both the  
1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns and for several other 
Tennessee campaigns. Prosecutors tried to show that the 
Chattanooga, Tenn., millionaire, was a sophisticated political 
veteran who got in over his head when he pledged to raise tens of 
thousands for Clinton-Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic booster for three decades, Haney, 59, was  
accustomed to giving his own money but unprepared to find enough 
legitimate individual donors to fulfill his promise, prosecutors 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also said Haney wanted to use his entree with top  
politicians to impress potential business partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was the 14th person charged in the Justice Department  
investigation of unorthodox contributions in the 1996 presidential 
race. He pleaded innocent in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Haney was also at the center of a Justice Department  
investigation last year into whether he paid a $1 million reward to 
1996 Clinton-Gore campaign manager Peter Knight. Haney and Knight 
both have said the payment represented legal fees for Knight's work 
on several Haney projects over three years.

</P>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Dennis Brown, a former child star who  
became known as the Crown Prince of Reggae, died Thursday. He was 
42. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports suggested Brown died of complications caused by  
respiratory problems, but his cause of death had not yet been 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown rose to prominence amid a 1970s wave of reggae singers  
that included Bob Marley, who introduced reggae music to listeners 
worldwide. He released a string of hit songs beginning with ``No 
Man is an Island,'' which he recorded in 1969 at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's most fruitful period came later, when he produced  
hits including ``Westbound Train,'' ``How Could I Leave,'' and 
``Ghetto Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album Light My  
Fire.

<P>
	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Joshua Nkomo, the Vice President and the  
father of Zimbabwe's fight for independence from white colonial 
rule, died Thursday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkomo was regarded by many as the guiding light of the nation's  
black nationalist movement, which fought a guerrilla war against 
white colonial rule for nearly three decades in the former British 
colony of Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
	But the traditional leader of the minority Ndebele tribe failed  
to achieve his goal of becoming the first black leader when 
Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old lion,'' as supporters fondly called him, wept when  
President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party 
swept to victory in the first democratic elections.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Constance Shacklock, a mezzo-soprano who was one  
of the leading singers at the Royal Opera House from 1946 to 1956, 
died Tuesday. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Shacklock made her debut at the Royal Opera in 1946 in  
``The Fairy Queen'' by Henry Purcell. But she made her reputation 
as one of the outstanding performers of Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her triumphs was singing Brangaene in ``Tristan und  
Isolde'' opposite Kirsten Flagstad. She sang that role in her first 
appearance outside Britain, at the State Opera House in East Berlin 
in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	She made more than 500 appearances at Covent Garden, and for a  
decade was the featured singer at the ``Last Night of the Proms'' 
at the Royal Albert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1961 to 1966, she played Mother Superior in the London  
production of ``The Sound of Music.'' 

</P>
<P>
                           *Sylvia Sidney    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sylvia Sidney, the waiflike star of the 1930s  
who specialized in playing victims and got an Oscar nomination in 
1973 for a comeback role in ``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams,'' died 
Thursday. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sidney made her professional theater debut at 16 and was  
still acting 70 years later, with a brief appearance in the 1988 
hit ``Beetlejuice'' and a small role in ``Mars Attacks'' in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the directors she worked with were Rouben Mamoulian, in  
``City Streets,'' 1931; Josef von Sternberg, in ``An American 
Tragedy,'' 1931; Alfred Hitchcock in ``Sabotage'' (also called ``A 
Woman Alone''), 1936; William Wyler, in ``Dead End,'' 1937; and 
Fritz Lang in ``Fury,'' 1936, ``You Only Live Once,'' 1937, and 
``You and Me,'' 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	Her return to the screen was in the 1973 drama ``Summer Wishes,  
Winter Dreams,'' in which she played Joanne Woodward's doomed 
mother. She was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting 
actress. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, she won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for an  
Emmy for ``An Early Frost,'' a TV movie in which she played the 
grandmother of an AIDS patient.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lord Whitelaw, one of the most prominent  
Conservative politicians of the postwar years and a principal ally 
of former British premier Margaret Thatcher, died Thursday. He was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	William Whitelaw served as Northern Ireland secretary and leader  
of the House of Commons under former Prime Minister Edward Heath in 
the 1970s, and as home secretary and leader of the House of Lords 
during Mrs. Thatcher's governments in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Lords until 1988, and after Mrs. Thatcher's  
resignation in 1990 continued as deputy leader of the Conservative 
Party for nine more months. He stepped down in August 1991 after 16 
years in the post and 35 years' service to the party.

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A former Stanford football star was  
sentenced to two years in prison Wednesday for sex crimes involving 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Abrams, 25, pleaded no contest earlier this year to false  
imprisonment and child molestation for posing as a Nike salesman 
and luring a 14-year-old boy into his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams also faces charges in San Francisco, where he allegedly  
impersonated a police officer and ordered a 13-year-old boy to 
strip for a drug search. Prosecutors also have accused him of 
trying to order two other boys into his car on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he pleaded no contest to charges of posing as a  
Stanford recruiter and for telling high school football players 
that he needed nude photos of them to evaluate their physical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The former placekicker, who played for the Cardinal from  
1992-95, is Stanford's career scoring leader with 282 points.

<HEADLINE> Scher's Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- After spending nearly two years in prison for  
the 1976 shooting death of his friend, Dr. Stephen Scher has been 
set free by a court ruling that overturned his murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	A smiling Scher walked out of a state prison Wednesday, saying  
he felt ``wonderful'' as he climbed into the back of a gold 
Cadillac to meet his wife -- the dead man's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is obviously a very happy day for everybody,'' his  
lawyer, John Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher, 59, was serving a life sentence after being convicted in  
1997 of shooting his friend, Martin Dillon, at Dillon's hunting 
camp. Scher had claimed that Dillon was chasing a porcupine, 
tripped and shot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting originally was ruled an accident and, two years  
afterward, Scher married Dillon's widow, Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillon's father pressed prosecutors to reopen the case and  
authorities exhumed Dillon's body in 1995. They conducted an 
autopsy and decided to charge Scher, citing new evidence that 
undercut his claim that he was more than 100 feet away when 
Martin's shotgun went off. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Scher changed his story and acknowledged he  
had been having an affair with Dillon's wife. He testified the gun 
went off in a struggle that started when he told Dillon about the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher said he lied about the shooting for more than two decades  
to protect Dillon's widow, and the dead man's two children, whom 
Scher raised. 
</P>
<P>
	A state court panel ruled June 7 that the 20-year interval  
between the shooting and Scher's arrest was too long and violated 
Scher's due-process rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the conviction was tainted by memories that had  
faded, evidence that had disappeared and witnesses who had died 
between Dillon's death and Scher's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that Scher could be  
released, but required him to post a $750,000 bond to allow 
prosecutors time to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	As additional conditions of his release, Scher was required to  
surrender his passport and limit his travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Attorney General Michael Fisher intends to appeal  
Scher's release, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will argue that the conviction should be reinstated and he  
should be returned to prison to serve out his life sentence for 
first-degree murder,'' said Fisher's spokesman, Kevin Harley. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses said Scher was eager to be reunited with his family and  
will apply to get his North Carolina medical license back.

<P>
	CLARKSTON, Mich. (AP) -- Veteran musician John Mellencamp was on  
hand for a ceremony designed to help rookies start playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a Wednesday night concert, Mellencamp and officials with  
the Save the Music Foundation announced the donation of $75,000 
worth of musical instruments to three Detroit schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music  
programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about 
the importance of music education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited about it,'' said Charles Moody, the principal  
of Bethune Elementary School in Pontiac, one of the three schools. 
``We know the impact that music has on a child's development.''

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Parts Maker Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Miami aircraft parts maker and a company  
executive pleaded guilty to taking safety shortcuts on parts sold 
to military and commercial buyers, federal prosecutors said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plea agreement, Air-Pro Inc. agreed to pay a $200,000  
fine, notify its customers and offer to replace the parts. John 
Wilson, vice president and operations manager, faces up to five 
years in prison and a $250,000 fine at sentencing Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Both pleaded guilty Wednesday to making false representations on  
the sale of nonconforming aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation found Air-Pro employees changed so-called cure  
dates by as much as five years on hose tags to make them look 
newer, fooling buyers about the life expectancy of crucial fuel, 
oil and hydraulic hoses. The military rejects the rubber hose 
assemblies after six to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	In another instance, Air-Pro applied a weaker coating to chafing  
sleeves on landing gear hose assemblies when a Teflon coating was 
required. The substitute was less resistant to abrasives and failed 
at a lower temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Air-Pro also failed to properly clean and test systems supplying  
oxygen to pilots and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had contracts with the Defense Department, Air Force  
and Defense Logistics Agency and was approved by the Federal 
Aviation Administration as an aviation hose manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson had no comment when contacted Thursday; his attorney was  
out of town and not immediately available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Japan Agrees to New Telecom Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States reached a trade agreement  
Thursday with Japan aimed at making sure that U.S. and other 
foreign telecommunications companies will be treated fairly when 
they compete for sales to Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Co. and its successor companies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the United  
States had achieved all of its objectives in the four days of talks 
held in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT is being broken up into four companies. Barshefsky said the  
new deal will ensure that U.S. and other foreign companies will not 
be discriminated against in competition for sales of 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	NTT purchased more than $10 billion of telecommunications  
equipment in 1997, the latest year for which data is available; of 
that total, $1.5 billion was purchased from foreign companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. companies, world leaders in the new technologies in  
demand worldwide, are well positioned to increase their sales to 
the NTT successor companies,'' Barshefsky said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the main sticking point in the marathon  
bargaining sessions was the insistence by the American side that 
Japan's government play an active oversight role in monitoring 
whether the Japanese companies were fulfilling their obligations 
under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. trade official said the final agreement satisfied  
U.S. demands in this area, including annual meetings between the 
two countries to review purchase data.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Automakers Make Gains in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Foreign automakers continued to increase their  
U.S. market share last month as demand for many new cars and light 
trucks exceeded the robust sales of June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, meanwhile,  
were off 5 percent compared with its record sales a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we've got a little blip,'' said sales executive Jamie  
Jameson. ``We're fully expecting the numbers to whipsaw right back 
in July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. planned to report their  
June sales today. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of Japan's Big Three posted gains: Toyota Motor Corp. and  
Nissan Motor Co. were up 5 percent, while Honda Motor Co. edged up 
just over 1.5 percent. The biggest percentage improvements once 
again came from European automakers, several of which posted 
double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG reported its strongest June in 26 years and its  
best month overall since May 1979. Its sales were up 23 percent 
over a year ago, due in large part to the success of its redesigned 
Jetta compact sedan -- the nation's best-selling European car. VW 
sold 13,101 Jettas in June for its best month since the nameplate 
was introduced 19 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Audi AG had its most successful June since 1987 with a 44  
percent sales increase from a year ago. Its new TT sports car was 
off to a strong start in its second month. Saab AB, meanwhile, had 
a 34 percent sales increase last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drop in June sales for DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler,  
Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep brands, the German-American automaker said 
the unit posted a record first half with just over 1.39 million 
sales, and had its best quarter ever in April through June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the market continues to show strength, and we have a  
robust production schedule planned to match that demand,'' said 
James P. Holden, executive vice president of sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The comparison to June 1998 was tough for DaimlerChrysler. Big  
``loyalty coupon'' discounts that the three Detroit automakers 
offered to consumers that month generated unusually strong sales; 
the former Chrysler Corp. set an all-time monthly record in June 
1998, a mark that stood until last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Car sales took the hardest hit at DaimlerChrysler last month,  
down 14 percent, while truck sales were off about 1.5 percent. Much 
of the decline was due to a 19 percent drop in minivan sales, which 
Jameson blamed on low inventories after a big dealer incentive 
program in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's gain gave the automaker its strongest June and  
best-ever second quarter. Though Toyota's U.S. car sales were off 
10 percent, its truck sales soared 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most ominous for Detroit's automakers was the news that Toyota's  
new Tundra full-size pickup had the best first-month U.S. sales of 
any Toyota model ever. Toyota sold 8,011 Tundras last month, 
breaking the previous first-model record of 3,339 set by the Tercel 
subcompact in October 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, GM and Dodge have dominated the full-size pickup market  
for decades. The V8-powered Tundra, assembled in Princeton, Ind., 
is the first serious challenge by a foreign automaker in the 
full-size pickup market. 
</P>
<P>
	New models also helped boost Nissan's sales. The Xterra sport  
utility vehicle had one of the best first month's sales figures in 
the company's history, with 5,470 sold. The Nissan Crew cab pickup 
and Quest minivan also sold well, offsetting an 11 percent decline 
in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda set June and half-year records. The biggest percentage  
gain was for Honda's redesigned Odyssey minivan; its sales were up 
277 percent.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judges Getting Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a delay of many months, President  
Clinton's judicial nominees are beginning to trickle through the 
Senate confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate confirmed five judges Wednesday, and the Senate  
Judiciary Committee sent three additional appointments to the floor 
in a brief meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The action comes after a delay of many months in which Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the committee chairman, blocked action on the 
administration's appointees in an attempt to have a citizen of Utah 
appointed to the bench. Hatch's selection, gubernatorial aide Ted 
Stewart, drew opposition from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	But one Republican source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the FBI has completed its background check on Stewart, and a 
report on Stewart is due back from the American Bar Association 
shortly. Both steps are part of the customary pre-nomination 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The five appointees confirmed by the Senate Wednesday include W.  
Allen Pepper Jr. of Mississippi, a college roommate of Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott at Ole Miss. Also confirmed was Karen E. 
Schreier of South Dakota, the home state of Senate Democratic 
Leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Also approved were Keith Ellison of Texas, Stefan Underhill of  
Connecticut and Gary Feess of California. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other judges had been confirmed by the Senate since the  
beginning of the year, and they were holdovers from the last 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominees approved by the committee included Marsha L. Berzon  
of California, named to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She 
was approved on a vote of 10-8, with Hatch and Sen. Arlen Specter, 
R-Pa., siding with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two were Robert Katzmann, named to the 2nd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals; and T. John Ward, nominated to be a 
district judge for the Eastern District of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	According to statistics kept by Democrats, there are still 37  
Clinton judicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch promised Democrats there would be at least one day for  
judicial nomination hearings in July, but declined to promise a 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, GOP presidential contender and leading  
advocate of an overhaul of campaign finance laws, drew some 
unusually blunt advice from Lott during the day. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Arizona lawmaker expected to demand a debate on  
campaign finance laws next month, Lott told reporters that 
``Senator McCain should concentrate on his presidential campaign, 
on Y2K liability (legislation). ... He's got a lot of work that 
needs to be done that the country needs and it would serve him 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite finished, Lott went on:  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're out there raising money right and left and then  
you're talking about how you need to reform the system, it rings a 
little hollow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, McCain responded that he has raised  
money following the spirit of the reforms he has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to keep the majority leader's attention  
focused on this issue so that he won't make any other uninformed 
mistakes on national television,'' he said. 

</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic political strategists in both the House and Senate  
are still waiting to hear from Rep. Bernard Sanders, an independent 
lawmaker from Vermont, about his election plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who is serving his fifth term in the House, has flirted  
for months with jumping into the race against GOP Sen. Jim 
Jeffords, and Senate Democrats have made no secret of their 
interest in having him run. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Democrats who are gunning to take control of  
the House would like to see him seek re-election to his current 
job. While elected as an independent, Sanders sides with Democrats 
on organizational matters, and they, in turn, protect his committee 
seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials earlier in the year said they expected Sanders  
to make up his mind by the end of June. But that date has passed, 
and now he's promising a decision later this summer. Democrats also 
said Sanders told them he intends to commission a poll to gauge his 
standing in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats got some good news on the political front

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks gained in Thursday trading, riding  
an overnight rally on Wall Street sparked by the Federal Reserve's 
decision to nudge up interest rates. The U.S. dollar edged lower 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose a sharp 331.01  
points, or 1.89 percent, to 17,860.75 at the close of the afternoon 
session. On Wednesday, the average closed down 252.05 points, or 
1.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.82 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 0.04 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 
120.93 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo stock market started higher in a follow-through move  
from New York where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 155.45 
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,970.80 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section rose 31.21 points, or 2.20 percent, to 
1,447.41 at the end of the afternoon session. The TOPIX closed down 
9.04 points, or 0.63 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Among international and high-technology blue chips, Sony and  
Softbank hit all-time high levels. Volume on the First Section of 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 626.15 million shares, up 
from 572.11 million shares Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants now await the results of the Bank of Japan's  
quarterly ``tankan'' survey of business sentiment, due out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Further stock market rises require gains in shares linked to  
domestic demand,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo 
Securities Co. ``The tankan should confirm an improvement in 
confidence, and boost domestic-demand stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the Fed raised short-term U.S. interest rates by a  
quarter point -- an anticipated move that did not have a major 
impact on currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials applauded the hike.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the ... decision to hike rates was appropriate. It  
was made in line with the status of the U.S. economy,'' said 
Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's 
Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed did surprise markets, however, by announcing it was  
abandoning its bias toward raising rates further. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the Fed was adopting a neutral stance toward interest  
rates -- meaning it was no longer leaning toward raising them -- sent 
some investors away from the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates mean higher returns on liquid investments  
held in that currency, so the prospect that U.S. rates may not 
increase for a while made the dollar less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the greenback moved lower from its New  
York level after U.S. funds sold dollars to invest in Japanese 
stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.36 yen, up from  
125.06 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.7600 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8500 percent, driving 
its price up to 100.34 yen from 99.57 yen.

<HEADLINE> INS' Role in Deporting Suspected Murderer Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's top watchdog will  
investigate why the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained 
a Mexican national wanted for questioning in connection with 
several murders but let him go, the INS said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency's failure to  
identify Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old drifter charged in 
two murders and linked to six other slayings, ``has raised serious 
questions about the INS' knowledge of the case and procedures used 
in encounters with'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of these questions, I have referred the matter to  
the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General,'' said 
Meissner in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department spokeswoman also said today that INS  
officials in Texas were contacted by Houston police about 
Resendez-Ramirez last December after the killing of a doctor during 
a burglary at her home in the Houston area. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Carole Florman said Houston police asked the INS for  
information on Resendez-Ramirez, and that INS officials provided 
photos of him to the police during a meeting in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner's statement Wednesday said the INS' office of internal  
audits was reviewing INS procedures ``in an effort to avoid any 
similar situation in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's office investigates waste, fraud and  
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said at a news conference  
today, ``I think we're going to learn a lot from this review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS arrested Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area either  
late on June 1 or during the early morning hours of June 2 for 
being in this country illegally and deported him to Mexico later 
that day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his release, authorities believe he killed a  
73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they believe 
he killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. His 
fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the scene 
of the murder of an 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials said that when Resendez-Ramirez was in the custody  
of the Border Patrol, they didn't have any information on his 
criminal records or of any outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meissner said the INS had multiple entries on  
Resendez-Ramirez in a photo and fingerprint database that provides 
immediate identification of aliens apprehended by Border Patrol. 
The system became widely available in 1997 and 1998. Prior to that 
INS relied on a text database of names. 
</P>
<P>
	INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since that 
time has been deported from the U.S. on three occasions in 1985, 
1987 and 1991. He was also apprehended by Border Patrol agents 
eight times between January 1998 and the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department will look at why  
Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS knew about 
Resendez-Ramirez criminal activities after being contacted by local 
law enforcement earlier this year.''

<HEADLINE> Patience Can Reward in the Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Your mother may have told you that patience is a virtue and its  
own reward. And your broker may have told you to stick with Big 
Blue. If you followed both bits of advice, you're probably feeling 
pretty good about the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A sample portfolio for small investors that The Associated Press  
has tracked since October 1997 gained 14.6 percent during the 
quarter as Pacific-region stocks, decimated by the financial crisis 
that started two years ago, barreled back, and as IBM split and 
shot up nearly 46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio's gains beat the Dow Jones industrial average,  
which rose 12.1 percent during the quarter, as well as the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 index, which picked up 6.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio, made up of three mutual funds and three blue-chip  
stocks, was rewarded for holding fast to its Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter Pacific Growth Fund and resisting the urge to sell even as 
the fund limped along for much of the past 21 months. The fund rose 
22.7 percent during the second quarter, bringing its net asset 
value to $13.67, or 37 cents above its net asset value of Oct. 23, 
1997, the day the portfolio was created. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM split 2-for-1 during the quarter and continued to march  
higher, registering a 45.8 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer maker's continuing stellar performance has helped  
carry the portfolio to a very healthy 66 percent gain since its 
creation. It has easily outperformed the Dow, which has risen 
nearly 40 percent over the same period, and the S&AMP;P 500, up 44 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Another blue-chip stock in the portfolio, Wal-Mart, also split,  
but had a much smaller gain of 4.7 percent during the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio's advance was held back by the T. Rowe Price U.S.  
Treasury Long-Term Fund, which fell 3.9 percent as investors, 
feeling less of a need for the relative stability of bonds, 
invested more heavily in stocks. Coca-Cola, which squeezed out a 1 
percent gain, also was a drag on the portfolio's performance, which 
does not assume reinvestment of dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has been beset by a series of problems including the  
fallout from the Asian economic crisis and the contamination of 
some of its products in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The final component in the portfolio, the Vanguard Index Trust  
500 Portfolio fund, which tracks the S&AMP;P 500, rose 6.7 percent 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio was valued at $25,299.85 at its inception and was  
worth $41,989.87 as the second quarter ended.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Closes at 11,066.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average extended its  
stunning gains today, flirting with a new record as investors 
reveled in the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow was up 95.62 at  
11,066.42. The blue-chip index held steadily above 11,000 for the 
first time in weeks, and inched within 28 points of its May 13 
record close of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators including the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and  
Nasdaq composite index also rose, hitting record highs for a second 
consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
	Tthe Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 8.07 to 1,380.78, and the  
Nasdaq composite index rose 20.09 to 2,706.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,697 up, 1,385 down and 487 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 828.57 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.11  
billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.32 to 651.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.28 to 794.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.26 to 454.42.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm,'' said William  
Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors again applauded the long-expected decision Wednesday  
by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates 
one-quarter percentage point. The market was especially heartened 
by the Fed's policy shift to a ``neutral'' bias on the need for 
future rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan, by removing his bias to tighten, has flashed a red  
cape in front of the bull market,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the charge today were semiconductor stocks including  
Intel and financial-services stocks, which thrived on the hope that 
interest rates may remain stable for at least the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Shobin, a technical analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.,  
said the market's big gains were somewhat surprising in light of 
the Dow's 155.45 point rise Wednesday, when the S&AMP;P 500 and the 
Nasdaq hit new closing highs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a sign of great strength that this market  
continues to be able to reach new levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices faltered this morning in tandem with bonds, which  
dropped after the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported the manufacturing sector expanded at a 
stronger-than-expected pace in June. The report suggested the 
threats of inflation that first prompted the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates Wednesday may not have evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plunged following the report, pushing the yield on  
the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.02 percent, up from 5.96 late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shrugged off the bond market's concerns. ``A little  
hiccup in bond land is not likely to end the mania on Wall 
Street,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet coffee company Starbucks tumbled after surprising Wall  
Street with a forecast of lower than expected earnings for the next 
two quarters and for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were mostly higher, led by Eli Lilly. Lehman  
Brothers added the stock to its ``10 Uncommon Values'' list of 
recommended stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of smaller companies had wild price swings as the Frank  
Russell Co. shuffled the component stocks of its indexes, which 
include the widely-followed Russell 2000. The changes mean that 
portfolios modeled after the indexes have to be adjusted as well.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 66.18 at 11,036.98 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today, with blue chips  
inching back toward record levels, as investors got their bearings 
in the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 66.18 at 11,036.98 after searching for a direction in morning 
trading. Since hitting a new closing high of 11,107.19 on May 13, 
the Dow has struggled to revisit the 11,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also reversed early losses. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.09 to 1,378.75, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was up 23.42 to 2,709.54.

</P>
<P>
	The stock and bond markets both rallied Wednesday after the Fed  
followed through on expectations and raised rates one-quarter 
percentage point. But the purchasing managers' report rattled bonds 
today, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.02

was frequently telegraphed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
investors applauded the Fed's policy shift to a ``neutral'' bias on

<HEADLINE> Bad News Continues for Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola has been battered by a spate of bad  
news this past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday brought word of more woes.  
</P>
<P>
	The company extended a glass bottle recall in Poland, in the  
aftermath of a major health scare in Europe over Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the Atlanta-based company reported that its second-quarter  
finances will be hurt by the health crisis and by continued 
economic downturns in other key overseas markets that have been 
reeling for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the past year, regulatory obstacles delayed Coke's  
efforts to take over the French brand Orangina and most Cadbury 
Schweppes brands overseas, and four current or past employees, all 
black, filed a lawsuit charging the company with racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the last 18 months or so has been  
challenging,'' company spokesman Rob Baskin said. ``I don't know 
that it's been more challenging than other times in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he said, Coke in its 113-year history has been  
through the Great Depression, recessions in the United States and 
abroad, and world wars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to keep these things in perspective,'' Baskin  
said. ``It's a matter of taking the long view and weathering the 
storms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has long been as popular on Wall Street as it is with loyal  
consumers, and its stature and reputation have helped keep the 
recent events from adding up to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have had a rough patch here,'' said Martin Romm, a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst who's followed Coke for more than two 
decades. ``I think Coke has really acted as an extremely focused 
company intent on doing the things that in the long term are in the 
best interests of their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been remarkably stable in an otherwise unstable  
environment,'' said Romm, among many analysts who still give Coke a 
good long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, M. Douglas Ivester, chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the company believes ``that the worst is behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain extremely confident in the fundamental strengths of  
our business systems throughout the world,'' Ivester said. ``Our 
company continues to be well-positioned to emerge from the current 
economic environment with an enhanced system that can refresh more 
consumers, every day, all over the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series of setbacks has brought increased scrutiny on  
Ivester, who succeeded Roberto C. Goizueta, Coke's CEO for 16 
highly successful years, in October 1997 following Goizueta's death 
from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nobody is blaming Ivester for any of these  
circumstances, CEO's have been eased into premature retirement for 
less,'' an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story commented Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has been criticized for a slow response to the health  
crisis that saw authorities link 249 cases of illness to Coke 
products and three European countries temporarily ban some Coke 
beverages. Ivester took personal charge of the crisis last week, 
apologizing in Belgium and pledging that Coke would regain trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Since overseas problems began hurting Coke's sales last year,  
Ivester has insisted that Coke remains focused on long-term 
opportunities and is committed to global growth. 
</P>
<P>
	A key director said Ivester retains the board's full support.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think Doug is the right man at the right time in the right  
place,'' said James B. Williams, retired chairman and CEO of 
SunTrust Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the company's strong civic reputation, most in the  
Atlanta area have had a wait-and-see response to the discrimination 
suit filed in April alleging the company gives less pay and 
opportunity to black employees. However, subsequent disclosures 
that black executives at Coke gave Ivester, at his request, 
recommendations for increasing diversity in December 1995 and that 
the plaintiffs had made formal complaints before the suit raised 
some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprises me is that they didn't nip it (complaints of  
discrimination) in the bud any earlier,'' said state Rep. Tyrone 
Brooks, D-Atlanta, who heads the Georgia Association of Black 
Elected Officials.

<HEADLINE> Best Buy, Prodigy Offer Rebates </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Electronics retailer Best Buy and Internet  
service provider Prodigy Communications are teaming for a promotion 
targeting consumers who haven't yet bought personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	They're offering rebates of up to $400 on purchase of a new PC  
with Prodigy Internet Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodigy says the effect could be to make entry level PCs free.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reports the online service leader,

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez MRI Shows No Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An MRI test of Texas Rangers catcher  
Ivan Rodriguez's injured knee showed no damage Thursday, and the 
team said he could be in the lineup for Friday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, who apparently hyperextended his knee while running  
the bases during Texas' 18-4 victory over Anaheim on Wednesday 
night, was examined by team orthopedist Dr. John Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was diagnosed with a bone bruise on his left knee. A  
statement from the team said there was ``a good possibility'' he 
will be able to play against Seattle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez is batting .308 with 13 home runs and 46 RBIs this  
season.

<HEADLINE> Gene Links Cancer Risk to Blacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Researchers have identified genetic signs  
unique to some blacks that appear to increase their risk for cancer 
of the colon and rectum. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published in the June 23 issue of the Journal of  
the American Medical Association, could help early diagnosis, a key 
to survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing the alterations is helpful when trying to look for  
them in families that are affected,'' said Dr. Thomas Weber, who 
led the two-year study at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	While similar links between colorectal cancer and specific  
genetic mutations have already been established among a handful of 
nationalities and ethnic groups, the new study was the first to 
focus on blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-leading cause of cancer deaths, colorectal  
cancer is expected to strike 129,400 people in the United States 
this year and kill 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks suffer higher rates of cancer of the colon and rectum  
than other racial and ethnic groups and die more frequently from 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the researchers said the genetic alterations are  
probably not an explanation for the higher death rate: that is 
largely attributable to late-stage diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, regular screening for cancer is essential, Weber  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything we can do to help identify who's at risk and direct  
clinical surveillance to those people would be very helpful,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite easy take-home tests, only about 40 percent of Americans  
over the age of 50 are screened regularly for colorectal cancer, 
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roswell Park research, done over the past two years, looked  
at 11 unrelated black colorectal cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The study determined that defects of the so-called ``mismatch  
repair'' genes, which normally repair DNA in cells that fail to 
replicate properly, contribute to hereditary nonpolyposis 
colorectal cancer, a specific type. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Cancer Society recommends that men and women 50 or  
older get tested annually to detect cancers of the colon or rectum. 
Screening should begin earlier for people with a strong family 
history of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Dell Chairman Sees Overseas Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dell Computer Corp., the nation's largest  
direct seller of computers, can grow considerably overseas over the 
next few years, Chairman Michael Dell says. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, we have a business that's roughly $6 billion in  
size,'' Dell said Wednesday night. ``Essentially, in the United 
Kingdom, we're pretty much tied for No. 1. We actually have more 
market share in the U.K. than we do in the U.S. Our models work 
better there than in the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which sells a majority of its computers to  
businesses, governments and other public institutions, reported 
revenues exceeding $5.5 billion in the fiscal quarter that ended in 
April, up 41 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported that sales through its Web site surpassed  
$18 million per day during the quarter, accounting for 30 percent 
of overall revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing to me is that we've been able to  
continue growth at a very elevated rate even in a mature, 
supposedly competitive market,'' Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He made those comments during a studio interview broadcast  
nationwide from the offices of the Edward Jones brokerage firm. The 
interviews with business executives allow Edward Jones' mostly 
middle- and upper-middle class investors to ask questions of the 
people leading the companies in which they're considering 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal computer market remains very strong and Dell Corp.  
continues to expect strong sales domestically and overseas, its 
chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The PC business to me looks like it's alive and thriving. We  
have a 10 percent market share globally. We think we can grow that 
considerably over the next several years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen very, very strong growth in (overseas) markets.  
Asia without Japan is growing much faster than the U.S. Europe is 
growing slower than the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell said the company's European division alone is about the  
size the entire operation was about three and half years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dell didn't exist in the U.S., Dell Europe would be an  
incredible success story but it kind of gets overshadowed by the 
growth that continues in the U.S.,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Amtrak Trains Graze Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Two Amtrak trains grazed each other  
early today as they moved past each other, derailing several cars 
and injuring seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	The trains were traveling on separate tracks and were not  
involved in a direct collision, Amtrak spokesman John Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We essentially had two trains sideswipe,'' he said. ``A number  
of cars derailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One train was headed from Miami to New York City and from New  
York to Miami when they hit just south of the Jacksonville train 
station, which the southbound train had just left. The trains, both 
called the Silver Palm, were carrying a combined 300 passengers, 
Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not sure what happened,'' said Ray Alfred, the  
Jacksonville fire chief. ``We don't know what caused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modesto Romero, his wife, Maria, and their children, Nelida, 11,  
and David, 14, were asleep in a cabin when the collision sent Mrs. 
Romero tumbling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and then I heard my wife. I jumped up and held up  
the top bunk where my kids were sleeping,'' said Romero, who was 
traveling to Miami from Newark, N.J., to visit relatives. ``They 
were a little scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Rhodell Green of Hollywood, Fla., said the accident  
jolted her out of her seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what happened. It felt like just a big hit,''  
she said. ``I thought we had run over a truck or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of seven the injured were taken to St. Vincent's Medical  
Center, where they were treated for cuts and bruises. The other two 
injured were taken to other hospitals; details were not immediately 
available but their injuries were not believed to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling south were to be put on another train and  
northbound passengers were put on buses.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Delay Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and some Democrats on  
Wednesday accused Republicans of trying to kill Senate-passed gun 
controls by putting off negotiations on the issue until mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned what delay means to gun bills,'' said D.C.  
Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton. ``The goal of the (GOP) leadership 
is not delay; the goal of the leadership is to defeat the bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert had told reporters June 24 he would  
name negotiators this week to iron out differences in the House and 
Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican leaders decided this week to wait until after  
Congress returns July 12 from its July Fourth holiday recess to 
begin the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary staff work needed for the negotiations ``is just  
taking longer than we expected,'' said Hastert's spokesman, John 
Feehrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intention is to appoint conferees and have this matter  
resolved one way or the other,'' Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Orrin Hatch said Wednesday. ``My goal is to have this 
conference report voted on before (we) go out for August recess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed White House-backed gun control legislation  
last month in response to shootings at a Colorado high school and 
elsewhere. The same provisions -- including mandatory background 
checks for all gun show sales -- were rejected by the House. The 
House later killed a measure that contained weaker curbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, since both the House and Senate have approved legislation  
dealing with juvenile crime, negotiations on a compromise are 
expected. Hastert told reporters June 24 that ``the American people 
intend us to'' address guns as part of a bill responding to high 
school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters that the  
negotiators would not be named until Congress returns in mid-July.	   President Clinton called the delay ``a grave mistake'' and 
pushed for the Senate restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress should make such measures the law of the land without  
further delay,'' Clinton said in a three-paragraph letter Wednesday 
to Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Democratic women lawmakers said they would beat the  
drum for gun control back home in their districts over the break.

<HEADLINE> Panel Advises on Fireworks Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fourth of July fireworks should be enjoyed  
from afar and beneath the stars to avoid hospital emergency rooms, 
federal safety officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued its annual warning  
about the dangers of fireworks by demonstrating the hazards of 
popular, and usually illegal, devices such as sparklers, bottle 
rockets, M-80s and M-1000s. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we near the year 2000, more of us than ever before will  
celebrate with fireworks,'' said Ann Brown, the commission 
chairwoman. ``These devices are best left to the professionals 
because even those that seem innocent can cause serious injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Matthew Scott, a 38-year-old paramedic from Absecon,  
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Scott became the recipient of nation's first hand  
transplant. On Thursday, he said he wished he was never in the 
position to make such medical history. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott lost his hand 14 years ago during ``a little horseplay''  
with friends and an illegal M-80 during the December holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My life was never the same, and it never will be the same,''  
he said. ``Yes, I was lucky enough to be selected to get the hand 
transplant on my left hand but all things considered, I wish I 
never had to make that choice. I wish I never picked up that device 
and I wish I never lit it. In an instant, my entire hand was gone. 
It affected not only me, but my family, my friends who were there 
with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CPSC noted that emergency rooms treated 8,500 fireworks  
injuries last year, about 40 percent of the them suffered by 
children under 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, working with the Customs Service, has seized more  
than 400 million unsafe fireworks at U.S. docks since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the risk of injuries from fireworks, the CPSC  
suggested consumers should: 
</P>
<P>
	--Never allow children to play with fireworks.  
</P>
<P>
	--Read and follow all fireworks warnings and instructions.  
</P>
<P>
	--Never try to relight fireworks that have not fully functioned.  
</P>
<P>
	--Keep a bucket of water nearby in case of accident or fire.  
</P>
<P>
	--Only light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from  
houses, dry leaves and flammable materials.

<HEADLINE>  Barron Davis Arrives in Charlotte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- It wasn't hard to pick out the newest  
member of the Charlotte Hornets at the team's headquarters 
Thursday. Baron Davis was the one walking around with the big 
smile, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours after the Hornets made Davis the third  
overall selection in the 1999 NBA draft, he was starting to 
appreciate the events that landed him in what looks like a 
relatively charmed spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of the NBA draft is such that the high picks  
generally go to the worst teams, and this year's draft followed 
that course -- with the exception of the Hornets and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the other top choices found themselves taken by such  
struggling teams as the Bulls, Grizzlies and Clippers, Davis landed 
with a franchise that has posted three consecutive winning seasons. 
The Hornets rallied in the second half of last season to finish at 
26-24, one game short of a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	But because they failed to qualify for the postseason, they  
wound up in the draft lottery, seemingly destined for no better 
than the 13th selection. But they beat the odds by winning the 
third pick, and now Davis has done the same thing by landing with a 
team that doesn't face a long rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sweet end of the deal,'' a beaming Davis said. ``I  
feel sorry for those other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately ahead for the 20-year-old point guard is acclimating  
himself to the NBA and the Hornets, who already have a starting 
point guard in six-year pro David Wesley. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to help Baron tremendously,'' coach Paul Silas  
said. ``He'll get a chance to work himself in, learn the league, 
learn what he can do and what he can't. There's going to be 
virtually no pressure on him to come out of the gates smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis doesn't plan to be tentative about the start of his NBA  
career. He was known as a tough, physical player at UCLA, and he 
intends to continue that style with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to take your head off,'' said Davis, who bounced  
back from knee surgery to lead UCLA in scoring, assists and steals 
in 1998-99, his second and final season with the Bruins. ``I'm 
trying to go at you all night. If it gets physical, it gets 
physical. That's what I like,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a California native who was raised in the Los Angeles  
area, said staying close to home would have been a preference for 
his pro career. Since that didn't work out, Davis said he's excited 
about coming to Charlotte and adapting to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it as an adjustment, a new beginning in life,'' he  
said. ``It's an opportunity to get away, to be out on my own, get a 
feel for life and grow as an individual. I'm looking forward to the 
challenges ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Some Hammer Assets Said Undeclared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- A court-appointed trustee overseeing M.C.  
Hammer's finances is accusing the rap star of failing to declare 
some of his assets in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustee William Broach has asked a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge  
not to release Hammer, whose real name is Stanley Burrell, and his 
wife from repaying their debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell, known for the song ``Can't Touch This,'' earned an  
estimated $30 million from his recording career, but filed for 
bankruptcy in 1996 claiming debts of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Broach questioned Burrell's claim that he had only about $60,000  
worth of jewelry, and that he had sold most of it to strangers. In 
a 1993 insurance policy application, Burrell claimed $674,000 in 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the Burrells, Eric Nyland, this week defended  
his clients: ``We believe the allegations in the complaints are 
wrong, and that will be proven in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was continued until Jan. 12.

<HEADLINE> China, Norway in World Cup Semifinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- China did it by dominating for an entire  
match, outshooting the Russians 24-2 in a one-sided contest. Norway 
used a 20-minute spurt to break open a close match against a 
familiar rival, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese and Norwegians reached the Women's World Cup  
semifinals in different fashions, and will face each other Sunday 
at Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	China defeated the Russians 2-0 in a game not nearly as close as  
the score, while the defending World Cup champion Norwegians scored 
all their goals in a 20-minute span of the second half in defeating 
Sweden 3-1 in Wednesday's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though Norway had made the final in each of the two  
previous World Cups, the Norwegians are painting themselves as 
underdogs against a Chinese team that is relentless on offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is ... the best team in the world right now. We're just  
one of the top four, so we want to see how we can do,'' Norwegian 
coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge Chinese goalie Gao Hong faced against the  
Russians was staying awake. The ball was on the Russian side of the 
field for most of the match, and Gao was not forced to make a save 
until the game's final moments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that boring,'' Gao said. ``The Russian team is known  
for its counterattacking, so I was ready for that. I was just 
waiting for my moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its past three games in the World Cup, China has outscored  
opponents 12-1. Gao has not faced a tough test since China's 2-1 
win over Sweden in its opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``The games will become harder and harder,'' said Gao, who  
allowed only five goals in five games at the 1996 Olympics. 
``Different teams give me different pressures. There was not much 
action for me (against Russia), but I was prepared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Norway advanced to the semifinal, the Swedes also had  
reason to cheer. When Malin Mostrom scored during injury time at 
the end of the second half, it earned the Swedes a spot in the 2000 
Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a complicated formula used to select the eight women's  
soccer teams for the 2000 Games, Mostrom's goal clinched a spot for 
the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This young team needs to get experience as we have in the  
World Cup and will in the Olympics,'' Swedish coach Marika Domanski 
Lyfors said. ``We are coming back in the next World Cup. I promise 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Norwegians seemed happy their Scandinavian neighbors  
had earned a spot in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased Sweden got the goal and qualified for the  
Olympics,'' Hogmo said.

	``When they stop coming, then that'll be a sign from God to ...  
do other things,'' said the Rev. Steve Hill, an evangelist who 
began the revival with Brownsville's pastor, the Rev. John 
Kilpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds fill the 2,000-seat church and overflow into another  
building where services are shown on a huge video screen. The 
revival runs four nights a week, with Hill preaching at two of the 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is being taken on the road, and its presence on  
religious television stations across the nation is growing. The 
revival has led to the creation of a school where 1,700 students 
train as ministers and missionaries. The goal is for a million 
people to make professions of faith by Jan. 1, 2001, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	In longevity, Brownsville has surpassed the three-year Azusa  
Street Revival in Los Angeles that began in 1906 and boosted the 
growth of the Pentecostal movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownsville's faithful exhibit physical manifestations similar  
to Azusa Street's. People jump up and down, their hands raised, as 
a choir and musicians sing and play contemporary Christian tunes. 
Some shake uncontrollably, fall ``slain in the spirit'' or speak in 
tongues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rock concert in robes,'' the New York Times once called  
Brownsville. It also has been compared to the Jesus movement of the 
late 1960s and early '70s, when hippies began following Christ and 
college students were holding revivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an old-fashioned camp meeting,'' Hill said.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics such as the Rev. G. Richard Fisher, a Baptist minister  
from Bricktown, N.J., contend such ``weird and crazy'' goings on 
put emotion before reason and are contrary to orderly worship 
dictated by the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a feel-good culture. If you make them feel good they  
think something is happening,'' said Fisher, a board member of 
Personal Freedom Outreach, a nonprofit association created to 
educate Christians about aberrational and false teachings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill responded: ``A physical manifestation is just how someone  
responds to the presence of God touching them. It doesn't make any 
difference to me if somebody falls down. I want to see them when 
they stand up, living for God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill declined to comment on former Brownsville church member  
Vicky Conroy's claim she had been told to fake manifestations. She 
is among hundreds who have left the church because they disagree 
with various aspects of the revival. 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging departures, Kilpatrick said the church has  
grown to about 5,000 members from 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``When God breaks out in a major way like this, people are going  
to come (who are) desperate,'' Kilpatrick said. ``There's a lot of 
people who don't want that type of people in their churches. They 
don't want the demon-possessed coming. They don't want the drug 
addicts, the prostitutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Hank Hanegraaff, president of the Christian Research  
Institute in Southern California and host of the ``Bible Answer 
Man'' radio program, criticized Brownsville and its manifestations 
on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kilpatrick's response: that God would bring Hanegraaff down if  
he continued his criticism. Kilpatrick later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Brownsville's financial practices have also brought criticism.  
The revival appeals for contributions, and separate ministries 
established by Hill, Kilpatrick and Michael Brown, president of the 
Brownsville Revival School of Ministry, sell books, videos and 
other revival-related items. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation two years ago by the Pensacola News Journal  
found the revival had pumped millions into their coffers with 
little or no accountability and without paying sales tax on the 
items sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the News Journal reports, sales taxes are being paid, and  
two of the ministries, Hill's Together in the Harvest and 
Kilpatrick's Feast of Fire, have joined the Evangelical Council for 
Financial Accountability, a watchdog group formed by Billy Graham 
and others. Revival leaders blamed state revenue officials for 
giving them conflicting information on whether sales tax should be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher and other critics contend that Brownsville's traveling  
revivals, the Awake America crusade, are just another way to make 
money. Hill denies it, citing high costs for travel, leasing 
stadiums and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not lucrative,'' he said. ``It's for preaching the  
gospel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen Awake America revivals are being held this year.  
Scheduled cities include Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis and 
Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they keep coming,'' Hill said, ''we'll keep  
preaching.''

<HEADLINE> Serial Killer Ng Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- After 14 years of legal maneuvering, a  
serial killer who videotaped victims begging for their lives was 
sentenced to death for a spree of sexual torture and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	At his sentencing hearing Wednesday, Charles Ng again tried to  
delay proceedings, first saying he was too tired to participate and 
then by asking for a hearing on one of his many motions to fire his 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange County Superior Court Judge John Ryan denied the request  
and was was unsympathetic to Ng's claims of sleepiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, a 38-year-old Hong Kong immigrant and former Marine, was  
convicted of murdering 11 people -- six men, three women and two 
baby boys. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng imprisoned, tortured and raped the women, who were lured to a  
cabin in the Sierra Nevada foothills, 150 miles east of San 
Francisco, that belonged to Leonard Lake, a friend of Ng's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng denied killing anyone, but jurors watched videotapes in which  
Lake and Ng were seen tormenting bound women. In one of them, a 
woman pleads for her baby and Ng coldly replies that the baby is 
``sleeping like a rock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors who convicted Ng recommended he be put to death, and Ryan  
agreed. He could have sentenced Ng to life in prison without parole 
for the murders, which happened in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake killed himself after a shoplifting arrest in 1985. Ng was  
arrested later that year in Canada, where he fought extradition for 
five years. Efforts to bring the case to trial dragged on as Ng 
hired and fired attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is one of the longest and costliest prosecutions in  
California history, with a taxpayer expense estimated at $14 
million. Appeals could take years.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower early today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid shifting 
weather forecasts for Midwest growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices retreated after forecasters predicted a high  
pressure ridge heading into major growing regions would not linger 
as long as originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops in Iowa and Illinois, the two largest growing states,  
are particularly vulnerable to high heat and a lack of moisture 
over the next few weeks, as they enter the crucial pollination 
stage.

<HEADLINE> Elton Brand Joins the Chicago Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- When Elton Brand's mother held his new  
Chicago Bulls jersey for the first time, a huge grin crossed her 
face and she let out a gleeful laugh as she shook the shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of taking two-hour train rides three or four days a  
week to the cramped church gym where his AAU team practiced, Brand 
has hit the big time. He's the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, and 
his new home is the gym that used to be Michael Jordan's 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to come in and see all the trophies,'' he said  
Thursday, glancing back at the six championship trophies at the 
Bulls' practice facility. ``I was just in amazement. It's a very 
special place with all the banners hanging up. I was in awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a sophomore at Duke, Brand averaged 16.2 points and 9.8  
rebounds and led the Blue Devils to the NCAA championship game. 
He's 6-8 and 275 pounds, and his arm span is wider than some small 
planes. He's also got the biggest, softest hands general manager 
Jerry Krause has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	But for all the magazine covers he graced and the awards he  
picked up last year, the national college player of the year said 
there are still some things people haven't seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the general managers and coaches were pleasantly  
surprised at my perimeter skills and my face-the-basket game,'' he 
said. ``I didn't get to showcase that much at Duke. But I didn't 
have to with Will Avery and Trajan Langdon out there hitting jump 
shots and me being able to dominate down low. But I do have a 
face-up, wide-open game that I think can flourish at this next 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely going to improve, athletically and  
physically,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls are counting on it. After going from dynasty to dust  
heap, the Bulls are looking for Brand to be the cornerstone of 
their rebuilding effort. That's fine with Brand, who arrived at 
Duke when coach Mike Krzyzewski was reviving his program after a 
year away recuperating from back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	People will expect a lot from him, but Brand said they always  
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot of pressure, but I'm looking forward to  
the challenge,'' he said. ``At every level, I've had to face 
pressure and criticism and such, but I always prevailed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't start calling him the next Jordan. Or Dennis Rodman.  
Or anyone else, for that matter, said David Falk, agent for Jordan 
and Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the important thing is not to compare the future with  
the past,'' he said. ``We don't want him to be the next anyone. I 
hope he's the first Elton Brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand knows the transition to the NBA might be difficult. He is,  
after all, just 20 years old, and the NBA is a long way from the 
Atlantic Coast Conference. Then there's the city of Chicago, which 
is looking for someone to make the post-Jordan hangover go away. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is used to traveling and living away from home, and his  
mother, Daisy, will probably come to Chicago with him for at least 
the first year. He also got a pleasant surprise when the Bulls 
drafted one of his old AAU buddies, Ron Artest, with the 16th pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest, a forward at St. John's, and Brand played on the  
Riverside Church AAU team for three years, including one 
spectacular season when it went 64-1. They once talked about going 
to the same college. And when neither could sleep on Tuesday night, 
they sat up in the hallway of their hotel, talking about how far 
they'd come and how their lives were about to change. 
</P>
<P>
	When Artest heard the Bulls call his name, he started crying.  
And no, it wasn't because his hometown New York Knicks didn't pick 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I could think was, `I'm back with Elton again!''' Artest  
said. ``That's crazy. I'm going to feel right at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two hope it won't be long before they're duplicating their  
magic from Manhattan in Chicago. For the next couple days, though, 
they're going to take some time and savor the feeling of making it 
to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've worked all your life for this and dreamed all your  
life for such a special moment, when it comes, it just feels very 
special,'' Brand said. ``I'm very eager to get in here and just get 
started. I'm looking forward to the great experience that's going 
to come.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Export Restrictions Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration eased restrictions  
on the export of computer technology Thursday, saying regulations 
haven't kept pace with technological advances. Officials pledged to 
review the guidelines every six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The new limits maintain tighter control over machines exported  
for military purposes than for civilian use, while accommodating 
the capabilities of current processing chips, hard drives and other 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	``These policies will strengthen America's high-tech  
competitiveness, while maintaining controls that are needed to 
maintain our national security,'' Clinton said. ``These reforms are 
needed because of the extraordinarily rapid rate of technological 
change in the computer industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that, given the power of commercially available  
personal computers, maintaining standards set in 1996 to stop 
sensitive technology from falling into unfriendly hands would hurt 
U.S. businesses without enhancing national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer industry leaders had sought the changes in a White  
House meeting earlier this year with Clinton's chief of staff, John 
Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will affect exports to about 100 countries, from  
the former Soviet bloc to Latin America, but of particular interest 
to the computer industry is the vast Chinese market, which experts 
say is growing about twice as fast as the world market for 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	There is heightened sensitivity to sharing technology with  
China, given that Beijing is suspected of stealing nuclear secrets 
from U.S. labs. 
</P>
<P>
	But relaxing the guidelines for China didn't seem likely to  
spark a tempest. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who led a congressional  
investigation into the China spying allegations, wrote in a San 
Jose (Calif.) Mercury News opinion piece last week that such 
exports have been ``a great democratizing and liberating force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said he was encouraged that the  
administration had acted ``after months of inaction.'' ``The 
administration has joined many of us in Congress in recognizing 
that America's world-class computer industry faces a looming 
problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say products that will be widely available  
next year would have surpassed the current guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. spokesman Chuck Mulloy called the new rules ``very  
good progress,'' but said the company saw it only as an ``interim 
step.'' Intel plans late next year to release a chip more powerful 
than those allowed under the revised guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very encouraged about the president's willingness to  
work with Congress in a bipartisan look at a long-term solution,'' 
Mulloy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he would ask Congress to change rules that require  
a six-month waiting period between announcement and implementation 
of regulatory changes for exports. The administration believes the 
industry should only have to wait one month. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he would review the limits again in six months.  
</P>
<P>
	Under current regulations, exports to what are classified as  
``Tier 3'' countries -- those deemed to present the greatest risk to 
national security -- are restricted to systems that can perform 
7,000 million theoretical operations per second, known as MTOPS, 
for civilian use and 2,000 million per second for military use. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, computer makers will be able to sell systems for civilian  
use that perform 12,300 MTOPS. Technology that could have a 
military application will be limited to 6,500 MTOPS. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry had been pushing to raise the limits to 30,000  
MTOPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our nation's cutting edge computer industry is constantly  
recreating itself with technological advances that are the envy of 
the world,'' Dreier said, adding that he would work with the 
administration ``to ensure that our export control laws keep pace 
with technological change.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks on Bush, Fundraising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, banking a record  
$36 million for his presidential race, would be lining up with 
Republicans ``unanimously hostile'' to campaign finance reform if 
he rejects federal spending limits, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people will have to make up their minds about  
whether this is an important issue or not,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the nation's most avid political watcher, he refused to  
handicap the race and speculate whether Bush already has the GOP 
nomination sewn up. ``I don't have a clue,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush broke ahead of the entire 2000 pack when he announced this  
week that he had raised over the last four months a stunning $36 
million for Campaign 2000. Clinton's hand-picked successor, Vice 
President Al Gore, has raised just $18 million in the first half of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's haul heightened speculation that he would forgo federal  
matching funds for his primary campaign and the spending limits 
that go with them. Advocates of campaign finance reform have 
worried that such a move would undercut attempts at tighter finance 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership of the Republican Party in general are  
unanimously hostile to campaign finance reform. They don't believe 
in it. And so if he did that, he would have that in common with the 
other leaders who won't let us bring'' campaign finance reform 
legislation to a vote in Congress, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional politicos were wowed by Bush's cash tally, but  
Clinton brushed aside its impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most valuable commodity in an election in a democracy ...  
even more valuable than money, is ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On ideas, Clinton added, Gore wins. ``He is the only candidate  
who has yet told the American people what he wanted to do if he got 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president added, in response to a later question, that he  
did not intend his comments to be ``a dig'' at Gore's only 
Democratic rival for the nomination, former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about news reports that Clinton was furious with Gore for  
campaign statements explicitly and repeatedly distancing himself 
from the president's personal behavior in the Monica Lewinsky 
affair, Clinton said he was ``bewildered'' by the stories and 
didn't know their source. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not in my heart or my mind,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in a joint news conference with Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	With Middle East tensions dominating their private talks, the  
two presidents exchanged before the news cameras congratulations 
for their respective commitments to renewing the Mideast peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valuable time has been wasted,'' Mubarak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants to give Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud  
Barak ``more freedom of movement to move aggressively ahead'' on 
the peace track. ``I do think that the time is right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lingering stalemate with Iraqi President Saddam  
Hussein, Clinton reiterated that he supports relaxing an 
international embargo for strictly humanitarian reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never wanted the Iraqi people to suffer because of their  
leader,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I do not believe we should give up on an  
attempt -- an insistence, indeed -- that the United Nations, in 
return for this'' should demand strict arms control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	On another foreign policy matter that has claimed his attention  
throughout his 6 1/2-year presidency, Clinton addressed the peace 
talks in Northern Ireland, which are once again at a crisis point. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, who has a personal stake in the implementation of  
last year's Good Friday accord, brokered by his own peace envoy, 
has worked the phones in the last 24 hours trying to break the 
stalemate in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very difficult problem for the parties, but it will be  
very hard for the world to understand if this breaks off, since 
everyone's agreed to the fundamental elements of the Good Friday 
agreement,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To call it a tragedy would be a gross understatement.''  
</P>
<P>
	He added that the British, Irish and political leaders of  
Northern Ireland ``do seem determined to work it through to a 
positive conclusion.''

 *United States 3, Germany 2    	
</P>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Brazil vs. the United States. Fourth of  
July. Stanford, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the two nations met at Stanford Stadium in the men's  
World Cup. Brazil won 1-0 and went on to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, the same countries, the same venue and the  
same red-white-and-blue date are the setting for Sunday's semifinal 
in the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Only this time, the United States will be the favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is a different story. Sometimes the same story  
repeats,'' Brazilian coach Wilson de Oliveira said. ``We hope this 
story repeats. We have a dream. If we can emulate what happened in 
this stadium five years ago, our dream will come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams advanced with one-goal victories Thursday night. With  
President Clinton and his family among the 54,642 fans at Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium, defenders Brandi Chastain and Joy Fawcett scored off 
corner kicks to rally the U.S. team from a 2-1 halftime deficit in 
a 3-2 victory over Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we'll have to play better against Brazil,'' said coach  
Tony DiCicco, whose team overcame its first real test after winning 
its three first-round games by a combined scored of 13-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil blew a 3-0 halftime lead against Nigeria before Sissi  
scored the first sudden-death overtime goal in Women's World Cup 
history. The midfielder's 22-yard free kick, her tournament-high 
seventh goal, won the game 4-3 in the 104th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the game I turned into an old man,'' de Oliveira said.  
``But after the game I became a young man again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results mean all four teams have qualified for the 2000  
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader was evidence of the unexpected surge in  
popularity of the biggest all-women's sports event ever. Extra 
seats were made available to meet demand, and the crowd was late 
arriving because of a 20-mile backup to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, also arriving late, watched the second half of the  
U.S.-Germany match from a luxury box with wife Hillary, daughter 
Chelsea, two of Chelsea's friends and Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	After the match, the presidential party met the U.S. team in the  
locker room. The players chanted ``Clinton'' as he posed for a 
group picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us what an inspiration the team was, coming from  
behind,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``I told him thanks for 
coming, it makes a ton of difference for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1, the Americans tied the score in the 49th minute when  
Chastain volleyed in Mia Hamm's corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Fawcett, who almost never joins the attack -- she had 18 goals in  
140 international games heading into the World Cup -- scored the 
game-winner in the 66th when she was positioned perfectly for a 
side header past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Silke 
Rottenberg. The corner kick came from Shannon MacMillan, who had 
entered the game seconds earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	As it has the whole tournament, the U.S. team came out sloppy.  
Chastain, who later would sustain a mile ankle sprain, played a 
loose ball back to goalkeeper Briana Scurry. Scurry wasn't 
expecting it, and the result was an own goal for Germany in the 
fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffeny Milbrett's low shot tied the game in the 16th minute,  
but Germany regained the lead in injury time when Bettina Wiegmann 
made a move around Cindy Parlow and sent a 22-yard rocket into the 
top left corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	That prompted an urgent halftime talk from U.S. captain Carla  
Overbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carla said that everything we done in this lifetime comes down  
to these 45 minutes,'' Foudy said. ``We had 45 minutes to make a 
difference. That's it and we had to leave everything on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second game, Sissi played a part in all four Brazilian  
goals. Her free kick started a sequence that led to Cidinha's score 
in the fourth minute, and her chip from the corner of the penalty 
box was headed home by Cidinha at the far post in the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissi then played the ball to Nene for a 40-yard chip that  
sailed over goalkeeper Ann Chiejine's head from the right flank in 
the 35th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria rallied with goals from Prisca Emeafu, Nkiru Okosieme  
and Nkechi Egbe before Sissi's ``Golden Goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, Sissi is the queen of soccer,'' de Oliveira said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Chief Tackles Population Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The head of the World Health Organization  
spoke out for greater access to sex education for young people 
Thursday, addressing a special U.N. session on population. 
</P>
<P>
	Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway,  
broke a deadlock at the U.N. Population Conference in Cairo 1994 
with an impassioned keynote speech calling for family planning and 
reproductive health programs for women. 
</P>
<P>
	She was equally outspoken at the special session to decide on  
new proposals to implement the Cairo plan, taking on one of the two 
issues that have stalled agreement on a final document. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young people especially, as they embark upon their sexual and  
reproductive lives, must be able to protect themselves from 
disease, abuse and exploitation,'' she told the General Assembly. 
``They have a right to information and to services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the conference headed towards its close on Friday, delegates  
from 180 countries were still debating at what age young people 
should receive sex education in school and whether children have a 
right to confidentiality on sex-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The other issue blocking agreement is whether countries should  
be asked to review laws that punish women for having illegal 
abortions. The most vocal opposition comes from the Vatican and its 
supporters Argentina, Guatemala and Nicaragua, as well as Libya and 
Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year worldwide, Brundtland said, there are 333 million new  
cases of sexually transmitted diseases, and one in 20 adolescents 
gets one. More than half of the 5.2 million people infected 
annually with HIV are under the age of 24. 
</P>
<P>
	She said respecting young people's right to information is  
essential in reducing disease, avoiding unwanted pregnancies and 
controlling the growth of the world population, now approaching 6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving young people information does not encourage  
promiscuity, rather it fosters mutual respect and shared 
responsibility,'' Brundtland said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft said the United  
States endorses a strong role for families. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are urging strong involvement, however, of young people in  
programs that affect them, and in the confidentiality that 
sometimes medical services have to be provided with. We think this 
has to be with strong support of parents and the guidance of 
parents throughout the process,'' Taft said.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Wheelchair Can Climb Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new high-tech wheelchair that can easily  
traverse curbs, climb stairs and is rugged enough to take users on 
the beach is being developed by Johnson &AMP; Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorized device, called the Independence 3000 IBOT  
Transporter, could be available as early as 2001. It will sell for 
at least $20,000 to $25,000, slightly more than most high-end 
customized motorized wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&AMP;J has completed testing the  
wheelchair with about 100 disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just amazed at how easy the thing was to use,'' said  
George St. Hilaire, 52, of Nashua, N.H. who took part in the 
testing. He especially liked the chair's ability to raise him up so 
he could talk to other adults at eye level. 
</P>
<P>
	If the chair were available, he would no longer need the  
elevator in his house to get around. He would also return to his 
favorite outdoor activities, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take it up into the White Mountains to some hiking on  
the trails,'' said St. Hilaire, who has used a wheelchair since 
losing the use of his legs six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheelchair allows users to move about at eye-level while  
balanced on two wheels. On four wheels, it allows users to climb up 
and down stairs, traverse uneven and hilly terrain, and negotiate 
street curbs. The wheelchair uses gyroscopes and sensors to help it 
maintain its balance on uneven terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheelchair, which J&AMP;J officials dub their ``advanced  
mobility system,'' was invented by Dean Kamen, founder of privately 
held DEKA Research &AMP; Development Corp. of Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamen said the idea hit him when he stumbled stepping out of the  
shower about a decade ago. He figured since he recover his balance, 
so could a wheelchair if it was computerized to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	He sold J&AMP;J on the idea five years ago and has been working with  
the company ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J, which sells a litany of medical devices in addition to its  
Band-Aids and baby powder, has never sold wheelchairs before. Two 
million Americans use wheelchairs; it is a $1 billion industry in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the Independence's features are unique, as several  
high-end wheelchair makers have seats that can go up and down and 
work like four-wheel drive vehicles to negotiate rough terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Independence puts many of the most high-tech features in  
one wheelchair, and even competitors acknowledge the ability of the 
Independence to climb stairs is an incredible feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be really cool,'' said Larry Jackson, vice  
president of operations for Permobil, a Swedish wheelchair maker 
that has U.S. operations in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the disabled say the advance can make wheelchair  
users more independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's remarkable,'' said Carol Fuhrer, an official with the  
National Center for Disability Services, in Albertson, New York. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 95.62 at 11,066.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks vaulted higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq  
composite and Standard and Poor's 500 indexes again setting 
records, as investors reveled in the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.62 to close at  
11,066.42. The blue-chip index held steadily above 11,000 for the 
first time in weeks, and during the session, inched within 28 
points of its May 13 record close of 11,107.19. So far this week, 
the Dow has gained 513.86 points. 
</P>
<P>
	A resurgence in technology stocks boosted the Nasdaq 20.06 to  
2,706.18, topping the record it set Wednesday. The S&AMP;P 500 index 
rose 8.25 to 1,380.96, also beating its Wednesday record high. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm,'' said William  
Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, investors applauded the long-expected decision by  
the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates one-quarter 
percentage point. The market was especially heartened by the Fed's 
policy shift to a ``neutral'' bias on the need for future rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan, by removing his bias to tighten, has flashed a red  
cape in front of the bull market,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the market Thursday were semiconductor stocks such as  
Intel, up 3 3/8 to 62 7/8. Technology stocks had slumped in the weeks 
leading up to the Fed's decision, as traders moved money toward 
lower-priced stocks that looked like better bargains in case higher 
rates began crimping profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Shobin, a technical analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.,  
said he might have expected profit-taking to set in after three 
consecutive days of steep gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a sign of great strength that this market  
continues to be able to reach new levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As trading began Thursday, stocks appeared to have ended their  
big run. Prices faltered in tandem with bonds, which dropped after 
the National Association of Purchasing Management reported the 
manufacturing sector expanded at a stronger-than-expected pace in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds initially plunged, as the report suggested the threats of  
inflation that first prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates may not have evaporated. Prices ultimately recovered, ending 
only modestly lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond settled 
at 6.00 percent, up from 5.96 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors shrugged off the bond market's concerns. ``A  
little hiccup in bond land is not likely to end the mania on Wall 
Street,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, which have languished for much of this year, were  
higher across the board. Eli Lilly led the sector, rising 3 1/4 to 74 7/8 
after Lehman Brothers added the stock to its ``10 Uncommon Values'' 
list of recommended stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet coffee company Starbucks tumbled 10 5/8 to 26 15/16 after  
surprising Wall Street with a forecast of lower than expected 
earnings for the next two quarters and for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of smaller companies had wild price swings as the Frank  
Russell Co. shuffled the component stocks of its indexes, which 
include the widely-followed Russell 2000. The changes mean that 
portfolios modeled after the indexes have to be adjusted as well. 
Pitt-Des Moines, a construction subcontractor that trades on the 
American Stock Exchange, was down 28 7/8 at 33 5/8 after rising 30 points 
in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.02 
billion shares, compared with 1.33 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.20 to 651.33, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.98 to 794.95. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.26 to 454.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.89 percent to its  
highest close since September 1997. European indexes also gained 
strength from the U.S. interest-rate decision. Germany's DAX index 
gained 1.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 rose 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Cable Car Crash Kills 20 in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE-EN-DEVOLUY, France (AP) -- A cable car gondola  
crashed hundreds of feet to the ground today near the top of a ski 
resort in the French Alps, killing all 20 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said no tourists were riding the private cable car  
that was carrying workers to the Pic de Bure space observatory. The 
gondola fell 262 feet onto a rock-studded grass slope above 
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, 400 miles southeast of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst cable car disaster in the country's history.  
Eight people died in a 1989 accident in the Isere region of the 
French Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said it was not yet known what caused the accident  
on the lift. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable car accidents have hit other regions of the Alps in recent  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, 20 people were killed when a U.S. Marine jet  
cut a cable of a ski lift, sending a gondola plunging to the ground 
near Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Charles Simiand, chief representative of the cable car  
union, told LCI television that the cable car was built in the 
1980s and recently passed a safety inspection. ``It was in perfect 
working order,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed in the 7:30 a.m. accident were employees of the  
space observatory, which is atop the mountain at 8,887 feet, or 
construction crews, France Telecom phone company workers and 
employees of a cleaning service. 
</P>
<P>
	All 20 victims on board were French. The Pic de Bure observatory  
specializes in radio astronomy -- the use of radio technology for 
space communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Simiand said the private lift consisted of one cable car with  
room for 20 passengers and another smaller one used to transport 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned local residents gathered this afternoon at the town  
hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``These mountain communities have a lot of heart,'' said Marcel  
Lesbros, a lawmaker for the Hautes-Alpes region. ``We're all 
personally touched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement was expected to arrive  
at the site later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technical investigations should shed light on the  
circumstances that led to this catastrophe, which the region and 
the entire country are mourning,'' French President Jacques 
Chirac's office said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Yvan Chaix, director of the tourism office in  
Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy, said: ``We know most of the victims. The 
whole region is in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident at Saint-Etienne-en-Devoluy was the latest disaster  
to hit the French Alps, where massive avalanches killed 12 people 
and swept away 23 chalets Feb. 9 near the ski resort of Chamonix. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, a fire that broke out on a truck in the Mont  
Blanc tunnel killed 45 people.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Backs Trade With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House's trade policy committee gave its  
support Thursday to President Clinton's decision to extend normal 
relations status with China for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee, by a voice vote, reported  
``adversely'' to the full House a motion to override the 
president's June 3 action to give China access to low tariffs for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House is expected to take up the issue in mid-July and  
go along with the president, but not before hearing arguments that 
China does not deserve normal trade status because of its trade, 
weapons proliferation and human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending China's trade status, formerly called  
``most-favored-nation'' status, has been an annual issue since 
1980, but Congress has never succeeded in overturning a president's 
decision to continue normal trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is expected to be even more heated this year because  
of growing anger here over allegations of Chinese espionage in U.S. 
nuclear weapons labs and illegal Chinese political contributions as 
well as China's growing trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese are using their $60 billion annual trade surplus  
with us to modernize their armed forces, including building nuclear 
missiles aimed at the United States,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, 
R-Calif., who introduced the motion to disapprove the trade status 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means  
trade subcommittee, said starting a trade war now would probably 
derail negotiations that would open China's markets and make them 
eligible for entry into the World Trade Organization. ``It is not 
only in the U.S. commercial interest, but in our strategic interest 
to renew normal trade relations with China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also reported adversely a motion to disapprove of  
another June 3 presidential decision making Vietnam eligible for 
U.S. government credits for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Crane likewise argued that continued engagement with the  
Vietnamese has borne results in increased trade and the accounting 
of missing U.S. servicemen. Vietnam won't be eligible for normal 
trade status until the two countries conclude a bilateral trade 
agreement.

	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Forwards Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet  
will remain with the Phoenix Coyotes for another year. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mercury Capsule To Be Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Two months after finding Gus Grissom's  
Mercury capsule in the Atlantic, an underwater salvage expert has 
returned to sea in hopes of raising the spacecraft and bringing it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank 38 years ago this month.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a big relief'' once the capsule is aboard ship,  
Curt Newport said before setting sail Thursday. ``I'll feel like 
the weight of a Mercury capsule's been taken off my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his team discovered Liberty Bell 7 on May 1 about  
300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral. But they were forced to 
leave it there when the cable to their robotic recovery vessel 
snapped in rough seas. The capsule is in water 3 miles deep. 
</P>
<P>
	It took five weeks for Oceaneering International Inc. to build  
another recovery vessel. The Houston company also supplied a bigger 
ship for this trip, which is expected to last 1 1/2 to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport plans to retrieve the recovery vessel first, then go  
after Liberty Bell 7, the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a 
successful mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule splashed down with Grissom after a 15-minute  
suborbital flight on July 21, 1961. But the explosive bolts that 
blow open the hatch detonated prematurely, and the spacecraft 
filled up with water and sank. 
</P>
<P>
	If he has time, Newport will hunt for the missing hatch, which  
could answer one of the biggest mysteries of the space program: Did 
Grissom blow the hatch or did it malfunction? Grissom insisted 
until his death in the 1967 Apollo launch pad fire that he did 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport expects Liberty Bell 7 to be on deck by the end of next  
week if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no guarantee we're going to come back with a  
spaceship,'' said Newport, 48, who spent 14 years trying to find 
the capsule. ``I think we will, but nothing can be guaranteed 
because there are so many things that can go wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two bomb experts are going along to deactivate an explosive  
navigation device that failed to go off when the spacecraft sank. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship will stop briefly at Fort Lauderdale on Sunday to pick  
up more people, including Jim Lewis, the helicopter pilot who tried 
unsuccessfully to rescue the capsule in 1961, and Guenter Wendt, 
the launch pad leader who strapped in the Mercury astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable television's Discovery Channel is financing the expedition  
for a documentary to be broadcast later this year. Production 
manager Sarah Hume estimates the return trip doubled the cost of 
the venture, which was already in the seven figures.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Lawsuit Bill Passed by Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Exactly six months before the year 2000,  
Congress emphatically endorsed compromise legislation Thursday to 
shield businesses from a potential flood of Y2K computer-related 
lawsuits. The White House says President Clinton will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	A House vote of 404-24 was followed several hours later by an  
81-18 vote in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year 2000 is right around the corner,'' said Rep. David  
Dreier, R-Calif., one of the chief House sponsors. ``We have a 
responsibility to do what we can to help people solve Y2K problems 
before anything goes wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's main sponsor, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called  
passage ``a victory for the nation and for the continued prosperity 
of our economy as we enter the new millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the top legislative priorities of the business community  
this year, the bill would give them 90 days to fix Y2K problems 
before lawsuits could be filed. It also encourages mediation. 
</P>
<P>
	It also seeks to limit frivolous lawsuits by capping punitive  
damages for small businesses, narrowing the sphere of class action 
lawsuits and ensuring that, in most cases, defendants will be held 
liable only for the share of the damages they cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will serve to minimize the potential explosion in  
litigation that would discourage Y2K compliance efforts, hurt 
American consumers and weaken our economic growth,'' said Thomas J. 
Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House issued veto threats against the original bills  
that emerged from both the House and the Senate, saying they put 
too many restrictions on legal recourse for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House, while under pressure from consumer and  
legal groups to oppose the legislation, was also hearing from 
another powerful constituent, the high-tech industry, which keenly 
wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore  
became personally involved in negotiations to revise the bill to 
improve consumer protections and make it acceptable to the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this bill is critical to meet national priorities and  
the president is prepared to sign it into law because it is 
narrowly tailored to deal with litigation dealing with the Y2K 
problem,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will sign it. I don't think he'll sign it with  
enthusiasm,'' said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he too was supporting it reluctantly. He warned  
that small business groups that back it ``may have to eat their 
words'' because they could be in the greatest peril from losses 
incurred because of computer systems that fail because they can't 
differentiate the year 2000 date from 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	To meet consumer group concerns that lawmakers would use the Y2K  
bill as a wedge to bring about far broader legislation protecting 
business from product liability lawsuits, the Senate sponsors -- 
Sens. McCain, Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. -- 
included language that takes the bill off the books after three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also emphasized that this legislation was  
one-of-a-kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the normal course of business, the administration would  
oppose many of the extraordinary steps taken in this legislation to 
alter liability and procedural rules,'' White House chief of staff 
John Podesta wrote in a letter Wednesday. ``The Y2K problem is 
unique and unprecedented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Joan Claybrook of Public Citizen sharply criticized the  
White House for accepting the final compromise, saying it ``sells 
out consumers and small businesses in favor of high-tech and other 
business special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 775.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Begins Henley With a Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENLEY-ON-THAMES, England (AP) -- Harvard's eights crew began its  
Henley Regatta campaign by powering past Bristol University in the 
Temple Cup Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a seeded team, Harvard earned a bye into the second round and  
lived up to expectations, leading all the way against its English 
rival. Dartmouth's ``A'' crew also opened its Temple Cup bid with a 
three-lengths win over Cambridge's lightweight eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton added to the success of U.S. boats with a narrow win  
over University College of Cork, Ireland. Trinity College of 
Connecticut defeated England's Nottingham University by less than a 
length. 
</P>
<P>
	In an all-American race, St. Joseph's ``B'' crew of Philadelphia  
defeated Dartmouth's ``B'' crew by 2 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	But St. Joseph's ``A'' crew couldn't complete a double. After  
waiting four hours to repair its damaged boat, St. Joseph's lost by 
1 3/4 lengths to Nereus of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Princess Elizabeth Cup for schoolboy eights, three  
American crews lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Tabor Academy of Marion, Mass., led early before losing to  
Australia's St. Peter's College by 4 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	After hitting a marker buoy near the start, Boston's Noble and  
Greenough School also lost in the second round, by 2 1/2 lengths to 
local favorite Abingdon School. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent School of Connecticut lost to another Thames-based school,  
St. Paul's, by 2 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Britannia Cup for senior coxed fours, Worcester Tech of  
Massachusetts beat local club Eton Excelsior by five lengths, while 
Harvard lost to Oxford's Isis club by three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round of the Visitors Cup for university coxless  
fours, Fordham overhauled Edinburgh at the half-mile mark and won 
by a length. 
</P>
<P>
	North Allegheny High School from Pittsburgh was out following  
the junior quadruple scull crew's loss. Its departure also ended 
the participation of Henley's first-ever set of competing triplets. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron and Benjamin LeDonne raced in this quad crew, while their  
brother, Daniel, had been in the school's eight crew that was 
eliminated on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the same event, the Bachelors Barge Club of  
Philadelphia defeated King's School of Rochester and Prince Edward 
School of Zimbabwe by four feet -- the narrowest winning margin of 
the regatta so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round of the Double Sculls Challenge Cup, the  
U.S. team of Ian McGowan and Nick Peterson, racing as the Augusta 
Sculling Center, beat Dan De Bonis and Will Fisher from the New 
York Athletic Club by 3 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Aquila Abdullah of the Potomac Club of Washington D.C., beat  
Andrew van der Broek of England in an opening heat of the Diamond 
Sculls.

<HEADLINE> Marines Install Jones As Commandant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps' new top general is a veteran  
of both the jungles of Vietnam and the corridors of Congress, a 
military man who also happens to be fluent in French and trained in 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	He is Gen. James L. Jones Jr., a 32-year veteran of the Marine  
Corps who on Wednesday became its 32nd commandant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Corps is well,'' he declared simply, indicating he  
intended no major changes of direction for a service that has fared 
well during Gen. Charles C. Krulak's four years as leader of the 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	In an emotional change-of-command ceremony at the historic  
Marine Barracks -- the oldest post in the Marine Corps -- Defense 
Secretary William Cohen thanked Krulak for his tenure as 
commandant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The epic life of Chuck Krulak is one of brilliance and  
courage,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krulak's father is Victor H. ``Brute'' Krulak, a veteran of  
World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars who rose to the rank 
of Marine Corps lieutenant general but never held the top Marine 
post. The younger Krulak, who served two tours in Vietnam, became 
commandant in July 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Krulak's retirement means there will be no member of his family  
in the Marines for the first time in nearly 70 years. His son, 
David, is a lieutenant in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to an audience of active and retired military  
officers, members of Congress and Marine families, Krulak quoted 
his father on the importance of maintaining public confidence in 
the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We flourish today ... not because of what we know we are, or  
what we know we can do, but because of what the grassroots of our 
country believes we are and believes we can do,'' Krulak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krulak rejected the notion advanced by some critics that the  
Marines have become too isolated from American society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we do stand a breed apart, we have not lost touch  
with the American people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 55, had been Cohen's personal military aide until  
President Clinton nominated him to be commandant. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's friendship with Jones began in the early 1980s when  
Cohen was a senator from Maine and Jones was the Marine liaison 
officer to the Senate. When Cohen became defense secretary in 
January 1997 he made Jones -- then the Marines' deputy chief of 
staff for plans -- his senior military assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a native of Kansas City, Mo., but spent his formative  
years in France. He returned to the United States to attend the 
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, where he received 
a degree in diplomacy in 1966. He was commissioned a second 
lieutenant in the Marines in January 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, as commanding officer of the 24th Marine Expeditionary  
Unit, Jones helped carry out Operation Provide Comfort, the 
U.S.-led humanitarian mission to protect and resettle Kurdish 
refugees in northern Iraq and Turkey after the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his personal decorations: the Silver Star Medal and a  
Bronze Star Medal with combat ``V'' for valor.

<HEADLINE> EU Opposed to Ocalan Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's prime minister on Thursday  
brushed aside European criticisms of a death sentence against 
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying efforts to influence 
the courts could produce a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union's 15 member nations, all of which have  
abolished the death penalty, have warned that hanging the rebel 
leader would hurt Turkey's bid to join EU. 
</P>
<P>
	``The European Union has not even accepted us as a member,''  
said Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. ``We are not in the position to 
take any political decision to please the European Union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan was sentenced to death Tuesday, convicted of treason for  
leading a Kurdish rebellion. Death penalties in Turkey are 
automatically appealed. If the verdict is upheld, parliament and 
President Suleyman Demirel also must approve it. Turkey has not 
executed anyone since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit warned that ``those who try to influence the legal  
proceedings in Turkey will meet with opposition from Turkish public 
opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey's ties with the EU were strained after the group told  
Ankara in 1997 that it must improve its human rights record and 
resolve its disputes with Greece, an EU member, before joining. 
Turkey responded by saying it would not discuss its internal 
affairs, including human rights, with the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Ecevit said his government was pressing for a  
law aimed at encouraging Kurdish rebels to come down from their 
mountain hideouts and surrender their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``repentance law,'' would grant lenient punishment  
to rebels who surrender and give information to security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	But hours later, Ecevit withdrew the draft law from parliament  
after his far-right coalition partners said they would not support 
it, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Sevket Bulent Yahnici, deputy leader of the Nationalist Movement  
Party, said such a law would have little public support. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-right party has opposed any concessions to the rebels in  
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit said the proposed law would help defeat Ocalan's  
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a 15-year 
war for autonomy in Turkey's southeast. Ocalan is not expected to 
benefit from such a law. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the PKK in Brussels refused to comment on the  
proposal until the full details were known. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish security forces have been successful in pushing the  
rebels from urban areas into the rugged mountains of the southeast, 
but fighting has continued. The rebels have threatened to increase 
attacks if Ocalan is hanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is widespread pressure to hang Ocalan, a public  
debate over the death sentence intensified Thursday with many 
analysts arguing that hanging the guerrilla leader would harm 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts urged the government to grant cultural rights to  
the Kurds, a call the PKK repeatedly has made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state should ... meet the language, broadcasting and  
education demands of its citizens of Kurdish origin,'' wrote 
commentator Tuncay Ozkan for the newspaper Radikal. ``It is not 
Abdullah Ocalan, it is the issues discussed behind his name that 
are important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasting or teaching in Kurdish is illegal. Speaking the  
language was only legalized in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Wednesday arrested 10 Kurdish militants who were  
allegedly preparing to stage bomb attacks to protest Ocalan's 
conviction, the Anatolia news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said 40 bombs were seized in operations in slum areas  
of Istanbul where Kurds live.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Mayor Hopes To Lure NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mayor Oscar Goodman says the ``Field of  
Dreams'' axiom might just work in wooing an NBA franchise to this 
gambling capital and rejuvenating downtown's Glitter Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman will head a committee to study possible construction of  
a sports arena in the downtown area and efforts to woo a NBA 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this could be the beginning of transforming downtown  
into the city of the millennium,'' Goodman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman won election to a four-year term last month on a  
populist platform that included rebuilding a downtown area that has 
taken a back seat to the booming Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirage Resorts Inc. chairman Steve Wynn met with 100 business  
and civic leaders Wednesday to announce the results of a survey 
showing Las Vegans would support a sports stadium and performing 
arts center. The same survey showed residents would support an NBA 
or NHL team if local interests were able to obtain a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn said any sports team was likely to lose money, and local  
hotel-casino owners didn't need to own a team as an ego trip. 
Still, he said he wanted to gauge local support for such a team. He 
said he had met with NBA commissioner David Stern and some club 
owners to determine their interest in a local franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Brienza, NBA vice president of media relations, said Wynn  
and Stern met a couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely not uncommon for David to take meetings if  
requested by people who are interested in doing business with the 
NBA or looking at the prospects of buying a team,'' Brienza said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the league has no present plans for expansion, and any  
expansion or franchise transfer would have to approved by the NBA 
board of governors, which consists of one representative of each 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman used the ``Field of Dreams'' axiom -- ``If you build it,  
they will come'' -- to suggest support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, if you build the arena, they (professional  
clubs) will knock each other out on the way to come to it,'' 
Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor is heading a committee to study the idea of building  
an arena and-or performing arts center on part of a 178-acre tract 
that has long been a railroad switching yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``That piece of land is a jewel and in large part will control  
the growth of downtown,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said he didn't see Las Vegas' role as the nation's  
gambling capital being a problem in obtaining an NBA team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to circumvent any problems,'' Goodman said,  
citing appearances by the UNLV basketball team in the NCAA playoffs 
over the years. ``They just took those games off the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada is the only state in the nation with legal sports  
betting. State law does not allow betting on games involving Nevada 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's meeting, political consultant Frank Luntz of  
Arlington, Va., presented a summary showing that a pro sports team 
would receive wide support in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Luntz said a survey of 580 Las Vegas area residents showed 93  
percent would support a sports arena and the professional sports 
team it might draw. He said 87 percent would support a performing 
arts center in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn's wife, Elaine, a director of Mirage Resorts and longtime  
activist in the arts, said building a performing arts center would 
help fulfill ``the quest to make Las Vegas a sophisticated, 
well-rounded environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Las Vegas is ``the last large city of its size not to  
have any professional sports team associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynn said he felt Las Vegas would be a strong candidate for a  
sports franchise in light of its 1.2 million population and the 
fact the city draws some 500,000 visitors weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Goodman reiterated his opposition to local  
taxpayers funding a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to be one of the key items in our discussions,''  
Goodman said of the financing. He said there are many ways to fund 
the project ``without burdening the taxpayers,'' such as a room tax 
or airport tax.

<HEADLINE> Boy Kills Little Brother by Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Mimicking a wrestling move he had watched on  
television, a boy accidentally killed his younger brother during 
horseplay, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-year-old victim died from brain swelling. His 7-year-old  
brother will not face any criminal charges, law officers said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he pushed his brother down ... and said he'd seen it  
on wrestling on TV,'' said police Lt. Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
	The older brother, asked to demonstrate what he had done, backed  
up about 10 feet and ran toward a police detective who was holding 
up a doll about the same size as the 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, as he neared the doll, thrust one arm out at shoulder  
level and forcefully struck the doll at its neck, knocking it 
backward, said Detective Dan Lesher. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jeffrey Barnard, Dallas County's chief medical examiner,  
ruled the May 27 death an accident caused by trauma to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we were going to serve society very well if we  
had ruled it a homicide,'' he said. ``But I think the public and 
parents need to realize some of the adverse effects of those 
wrestling shows.''

<HEADLINE> Racing's Jack Marlin Jr. Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Former stock car driver Jack Marlin Jr.,  
brother of retired NASCAR driver Coo Coo Marlin and uncle of 
current competitor Sterling Marlin, died. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Wednesday of an undisclosed illness at Claiborne Hughes  
Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlin helped his brother get started in racing by letting Coo  
Coo use his name, when Coo Coo was underage and couldn't race 
legally. Jack Marlin finished second to his brother in NASCAR's 
Southern 300 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Remarks by President Clinton and Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak, as transcribed by the federal Clearing 
House: 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Good afternoon. I'm delighted to welcome President  
Mubarak back to the White House. He is our long time partner in 
building a safer and more peaceful world. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, we now have a real chance to move the peace process  
forward in the Middle East. Egypt has been central to that process 
and to all the progress which has been made since the Camp David 
accords over 20 years ago. Egypt will continue to play a leading 
role to address the important tasks ahead, building on Oslo, Wye 
River implementation, reaching a permanent status agreement between 
Palestinians and Israelis, widening the circle of peace to include 
agreements with Syria and Lebanon; revitalizing talks between 
Israel and the Arab world on a host of other important issues, from 
the environment to water resources to refugees to economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	There are, to be sure, major challenges ahead. But the will of  
the people for peace is strong. 
</P>
<P>
	President Mubarak and I also discussed our common determination  
to fight terrorism in all its forms. 
</P>
<P>
	With regard to the peace process, let me just say one other  
thing. The best way for the Israelis to have lasting security is a 
negotiated peace based on mutual respect. That is also the best way 
for Palestinians to shape their own future on their own land. A 
negotiated peace is the best way for all the people of the region 
to realize their aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me just say also that over the last two decades, under  
President Mubarak's leadership, Egypt has done much to fulfill the 
aspirations of its people. Economic growth has been strong and 
sustained. Inflation has been held in check. GDP per person has 
increased by a factor of five. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt is building a modern infrastructure in roads, power  
plants, communications systems. Civil society has grown with work 
ahead to strengthen it so that all Egyptians participate in 
building a better future. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons for all this progress, two stand out -- both  
advanced by President Mubarak's wise leadership. First, Israel -- 
excuse me -- Egypt's deepening peace with Israel that has freed 
resources and energies of the people. A broader regional peace will 
be good for prosperity, for progress and for freedom. Second, 
Egypt's economic reform, with expansion of the private sector and 
free markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The work of President Mubarak and Vice President Gore on our  
U.S.-Egypt partnership for growth and development, which they will 
advance later today, has been crucial. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is committed to continuing the reforms and America  
will continue to help. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, we discussed a number of other issues. I'd like to  
mention just one -- Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	I am profoundly grateful to Egypt for supporting the stand taken  
by NATO. Already more than half the refugees have returned to 
Kosovo. There is still much work to do and I thank Egypt for its 
commitment to provide Egyptian police officers for the civilian 
police implementation force there. 
</P>
<P>
	But we have made a powerful statement together. The future  
belongs to those who reconcile human differences, not those who 
exploit them. The future belongs to those who respect human rights, 
not those who destroy people because of their religion, their race 
or their ethnic background. 
</P>
<P>
	I hope we can carry some of the momentum from what we have  
achieved in Kosovo to the Middle East as we seek there to promote 
tolerance and a durable peace. As we do, the leadership of 
President Mubarak, as always, will be critical. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, welcome. The floor is yours. Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I was very  
pleased to see my friend President Clinton and exchange views with 
him on matters of common concern. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, our talks this morning reflected the similarity and  
the convergence of our views. 
</P>
<P>
	We value our solid friendship with this great nation and  
consider it one of the pillars of our policy. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, we have been working together in order to bring  
about peace and reconciliation in the Middle East. President 
Clinton has been playing an active and a very effective role. Under 
his leadership, the American contribution to the cause of peace has 
reached a new high. His continued involvement is appreciated by 
those of us who are committed to peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months ahead we are looking forward to reviving the peace  
process, which has been stalled for some time. Unfortunately, 
valuable time has been wasted. Today, there's an opportunity which 
should not be missed. We should work closely with the U.S. and to 
coordinate our joint efforts in order to have the parties break the 
stalemate and the stalled movement towards peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent events indicate that most of the regions inhabitants are  
yearning for peace. We should be working with President Assad, 
Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat, respectively with a view 
to creating the necessary atmosphere for resuming the peace process 
without delay. I'll be meeting with each of them in the near future 
for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreements which have been signed on the Palestinian track must  
be implemented fully and in (inaudible). 
</P>
<P>
	Provocative actions, especially settlement activities, should be  
stopped altogether. This will pave the way for starting final 
status negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In (inaudible), negotiations should be resumed on the Syrian  
track. There are signs that the ground is favorable for that. It 
would be a mistake to assume that movement should be confined one 
track at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress on each track facilitates movement on the other. The  
goal is to achieve just, comprehensive and stable peace in the 
whole area. In the context, we were alarmed by the recent Israeli 
bombing of civilian targets in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Such actions only poison the atmosphere in the region. They  
create an erosion of the people's confidence in the process at a 
time when we are working hard to encourage the parties to take 
confidence-building measures. We call upon Israel to apply maximum 
self-restraint in the crucial months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	As tangible progress is achieved towards peace, we can work for  
enhancing cooperation and interaction in the region. Egypt was the 
country that initiated the peace process, and we remain most 
willing and determined to do all we can to help bridge the gaps and 
restore confidence between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
	We have also discussed some other regional and international  
problems, notably African issues, as well as matters related to 
cooperation between countries of north and south. I commended 
President Clinton on the success of the American role in bringing 
about peace and security in Kosovo. We hope that the events that 
took place in that part of the world will convince all those 
concerned of the necessity to abide by the rule of law and respect 
the human rights of all peoples. 
</P>
<P>
	We are aware of the fact that much has to be done to help  
refugees and to prevent any recurrence of ethnic, religious, or 
culture violent conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: On our part, we will contribute to the international  
force that is being assigned the task of maintaining security and 
order in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	As we are about to enter a new era with the dawning of the new  
millennium, we must spare no effort in our quest for peace and 
security. For all nations, global problems that threaten the future 
of mankind ought to be addressed with vigor and determination. In 
all these endeavors, we shall cooperate with our partners and 
friends, among whom the U.S. figures very prominently. 
</P>
<P>
	Our bilateral cooperation is expanding every year, and it will  
continue to grow. It is a goal both of us are committed to. The 
Clinton administration has done much in this respect, and the 
president's personal involvement in this process was and continues 
to be most appreciated by the Egyptian people. 
</P>
<P>
	Before I conclude, I would like to extend a message of  
friendship and affection to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Thank you, Mr. President. Now, as is our practice, we  
will alternate between American and Egyptian journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: President Clinton, do you have any new ideas for  
breaking the stalemate in the Middle East? And with the advent of 
our own Independence Day, when do you think Lebanon will be free 
and independent and rid of a longtime occupation? 
</P>
<P>
	President Mubarak, do you think the new Israeli government will  
make a gesture toward halting the settlements? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, let me answer the questions you asked me first.  
</P>
<P>
	I do think that the time is right, but I think that before I  
advance publicly any ideas I should have a chance to meet with the 
prime minister-elect, Mr. Barak. He, according to the reports in 
the press this morning, he has constituted a government on quite a 
broad base, which should give him more freedom of movement to move 
aggressively ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Our role traditionally has been to try to create the conditions  
and provide the support necessary for the parties to make peace. 
And I expect that he will have ideas of his about that. And so I 
think that it -- the appropriate thing for me at the moment is to 
look forward to our meeting, which I hope will occur in the near 
future, and then after that, after I talk with him, to make 
whatever statements are called for at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the questions of Lebanon, I think our position on that  
has always been clear. We believe that a comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East should include not only an agreement with the 
Palestinians and an agreement with the Syrians, but also an 
agreement which includes Lebanon and promotes its independence and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: That question about the settlements you mean? I think  
the time now is viewed as at least to improve the atmosphere in the 
area, to stop building the settlements now until the negotiations 
start, and then the Palestinians and the Israelis could sit and 
find out what could be done. This is, I mean, a step for improving 
the atmosphere between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Thank you. The president -- the question is for  
President Clinton. I would like to follow up on Helen's question on 
the settlements. President Clinton, in 1991 when you first was 
running for the presidency, you made a pledge never to criticize 
Israel publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	However, your administration expressed its dissatisfaction with  
Israel's settlement activities by describing them as an obstacle to 
peace. However, 23 new settlements have been built since the 
signing of the Wye River accord. Would you be willing -- your 
administration would be willing to tell Israel to stop building the 
settlements -- the Israeli government to stop building the 
settlements and undo the wrong that has been done. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I think our position on the settlements has been  
clear. We don't believe that unilateral actions by any parties, 
including other interested parties like the United States, which 
compromise the capacity of the parties to the Oslo Accord to reach 
agreement on final-status issues, should be taken, and that 
includes provocative settlement actions. We've made that clear and 
unambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
	But I do not believe -- the Israel people just had a huge  
election, a big election, and they voted in very large percentages 
in ways that almost every commentator had concluded -- sent the 
signal that they were ready to pursue the peace process to its 
conclusion. They now have a prime minister-elect who has just 
completed his government. He is coming to see me in the next few 
days. I think the less I say until I see him, and until we see if 
we can embrace a common posture toward making the peace, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	But my views on the settlement question are well known and have  
not changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes?  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, Governor Bush has raised a  
record-breaking $36 million, more than 10 times his closest rival 
for the Republican nomination. Do you think he's wrapped up the 
nomination or is wrapping it up? And if decides not to accept 
federal campaign money and the spending limits that go with it, as 
appears increasingly likely, do you think that would be a blow to 
campaign finance reform? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, I don't want to get into being a  
political handicapper, so I can't say -- how do I know what the 
Republicans are going to do in their nominating process. I don't 
have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
	But I would make two observations. First of all, the leadership  
of the Republican Party in general are unanimously hostile to 
campaign finance reform. They don't believe in it. And so he -- if 
he did that, he would have that in common with the other leaders 
who won't permit us to bring the McCain-Feingold bill to a vote, or 
to try to pursue what I believe are needed changes in the campaign 
finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	So, that is one thing that is -- that's just where they are, and  
they're very forthright about it. And the American people are going 
to have to make up their minds whether this is an important issue 
to them or not. 
</P>
<P>
	But I would say -- I would make one point generally. I think the  
most valuable commodity in an election in a democracy in which you 
will cover the candidates extensively, even more valuable than 
money, is ideas. And I think the most important thing, therefore, 
that I have seen in this election so far is that Vice President 
Gore is, as nearly as I can determine, the only candidate of either 
party who has yet actually told the American people what he would 
do if he got elected. 
</P>
<P>
	And I think if you look at the 1998 elections, for example, it's  
a good example that in a democracy which has a vigorous media 
publicizing what people are doing and saying, money may be 
important, but ideas are even more important. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: My first question is for President Mubarak. You've  
been suggesting for sometime the preparation of a world summit on 
terrorism. Did you discuss your ideas on this issue with President 
Clinton? And Mr. President, do you have a specific plan for dealing 
with this international threat? And for you, President Clinton, to 
carry on with the peace process -- how do you plan to work, really, 
on the peace process as you approach the next best, and maybe the 
happiest, 18 months in the Clinton Administration? 
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, being at peace would be a good start.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	Go ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: Really, I've fully discussed this issue about the  
international terrorism with the president, as well as I have 
discussed it with other heads of state, but mainly here with 
President Clinton I raised this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm saying that in the coming century, the most dangerous  
element is not the war, not this or that. It's terrorism spreading 
all over the world. Sometimes when the terrorism starts, when I 
start speaking about terrorism sometime. ... Now, terrorism is 
spreading everywhere in the world. It's a very dangerous phenomena. 
(Inaudible) summit, and it's well prepared before it, I think the 
whole world will suffer from terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	War is much more easier than terrorism. Terrorism, you never  
know when that is going to take place. But war, it's planned and 
know its limits. That's why I discuss with the president, and hope 
that we could reach a summit, and before the summit there should be 
very thorough preparation with the technical group to see what kind 
of agreement could be reached in the whole world under the UN. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: We discussed this issue quite extensively, and this has  
been a subject of great concern to me, and it's one thing we've 
shared over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago I gave a speech at the United Nations, at the  
opening session, about terrorism, and I asked that we focus on it. 
</P>
<P>
	We have asked the Congress to provide substantial resources to  
look into what else we can do to fight terrorism, to deal with the 
threats of biological and chemical weapons and the prospect that 
they might get into the hands of terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	We have to consider the prospect and the future that, as the  
president said, the most serious security threats to nations will 
not be from other nations but from terrorists groups across 
national borders, and it may well form presently unprecedented 
allegiances with other illegal groups, organized crime groups, drug 
traffickers, weapons profiteers. 
</P>
<P>
	And so I think that all the nations of the world that are  
interested in stability and peace for their people are going to 
have to have a much higher level of cooperation on these issues. 
And so I'm for doing anything that can be done to increase that. 
</P>
<P>
	Now you asked me about the Middle East process. Let me just say  
again, our role has never been to dictate to either party the terms 
of the peace. Even though we have many Arab-Americans and many 
Jewish-Americans in this country, we do not live in the Middle 
East. The people of the Middle East live there, and they have to 
work out the terms of their own reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	What we have always tried to is to keep the parties working  
together and then to do whatever was necessary to provide the 
support that the friends of peace need, and then to -- and if the 
process seemed in danger of failing, as it did before the Wye River 
nine-and-a-half days and sleepless nights, to do what could be done 
to keep it alive. But I think that the people of Israel have sent 
us a loud message that they want the process to be kept alive and 
they want it to be seen through. 
</P>
<P>
	So, we're in a period of transition now. Let's let the prime  
minister, the new prime minister-elect, get his government in 
place, take office, come to see me, talk to President Mubarak, talk 
to all the other parties and see where we go from there. 
</P>
<P>
	But those of us who are friends of the peace process in the  
Middle East should focus on successful resolution of it. And 
sometimes the less we say in public, the more likely we are to have 
a positive impact on the outcome of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: On Northern Ireland?  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Larry. Yes, I'll take an Irish question, but go ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: President Clinton, as you're aware, there have been  
reports of tension between you and Vice President Gore. And I 
wondered, you know, if you could comment on your relationship? And 
are you resigned as the campaign goes on that inevitably you're 
going to be at odds on certain issues and disagree with the vice 
president? And for that matter, assuming your wife decides to run 
for the Senate, perhaps on Medicare and New York issues? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, that's a substantive question. I'll be glad to  
answer that if you want. But let me say, I have been, frankly, 
bewildered by those reports. Only one person ever asked me about it 
directly, one of your number, and that was Wolf Blitzer in an 
interview I did before I left for my European trip. And I -- at the 
G-8 -- I gave him a very good answer, which was that I thought that 
the vice president had done a good job in his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	And I thought the most important thing he's done, and I'll say  
again, is to tell the American people what he would do if he got 
the job, and to pose the choice that I think is before them, which 
is do you want to go beyond and -- build on and go beyond the 
successful direction of the last six and a half years, or would you 
like to turn around and go back and take a different course? 
</P>
<P>
	And so I think he's doing fine. And I honestly do not know what  
the source of the stories are, but they are not in heart or my 
mind. You know, I want him to get out there, and if he disagrees 
with a decision that I make as president during the next year and a 
half, then of course he will have to say so, and I will take no 
offense at that. 
</P>
<P>
	And if my wife decides to run for senator from New York, then  
some of the disagreements that we've had in the past over decisions 
I've made as president, she may be constrained to state publicly 
because they'll be relevant to the future. And that's the way 
democracy works. 
</P>
<P>
	You know members of a political party, whether Democrats or  
Republicans, belong to the political party because they share a 
general set of values and a general approach and because they agree 
on almost all things, not because they agree on all things. It 
would be a dreary world indeed if we all agreed on everything. 
</P>
<P>
	And I didn't ask Al Gore to become vice president so that he  
would agree with me about everything. Nobody with a fine mind and a 
lot of experience and looking at the world we live in would agree 
with anyone else with the same qualities on every issue. It just 
wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Now on the merits, let me say on this Medicare issue, there have  
been many people --- not just in New York with the teaching 
hospitals -- but there are rural hospitals; there are home therapy 
providers; there are others who have felt that the budget savings 
--- the cuts in the '97 Balanced Budget Act -- were too severe and 
made it difficult for them to maintain quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	One such group are the teaching hospitals. There are a lot of  
them in New York who take care of a lot of poor people, but there 
are a lot of them in Massachusetts; a lot of them in California; 
and there's at least one in every state in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	When we put out our Medicare plan, we therefore did not continue  
all of the cost savings in the '97 Balanced Budget Act beyond the 
period when they run out. We actually left some of them off to try 
to alleviate that pressure. The second thing we did was to create a 
fund -- a quality fund -- of about $7.5 billion which the Congress 
can use to debate and allocate to alleviate present problems. 
</P>
<P>
	So I would encourage the senators from New York or anyone else  
who's concerned about this to bring those concerns, bring the facts 
to the table, get it out in the open, then embrace the idea of 
Medicare reform, pass that fund, and then allocate it as it should 
be allocated. Because I do think that's a legitimate issue. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: For President Mubarak: Have you discussed the issue of  
Iraq and how close ... American and Egyptian positions are? 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate you on your success in  
resolving Kosovo. And from your statement you referred to it as one 
of the criteria for success is that you if you have no refugees. 
(OFF-MIKE) refugees -- Kosovars to their homes. Will you use the 
same criteria in the Middle East that the Palestinian refugees and 
displaced will come back to their homes? 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: That's really good. That's really good.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	You called on him.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: I didn't know what was the question.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	Really, for the first part of the question about Iraq, really,  
our position didn't change at all. We are looking forward how to 
help the people of Iraq under any circumstances. I have discussed 
this with the president and that ... resolution and I think may be 
some improvement in it in the near future, mainly to help the 
people of Iraq for medicine, food and other things. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Let me say, our position on Iraq is that we favor the  
proposal before the United Nations advanced by the British and the 
Dutch. It would provide for more money to Iraq to help the people 
there with their human needs, but it would maintain a vigorous arms 
control regime because we do not believe that Saddam Hussein should 
be permitted to develop again weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	And I would remind everyone that he has actually used weapons of  
mass destruction. He has used chemical weapons on the Iranians. He 
has used them on his own people, on the Kurds that live in Iraq. So 
I think that we have a balanced position. 
</P>
<P>
	But I have never wanted the Iraqi people to suffer because of  
their leader. And I think we have -- we have supported a relaxation 
of the way the funds flow there so that more can go to benefit the 
people. But I do not believe we should give up on an attempt, an 
insistence indeed, that the United Nations in return for this 
maintain an arms control regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, on the refugee question, let me say one brief question  
about Kosovo, because I do appreciate the interest in Kosovo in 
Egypt and in other countries of the region. About half the refugees 
have gone home. They're dying to go home. And one of the reasons 
that NATO was determined to act is we knew if we acted quickly 
enough that the refugees could go home and most of them would wish 
to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in Bosnia where the war went on from -- the conflict from  
1991 until 1995, there were many people who had established other 
lives and other places and did not want to go home. There are still 
a lot of refugees who have not gone home in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	So, I'm delighted that the Kosovars are pouring in. The truth is  
that we've actually tried to slow it down a little bit because 
we're worried about the land mines and other explosives which might 
be there and we want it to be safe for them, and because we're 
trying to get organized to help everybody rebuild their homes and 
the basic infrastructure of life so that once they do go home they 
can actually live and do well. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, that brings it back to the refugee question you asked in  
the Middle East. I think that the important thing is, if we have 
the right kind of peace agreement -- that's why I say, you know, no 
one can accuse me of dodging Middle East questions. I've been up to 
my ears and eyeballs in this peace process since the day I took 
office. But if you just look at it as a practical matter, the 
agreement that is made in the end, whether refugees go home depends 
in part on how long they've been away and whether they wish to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also depend on what the nature of the settlement is,  
what -- how much land will the Palestinians have, where will it be, 
how does it correspond to where people lived before. 
</P>
<P>
	And I would like it if the Palestinian people felt free and were  
free to live wherever they like, wherever they want to live. I 
would also like it very much if we could help those countries which 
have born a heavy burden, particularly Jordan, where a majority of 
the population is now Palestinian, to build a better life for the 
people who are there. 
</P>
<P>
	Because they have a lot of very serious economic challenges.  
They have a fine new king, who is a able person, and we -- we're 
trying to help and we want others to help ... but I think it will 
depend upon the refugees themselves and will depend upon the shape 
of the final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, Northern Ireland?  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Ask the Irish question if you want.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Thank you, sir. Several questions on Northern Ireland.  
</P>
<P>
	What is the latest update you can give us about your activities?  
Do you plan to make an emergency trip over there? Do you blame 
either side for the impasse? And what constructive suggestions can 
you convey to us at this juncture? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well I have been, for the last couple of days  
particularly, we've been in virtually constant contact with the 
parties there. And I spent a lot of time on it yesterday and late, 
late last night and this morning, early. They are in negotiations 
as we speak. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood seems to be reasonably positive and they are exploring  
some new ideas. I offered my suggestions for possible resolution of 
the sticking points, with the benefit of all the folks on our 
national security team who've been working on that. 
</P>
<P>
	And I'll say this: it is a very difficult problem for the  
parties, but it will be very hard for the world to understand if 
this breaks off, since they have -- everyone's agreed to the 
fundamental elements of the Good Friday agreement. Both sides agree 
that they have to comply with every bit of it. There was an 
election where the Irish people voted for it. Then there was an 
election where the Irish people voted for leaders under it. 
</P>
<P>
	So if you have a situation where you've had two elections  
ratifying the peace agreement, and you have all the leaders saying 
that we all have to comply with every element of it, and it falls 
apart over sequencing, I think that it would be -- to call it a 
tragedy would be a gross understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is a very difficult thing, and it would take 30 minutes  
to go through the whole litany of why. But they are working now. 
They are exploring some new ideas, and they do seem determined to 
work it through to a positive conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Would you like to take one more?  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: President Clinton, you talked about the  
nine-and-a-half days in the Wye Plantation. We know you tried, God 
knows you tried, but you failed, sir. 
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	What makes you think that...  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: I got an agreement. It wasn't my job to implement it.  
It has not been fully implemented. The agreement itself was a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: That's correct, sir, but...  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: That's all right. They tell me I fail every day. It's  
quite all right. 
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Your officials...  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: You just saved them the trouble today. Go ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Your officials used to speak about CBM,  
confidence-building measures. ... Even Netanyahu thanked Arafat at 
one stage. But you were -- let's say you failed in convincing the 
Israelis to reciprocate and do the same. What makes you feel that 
this time around you'll be more successful, sir? 
</P>
<P>
	My question to President Mubarak, sir, how does Egypt view any  
external interference in Iraqi internal affairs from whatever 
source it comes? Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Let me make a...  
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: You didn't say that I failed also this time.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Yes. The -- yeah, they zinged you this time. Let me say,  
I think, with regard to Wye, obviously I think its conditions 
should be honored, because it's like any agreement between two 
parties, unless one party -- unless both parties agree that the 
agreement should be modified, then it should be honored. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe that historians, when they look back on this period,  
will conclude that the principal difficulty that Mr. Netanyahu had 
was the nature of his coalition, because it was small enough, his 
majority was so small, and it included people who were so hostile 
to the peace process, that no matter what he tried to do they could 
always threaten to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the reason I think it will be different now is, number one,  
Prime Minister-elect Barak was a much more open and heartfelt 
supporter of the Oslo process. He has, you remember, I think his 
first public event after his election was to visit the grave side 
of our friend Prime Minister Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
	But number two, he got a big vote from the people of Israel,  
with peace being the major issue. And number three, he has 
constituted a government, apparently from the morning press, with 
quite a large voting majority in the Knesset, obviously geared 
toward the peace process because the parties have deep differences 
in his coalition over domestic policies, unrelated to the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	So for those reasons, I think the chances of success are now  
greater. And therefore I think that all of us should try to 
restrain our comments about specifics until we talk to the prime 
minister-elect and we can form a common strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: Concerning the interference in the general affairs of  
Iraq, you know our principle from the beginning. We never interfere 
in the internal affairs of Iraq. If there is any change in the 
government of Iraq, it should come from internally, not from 
outside. This is our principle, which has been adopted all our life 
with any country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: One more. Go ahead. I'll give you a question.  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, when you were asked about George W.  
Bush and Republicans a few moments ago, you deferred, pleading 
ignorance. Perhaps I could ask you about the Democrats. When you 
said that Al Gore is the only one in the race on either side of the 
party who has been talking about ideas, clearly that represents a 
dig not merely at the Republican candidates but also former Senator 
Bill Bradley as well. 
</P>
<P>
	So let me ask you about his candidacy, sir, if I may. Number  
one, do you believe that he's as qualified as is the vice president 
to be president of the United States? And number two, how do you 
explain, in your own mind, when you heard the figures yesterday, 
showing that the vice president raised less money than he'd hoped 
for and Bill Bradley appears to have raised more? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, I'm not going to talk about their  
fund raising because I don't think I should be a political 
handicapper. But anyone who understands Senator Bradley's career 
and life story would not be particularly surprised by this. I 
certainly wasn't. And I don't think it's accurate to say the vice 
president's raised less money than he had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other question, it wasn't a dig at Senator Bradley. He  
has said himself that he has not laid out his case for being 
president and said that he wants to wait until the fall to do it. 
That's what he said. I'm not digging him. I have nothing bad to say 
about him. That's a fact. 
</P>
<P>
	But I personally have always believed that you should begin by  
saying why you want the job because you're asking people to hire 
you to do things. 
</P>
<P>
	So -- and I think the vice president deserves a lot of credit for  
doing that. That's my only -- that's my view. 
</P>
<P>
	But you can't read as a dig at Senator Bradley because he  
himself said, 'In the fall I will tell you what it is I intend to 
do.' 
</P>
<P>
	That's his position.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: (inaudible)  
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I don't think -- I think the question -- the  
American people will have to decide who's qualified and who's not. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nobody in the race who is running or who could run who  
has had as much experience in as many different ways. He's had both 
legislative experience and executive experience. 
</P>
<P>
	And besides that, he's been a journalist, the vice president.  
You've got to think that counts for something. 
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	And so he's been a journalist, he's been in the executive  
branch, he's been in the legislative branch. he has vast experience 
in foreign policy and arms control issues, and vast experience in 
domestic policy, and maybe even more important than experience, the 
ideas that he's advanced have made America a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	I mean, so, if results counts and experience counts, then he has  
quite a good resume. And I don't have to make comparative judgments 
about the other candidates to say that. No one has anything like 
that level of experience with that level of positive impact on the 
people of our country. Those are just I think indisputable facts. 
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: How about one more (question)?  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: I have a question for President Mubarak and one for  
President Clinton. Sir, at this moment, Prime Minister-elect Barak 
is forming his government in Israel. What should be, with so little 
time before the next American elections -- which are just around the 
corner -- what would be. ... 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Seventeen months?  
</P>
<P>
	(LAUGHTER)   	
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: What would be perhaps the one thing or one message you  
would direct towards Mr. Barak as a step that should be taken as 
son as possible to revive the peace process? And President Clinton, 
your comment on President Mubarak's statement? 
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: Is the question directed to me?  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Yes. First, your excellency.  
</P>
<P>
	MUBARAK: I think I have already mentioned that in the comments I  
started with that there should be some steps to make that feel much 
far better, and to start the peace process. Eighteen months is 
quite a lot. We could achieve in one year so many things. The peace 
process have already started years and years ago. The Palestinians 
have signed some agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mr. Barak, and I'm sure that he's going to do it, starts  
implementing the Wye agreement, for example -- makes some steps for 
the settlements -- I think the process will move. And we hope that 
we could finish or reach a final status in one year. One year and a 
half is quite a lot of time for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Yes, I agree with that. It doesn't have anything to do  
with the time left I have on my term. My advice would be -- let me 
go back to 1993 when I became president. Our biggest problem was 
the domestic economy was not doing well and we had a $290 billion 
deficit. And we -- there was no easy way to close it. And we made 
... we presented an economic plan to the Congress that passed by 
only one vote in both Houses. It was very controversial. It was 
very difficult. But I think it -- in that sense -- politically, 
internally -- was perhaps more controversial than making -- than in 
Israel going forward with the peace process may be now, given the 
vote in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
	I think it's better -- if you know you've got to do something  
without which you cannot succeed in serving your people in the long 
run, it's better to do it sooner rather than later, generally. That 
is generally true. 
</P>
<P>
	And if it is going to be difficult and there are tough  
consequences, it's better to take them early rather than later. 
That is just a general rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it's -- otherwise if you don't do it, you may never get  
around to doing it, but it won't get any better. It'll just get 
worse and worse and worse. So it's better to just take a deep 
breath and go on and do what you think has to be done. That's what 
I believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Maloofs Gain Control of NBA's Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The Maloof family officially gained a  
controlling interest of the Sacramento Kings and Arco Arena from 
Jim Thomas on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Board of Governors approved the ownership change on May  
7 and it went into effect Thursday. The Albuquerque family, headed 
by brothers Joe and Gavin Maloof, already has been exerting control 
over the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very exciting day for the Maloof family,'' Joe  
Maloof, president of the Maloof Companies, said during a signing 
ceremony in Los Angeles. ``We are proud to rejoin the NBA family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family, which owned the Houston Rockets from 1979 to  
1982, purchased a one-quarter interest in the Kings last year for 
$37.5 million, with an option to purchase the rest of Thomas' 53 
percent interest within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is a Los Angeles-based developer who purchased the team  
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maloof family owns the Fiesta Casino Hotel in North Las  
Vegas, Nev. Their other holdings include a beer distributorship in 
Albuquerque and several banks, a transportation company and other 
businesses operating in New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings had their first winning season this year since Thomas  
bought the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we bought the team we weren't looking for a winner, but  
looking to help make a winner. We're used to being the underdog, 
but we are also used to coming out on top,'' Joe Maloof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas restructured the team's finances two years ago by  
obtaining a $70 million loan from the city, secured by the 
franchise and the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs and the Sacramento Knights indoor  
soccer team are included in the ownership transfer to the Maloof 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe and Gavin Maloof are two young, energetic and hard-working  
men and will continue to transform the Sacramento Kings into a 
successful, nationally admired franchise,'' Sacramento Mayor Joe 
Serna said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton's Trips Under Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Republican National Committee chairman  
criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton today for using government 
aircraft and resources for campaign-style visits to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, expected to seek the Senate seat being vacated  
next year by retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has 
made 12 trips to New York in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost to taxpayers is estimated at more than $220,000, said  
the top Republican, Jim Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary's flying military jets, but at $20,000 per trip, it's  
the taxpayers who are being taken for a ride,'' Nicholson said in a 
statement distributed by aides as he began a four-stop trip across 
traditionally Republican upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Berry, a spokesman for the first lady, has said that, on  
the advice of the Secret Service, Mrs. Clinton will continue to fly 
military jets to New York for as long as she is first lady. Berry 
said the government would be reimbursed for Mrs. Clinton's own 
political travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Other campaign committees have paid for some of Mrs. Clinton's  
costs when she participates in fund-raising events for them. But 
taxpayers have covered all other expenses, including Secret Service 
protection, when she travels. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to file papers next week with the  
Federal Election Commission creating an exploratory committee that 
will allow her to raise and spend money for campaign-related 
purposes.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Mediators Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada has appointed two mediators to try to  
resolve an Air Canada labor dispute that could lead to a strike 
this month by the 5,100 flight attendants of Canada's largest 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the attendants' union have until July 7 before  
they are in a legal position for a strike or lockout. Each side 
says it is willing to resume negotiations prior to the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada says it will ground its planes in the event of a  
strike and customers will need to seek other travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Labor Ministry said it would not appoint a  
conciliation board to impose a settlement, but it did appoint two 
mediators to assist if negotiations resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada's most recent strike was in September 1998, when its  
2,100 pilots walked out for 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendants' latest proposal, which the airline rejected June  
20, sought a pension increase of more than $3,000 a year. The 
airline said last week it refuses to consider the union's proposal 
unless pensions are taken off the table. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have agreed on wage increases totaling 12.5  
percent over a three-year contract. The company has also offered a 
lump sum payment which the union says falls far short of the 
requested pension improvements.

<HEADLINE> Morrison To Get Competency Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A judge ordered retired heavyweight Tommy  
Morrison on Thursday to undergo a competency evaluation, rather 
than sentencing him on a drunken-driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa County Special Judge Kyle Haskins delayed sentencing after  
Morrison's attorney told him a pre-sentencing background report was 
not ready. The judge then expressed doubts about Morrison's 
competency. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were to simply sentence you today while harboring  
concerns about your competency, that would be improper,'' Haskins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Caleb Raynolds said it was the first  
time competency had been raised in the nearly year-old case. It was 
unclear what motivated the judge's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing was rescheduled for Aug. 9.  
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, who appeared in court wearing shorts and carrying a  
small book, nodded in response to the judge. Any comments he made 
were inaudible in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison pleaded guilty in April to a drunken-driving charge and  
two other traffic misdemeanors after numerous delays in the case. 
The maximum possible punishment on the three counts combined is two 
years and 10 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged July 17, 1998, with driving under the influence  
of alcohol, driving while his license was revoked and failing to 
stop at a red light. Broken Arrow police said they arrested him 
after he tried to fill his car with gas and then drove off with the 
nozzle and hose still attached to the tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison became the WBO heavyweight champion in 1993 by  
defeating George Foreman. He lost the title later that year and 
retired from boxing in 1996 after testing positive for HIV.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Group Dismisses 33 Executives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Daewoo group dismissed 33 of its 50  
subsidiary presidents as part of an effort to speed up 
restructuring at the conglomerate, company officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came one day after all of the 50 presidents tendered  
resignation letters and vowed to work without getting paid until 
the business group's planned restructuring is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining 17 presidents will work without salary as  
promised, Daewoo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Tae-gu, who has been in charge of corporate restructuring,  
became new president of Daewoo Motor. Former president for the 
carmaker, Kang Byong-ho, was appointed president of Daewoo Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Daewoo announced plans to sell its shipbuilding and  
other businesses to improve its financial position. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo plans to reduce the number of its subsidiaries to eight  
from 34 in the automobile, trading and finance sectors and reduce 
its debt-to-equity ratio sharply by October. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1998, Daewoo had $63 billion in total assets and  
$50 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In early June, Daewoo agreed to sell the Hilton Hotel in Seoul  
to General Mediterranean Holding Co., an investment firm based in 
Luxembourg, for $215 million, its first sale of a major asset. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung has been urging more corporate  
restructuring at the nation's top five conglomerates -- Hyundai, 
Daewoo Samsung, LG and SK -- to improve efficiency and boost foreign 
investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea was forced to accept a $58 billion bailout fund from  
the International Monetary Fund in late 1997 to save its faltering 
economy. Structural reforms were a key condition of the rescue 
package.

<HEADLINE> CDC Warns of Alaskan Flu Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Federal health officials are urging older  
tourists to consult a doctor before traveling this summer to Alaska 
and the Yukon, where a flu outbreak has sickened hundreds of 
tourists for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 428 cases have been reported among tourists on seven  
cruises since May 22, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reported Thursday. That's about 4 percent of 10,110 
passengers got sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Those most vulnerable -- people over age 65 or with chronic  
respiratory and heart problems -- should get advice from a doctor 
before traveling to the region, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency issued a similar warning for the area last August,  
after flu had sickened nearly 2,000 tourists and killed two. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu spreads easily on cruise ships because tourists travel in  
close quarters. A constant influx of new tour groups allows the 
bugs to circulate over extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of flu vaccine are low during summer, making outbreaks  
more worrisome. But doctors can prescribe drugs that blunt the 
effects.

	The left-hander kept his thoughts to himself Thursday, a day  
after he pitched another dominating game and wound up with another 
tortuous loss. Johnson struck out 17 in a 2-0 loss to the 
Cincinnati Reds that was painfully familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's line for his last two starts: 31 strikeouts, two  
complete games, no wins, no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything to say,'' Johnson said before Thursday's  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	His problem is that he isn't getting any help from his offense.  
</P>
<P>
	In his start last Friday, Johnson struck out 14 Cardinals and  
allowed only one run but wound up with a 1-0 loss. St. Louis rookie 
Jose Jimenez threw a no-hitter to upstage him. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Reds' turn on Wednesday, when Ron Villone and Scott  
Williamson held the Diamondbacks to one hit in a 2-0 win. 
Afterward, Johnson made himself scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how Johnson was taking it, manager Buck Showalter said,  
``I would think not very well. In fact, I know he isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reporters finished with Showalter, public relations  
director Mike Swanson told them, ``He isn't taking it so well that 
he's got nothing to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers say it all.  
</P>
<P>
	In his last two starts, Johnson has thrown two complete games,  
struck out 31 and allowed only three runs on 12 hits and two walks. 
Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks have managed one hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 strikeouts on Wednesday night were a season high, a  
Diamondbacks record and the fourth 17-strikeout game of his career. 
The last time he struck out 17 was Aug. 8, 1997 against the Chicago 
White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	His two-game total of 31 strikeouts is two shy of Kerry Wood's  
National League record set last year. He needs 12 strikeouts in his 
next start Monday to tie the NL mark for three consecutive games. 
Dwight Gooden fanned 43 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	All that domination has gotten him is two losses. Although the  
Diamondbacks have one of the top offenses in the NL, it has gone 
flat since the no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last five games, Arizona hit only .138 and scored eight  
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can never figure it out,'' outfielder Bernard Gilkey said.  
``That's what makes it so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson probably would choose another adjective -- if he were  
inclined to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	The only bright moment in Johnson's latest loss came when he  
struck out Barry Larkin during a five-strikeout spree in the middle 
innings. Larkin started swinging at what he thought was a fastball, 
then wound up contorted when it turned out to be a down-and-in 
slider. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the worst swings of Larkin's career. Both of them  
laughed about it on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was coming in about a billion mph, then it broke at the  
last second,'' Larkin said. ``I tried to adjust my swing. I just 
couldn't believe it. That's how good his stuff was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good, but not good enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard. It's rare that you ever see that,'' Gilkey  
said of Johnson's two-game heartbreak. ``He's been pitching great 
for us. It's unfortunate we haven't been able to pick up a couple 
of runs for him. Those are the breaks, I guess. I feel bad for 
him.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Bush 'Hostile' To Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, banking a record  
$36 million for his presidential race, would be lining up with 
Republicans ``unanimously hostile'' to campaign finance reform if 
he rejects federal spending limits, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people will have to make up their minds about  
whether this is an important issue or not,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush broke ahead of the entire 2000 pack when he announced this  
week that he had raised over the last four months a stunning $36 
million for Campaign 2000. Clinton's hand-picked successor, Vice 
President Al Gore, has raised just $18 million in the first half of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Professional politicos were wowed by the tally, but Clinton  
brushed aside its impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most valuable commodity in an election, even more valuable  
than money is ideas,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On ideas, Clinton added, Gore wins. ``He is the only candidate  
who has yet told the American people what he wanted to do if he got 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about news reports that Clinton was furious with Gore for  
campaign statements explicitly and repeatedly distancing himself 
from the president's personal behavior in the Monica Lewinsky 
affair, Clinton said he was ``bewildered'' by the stories and 
didn't know their source. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not in my heart or my mind,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke in a joint news conference with Egyptian  
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	With Middle East tensions dominating their private talks, the  
two presidents exchanged before the news cameras congratulations 
for their respective commitments to renewing the Mideast peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Valuable time has been wasted,'' Mubarak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he wants to give Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud  
Barak ``more freedom of movement to move aggressively ahead'' on 
the peace track. ``I do think that the time is right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lingering stalemate with Iraqi President Saddam  
Hussein, Clinton reiterated that he supports relaxing an 
international embargo for strictly humanitarian reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never wanted the Iraqi people to suffer because of their  
leader,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``I do not believe we should give up on an attemt  
-- an insistence, indeed -- that the United Nations, in return for 
this'' should demand strict arms control measures.

<HEADLINE> Ben Hogan's Widow Dies at 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Valerie Hogan, the widow of golf legend  
Ben Hogan, has died. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hogan, who died Wednesday at her home shunned the limelight  
when her husband was alive, avoiding interviews and making public 
appearances only with him. Hogan died in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, however, Mrs. Hogan had taken a more public  
role. She appeared at a November announcement by Spalding 
concerning return of the Ben Hogan Co. to Fort Worth from Richmond, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Mrs. Hogan appeared in television network interviews  
to commemorate her husband's career. She offered information about 
Hogan's victory in the 1953 British Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, 
the site of this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hogan traveled in June to the Memorial Tournament in  
Dublin, Ohio, where her late husband was honored. She then went to 
the opening of the Ben Hogan Room at Golf House in Far Hills, N.J., 
the headquarters of the United States Golf Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The travel last month had been rather hard on her,'' her  
secretary, Sharon Rea, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hogan criticized some published portrayals of her husband  
as cold-hearted or unemotional. She declined to cooperate in a 
Hogan biography that was published in 1996 and later criticized it 
as an inaccurate portrayal of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's always been quiet and done such a great job of seeing  
after Ben. It's always sad when you say goodbye to people who have 
been your friends for all these years,'' said golfing great Byron 
Nelson, once a fellow caddie with Ben Hogan at Glen Garden Country 
Club in Fort Worth.

<HEADLINE> Lott Plans Gun-Control Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the polite parlance of the Senate, Majority  
Leader Trent Lott on Thursday dismissed Sen. Bob Smith's threat to 
hold up legislative business if negotiations are opened with the 
House on new gun control restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Threat or no threat, Lott told reporters, negotiators will be  
appointed and the process will begin in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, you have to go forward,'' Lott, R-Miss., told  
reporters at a news conference. He promised ``to talk to Senator 
Smith about how we go to conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, one of three senators running longshot bids for the GOP  
presidential nomination, opposes the new gun restrictions in the 
Senate-approved juvenile justice bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a juvenile justice bill that significantly  
weakened the Senate's proposed gun control measure. Leaders of both 
houses say they will appoint negotiators to work out the 
differences after the summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, R-N.H., believes that the Senate's gun provisions stand a  
chance of surviving the talks. He's also not sure whether he likes 
weakened gun proposals that won brief favor in the House before 
lawmakers there decide to reject gun controls entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he sent letters to Lott and Judiciary Committee  
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, saying he was considering a 
procedural maneuver to block the appointment of conferees, the 
first step in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate tradition permits its members to hold up legislative  
process by objecting to it for any reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Going to conference, Smith told reporters, is ``not worth the  
risk,'' and he's considering everything from a hold to a filibuster 
to stop conferees from being named. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds are the conferees will be favorable to the Senate's  
position,'' Smith said. ``I'm going to do everything in my power to 
see to it that we don't get to conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Smith said, GOP leaders should put the House bill up for  
a vote in the Senate and bar amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott has no such plans, and he made clear that he intends to  
talk Smith out of the confrontation. If Smith persists, Lott said 
he would call for a Senate vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't mean it as an affront to anybody,'' Lott said.  
``Anyway, we won't do it till we come back and give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said no one has tried to force to retreat from his  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thus far my arms are intact and no one has threatened me with  
anything,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Disabled To Earn More, Keep Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beginning Thursday, people with disabilities  
may earn up to $700 per month -- $200 more than the old limit -- 
before losing their federal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Administration estimates the change will  
benefit about 27,000 people and cost $1.2 billion through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first increase in earnings allowed since 1990 and is  
part of the Clinton administration's effort to encourage the 
disabled to work. The Social Security Administration made the 
adjustment through regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Senate just passed legislation giving people  
with disabilities other incentives to work, including the ability 
to keep government health insurance. Similar legislation, which 
President Clinton supports, is pending in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules affect both of the federal government's disability  
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security Disability Insurance program aids people of  
all incomes who have worked for at least 10 years before becoming 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Thursday, applicants to the program may earn up to  
$700 each month and still qualify, and they may earn that much once 
they are on the program and still keep their benefits. If they 
exceed $700, all benefits cease. 
</P>
<P>
	The program pays an average of $722 per month to 4.7 million  
beneficiaries and 1.6 million members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The change will affect only the application process for  
Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, which aids poor people with 
disabilities. Applicants may earn up to $700 a month and still 
qualify. But the program, which is based on income, already reduces 
benefits by $1 for every $2 earned above $65, and that will not 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, nearly 400,000 people collecting disability benefits  
work in some way, but many others do not try for fear of losing 
cash and medical benefits, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	The change does not affect workers who are blind. They already  
may earn $1,110 per month -- a figure set in legislation and which 
rises with inflation each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the program, John Trollinger, said that more  
than 3,000 public comments, an unusually higher number, were 
received about the proposed change. Only one person opposed the 
change.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Finance Minister Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has  
replaced his finance minister, the seventh member of his cabinet to 
depart since he took office in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritza Izaguirre is out and the post will be filled by her  
35-year-old deputy Jose Rojas, Chavez told reporters late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Izaguirre, 60, says she is leaving to return to her post at the  
Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. She was named 
finance minister last year by then-President Rafael Caldera and 
agreed to stay on temporarily to provide a transition between the 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Izaguirre was among the more highly regarded members of Chavez's  
economic team, which critics say has lacked a coherent plan to 
bring the country out of one of its worst recessions in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's economy plunged into a recession last year after  
prices for oil, the country's main export, fell to a 12-year low. 
The economy shrank by 9.8 percent between January and March this 
year, the fiscal deficit is $8 billion and unemployment is up to 15 
percent, according to official figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the other cabinet members who resigned quit to run in  
elections July 25 for a constituent assembly that is to rewrite 
Venezuela's constitution -- the centerpiece of Chavez's governing 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Izaguirre's departure could add to tensions in Venezuela.  
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, the leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt, is under  
attack by opponents for breaking campaign laws, naming scores of 
soldiers to government posts and allegedly planning to use the 
constituent assembly to impose authoritarian rule by temporarily 
shutting down Congress and the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the former army paratrooper is also wildly popular  
among millions of poor people who think he will attack rampant 
political corruption blamed for squandering the country's vast oil 
wealth.

<HEADLINE> Expos Send Rojas to Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal sent reliever Mel Rojas outright to the  
minors on Thursday, just five days after the Expos brought back 
their former closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Ottawa on June  
26, was sent to back to the Lynx following the Expos' 4-1 loss to 
the Atlanta Braves. He appeared in three games for Montreal, 
allowing five runs in 2 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas, who is expected to report to Ottawa, saved 109 games for  
Montreal from 1990-96, including a career-high 36 saves in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas began the season with Los Angeles and had a 12.60 ERA in  
five appearances with the Dodgers. He was traded to Detroit on 
April 17 and was released by the Tigers on May 3 after posting a 
22.74 ERA in five appearances. He gave up 11 runs in 1 2-3 innings 
against Seattle on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal will recall Jeremy Powell from Ottawa to start against  
Florida in Miami on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell is 3-5 with a 2.97 ERA in 16 starts for the Lynx this  
season. He was 1-5 in seven games for the Expos last year with a 
7.92 ERA in 25 innings, including six starts.

<HEADLINE> Analyst: $996B Surpluses by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress' top fiscal analyst estimated today  
that excluding Social Security, there will be $996 billion in 
budget surpluses over the next decade, close to the round $1 
trillion by which many Republicans want to cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its last estimate in April, the Congressional Budget  
Office increased its estimate of the non-Social Security, 10-year 
surplus by $171 billion. That increase is only about half the $333 
billion boost that President Clinton announced Monday in the White 
House's own 10-year surplus projections since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the new CBO numbers give lawmakers an astounding amount  
of money with which to pursue their priorities, particularly when 
compared with the annual deficits that until recently dominated 
Washington's landscape for decades. The White House envisions an 
even bigger, $1.08 trillion pot of non-Social Security surpluses 
over the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO's annual summertime report, distributed on Capitol Hill,  
credited the surplus upsurge to the economy's continuing strong 
performance and the extra money it has generated for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Revenue growth continues to be the engine that drives mounting  
estimates of the surplus,'' the agency's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO also cautioned, however, that as baby boomers begin retiring  
in 2010 and relying on Social Security and Medicare, ``Budgetary 
pressures caused by increased participation in such programs can 
easily reverse the favorable fiscal forces that are operating 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus from the part of the budget that includes everything  
but Social Security is what both parties feel comfortable using for 
more spending, tax cuts or both. Many Republicans want to use that 
money for tax cuts, while Clinton and many Democrats want to use 
most of it for Medicare, defense and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In good news for the GOP, the CBO will project a $14 billion  
non-Social Security surplus next year -- up from a $5 billion 
non-Social Security deficit the agency estimated in April. That 
should help the Republican majority in Congress because until now, 
they have been struggling to pay for the first year of their tax 
cut and to craft spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not entirely clear, however, how Republicans will decide  
to use the money. 
</P>
<P>
	Though tax-cutting sentiment is particularly strong in the  
House, moderate Republicans in both chambers are leery of a 
tax-cutting package that much exceeds the $778 billion, 10-year tax 
reduction that Congress' budget envisioned in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he wanted to do with the extra surplus projections,  
the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., 
cited looming needs to prepare Medicare for baby boomers' 
retirements and to provide extra funds for education and some other 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not prepared to do anything until we look at the total  
picture,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO estimated the 1999 overall surplus will be $120 billion and  
next year's, a record $161 billion. In April, CBO predicted the 
2000 overall surplus would be $133 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	And from 2000 through 2009, CBO projected an accumulated budget  
surplus of $2.896 trillion. Clinton's projection for the same 
period was $2.916 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacob Lew, the White House budget director, said in a statement  
that both sets of surplus projections ``show movement in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also reiterated the White House's insistence that surpluses  
be used for domestic spending, Social Security, Medicare and debt 
reduction ``before making other decisions on ways to spend the 
surplus'' in other ways, such as on tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, the CBO envisioned 10-year, non-Social Security  
surpluses of $787 billion, $37 billion more than the White House 
estimated. Because the CBO began from a higher starting point, 
insiders were not surprised that in updating their figures, the 
congressional agency's adjustment was smaller than Clinton's.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympian Dies in His Sleep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARY, N.C. (AP) -- A 14-year-old Special Olympian from Egypt died  
in his sleep early Thursday, probably from an epileptic seizure, 
officials of the Special Olympics World Summer Games said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohamed Abdul Baset Barin, a volleyball player, was pronounced  
dead in his room at North Carolina's Morrison Hall at Chapel Hill, 
N.C., after his coach called paramedics, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is tragic, it is saddening, but it was also, sadly,  
unavoidable,'' Tim Shriver, president and CEO of Special Olympics 
Inc., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tim Taft, chairman of the Special Olympics' medical advisory  
committee, said Barin was an epileptic. An autopsy performed 
Thursday by the state medical examiner's office suggested his death 
was related to epilepsy. But since Barin died in his sleep, 
examiners couldn't be absolutely sure, Taft said. Taft said Barin 
was taking medication for his disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know he had an underlying seizure disorder,'' Taft said.  
``That is the most likely explanation for what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Games organizers planned a moment of silence at each event venue  
Thursday night to observe Barin's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Special Olympians are all developmentally disabled, and many are  
afflicted with medical problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Freddoso, CEO of the Games Organizing Committee, said Barin  
and his teammates watched volleyball competition Wednesday night at 
Carmichael Auditorium on the North Carolina campus, then returned 
to Morrison Hall, watched television and went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Barin couldn't be awakened about 7 a.m. Thursday, his coach  
called paramedics, who pronounced him dead a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of my parents and the entire Special Olympics  
movement, we extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Mohamed 
Abdul Baset Barin,'' Shriver said. ``He showed courage in 
everything he did and was a shining example, a hero of our 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shriver said the rest of the 32-member Egyptian delegation will  
continue to participate in the Special Olympics. Barin's volleyball 
team played a match on Thursday, losing to a team from Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have asked to be allowed to continue but continue, if at  
all possible, without any outside interference,'' Shriver said. 
</P>
<P>
	The death is the second in the 10th Special Olympics World  
Summer Games, which opened in the Raleigh-Durham area last Saturday 
and ends Sunday. A Games volunteer died of a heart attack after 
completing his shift in the opening ceremonies. Two athletes each 
from the Dominican Republic and Morocco are missing after leaving 
their delegations. Authorities don't suspect foul play, describing 
the athletes as highly functional mentally retarded men. 
</P>
<P>
	This is also the second straight World Games in which an athlete  
has died. During the 1995 World Games in Connecticut, a 21-year-old 
Nepalese Special Olympian, Ramesh Mali, drowned during a beach 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7,000 athletes from the United States and 150 other

<HEADLINE> 2 Girls Charged In Road Rage Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALE CITY, Va. (AP) -- Two teen-age girls are accused of killing  
a 25-year-old mother by pounding her head on the pavement in front 
of her children because she complained that their car was blocking 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Hattie Dixon, 18, was charged with aggravated malicious  
wounding in the attack on Natalie Davis. The charge was lodged 
prior to Ms. Davis' death. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the other girl was withheld because she is 16.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a heinous and senseless crime,'' said prosecutor Paul  
Ebert, who said he intends to seek murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack happened Tuesday night while Ms. Davis, her children,  
ages 2 and 4, and four other relatives were driving to church. She 
died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A car was blocking the road out of the cul-de-sac where they  
lived, and about five girls were gathered around talking. Ms. Davis 
asked the teens to move the car, though the driver of Ms. Davis' 
car eventually managed to get around. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens jumped into another car and followed the family after  
they passed, Sgt. Kim Chinn said. After a short distance, Ms. Davis 
and one of the pursuers got out of their cars and exchanged words. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear who threw the first punch, but the teen-ager  
grabbed Ms. Davis by the hair and pounded her head on the pavement, 
Chinn said. A second teen stomped on her head and kicked her in the 
face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Ms. Davis' relatives flagged down a police officer.

<HEADLINE> Packers Expect 10,000 at Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers expect between  
10,000 and 12,000 of the team's owners to attend Wednesday's 
outdoor shareholders meeting at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers are the nation's only publicly-owned sports team,  
and last year's meeting, the first of its kind, attracted 18,707 of 
the team's more than 100,000 shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Bob Harlan, general manager Ron Wolf and other  
team officials will speak at Wednesday's meeting. Harlan will give 
an update on the team's pursuit of a new stadium, and Wolf will 
make his second ``State of the Team'' address. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional reports will be presented by the investment committee  
and the corporate marketing committee. The Packers also will elect 
15 directors to three-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the presentations, shareholders will be able to ask  
questions of the team officials. Last year's meeting featured a 
spirited discussion about then-unsigned running backs Dorsey Levens 
and Raymont Harris, both of whom eventually signed with the 
Packers.

<HEADLINE> Nemechek Captures Daytona Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- First, owner Felix Sabates switched  
crew chiefs. In the back of his mind, Joe Nemechek must have 
wondered if Sabates was thinking about making a change in drivers 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek got a boost to open the second half of an otherwise  
dreary season Thursday, winning the pole position for the Pepsi 
400. 
</P>
<P>
	With a speed of 194.860 mph on Daytona International Speedway's  
2.5-mile trioval, Nemechek earned his first pole in more than two 
years. It confirmed the wisdom of Sabates' decision to reassign 
Tony Glover to Nemechek's team last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were together in 1997, when Nemechek earned the nickname  
``Front Row Joe'' after taking a pair of poles and qualifying 
second three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been through so much here and knows how to call a  
race,'' Nemechek said of Glover. ``We communicate real well. He can 
say something and I know what he says. I can say a different word 
back to him and he knows how far the car is off. We've been able to 
capitalize on that in the past, and hopefully we will Saturday 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a startling turnaround for Nemechek, who is in 37th  
place in the points standings and has just one top 10 finish this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting outside of Nemechek will be Ricky Rudd, an owner-driver  
who qualified at 194.574 mph just hours after learning his 
nine-year sponsorship deal with Tide will be terminated after this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way to do it but go out, get mad about it, fight  
harder and try harder,'' Rudd said. ``I'm a firm believer that if 
you work hard, something will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the third position will be Mark Martin, who qualified at  
194.376 mph. Martin is seeking his first restrictor-plate victory 
since 1997 at Talladega, when his Ford averaged 188.354 mph in an 
accident-free race on the circuit's fastest track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel like we've got the best shot at a race at  
Daytona that we've ever had,'' said Martin, who has never won a 
main event at the track. ``We've got great horsepower. This is the 
most I've had on any restrictor plate that I can ever remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to Martin will be Chad Little (193.690 mph), with Rusty  
Wallace and Tony Stewart in the third row. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, who won the pole and the Daytona 500 in February,  
qualified 11th. Dale Earnhardt was 10th and series points leader 
Dale Jarrett was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek has made 170 Winston Cup starts without a victory. Like  
any driver, he would like to break that string at NASCAR's most 
famous track. Of course, he knows that qualifying and the actual 
race are always different at Daytona, where carburetor restrictor 
plates are set in place to reduce speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a whole different setup,'' Nemechek said. ``Qualifying is  
made for two laps. You can just barely hang onto it. Race mode, 
you've got to hang on and hold that throttle open all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 25 fastest qualifiers locked up starting spots in the 43-car  
field, with the rest of the lineup to be set tonight in the final 
round of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the drivers who failed to make the top 25 and will have to  
either try again tonight or stand on their first-day laps were 
Terry Labonte, who was 39th, and Steve Park, last among the 44 who 
made a qualifying attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Wallace also failed to qualify. He had to use an untested  
car after getting into an accident in practice. Wallace was able to 
drive in qualifying, but the car did not survive the accident.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Financier Not Surrendering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Fugitive financier Martin R. Frankel,  
accused of stealing at least $200 million from a bevy of insurance 
companies, was still on the loose Thursday and is not considering 
turning himself in, his lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Hugh Keefe confirmed that he had spoken to  
Frankel in the past three weeks, but said ``none of those 
conversations had anything to do with surrender,'' Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is wanted on federal wire fraud and money laundering  
charges. He is believed to be somewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of countries that have extradition treaties with the  
United States is growing all the time, resulting in fewer places 
for Frankel to hide. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States currently has 115 extradition treaties in  
place, according to the Justice Department. Notable exceptions 
include Russia and China, spokesman John Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Daniel Partan of the Boston University Law School said  
it is much more difficult to escape U.S. prosecution today than it 
was 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watch treaty developments and I know the Department of  
Justice is interested in drying up any safe havens,'' Partan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But extradition treaties vary from country to country, and  
Frankel is believed to have tremendous resources at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, the chances of finding him and extracting him  
are not that good,'' Partan said. ``I would suspect that with his 
skills at financial affairs he has a pretty good shot at finding a 
haven. He has probably thought fairly carefully and competently 
about how to move his money around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, when Frankel disappeared from his Greenwich mansion in  
early May, among the items left behind were a handwritten list of 
tasks, including the notation, ``Get $ to Israel get it back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel may be able to claim Israeli citizenship because he is  
of Jewish heritage. A similar claim was recently employed 
successfully by Samuel Sheinbein, a Maryland teen-ager accused of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein will not be extradited, but faces trial on the murder  
charge in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Many treaties give countries the option not to send their  
citizens back to the United States for trial, said Professor Ruth 
Wedgwood of the Yale University of School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	``These treaties are handcrafted according to the political  
sensibilities of the particular country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance company regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage,  
Liberty National Securities Inc., siphoned at least $215 million 
from small insurance firms in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, 
Missouri and Arkansas. In the end, the losses could prove to be 
much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing is as much as $1.98 billion from the St. Francis of  
Assisi Foundation, which investigators say is a bogus Roman 
Catholic charity Frankel established last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's assets were kept in the British Virgin Islands,  
investigators said.

<HEADLINE> Agencies Announce Egg-Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Thursday  
proposed new warning labels for egg cartons and took steps to 
combat salmonella contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed safe handling instructions warn that ``eggs may  
contain harmful bacteria known to cause serious illness, especially 
in children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune 
systems.'' It would advise consumers to keep eggs refrigerated, 
cook egg yolks until firm and thoroughly cook any food containing 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint announcement by the Food and Drug Administration and  
the Agriculture Department, which together have responsibility for 
preventing food-bourne illnesses, came as a report criticizing 
their efforts was presented at a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office found that too many  
federal agencies have done too little, too slowly to protect 
Americans from salmonella-contaminated eggs. It concluded that new 
national standards and better coordination among the several 
agencies with jurisdiction over the issue is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidence of the digestive illness that can be caused by eating  
raw or undercooked eggs -- found in such favorites as runny fried 
eggs, thick-cut French toast, Caesar salad and unbaked cookie dough 
-- decreased by 44 percent since 1996 in selected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But egg-bourne salmonella infections remain a public health  
concern. In 1997, the disease may have sickened as many as 300,000 
and caused 115 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the new labels, the FDA and USDA proposed  
expanding a federal requirement that eggs and egg products be kept 
refrigerated at 45 degrees or below. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a requirement covering eggs from the time they are packed  
and shipped until they reach retail locations is set to take effect 
in August -- eight years after Congress mandated it. On Thursday, 
the FDA said it is moving to include eggs on store shelves, in 
restaurants and at nursing homes and schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The agencies also promised that the President's Council on Food  
Safety would complete by Nov. 1 a government-wide plan to further 
increase egg safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposed regulations are being published in the Federal  
Register and will be open to comment for the next 75 days.

<HEADLINE> Bowl Championship Series Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Say goodbye to maximum adjusted deviation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bowl Championship Series on Wednesday modified its  
guidelines for selecting teams, adding more computer rankings and 
dropping its most perplexing term. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS also toughened eligibility standards for the four major  
bowls and, in a move seemingly aimed at the Big East, set up a 
mechanism that could strip weaker conferences of automatic bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Maximum adjusted deviation was used last season in the event of  
any unusual differences in the computer rankings. Don't even ask 
how it was determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concept is still there,'' said Southeastern Conference  
commissioner Roy Kramer, chairman of the BCS, ``but it's done in a 
much simpler way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS standings are determined through four factors: a  
combined ranking in The Associated Press media poll and ESPN-USA 
Today coaches poll; computer surveys; strength of schedule; and 
won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the BCS will again use the computer ratings of Jeff  
Sagarin, The New York Times and the Seattle Times. But it also will 
consider Richard Billingsley, Dunkel Index, Kenneth Massey, David 
Rothman and Matthews-Scripps Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to get a second, third, fourth or fifth  
opinion,'' Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
	A school's lowest ranking from the eight computer services will  
be thrown out, eliminating the possibility of a team being hurt by 
an unusual difference in one of the polls. That process takes the 
place of maximum adjusted deviation. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS took no action to address one of the major concerns from  
its debut season -- the exclusion of a worthy team such as Kansas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Wildcats were relegated to a minor bowl even  
though they lost only one game -- the Big 12 championship in 
overtime -- and were ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the bowls, after you get past the 1-2 game, need  
to have some regional flexibility,'' Kramer said. ``You can't take 
two West Coast teams and play in Miami. You've got to have regional 
ties to make the bowls succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS is considering whether to add a fifth game to its  
lineup, providing spots for two more at-large teams. While Kramer 
described the talks as ``very preliminary,'' he didn't rule out 
another bowl game as soon as 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, champions from the Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC,  
Atlantic Coast and Pac-10 receive automatic bids to the BCS, which 
also includes two at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-2 teams in the BCS standings are matched in a national  
title game that rotates among the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta 
bowls. The other six teams are divided by the remaining games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 title game will be held Jan. 4 at the Sugar Bowl in New  
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season -- the first for the BCS -- teams were eligible for  
at-large berths with either eight victories or by finishing no 
lower than 12th in the BCS standings. Now, teams must have nine 
regular-season wins over NCAA Division I-A opponents and at least a 
No. 12 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said the main purpose of the stricter standards was to  
give schools more flexibility in making deals with bowls outside 
the BCS. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we were holding up a lot of teams with eight wins  
that we didn't need to hold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this season, each of the six BCS leagues must show it  
is worthy of that status. If a conference's automatic qualifiers 
failed to average at least a No. 12 BCS rating over a four-year 
period, it could be stripped of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision seems most directed at the Big East, which has been  
criticized for sending subpar champions to the major bowls. Last 
season, Syracuse (8-4) finished No. 15 in the BCS rankings and was 
routed by Florida 31-10 in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very logical move,'' Kramer said. ``As other  
conferences expand and grow, there should be an opportunity for 
change to occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer scoffed at complaints that the average fan can't  
comprehend the BCS and its complex formulas -- even with the 
deletion of maximum adjusted deviation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much easier to explain than a subjective poll,'' he  
said. ``You don't know why anyone voted the way they did in a 
subjective poll.''

<HEADLINE> European Scare Adds to Coke's Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. may have had worse years. But not  
many. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news has poured out of the Atlanta-based American business  
icon almost continuously since last July: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The economic crisis in Asia punctured the company's sales and  
earnings expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Deals to buy the French soft drink Orangina and overseas  
rights to the Cadbury Schweppes brands bogged down after regulatory 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Four current or past employees sued Coke, charging racial  
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In a public relations nightmare striking at the company's very  
essence, Belgian schoolchildren became sick June 8 after drinking 
Coke, triggering a health scare throughout Europe. Authorities 
linked 249 cases of illness to contaminated Coke products before a 
16-day ban on sales was lifted in three European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse, the company was, by its own admission,  
slow in responding to concerns about the safety of its products. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And on Tuesday, Coke announced it was removing glass bottles  
of its Bonaqua mineral water from stores in Poland after mold was 
found in one bottle. On Wednesday, it expanded the recall in Poland 
to include other Coke products. 
</P>
<P>
	The litany of bad news has taken a toll on profits, sales and  
Coke's stock price -- down more than 30 percent from an all-time 
high of nearly $89 a share in July 1998. The company said Wednesday 
worldwide sales volume will fall 1 percent to 2 percent for the 
second quarter, with earnings also expected to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-term cost to Coke's image and to chairman and chief  
executive officer M. Douglas Ivester remains to be seen. But so 
far, securities analysts who follow the company and a prominent 
member of Coke's board are supportive and optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have had a rough patch here,'' said Martin Romm, a Credit  
Suisse First Boston analyst who's followed Coke for more than two 
decades. ``I think Coke has really acted as an extremely focused 
company intent on doing the things that in the long term are in the 
best interests of their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been remarkably stable in an otherwise unstable  
environment,'' said Romm, among many analysts who still give Coke a 
good long-term outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Williams, retired chairman and CEO of SunTrust Banks,  
said of Ivester last week, ``We think Doug is the right man at the 
right time in the right place.'' SunTrust holds 6 percent of Coke's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke acknowledges that the last 18 months have been challenging.  
But, company spokesman Rob Baskin said, ``I don't know that it's 
been more challenging than other times in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the 113-year-old company has been through the  
Great Depression, recessions in the United States and abroad and 
world wars. ``It's a matter of taking the long view and weathering 
the storms,'' Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ivester said Coke believes ``the worst is behind  
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain extremely confident in the fundamental strengths of  
our business systems throughout the world,'' said Ivester, who 
succeeded Roberto Goizueta, Coke's CEO for 16 highly successful 
years, in October 1997 following Goizueta's death from lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some questions about Ivester's future. ``While  
nobody is blaming Ivester for any of these circumstances, CEO's 
have been eased into premature retirement for less,'' an Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution story commented Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the slow response to the European contamination  
crisis, Ivester seems likely to face increased scrutiny in the 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the company's strong civic reputation, most in the  
Atlanta area have had a wait-and-see response to the discrimination 
suit filed in April charging that Coke pays black employees less 
and gives them fewer opportunities. But subsequent disclosures that 
black executives at Coke gave Ivester, at his request, 
recommendations for increasing diversity in December 1995 and that 
the plaintiffs had made formal complaints to Coke before filing the 
suit raised some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``What surprises me is that they didn't nip it (complaints of  
discrimination) in the bud any earlier,'' said state Rep. Tyrone 
Brooks, D-Atlanta, who heads the Georgia association of black 
elected officials. ``If you do not deal with them when they first 
surface, they can become a major embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts expect aggressive marketing to mitigate long-term  
damage from Coke's crises. 
</P>
<P>
	And John Sicher, publisher and editor of Beverage Digest, said  
that in spite of everything that's happened, Coke remains a solid 
No. 1 in the soft-drink industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're talking about the power of the brand and long-term  
growth and stability of the brand, there won't be any impact,'' 
Sicher said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Get Kerrey's Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bob Kerrey of Nebraska will formally  
endorse Bill Bradley's bid for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, the second senator to do so, Bradley aides said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey will issue his endorsement at a pancake breakfast Monday  
morning in Omaha, and the two will then travel to suburban Des 
Moines to repeat the announcement in the state where precinct 
caucuses launch the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	That event -- at a private home -- will draw Democratic activists  
friendly to the campaigns both of Kerrey and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In the announcement, Kerrey will make it clear he is picking  
Bradley over Vice President Al Gore, said a Bradley aide who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has the backing of much of the Democratic Party's  
establishment, including the leaders in both the House and Senate. 
Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone is the only other senator who has 
endorsed Bradley, who served for 18 years as a senator from New 
Jersey before stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kerrey, Bradley gets the backing of a decorated war hero who  
won the Medal of Honor for valor in Vietnam, and a former candidate 
for the Democratic nomination. There had been speculation he would 
run again this election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement does not come as a great surprise. There have  
been tensions between Kerrey and the Clinton administration. In 
addition, when announcing he had decided not to make the race, one 
of the reasons Kerrey cited was Bradley's presence in the field 
giving Democrats a choice of candidates.

<HEADLINE> No Outside Counsel in Shuster Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House ethics committee disclosed Wednesday  
that it will not name an outside counsel to handle its 
investigation of the House Transportation Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting a private group's request, committee leaders said  
such an appointment ``is neither necessary nor appropriate.'' No 
reason was given, but outside counsel appointments are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., is under investigation for his ties  
with Ann Eppard, a transportation lobbyist who was the lawmaker's 
congressional chief of staff for 22 years and remains his chief 
campaign fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee late last year widened the inquiry to  
include Shuster's campaign operations over the past six years. The 
campaign has spent millions of dollars on travel, meals and other 
expenses even though he had no formidable opponent during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	The rejection letter came from the ethics committee chairman,  
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and the panel's ranking Democrat, Howard 
Berman of California. The letter was dated last Thursday and was 
received Wednesday by Ralph Nader's Congressional Accountability 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nader group's director, Gary Ruskin, said an outside counsel  
was necessary because of inherent conflicts of interest between 
Shuster and members of the ethics committee. Ruskin, who filed the 
complaint in September 1996, said the lack of an outside counsel 
leads to delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster has considerable say over funding for highway and  
aviation projects across the country. Last year, he helped steer 
into law a $203 billion transportation measure containing several 
projects that benefit Ms. Eppard's clients.

<HEADLINE> France's BNP Raises Bank Bids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French bank Banque Nationale de Paris, locked in a  
takeover battle for rivals Societe Generale and Paribas, said 
Thursday it has increased its offer by 5 percent to $38.85 billion 
in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But BNP's hopes of a successful resolution to the four-month  
saga looked dashed after Paribas branded the new offer ``stingy'' 
and ``unambitious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BNP launched its initial $37 billion hostile takeover bid for  
Societe Generale and Paribas in March. But the two banks, 
themselves in the midst of merging since February, have been 
fighting the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairmen of the three banks met for talks last week with the  
governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet, to try and 
break the impasse. But no agreement had been reached when the 
discussions broke down late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on BNP's closing price Wednesday, the sweetened offer  
gives a 6.6 percent premium over Societe Generale's closing stock 
price on Wednesday and a 24.9 percent premium over its share price 
when BNP made its initial offer. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's new offer to Paribas shareholders is 14.8 percent higher  
than Paribas's closing price on Wednesday and is 45.2 percent 
higher than Paribas' share price when the initial BNP offer was 
made in March. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP said it hoped the two banks' shareholders would approve its  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	If the three banks merge under the new offer, ownership would  
include 32.3 percent for BNP shareholders, 32.7 percent for Societe 
Generale holders and 35 percent for Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	A merger would also create the world's first $1 trillion bank in  
terms of assets.

<HEADLINE> Reggie Jackson May Buy Into A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Hall of Fame slugger Reggie Jackson, who  
helped the Oakland Athletics win three World Series championships, 
has joined the group trying to buy the team just a few days after 
Joe Morgan said he was pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, known as ``Mr. October'' for his stirring World Series  
performances, played for the A's for nine years and was the 
American League's Most Valuable Player in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Dolich, the former A's marketing director who is heading  
the group, said Wednesday that Jackson and six other investors have 
been added. Bob Piccinini, the owner of Modesto-based Save Mart 
Supermarkets, is the group's main financial backer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball has been and will always be a part of me,'' said  
Jackson, who lives near Carmel. ``Partnering with this group at 
this time represents a unique opportunity for me to use both my 
business and baseball skills. I am committed to the group's 
philosophy of local ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``On a daily operating level, Reggie will work with me and Bob  
on the baseball and business side,'' Dolich said. ``Reggie will 
continue with his other business ventures, but he will devote a 
significant amount of time to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson currently is director of new business alliances for  
Viking Components, which makes computer memory. He is also a 
principal of Ulico Insurance Group of Washington, D.C., and from 
1993 until last year served as a special adviser to the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said he dropped out because he didn't want to give up his  
broadcast positions with ESPN and NBC, and was unable to work out 
an acceptable deal with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still an opportunity for us and Joe to work  
together,'' Dolich said. 
</P>
<P>
	One new investor is the Mugar family of Boston, headed by  
prominent businessman and philanthropist David G. Mugar. Dolich 
said Mugar's sons Jonathan and Peter will handle the family's 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolich's group has offered $122.4 million to owners Steve Schott  
and Ken Hofmann. The price was worked out in a settlement with the 
city of Oakland and Alameda County. The sale must close by Sept. 21 
or Schott and Hofmann retain ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new investors announced were restaurateur Dan Costa of  
Modesto; Jerry Kline, president and chief executive of Innovative 
Interfaces, Inc. of Emeryville; attorney Louis J. Giraudo; attorney 
Steven Kazan; and Kazan's partner David McClain. Others involved 
include The Oakland Tribune; Wind River Systems chairman Jerry 
Fiddler; Men's Wearhouse chief George Zimmer; advertising executive 
Jeff Goodby; and attorney Guy Saperstein. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale may be voted on by baseball owners at a Sept. 18  
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Crude Prices Rise; Will Gas Follow? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Prices at the pump remain cheaper during the busy  
summer driving period than a gourmet coffee or some brands of 
bottled water, but sharply higher crude oil prices are threatening 
to change that. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Energy Department on Thursday said gasoline prices  
nationwide remain only slightly higher than a year ago going into 
the busy Fourth of July holiday, when millions of Americans are 
expected to take to the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	But crude oil prices now are their highest in 19 months could  
force them to dig deeper into their pockets in coming days, 
industry observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some areas could see an effect on their gas prices fairly  
quickly,'' said AAA spokesman Mitch Fuqua. ``But even in the 
short-term, there's no easy way to predict which way prices are 
going to turn. It's a wait-and-see game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retail gasoline prices fluctuate based on demand, competitive  
issues, taxes in a geographical region, refinery production and 
capacity, and both present and anticipated future crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, prices at the pump fell nationwide by an average 5  
cents between early May and early June -- despite tightening 
inventories -- as driving demand remained weaker than expected at 
the start of the peak summer period. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent survey of 10,000 gasoline stations  
nationwide, the national weighted average for gasoline, including 
all grades and taxes, was $1.1960 on June 25, up only 0.58 cent per 
gallon from June 13, according to the Lundberg Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	But oil producers this week are enjoying the best prices they've  
seen for crude since November 1997 amid intense summer driving 
demand and sharp declines in available supply. Futures prices for 
August crude rose 10 cents Thursday on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange to $19.39 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	The roots of the rising prices come from an agreement in March  
between OPEC and other key producers, including Mexico and Norway, 
to cut their combined daily production by 2.7 percent, or 2.1 
million barrels, beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were skeptical the disparate parties could maintain such  
cuts since quota-busting has been widespread over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	But compliance has reached more than 90 percent, which provides  
a comfortable cushion from the actual production cutbacks needed to 
sustain prices, said energy analyst John Saucer at Salomon Smith 
Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, they've given themselves a lot of breathing room  
and seem to be working with levels of cooperation that we haven't 
seen in a long time,'' Saucer said. ``That means the bias is going 
to be higher for crude, at least through the end of the year, and 
to a lesser extent, for (gasoline and heating oil).'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a similar sharp increase earlier this year was nearly erased  
after refiners stressed by weak profit margins for manufacturing 
gasoline and heating oil also reduced their production of such 
products, slashing the need for crude. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that factor is unlikely to come into play in the  
future because gasoline and heating oil inventories are shrinking 
rapidly, particularly on the West Coast, where driving demand is 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
	The current round of cuts comes on top of 3.1 million in  
reductions pledged over the past year -- moves that had little 
effect on prices at the pump amid weak demand in Asia and Europe, 
the widespread cheating on exports and increased output from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts noted demand also is on the rise in recovering  
Asian economies, a factor that has helped erase a year-to-year 
world oil surplus and could lead to virtually no supplies in 
storage by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	If that occurs, inventories of gasoline and heating oil also  
could fall sharply. That could result in steep price increases if 
driving demand remains relatively strong or if parts of the world 
suffer a frigid winter, Saucer said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Everglades Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ambitious $7.8 billion, long-range rescue  
of the Florida Everglades was sent to Congress today and Vice 
President Al Gore called for ``a bipartisan effort ... to save this 
national treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the plan has been public for months. But now Congress  
must come up with the money -- an estimated $200 million a year for 
two decades -- to keep the onetime ``River of Grass'' that stretches 
across South Florida from being further devastated and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Everglades have been abused. We didn't see them for what  
they were worth,'' Gore during a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's congressional delegation -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- have vowed to fight for the restoration plan, but Sen. 
Connie Mack, R-Fla., acknowledged ``there will be difficulties 
ahead'' in getting the Congress to approve the plan and provide a 
steady stream of funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Everglades restoration has been marked by an undercurrent of  
presidential campaign politics. Gore, a longtime champion of 
Everglades restoration, made the unusual trek to Capitol Hill to 
mark the 4000-page recovery plan's formal presentation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	And an aide to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of GOP  
presidential derby front-runner George W. Bush, made clear 
Wednesday that the governor is going to push for the plan just as 
hard as Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of no opposition. It would be politically  
unthinkable,'' said J. Allison Defoor, the governor's Everglades 
policy coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore called the plan ``the most critical step yet to restore the  
Everglades, one of America's true natural treasures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one had to say Florida is a key state in the presidential  
race in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government and state will evenly divide the cost of  
the 20-year restoration of one of America's most treasured, but 
severely threatened, environmental landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very concerned about the financing,'' Sen. Bob Graham,  
D-Fla., said, adding that a permanent federal funding stream of 
$150 million to $200 million a year will be needed. Comparing it to 
heart surgery, Graham, added ``We're going to go in with a knife. 
... Once you start that process, you can't stop in the middle of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Wednesday he was confident Congress ``will join us in  
this historic effort'' and come up with the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three years of work, we now have a final plan that is  
terrific for the environment, terrific for communities, terrific 
for business, and saves a world and national treasure,'' Gore said. 
``I think the strength of that consensus will guarantee the money 
we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said that while there is no need to panic, there is  
concern that House and Senate appropriations committees have not 
come up with as much money as the administration has projected for 
the Everglades this upcoming fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Funding approved by the Senate panel falls 40 percent short of  
the $150 million requested for the Interior Department and also 
less than what had been sought by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
which is in charge of the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest obstacle for restoration of the Everglades is  
getting a full commitment from Congress,'' said Ron Tipton of the 
World Wildlife Fund. The state of Florida also has not yet 
pinpointed how it will pay for the historic recovery program, 
although state officials said financing sources will be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida already has spent $2.3 billion since 1983, and the  
federal government another $1.3 billion, to try to revitalize the 
``River of Grass'' that spans more than 100 miles from north of 
Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The restoration plan calls for overhauling the plumbing of the  
Everglades by eliminating some 240 miles of levies and canals -- 
part of a 1,700-mile system built 50 years ago to artificially 
channel the water that once flowed naturally in sheets southward. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for 60 specific projects, including construction  
of aboveground reservoirs, underground aquifers and development of 
new wetlands. The aim is to restore the natural flow of water and 
to collect water that now rushes into the ocean for nobody's 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the additional water would be used to  
revitalize the health of the Everglades ecosystem, which is home to 
1,500 varieties of plants and wildlife from wading birds to 
alligators, including at least 68 threatened or endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the fresh water would go to cities and farms. The  
administration is asking Congress to approve the first round of 
projects this year at a cost of $1.2 billion over six years. The 
entire program is projected to be completed by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Pub Owner Guilty in Larry Bird Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The former owner of a downtown pub has been  
convicted of battery for evicting a woman who spoke with Indiana 
Pacers coach Larry Bird as he was drinking with an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	In convicting Gordon Etchison, Marion Superior Court Judge Evan  
Goodman on Wednesday said there was overwhelming evidence Etchison 
was ``belligerent with her in an irrational manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Williams, 43, was speaking with Bird at the Legal Beagle on  
Feb. 4, when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and two witnesses testified that Etchison grabbed her  
and tried to push her away from the table where Bird was sitting. 
Etchison said he believed Williams was bothering Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	In his videotaped testimony, Bird reiterated his statement to  
police that Williams was not bothering him when she came to his 
table. He said Etchison came up to her and told her it was time to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'She's fine.' I could tell she was about done,'' Bird  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird said he did not see Etchison physically grab Williams, who  
was treated at Methodist Hospital for bruises and soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	Etchison faces a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a fine  
of $5,000.

to you, whether it's a starter or a reserve or a cheerleader. You 
know a time will come when you'll be needed and you have to be 
ready. Until then, you do the best job you can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fair, an alternate in the 1996 Olympics, is a college star. She  
has one season of eligibility remaining at North Carolina, where 
she will be a favorite for the player of the year award after being 
a nominee in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When she looks at the talent surrounding her on the American  
team, she doesn't fret about riding the bench. When her opportunity 
comes, as it did in a first-round runaway against Nigeria, she 
jumps all over it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd be nervous,'' she said of her World Cup debut,  
``but (assistant coach) Lauren Gregg said, `You need to do this and 
do that' to be ready. So all the nerves went away even before I got 
on the field. It's like, `You're in, now go and have fun.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were having so much fun on the bench that it was almost as  
tiring as playing. Every time we scored, we'd be celebrating so 
much that we'd have to sit down and recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whalen also got into the Nigeria game, and she played the entire  
way against North Korea in the last opening-round match. A 
three-time All-American at Connecticut, Whalen might be the fastest 
player on the squad. She displays tremendous composure for a 
23-year-old with limited international experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tony DiCicco said he never hesitates about using Whalen.  
She has responded with steady performances and authoritative play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Tony. He definitely wants to spread the leadership on  
the team,'' Whalen said. ``It's a good idea for the future. When 
some of the veteran leaders are gone, we must step up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony makes sure we all get to play in key situations. And when  
we don't play, we watch, we cheer and we try to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts, who played the first 73 minutes against North Korea, is  
just 22. Despite her youth, she is in her sixth year of work with 
the national team, and, in 1995, started at right midfield. A 
backup now, Roberts has completed her college eligibility. Look for 
her to move back into the lineup heading toward the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you are on the bench on this great a team, it's not a big  
deal,'' she said. ``We all get our opportunities and we all have to 
stay sharp for those chances, and make something of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, they probably won't do much more than offer support for  
the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're needed,'' Fair said, ``we'll be there. Everybody  
knows that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ad Spending Expected To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. advertising spending is growing faster than  
expected this year and should accelerate next year as the 
elections, the Olympics and the millennium boost demand for media 
space, a prominent forecaster says. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Coen, senior vice president for the ad agency  
McCann-Erickson Worldwide, said Wednesday he expects ad spending 
will rise 6.1 percent this year, topping his earlier estimate of a 
5.5 percent expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the economy has grown more rapidly than had been  
expected when he offered the lower estimate six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a pretty good year for the advertising industry,''  
Coen said as he presented his latest semiannual ad spending 
forecast. He has been tracking trends in ad spending for nearly 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first estimate of spending in the year 2000, Coen expects  
7.5 percent growth next year as the presidential and congressional 
elections result in more advertising at the same time that 
marketers are trying to capitalize on the millennium and the Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth expected this year is down from 7.5 percent in 1998  
and would be the slowest since a 5.2 percent rise in 1993. But Coen 
said ad spending has been stronger than anticipated for what he 
called a ``hammock'' year when growth was expected to subside 
between the 1998 Winter Olympics-election year and the 2000 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. ad spending is expected to rise to $213.95 billion in 1999  
and reach $230 billion in 2000, Coen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the growth estimate for this year was divided  
nearly evenly between national and local advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	National ad spending is expected to rise 6.4 percent, up from  
Coen's December estimate of 6.0 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the four major broadcast TV networks should see ad  
revenue rise 7 percent this year, much faster than the 4 percent 
growth he expected in December. The recent advance sales of network 
TV ad time for the fall season was considered exceptionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen said national advertisers are expected to boost spending by  
9 percent on radio and 6.5 percent on magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among major advertising categories, drug advertisers posted the  
biggest spending gains on TV and in magazines in the first quarter 
with a 21 percent increase while movie ad spending was up 11 
percent. Telecommunications and computer companies boosted ad 
spending in early 1999 by 26 percent and 23 percent respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen expects local ad spending will be up 5.7 percent this year,  
up from his earlier forecast of 5.0 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio is experiencing the biggest surge in local ad spending, as  
its growth is expected to reach 9 percent this year vs. earlier 
projection of 6 percent growth. Coen said price increases account 
for most of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Local ad spending is expected to rise 5 percent in newspapers,  
on television and in the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Coen said his figures include a mid-range estimate of about $1  
billion in ad spending on the Internet. But he is skeptical about 
the figure because of the difficulty in measuring it. He said he 
suspects the amount of advertising in weekly newspapers and 
shopping guides and at in-store displays each probably exceed that 
on the Internet several times over. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas advertising is expected to rise 4.1 percent to $212  
billion this year following a 3.0 percent decline last year, Coen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects 5.7 percent growth in overseas ad spending in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Congress Mulls Asbestos Litigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who claim injury as a result of  
asbestos exposure would have to seek compensation in an 
administrative procedure instead of the courts under a plan 
lawmakers are considering. 
</P>
<P>
	During a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday, supporters  
praised the legislation as badly needed relief for a legal system 
now choked by hundreds of thousands of slow-moving asbestos-related 
lawsuits, many of filed by people who probably will never become 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts of this land simply are not equipped to handle the  
more than 200,000 asbestos-related cases currently in the system 
and the 8,000 new filings thrust upon the courts on the last month 
alone,'' said Conrad Mallet, a former chief justice of the Michigan 
Supreme Court and president of a business group lobbying for the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only losers are a few dozen powerful lawyers,'' said  
Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard Law School professor. ``This bill 
benefits almost everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents called it an undeserved bailout of the asbestos  
industry that would deny compensation to people battling cancer and 
other disabling diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not fair,'' said Richard Middleton, president-elect of  
the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. ``It is not fast, it 
is not efficient and it is not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Supreme Court decision last week threw out a proposed $1.5  
billion asbestos agreement. The ruling urged Congress to create a 
better way to settle asbestos claims, saying current rules are not 
flexible enough to accommodate cases involving multiple claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would create a quasi-governmental agency, the  
Asbestos Resolution Corporation, to resolve asbestos injury claims. 
Asbestos companies would pay all the costs of the non-judicial 
administrative process, supporters said. No taxpayer dollars would 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
	For an applicant considered ill or injured and receiving a  
``certificate of medical eligibility,'' the case would go to 
mediation if a settlement with the potentially liable companies is 
not reached in 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	If mediation fails, the claimant could sue or try arbitration.  
</P>
<P>
	The president would nominate and the Senate confirm the  
corporation's seven-member board of directors. A medical advisory 
board would provide expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments would go only to claimants who can show they are sick  
or injured as a result of exposure to asbestos using criteria 
spelled out in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Punitive damages would be prohibited ``so as to ensure that  
funds would be available to compensate people who may in the future 
become impaired by asbestos-related diseases,'' said a Judiciary 
Committee statement explaining the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Claimants could collect money for nonmalignant disease, such as  
asbestosis -- scarring of the lungs -- without losing their right to 
future compensation if they develop cancer later, supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would cap attorneys fees and expenses at 25  
percent. Supporters of the plan said that as much as two-thirds of 
some asbestos awards today go to lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1283.

<HEADLINE> Diva Costa Files Suit Over Easement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The voice of ``Sleeping Beauty'' is  
crying foul over a property dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Diva Mary Costa and others have filed a lawsuit over the hassle  
with mobile home magnate Jim Clayton. They accuse him of cajoling 
residents of the LaRue Condominiums into giving him access to his 
new home on Fort Loudoun Lake. Costa claims the easement affects 
her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton's behavior bordered on ``robber baronism,'' Costa's  
lawyer, Robert Crossley, said in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will not let you get away with it without a fight,'' he  
wrote of his client, a veteran of the Metropolitan and San 
Francisco operas who supplied the singing voice for the 1959 Disney 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton said most of his neighbors have been very accommodating.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just completely without understanding that Mary Costa  
would not take the same position,'' Clayton said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A Knox County judge has issued a temporary restraining order  
preventing Clayton from using the driveway until he can study the 
case.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-U.K. Aviation Talks Off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Formal talks between the United States and the  
United Kingdom about a new aviation agreement were supposed to 
resume next week, but instead have been postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials expressed disappointment Thursday about the  
decision announced by the British government in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been nine months since we last had formal talks with the  
British government ... and the time frame for accomplishing such an 
agreement is growing increasingly short,'' said Transportation 
Department spokesman Bill Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear from what we've seen from the other side is  
there's an inability to develop a position,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hang-up reportedly stems from a dispute between British  
Airways and officials in the British Office of Fair Trading, as 
well as the country's transport offices. Both entities want the 
airline to surrender takeoff and landing slots at London's popular 
Heathrow Airport, but the airline apparently is balking at the 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have insisted on more slots since British Airways  
proposed an alliance with American Airlines in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two  
U.S. carriers -- American and United Airlines -- are allowed to fly 
into Heathrow. Business travelers in particular like the airport 
because it offers the most connections to international points. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an ``open skies'' deal, an unlimited number of carriers  
could serve any U.S. or British airport. U.S. officials believe 
added access to Heathrow would drive down airfares and give 
customers more flight selections. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations collapsed last fall after only three days of  
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, top transportation officials from both countries said  
preliminary talks would resume, with an eye toward returning to 
formal negotiations. Recently, both governments announced the 
formal talks would take place next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The British government said Wednesday in a statement: ``We are  
still refining our negotiating position in talks with the airlines. 
We've postponed our talks and no alternative date has been set.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Amtrak Train Ran Red Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Two Amtrak trains sideswiped as they  
passed each other early today, derailing several cars and slightly 
injuring eight people. One engineer had run a red light seconds 
before the crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Gober, lead investigator for the National Transportation  
Safety Board, said the engineer of the southbound Silver Palm 
radioed, ``I made a bad mistake. I made a bad judgment.'' The 
engineer's name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound train was traveling at 55 mph when it slammed  
into the northbound train, which was moving into a siding at 14 
mph, Gober said. The southbound train was supposed to have stopped 
while the other train moved to the siding. 
</P>
<P>
	One train was headed to Miami from New York City, while the  
other was on its way to New York City from Miami. The trains, both 
called the Silver Palm, were carrying a combined 300 passengers 
when they collided on the west side of downtown Jacksonville at 
about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Four locomotives and seven cars derailed, said Jane Covington, a  
spokeswoman for CSX Transportation, which owns the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Modesto Romero, his wife, Maria, and their children, Nelida, 11,  
and David, 14, were asleep in a cabin when the collision sent Mrs. 
Romero tumbling to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asleep and then I heard my wife. I jumped up and held up  
the top bunk where my kids were sleeping,'' said Romero, who was 
traveling to Miami from Newark, N.J., to visit relatives. ``They 
were a little scared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger Rhodell Green of Hollywood, Fla., said the accident  
jolted her out of her seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what happened. It felt like just a big hit,''  
she said. ``I thought we had run over a truck or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five of seven the injured were taken to St. Vincent's Medical  
Center, where they were treated for cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others were sent to Methodist Medical Center. Two were  
treated and released and another was being held for observation in 
the emergency room, said hospital spokeswoman Joy Batteh-Freiha. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling south were to be put on another train and  
northbound passengers were put on buses.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Activists Seek Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two vegetarians petitioned Parliament on Thursday  
for the right to appeal a judgment that they defamed McDonald's 
Corp. by claiming that its products are poisonous and cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Morris and Helen Steel are seeking to appeal to the House  
of Lords, Britain's highest court, to overturn a ruling that they 
pay the hamburger chain $64,000 in damages, their supporters said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The case, known widely in Britain as ``McLibel,'' resulted in a  
314-day trial, the longest in English history. Now it could go on 
even longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris and Steel said they were trying to defend the public's  
right to criticize companies whose business operations affect 
people's health and the environment. They argued that multinational 
corporations like McDonald's should no longer be allowed to sue for 
libel, the McLibel Support Campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's suffered an embarrassing  
public relations setback in March when an appeals court upheld the 
activists' claims that the chain sells heart-damaging food and 
treats its workers poorly. The court also did not dispute the 
original findings of a trial judge that McDonald's was responsible 
for animal cruelty and that it exploited children through its 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ultimately reduced the original damages award  
by $32,000, but upheld most of the libel verdict won by McDonald's 
against Morris and Steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists hope to persuade the House of Lords that they  
should have won their case against McDonald's outright. 
</P>
<P>
	If denied the opportunity to appeal to Parliament's upper house,  
Morris and Steel said would take the case to the European Court of 
Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Promise Massive Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Literally banging a drum for tax cuts, House  
Republicans insisted Thursday the federal budget surplus is so huge 
that Congress can cut taxes by nearly $1 trillion and still brace 
Social Security and Medicare for baby boomer retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders pledged to press ahead with their massive tax cut  
even though many GOP moderates, particularly in the Senate, believe 
it is too large and Democrats say its sheer size practically begs a 
presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year package outlined in general terms would include cuts  
in taxes on income, inheritances and investments, as well as breaks 
to encourage personal savings for retirement and education and to 
enable more people to afford health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders marched behind a drum and fife corps from the  
Capitol across Independence Avenue to a House office building to 
rally for tax cuts and tout a new Congressional Budget Office 
forecast showing the total budget surplus -- including Social 
Security funds -- is expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the largest surplus in history,'' said House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``As we commit ourselves to finding 
ways to secure our retirement programs, we also commit ourselves to 
bringing fairness to the tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new CBO estimate shows there will be a $996 billion surplus  
over the next decade, excluding money set aside for Social 
Security, an increase of $171 billion over its April projection. 
Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means 
Committee, wants to use the bulk of that for tax cuts, which would 
top the $778 billion originally envisioned in the GOP budget for 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are  
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' said Archer, 
R-Texas. ``If we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in 
Washington, the politicians surely will spend it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some moderate Republicans, however, say the  
surplus should first be used to beef up spending on priorities such 
as education, once Medicare and Social Security are safeguarded and 
the national debt is erased. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 
D-Mo., also said GOP tax cuts on such things as capital gains would 
mostly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really have left out the important priorities that we  
ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``We do need a 
tax cut. It can be far less expensive than this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats believe President Clinton will never sign a tax  
cut bill approaching $1 trillion, although he has said he is 
willing to consider a moderate bill using some of the surplus with 
benefits targeted to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate presents another roadblock to a $1 trillion tax cut.  
Because the GOP budget only allows for $14 billion of the new 
surplus estimate to be added to the tax package, it could take 60 
of the 100 senators to agree to boost the number by a penny more. 
The Senate has 55 Republicans, 45 Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans also want some of the newfound surplus to be  
used for more spending on key programs and for such things as 
helping Medicare recipients pay for prescription drugs, a top 
priority of Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're ready to say precisely how many dollars  
should be added to this tax cut,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, 
chairman of the House Budget Committee and a presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters he  
was ``excited'' by the House proposals but added that there was no 
``magic number'' for the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like for us to have the largest possible tax  
reduction,'' Lott said. ``But we have to get a bill ... through the 
Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most on Capitol Hill now believe there will be a tax cut  
of some kind, given the giant budget surpluses driven by America's 
booming economy. Some moderate Democrats, for instance, are 
discussing tax relief of roughly $500 billion, possibly including a 
capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a prevailing consensus that there ought to be a tax  
cut,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Now the question is 
how large it will be and what should be the components of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally Thursday was timed to give Republicans something new  
to talk about when they return to their home districts during next 
week's Independence Day recess. But the tax bill work won't start 
in earnest until July 14, when the Ways and Means Committee is 
scheduled to begin voting on its plan. 
</P>
<P>
	If any large tax cuts eventually pass, most of the impact will  
be delayed until after 2004 because, until then, the $2.9 trillion 
surplus is dominated by payroll taxes used to fund Social Security. 
After 2004, income tax revenue begins to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	And CBO had some words of caution about the surplus projections,  
saying that as baby boomers begin retiring in 2010 and relying in 
large numbers on Social Security and Medicare, ``budgetary 
pressures ... can easily reverse the favorable fiscal forces that 
are operating today.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Continues Abortion Funds Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Thursday to continue barring  
federal workers' health-insurance plans from covering most 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	By 51-47, senators approved language banning the benefit and  
included it in a $27.7 billion measure financing the Treasury 
Department and several smaller agencies in the coming fiscal year. 
The overall bill was approved by voice vote, and shortly afterward 
the Senate adjourned for a 10-day July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also leaves open the possibility that members of  
Congress will allow themselves a cost-of-living pay raise of about 
$4,600 next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an annual pay raise unless they  
vote to deny it. The Treasury bill is the traditional vehicle for a 
provision doing that, and so far it contains no such prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	A House version of the measure, approved only by a subcommittee  
so far, also lacks language that would block the pay raise. 
Lawmakers currently earn $136,700, a level they reached two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion prohibition for federal employees would allow  
exceptions for cases of rape, incest and when the woman's life is 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, sponsored the abortion ban, saying 73  
percent of the cost of federal workers' health plans comes from 
taxpayers' dollars. He said abortions ``violate the conscience of 
many taxpayers'' and federal dollars should not be used to pay for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the 1.2 million women  
affected by the prohibition would lose coverage for a procedure 
that privately employed women have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't repeal her right to choose, take away her ability  
to pay for what is legal,'' Boxer said of her opponents' tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said in a written statement the  
White House ``would strongly oppose'' the prohibition, but did not 
mention a veto threat. The ban has been included in the bill all 
but two years since 1983, DeWine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill includes $8.2 billion for the Internal Revenue  
Service, nearly $200 million less than this year. And it would cut 
President Clinton's $195 million request for an anti-drug media 
campaign by $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also used a voice vote to approve $411 million in  
federal contributions to the District of Columbia's city budget. 
The measure bans the use of federal or district funds for most 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee approved a $14.1  
billion measure financing federal land and cultural programs, and 
an $8.45 billion bill for military construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The land bill provides nearly $1.2 billion less than Clinton  
wants, cutting his requests for land and water conservation, 
purchase of property for federal and state parks, restoration of 
Florida's Everglades and energy conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee approved an amendment by Rep. Lucille  
Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., that would allow women to breast-feed in 
national parks or cultural institutions covered by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Minister Convicted on 'Black Tax' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A black minister was convicted of getting three  
people to file tax returns in which they claimed a nonexistent 
``black tax'' exemption that he insisted was available to 
descendants of slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Foster, 35, of Fort Worth could get up to 27 months in  
prison at sentencing Sept. 14. He was convicted on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people testified that Foster told them the ``black tax''  
exemption was a government reparation for descendants of slaves 
freed after the Civil War. No such reparations were ever 
authorized. One man actually received a $2,300 refund two years ago 
by making the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie Foster is not an American hero. You don't rope other  
hard-working people into this scam,'' prosecutor Terri Moore told 
the federal jury of three blacks and nine whites. ``He spread lies. 
He spread bad information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Greene, Foster's lawyer, argued that the IRS was holding  
Foster responsible for its own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury took less than an hour to convict Foster on three  
counts of filing false claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster himself got $30,085.89 back from the IRS after filing for  
the ``black tax'' exemption. The IRS caught the mistake, but Foster 
never gave the money back. No charges were ever brought against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of slave reparations has circulated since the end of the  
Civil War, when Congress voted to give freed slaves 40 acres and a 
mule. But President Andrew Johnson vetoed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate landed in the lap of the IRS after L.G. Sherrod, a  
journalist and economics consultant, wrote an essay in Essence 
magazine in 1993 in which she urged readers to use their tax forms 
to claim the modern-day equivalent of 40 acres and a mule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply enter $43,209 in `black taxes' and compute  
accordingly,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a flurry of filings that year and some later, and the  
story became an urban legend.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Lower; Dow Down 18.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today as investors pondered  
their course in the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 18.04 at 10,952.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were posting narrower losses. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.69 to 1,367.97, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was down 5.58 to 2,680.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices responded most dramatically today to the Federal  
Reserve's decision to raise interest rates one-quarter percentage 
point. After a rally Wednesday afternoon, bond prices sank today, 
pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.04 percent, up 
from 5.96 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That prevented stock prices from building on their own Wednesday  
rally. The Fed's decision and its accompanying policy shift to a 
``neutral'' bias on the need for future rate increases vaulted the 
Dow 155.45 higher to close at 10,970.80. The S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq 
each raced to new record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	A major contributor to the Nasdaq's weakness today was coffee  
company Starbucks, which surprised Wall Street with a forecast of 
lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the 
year. Starbucks shares fell 12 5/16 to 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 118.88 million 
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.11 at 646.02, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.08 at 796.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.89 percent to its  
highest close since September 1997. European indexes also gained 
strength from the U.S. interest-rate decision. In afternoon 
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 was up 2.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Undersea Cable Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department said Thursday it has  
begun an antitrust investigation of the undersea cable business, in 
which groups of telecommunications companies band together to build 
and maintain undersea cables. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices  
in the international undersea cable industry,'' said department 
spokeswoman Jennifer Rose. She declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Undersea cables are used to transmit telephone and Internet  
information around the world, and telecommunications companies have 
worked together for decades to finance them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the  
investigation Wednesday, said Sprint Corp. and Level 3 
Communications -- members of a consortium building an undersea cable 
between the United States and Japan -- had received Justice 
Department letters demanding information in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Thursday that AT&AMP;T Corp. also said  
it received such a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal also said Thursday the Federal Communications  
Commission was preparing to open an investigation of the undersea 
cable business.

<HEADLINE> Woman Comes Forward on Powerball Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEVILLE, Minn. (AP) -- A woman from central Minnesota came  
forward today and claimed a Powerball jackpot of $150 million, the 
third highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman from the Brainerd area came to lottery headquarters in  
this St. Paul suburb, and lottery officials confirmed she had the 
winning ticket from Wednesday night's drawing. Her name was not 
immediately released, pending a news conference set for this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole winning ticket had a jackpot worth $150 million if  
taken over 25 years, but the winner elected to collect all the 
money in a ``cash option'' lump sum worth $78.8 million, lottery 
director George Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	After state and federal tax withholding, he said, the winner  
will take home about $50.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, based in Iowa, is played in 20 states and the District  
of Columbia, and the sky-high pot attracted long lines of ticket 
buyers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sales are extremely out of control. It's just packed,''  
Deana Warner, manager at Pump N Pantry in Fond du Lac, Wis., said 
Wednesday. ``I don't know how to describe it. It's hard to explain 
the amount of business we're doing here. The ticket sales are 
astronomical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The largest Powerball jackpot ever won was $295.7 million last  
July 29. The winning ticket was bought by 13 machinists -- the 
``Lucky 13'' -- who worked together in Westerville, Ohio. An 
Illinois couple set a record in May 1998 for a single-ticket winner 
by hitting a $195 million Powerball jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
	Players select five numbers from a field of one to 49 and a  
single Powerball from among the numbers one to 42. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning numbers drawn Wednesday night were 5, 10, 12, 20, 40  
and the Powerball was 3. In addition to jackpot, there were 49 
tickets sold that matched the five regular numbers but missed the 
Powerball. Those tickets are worth $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Would-be winners' dreams ranged from practical to escapist.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would probably pay off my immediate bills, set up college  
education fund my kids, my nieces and nephews, maybe pay off my 
folks' mortgage,'' said Bruce Lund of Ankeny, Iowa. ``And then I'd 
sit down and probably set up some kind of foundation that I could 
run and be philanthropic with the rest of the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Kenworthy of Urbandale, Iowa, had something else in mind  
with the $5 he spent on Powerball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd go to Tahiti where the women don't wear no tops,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attends U.S. World Cup Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton wasn't the only fan who  
missed the national anthems. The United States' quarterfinal game 
in the Women's World Cup led to a 20-mile backup and thousands of 
high-priced empty seats at kickoff Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took three hours to get here from 25 miles away,'' said Jan  
Sorensen, rushing toward the gate just before halftime with three 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was awarded a quarterfinal  
doubleheader that likely to feature the United States, organizers 
figured closing the upper deck and having 41,000 seats to sell in 
the 80,000-seat stadium would satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Then United States games drew NFL-size crowds in first-round  
matches at East Rutherford, N.J., Chicago and Foxboro, Mass. After 
5,000 tickets were sold in 24 hours for the quarterfinal against 
Germany, organizers decided to make an extra 14,000 upper-deck 
seats available. 
</P>
<P>
	The attendance for the doubleheader, which included Brazil vs.  
Nigeria in the second game, was announced at 54,642. It was a 
response to an unprecedented frenzy never before seen for a 
women's-only sporting event in a country that usually revels in 
linebackers beating up quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about it, and honestly it bring tears to my eyes,''  
said Robert Cantelon, who drove from Ann Arbor, Mich., with his 
8-year-old daughter after buying tickets by phone Tuesday. 
``Because in America there is almost a spiritual experience to 
sports, especially if you're male and you've grown up that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's the sociology of sports in America, but  
part of being here is knowing there's something there for my 
daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, was there, too, along with two of  
her friends. The president, also accompanied by his wife and Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, arrived just before 
halftime of the United States-Germany game, watched the second half 
from a luxury suite. There were scattered boos when Clinton was 
shown on the stadium's large video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, won 3-2 the United States, Clinton met with the  
American players in their locker room. They chanted ``Clinton!'' as 
he posed for a group picture and invited him to the championship 
game later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us what an inspiration the team was, coming from  
behind,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said. ``I told him thanks for 
coming, it makes a ton of difference for this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was tardy simply because he was late leaving the White  
House. Other fans, without the benefit of a police escort, endured 
a backup that stretched halfway around the Capital Beltway. There 
were more than 5,000 empty seats in the sold-out lower level of the 
stadium for much of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty amazing that this many people show up for a  
game,'' said Mike Dooley, a non-soccer fan from Santa Cruz, Calif., 
who was coerced into coming with some local friends. ``It's 
semiunusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Public transportation wasn't a better option. Susan Cunningham,  
from Arlington, Va., and three friends waited 30 minutes for a bus 
at the subway station. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave up and took a taxi,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Parents Behaving Badly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gone are the days when Jimmy Connors' mom was considered a tough  
tennis parent because she sent hard-to-handle volleys whizzing 
toward her young son during practice at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your own mother would do this to you,'' Gloria Connors  
warned the toddler, ``just imagine what your opponents will try.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A quick glance across the women's bracket at Wimbledon this year  
reminds us it's a good thing the kids still play one another 
instead of their parents. Because looming behind too many headlines 
about young players grabbing the spotlight, or older ones finding 
their way back in, are stories about grownups behaving badly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do so many parents seem to be crossing the line now?  
Because the stakes are higher than ever,'' said Nick Bollettieri, 
whose Florida-based tennis academy accepts full-time students as 
young as age 9. ``Because it's easier than ever to lose sight of 
what their duties are. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, especially on the girls' side, parents start  
out in a protective role. Then they get caught up in the money, or 
the glamour, or living through their child's success. And before 
they know it,'' he said, ``the parents are way more involved than 
they ever planned to be -- or should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's quarterfinal between 16-year-old Jelena Dokic of  
Australia and 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson, suspended because of 
rain, was notable for several reasons. It not only matched two very 
young, very poised rising stars, it also marked the first time two 
qualifiers advanced to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dokic and Stevenson shared a troubling distinction, too.  
Both have parents who seem to be -- to borrow from Bollettieri's 
diplomatic vocabulary -- overinvolved in their children's careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dokic's father, Damir, has been warned by the WTA Tour to be on  
his best behavior at Wimbledon. This followed his ejection from a 
recent tournament in Birmingham, England, for verbally abusing 
match officials then taking his protest outside the grounds where 
he was arrested for laying down in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson's surprising run through the bracket, meanwhile, has  
hardly been discussed during her interviews. She's been too busy 
answering questions about her mother Samantha's allegations of 
racism and lesbianism on the tour. And that was before the 
teen-ager was asked whether basketball great Julius Erving was the 
father who was never present in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering questions about their parents was already a fact of  
life for three other quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf's father, Peter, has slipped quietly into the  
background after serving a sentence for tax evasion. But he made 
such a mess of his personal life and her business affairs a few 
years ago that she nearly landed in jail along with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman Graf beat Thursday, Venus Williams, handles inquiries  
about her father, Richard, with such aplomb these days it's clear 
she's had too much practice. Say what you want about how the elder 
Williams trained Venus and sister Serena to play tennis -- but one 
thing they've learned is how to handle hostile questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The last member of the not-so-exclusive club, Mirjana Lucic,  
fled her native Croatia late last year to escape an abusive father. 
Her story may be the saddest; she accused her father, Marinko, of 
beating her when she lost a match or didn't hustle in practice. 
Yet, parent problems aren't limited to the handful of women who 
reached the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Pierce's father, Jim, was is back at WTA events under what  
the tour calls ``severe restrictions.'' Those follow his banishment 
from WTA events between 1993 and 1998 for what was termed ``abusive 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for all the pleasant echoes that Jennifer Capriati's return  
to Wimbledon brought, it also served as a reminder of the 
too-much-too-soon syndrome that dominating parents have foisted on 
talented kids. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has a better perspective on the problem than Bollettieri,  
for whom pushy parents are both a blessing and a curse. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want the discipline they bring,'' he said. ``Separating  
that from the rest of the baggage is what's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bollettieri gets $30,000 a year for housing each of his 200  
full-time students. That means he has to balance the parents' 
dreams with what's realistic for their children. He has collected 
some of those experiences for a book due out in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Needless to say,'' he said, ``the chapter about parents is as  
touchy as it gets.''

<HEADLINE>  Women's Sports Getting TV Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Who needs Tim Duncan or Brett Hull? This is the weekend of women  
in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NBA and NHL seasons finished, the Wimbledon women, the  
Women's World Cup and the WNBA are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the All London Club still refuses to pay women equal  
prize money, viewers have been watching them more than the men in 
eight of the last nine tennis majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect that trend to change this year, even with Andre  
Agassi and Pete Sampras advancing deep into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not with American Alexandra Stevenson and 16-year-old Australian  
Jelena Dokic getting most of the attention so far and American 
Lindsay Davenport breezing into the semifinals. There's also a pair 
of World Cup matches on ESPN on Sunday and a WNBA game Saturday 
afternoon on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't have to worry much about the competition -- the X  
Games and some lesser-known golf tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup hasn't enjoyed the same level of success  
on television as it has with attendance, but its TV ratings still 
have been better than for regular-season NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, that's nothing to brag about.  
</P>
<P>
	``Women's sports are still difficult to succeed on weekend

between a pair of men's semifinals as it has done in the past.

Kournikova, Mia Hamm and Chamique Holdsclaw, girls growing up have 
a different outlook on female athletes nowadays.

<P>
	``These girls now want to grow up and be athletes,'' said NBC  
analyst and three-time Wimbledon champion Chris Evert. ``There are 
attractive, appealing girls out there and now they realize that's 
it is OK to run around and sweat and be tough. Twenty years ago it 
was frowned upon and wasn't feminine.''

<HEADLINE>  Women's Sports Getting TV Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Who needs Tim Duncan or Brett Hull? This is the weekend of women  
in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NBA and NHL seasons finished, the Wimbledon women, the  
Women's World Cup and the WNBA are taking over. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the All London Club still refuses to pay women equal  
prize money, viewers have been watching them more than the men in 
eight of the last nine tennis majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect that trend to change this year, even with Andre  
Agassi and Pete Sampras advancing deep into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Not with American Alexandra Stevenson and 16-year-old Australian  
Jelena Dokic getting most of the attention so far and American 
Lindsay Davenport breezing into the semifinals. There's also a pair 
of World Cup matches on ESPN on Sunday and a WNBA game Saturday 
afternoon on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't have to worry much about the competition -- the X  
Games and some lesser-known golf tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup hasn't enjoyed the same level of success  
on television as it has with attendance, but its TV ratings still 
have been better than for regular-season NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, that's nothing to brag about.  
</P>
<P>
	``Women's sports are still difficult to succeed on weekend  
afternoons because it's so crowded and traditionally it's been the

<HEADLINE> Phillips Ups Interest in Oil Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) -- Phillips Petroleum Co. announced an  
agreement Thursday that will expand its interest in a Venezuelan 
oil field and boost its worldwide reserves by 32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips agreed to exchange its 18 percent working interest in  
the LL-652 oil field in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, for two-thirds 
of ARCO's 30 percent working interest in the Hamaca heavy oil 
project in Venezuela's Orinoco Oil Belt. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange brings Phillips' share in the Hamaca project to 40  
percent, the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Texaco has agreed to acquire the remaining one-third of ARCO's  
Hamaca interest. The other 30 percent is held by Petroleos de 
Venezuela S.A. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies manage their interests through a joint  
operating company called Petrolera Ameriven. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips expects the Hamaca project to begin producing 36,000  
barrels per day in mid-2001, then reach peak production of 190,000 
barrels in 2004 and continue that level of production for 35 years. 
The cost for the project to reach peak production is $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the agreement supports a strategy of adding  
low-cost, long-life reserves to its portfolio.

<HEADLINE> Movie-Obsessed Youths Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two teen-age cousins who said they were  
inspired to kill by the teen slasher movie ``Scream'' have been 
convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Padilla, 17, was found guilty Thursday in the killing of  
his mother, 37-year-old Gina Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate jury convicted Samuel Ramirez, 15, earlier this week.  
That verdict was sealed until Padilla's panel returned its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Cheroske had banned any reference to the movie during  
the trial, but testimony at a preliminary hearing showed that the 
boys were obsessed with the film ``Scream'' and its sequel, 
``Scream 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the movies, teen-agers are knifed by killers in Grim Reaper  
costumes who are obsessed with horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Castillo was stabbed 45 times with four knives and a  
screwdriver in January 1998. Padilla and Ramirez said they attacked 
her while she was seated at her home computer. Padilla stabbed her 
and Ramirez held her down, according to their admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	During the preliminary hearing, one of the boys said that the  
slayings depicted were ``cool.'' And on the way home from one of 
many viewings, he told a pal: ``It was a perfect way to kill 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That testimony was not allowed at the trial, and when the taped  
confessions were played for the jury, their own mentions of the 
``Scream'' movies had to be edited out. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the defendants' ages, prosecutors are not seeking the  
death penalty. Padilla could get life in prison without parole. 
Ramirez, who was 14 at the time of the killing, faces up to 25 
years to life in prison. Both were tried as adults.

<HEADLINE> Apple Sues Rival Over iMac Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. accused a  
competitor Thursday of stealing the design of its iMac personal 
computers to make low-cost PCs unveiled at a computer show last 
week, complete with a curvy translucent look and five gemstone 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's complaint, filed in San Jose District Court, alleges  
Future Power Technologies, an 8-month-old Silicon Valley company, 
and Korea's Daewoo Telecom illegally copied iMac's unique features 
to make their E-Power PC. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a universe of original designs that Future Power and  
Daewoo could have created for their computers, but instead they 
chose to copy Apple's designs,'' said Steve Jobs, Apple's interim 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've invested a lot of money and effort to create and market  
our award-winning designs, and we intend to vigorously protect them 
under the law,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple, which declined to comment beyond the wording of its  
complaint, wants an injunction preventing the companies from 
distributing the E-Power computers. It's also seeking actual and 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Power created a sensation at the PC Expo in New York City  
last week with the E-power, which has a shape resembling the iMac, 
and comes in five translucent colors: amethyst, ruby, topaz, 
emerald and sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also like iMac, which Apple sells in strawberry, blueberry,  
grape, tangerine and lime -- the E-power has an all-in-one design 
and a single power cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the iMac, the E-power runs on Microsoft's Windows  
operating system and has a floppy disk drive. Also, it is priced to 
sell at two-thirds the cost of Apple's model. 
</P>
<P>
	Wired magazine reported from the PC Expo that Future Power  
didn't deny that iMac was its source of inspiration for E-Power -- 
the startup even held talks with Apple's lawyers before launching 
the new product, presumably in hopes of heading off a legal 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Future Power said the company would not  
comment until it received a copy of the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> INS' Role in Railroad Case Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department's top watchdog will  
investigate why the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained 
a Mexican national wanted for questioning in connection with 
several murders but let him go, the INS said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency's failure to  
identify Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old drifter charged in 
two murders and linked to six other slayings, ``has raised serious 
questions about the INS' knowledge of the case and procedures used 
in encounters with'' him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of these questions, I have referred the matter to  
the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General,'' said 
Meissner in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the INS' office of internal audits was reviewing  
INS procedures ``in an effort to avoid any similar situation in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general's office investigates waste, fraud and  
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS arrested Resendez-Ramirez in the El Paso area during the  
week of June 1 for being in this country illegally and deported him 
to Mexico later that day, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his June 2 release, authorities believe he killed  
a 73-year-old woman west of Houston. The following day, they 
believe he killed a 26-year-old Houston schoolteacher at her home. 
His fingerprints then were found June 15 in Gorham, Ill., at the 
scene of the murder of an 80-year-old man and his 52-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	INS officials said that when Resendez-Ramirez was in the custody  
of the Border Patrol on June 1, they didn't have any information on 
his criminal records or of any outstanding warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meissner said the INS had multiple entries on  
Resendez-Ramirez in a photo and fingerprint database that provides 
immediate identification of aliens apprehended by Border Patrol. 
The system became widely available in 1997 and 1998. Prior to that 
INS relied on a text database of names. 
</P>
<P>
	INS first encountered Resendez-Ramirez in 1976 after he was  
arrested in Michigan. He was returned to Mexico, but since that 
time has been deported from the U.S. on three occasions in 1985, 
1987 and 1991. He was also apprehended by Border Patrol agents 
eight times between January 1998 and the present. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said the Justice Department will look at why  
Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether INS knew about 
Resendez-Ramirez criminal activities after being contacted by local 
law enforcement earlier this year.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Open Lower; Dow Down 18.04 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today as investors pondered  
their course in the new interest rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 18.04 at 10,952.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were posting narrower losses. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 4.69 to 1,367.97, and the 
Nasdaq composite index was down 5.58 to 2,680.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices responded most dramatically today to the Federal  
Reserve's decision to raise interest rates one-quarter percentage 
point. After a rally Wednesday afternoon, bond prices sank today, 
pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.04 percent, up 
from 5.96 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That prevented stock prices from building on their own Wednesday  
rally. The Fed's decision and its accompanying policy shift to a 
``neutral'' bias on the need for future rate increases vaulted the 
Dow 155.45 higher to close at 10,970.80. The S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq 
each raced to new record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	A major contributor to the Nasdaq's weakness today was coffee  
company Starbucks, which surprised Wall Street with a forecast of 
lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the 
year. Starbucks shares fell 12 5/16 to 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 118.88 million 
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 2.11 at 646.02, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.08 at 796.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.89 percent to its  
highest close since September 1997. European indexes also gained 
strength from the U.S. interest-rate decision. In afternoon 
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 was up 2.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tapes Dropped From Cisneros Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government on Wednesday scaled back the  
number of tapes secretly recorded by Henry Cisneros' ex-mistress 
that it says are needed for the former housing secretary's upcoming 
conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors initially said they intended to use 34 of the 88  
tapes that Linda Jones recorded and later handed to federal agents 
investigating whether Cisneros conspired with Ms. Jones and others 
to conceal more than $250,000 in alleged hush money payments to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the sixth day of a pivotal pretrial hearing on the tapes'  
admissibility, prosecutor Jim Fleissner said the government now 
intends to use only 26 recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros' attorneys contend all 88 tapes -- which are copies of  
since-destroyed originals -- are inadmissible because they 
constitute ``tampered'' evidence and because Ms. Jones had an 
unlawful intent in making them. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings are central to prosecutors' contention that  
Cisneros, while under consideration for a post in the Clinton 
administration, conspired with Ms. Jones and two aides to conceal 
the scope of his payments to her from the FBI agents who were 
conducting his Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who headed the Department of Housing and Urban  
Development from 1993 through 1996, acknowledged to the FBI that he 
had provided financial support to Ms. Jones after publicity over 
their extramarital affair cost her marriage and career as a 
political fund-raiser. But prosecutors contend he falsely told the 
FBI that he never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-count indictment against Cisneros alleges that he paid  
her more than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. He has pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones testified last week that she began recording her phone  
conversations with Cisneros as their relationship soured and she 
scrambled for proof of his earlier verbal commitment to support her 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran afoul of Independent Counsel David Barrett in part for  
misrepresenting the tapes to his prosecutors, the FBI and Internal 
Revenue Service as originals and is serving 3 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Corroborating both prosecution and defense lawyers, a government  
tape expert testified Wednesday that all 88 tapes are copies. 
Prosecutors have acknowledged that five of the tapes they want to 
submit into evidence were altered by Ms. Jones, largely to 
eliminate passages in which she threatened Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
	Tape expert Bruce Koenig testified that at least five others are  
copies of copies. Many show signs of having been halted 
mid-recording or have short gaps that in some cases can be 
explained by the voice-activation recorders she used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koenig said there are no signs of conversations being  
manufactured either by splicing or adding information. ``That, I'm 
positive, didn't happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But under questioning from Cisneros lawyer Barry Simon, Koenig  
acknowledged that because all of the tapes are copies, it may not 
be possible to detect every alteration.

<P>
	``While they are entitled to their opinions, a group of less  
than twenty members in Iowa does not speak for the International 
Executive Board of the union and no one should think that they 
do,'' union president Stephen P. Yokich said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual rebuke of the Iowa council representing 18,000  
active members reflected top union officials' displeasure with the 
unilateral action as well as lingering reticence in labor about the 
Clinton administration's record on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice president  
was ``working to show the working men and women of the 
international UAW that Al Gore is their candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa UAW endorsed Vice President Gore on Sunday, the second  
show of support from organized labor in the key presidential caucus 
state. The UAW event, coming on the heels of an endorsement from 
Council 61 of the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, offered Gore key political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite occasional differences, union leaders have maintained  
friendly relations with the Clinton administration. But former Sen. 
Bill Bradley, Gore's only Democratic challenger, has made inroads 
with many unions, speaking recently to a Teamsters meeting in 
Orlando and Service Employees International Union members in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts saw the Iowa endorsements as a sign that labor was  
ready to put aside its differences with the Clinton administration, 
but Yokich's statement and the debate among the leaders of other 
national unions showed that differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the International Executive Board that is empowered to  
make endorsements for candidates for national office following a 
union-wide process of evaluation,'' Yokich said. ``That process is 
anything but finished at this point in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Korman, the UAW regional director for nine states,  
including Iowa, stressed that under the union's charter, state and 
local councils do not have the authority to endorse presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	While he backed Yokich's statement, he said it wasn't so much a  
rebuke as an effort ``to set the record straight -- that that was 
not a blanket endorsement of the Gore candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a push by some AFL-CIO officials to move ahead with  
an early endorsement of Gore has run into resistance from several 
large unions, according to a half-dozen union officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the call for an endorsement at the last AFL-CIO  
executive council meeting was AFSCME President Gerald McEntee, who 
garnered favor with top Democrats with an early endorsement of the 
Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But several unions, including the UAW, the Teamsters, and  
several building trades unions, angry about Clinton administration 
policies on trade and reticent to play such a big political chit 
early, spoke against an early endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people who think it would be a good bump for  
Gore to do that, but I think it would be contentious to say the 
least, and I don't think that does anybody any good,'' said Mike 
Mathis, the Teamsters' director of governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO executive council is considering whether it should  
make a recommendation on an endorsement when it meets in August. If 
it does, the recommendation would have to be acted upon by the 
biennial convention in October. Clinton and Gore have addressed the 
convention in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	But several labor officials questioned whether that would  
happen. The Teamsters, the largest AFL-CIO affiliate with 1.4 
million members, are inclined to wait until after the primaries 
before officially endorsing a candidate, Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a real strong push for an early endorsement,''  
Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salazar indicated that Gore recognized he had work to do to  
secure labor's backing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to work very hard to pursue the support of labor  
leaders and working men and women all across America because we 
think we can show them that Al Gore has fought very hard on issues 
that are important to them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Starbucks Expects Lower Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. shares tumbled today after the  
coffee retailer warned that shortfalls in its non-core businesses 
and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in 
lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60  
cents per share for fiscal 1999. But Starbucks late Wednesday 
predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the 
next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Starbucks  
shares skidded $11.68 3/4 to $25.87 1/2 -- a decline of 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in  
Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but 
that didn't happen, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever  
for the potential for significant profit growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet will play a role in that growth.  
</P>
<P>
	To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will  
form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice 
president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web  
site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and 
home furnishings as well as coffee products and music. He also said 
the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the 
Internet site later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said  
the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at 
$100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's  
customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more 
than $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.

<HEADLINE> Capital Planners Reject MLK Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capital planners on Thursday rejected a  
four-acre site near the National Mall that was proposed for a 
monument to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the project, already approved by Congress, now  
expect to look again at three sites close to the Lincoln Memorial, 
where King gave his ``I have a dream'' speech in 1963, five years 
before he was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 7-5 vote, the National Capital Planning Commission turned  
down the proposed site near memorials to Presidents Jefferson and 
Franklin Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Philosophically, it doesn't work,'' said Margaret G.  
Vanderhye, one of the three presidential appointees on the 
commission. ``We can do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johanna Hardy, representing GOP Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee,  
chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said the 
noise from planes at nearby Reagan National Airport was ``3,000 
times greater'' than at the three other sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission chairman, Harvey Gantt, said the noise from  
planes flying over the Jefferson and Roosevelt memorials is just as 
bad as at the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin Luther King would have approved what we're doing today,  
with everyone expressing different, passionately held opinions,'' 
said Gantt, a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Also unhappy with the decision was John Carter, vice president  
and manager of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Project 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're surprised and very disappointed,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter had come from Atlanta expecting an approval that would  
have enabled him to start an international competition for a 
design. Thursday's vote could delay the project by a year, Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission previously approved a 4 1/2 acre site, provided the  
King monument not encroach on the World War II Memorial to be built 
near the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) --Bond prices fell Thursday as traders cashed in on  
Wednesday's rally amid new inflation jitters and a reassessment of 
the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which shot up  
1 9/16 points Wednesday, fell 9/16 point on Thursday, or by $5.62 
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, rose to 6.00 percent from 5.96 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices had soared on Wednesday, even though the Federal  
Reserve raised a key short-term interest rate. The powerful rally 
was triggered by investor relief as the Fed suggested it won't 
raise interest rates for a second time later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, traders re-evaluated the Central Bank's actions and  
speculation grew that rates still might increase beyond the 
quarter-point increase of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As rates rise on new Treasury securities, the value of bonds  
already held by investors is depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	New economic data also revived inflationary fears and the  
specter of future interest rate hikes aimed at preventing the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported  
Thursday that the manufacturing sector expanded at a 
stronger-than-expected pace in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Treasury market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 3/32 point to 1/8 point, while prices of intermediate 
maturities fell 7/32 point to 3/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.64 percent, while  
the discount tumbled 0.11 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.52 
percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.99 percent as the discount fell 
0.03 percentage point to 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields remained at 5.05 percent, while the discount  
remained unchanged at 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 6.00 percent from 5.25 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/32 to 118 23/32, with the yield 
rising to 5.54 percent from 5.53 percent.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Mayor Edward Koch was taken by ambulance  
to a hospital today with chest pains and doctors found a blocked 
artery, his former press secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch, 74, arrived at his gym for his daily workout and began  
having pains, said George Arzt, his former spokesman and a close 
friend. He was taken to New York Weill-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The former mayor, who served three terms, was being treated in  
the cardiac care unit after doctors found he had a blocked artery, 
Arzt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch was briefly hospitalized in March for low blood pressure  
when he showed up for a workout at the same gym. He had a minor 
stroke while he was mayor in 1987 and has worked out regularly 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized briefly in 1991 when he collapsed during a  
workout and again in April 1997 after beginning a strict no 
carbohydrate diet and taking diet pills.

<HEADLINE> Congress To Get Olympics Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympic organizers on Thursday pledged  
full cooperation with congressional investigators looking into 
possible corruption in the bid for the 1996 Games, although they 
said there was nothing to find. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee investigators, who opened their  
probe in the wake of bribery allegations involving the 2002 Games 
in Salt Lake City, will have ``unfettered access'' to all records, 
including eight sensitive boxes of documents, said Billy Payne, 
former head of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said another 6,000 boxes of records will be made available to  
the public July 19, the three-year anniversary of the Atlanta 
opening ceremonies, with the eight boxes kept private. The wait is 
to set up a procedure for viewing the records, which will include 
access and retrieval fees yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta organizers said the investigators will find no  
wrongdoing in the records. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this thing broke in Salt Lake City, people started to  
wonder about Atlanta, saying, `Billy, say it ain't so,' '' said 
A.D. Frazier, former chief financial officer for ACOG. ``I'm here 
to say that it ain't so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chairs the subcommittee leading  
the investigation, welcomed the announcement of cooperation, even 
if it came after a harshly worded letter written to Payne Tuesday 
threatening subpoenas and other legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know all too well the path Salt Lake City organizers chose.  
...'' Upton said in a statement. ``Taxpayers deserve to know if the 
same thing happened in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to both Commerce Committee and Atlanta officials,  
investigators always had access to the eight controversial boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	But since Atlanta officials maintain they contain private  
information -- such as lists of donors wishing to remain anonymous, 
letters subject to attorney-client privilege and personnel files -- 
they asked the investigators not to make copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and state Attorney General  
Thurbert Baker have sued to see the records, saying they fall under 
the Georgia Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our day in court to prove our case,'' Payne said.  
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also were fearful the documents would become public  
through release in a congressional report or through news leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., said Thursday the  
organizers' concerns about confidentiality would be taken into 
consideration, but no promises would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue was who was to pay the $20,000 for copying all the  
documents. Payne said the Atlanta organizers would pay the bill and 
the investigators would get the copies they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an administrative matter that has been resolved,''  
Payne said. ``We have been cooperating with them all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, Frazier and former Atlanta mayor and ACOG co-chairman  
Andrew Young also announced that formal papers were filed Thursday 
to dissolve ACOG, a nonprofit corporation that had a $1.7 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we always said we would do,'' Payne said.  
``In a sense, we now celebrate the conclusion of our mission of 
organizing and celebrating the Centennial Olympic Games.''

<HEADLINE> Coka-Cola: Mold in Poland No Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Laboratory tests showed mold found in  
bottles of mineral water produced by Coca-Cola in Poland posed no 
health threat to consumers, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were conducted after a consumer last week saw  
particles of mold in a glass bottle containing roughly 12 ounces of 
Bonaqa brand mineral water. Coca-Cola found mold in some of its 
other products and on Wednesday recalled all of its beverages in 
Poland packaged in the small, returnable bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major withdrawal of Coca-Cola products in  
Europe in recent weeks, after some of the company's soft drinks 
were ordered off shelves in Belgium and France when consumers 
became sick. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses has been reported in Poland, and Coca-Cola  
officials said the mold only showed up in a fraction of the 
products. It halted production of beverages in the returnable glass 
bottles at its plant in southwest Poland when the consumer 
complaint arose June 25, company spokeswoman Sonya Soutus said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	New procedures for washing the returnable bottles were tested  
Thursday with Polish sanitary officials looking on, said Soutus. 
She said full production of beverages in the returnable bottles 
could resume as soon as Friday, with new bottle caps indicating the 
product underwent the more rigorous washing. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing by the TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute in The  
Netherlands showed the mold particles were inactive, according to a 
report from the laboratory distributed by Coca-Cola Poland Services 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our findings as described in this document do not indicate  
that consumption of the mineral water ... investigated by TNO could 
harm the health of the consumer,'' the laboratory's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	By recalling all of the small, returnable bottles -- Coca-Cola  
officials refused to say how many -- the company said it was taking 
extraordinary measures to maintain public trust in the quality of 
its products. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recall followed a damaging contamination of Coca-Cola  
products in Belgium and France that led to more than 200 people 
claiming they were ill, forcing a recall that cost at least $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola officials in Atlanta, Ga., where the corporate  
headquarters is located, said Wednesday the European health scare 
would harm the company's second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Poland, Coca-Cola first announced Tuesday night it was  
removing the small glass bottles of Bonaqa because of the mold. It 
expanded the recall Wednesday to all of its beverages packaged in 
the small glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonya Soutus, Coca-Cola's Central Europe communications manager,  
said the normal cleaning process failed to remove all the debris in 
what she called particularly dirty bottles. She said all returnable 
bottles in Poland now would be washed twice at a higher 
temperature.

<HEADLINE> NYC Targets Three-Card Monte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Think you can win a game of three-card monte in  
Times Square? Then you might be interested in buying a certain 
bridge in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of winning the so-called game of chance are that  
bad. In fact, according to a New York City Council committee, 
there's no chance of winning at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The council moved this week to close a legal loophole that  
declared the vintage street scam a game of skill. The proposed rule 
would put three-card monte in a league with loaded dice and rigged 
roulette wheels, making it illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, the odds of winning are one-in-three: one red card is  
mixed with two black cards. The dealer flips the cards madly atop a 
cardboard box, inviting the players to pick the red one when the 
shuffling stops. 
</P>
<P>
	The wager is generally $20 a game. Participants inevitably wave  
goodbye to their cash, suckered by any number of sleight of hand 
moves that stack the odds fully in the dealer's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a con game,'' Councilman Sheldon Leffler, head of the  
council committee on public safety, said Wednesday. ``We're 
protecting people against fraud, larcenies, being duped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Too true, says Penn Jillette, the 6-foot-6 verbal half of the  
illusionists Penn and Teller. Before relocating to Las Vegas, he 
watched Times Square's three-card monte masters in action. 
</P>
<P>
	Can the dealers ever lose?  
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible,'' he begins, ``that the operator could be hit  
by an asteroid ... and your $20 could fall off his cardboard box 
and land on the ground, and while you were picking it up, $5 could 
blow into your hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``You therefore could win $5 by a simple twist of fate.''  
</P>
<P>
	And without cosmic intervention? ``Your chances of winning,''  
Jillette says brightly, ``are absolutely zero.''

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Shuts Down Video Poker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- Nearly one-third of Louisiana's 15,000  
video poker machines fell silent at 12:01 a.m. Thursday in one of 
the nation's biggest rollbacks of legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in 33 Louisiana parishes voted 2 1/2 years ago to get rid of  
the machines, which are set up at truck stops, bars, racetracks, 
casinos and other locations. Thirty-one parishes voted to keep 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 4,874 of the devices were simultaneously turned off  
after midnight by a computer program at State Police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I play. It's fun,'' said Joy Clark from the Cajun  
Circus Casino, where 50 machines were shut down. ``It's a good 
thing to do. But a lot of people come in to try to pay the 
mortgage. That's when it doesn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents hailed the shutdown as evidence that states can remove  
entrenched forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, lawmakers in South Carolina, the state with the  
most video gambling machines, at 34,000, approved a bill to let 
voters decide whether to ban the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a ban had been sought by former South Carolina Gov. David  
Beasley, who called the machines the ``crack cocaine of gambling'' 
in 1998. Several months earlier, on a sweltering day, a 10-day-old 
girl suffocated after being left in a car while her mother gambled 
at a video poker casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Beasley, a Republican, was defeated in 1998 by Gov. Jim Hodges,  
who received critical support from the video gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana shutdown is possibly the largest since the spread  
of legalized gambling in the late 1980s. The Legislature legalized 
the machines in 1991, and they went into operation the following 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996, lawmakers called for a parish-by-parish vote on  
video poker after critics said the machines were being played 
mostly by local residents and sucked money out of local economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines will remain on riverboat casinos in and around New  
Orleans, Shreveport, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	Some machine owners marked the shutdown with parties for their  
customers. Others let the night pass quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any reason to celebrate something that's  
been so important to us,'' said Bruce VanZandt, who owns the 
Sundown Tavern in Ruston. 
</P>
<P>
	State police estimate state and local governments will lose $72  
million a year in taxes from the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ascension Parish, taxes from video poker helped pay for a  
retirement home, a new town hall and new police cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy Keenan, manager of LaFonda's Restaurant and Lounge in  
Baton Rouge, said she will have to raise her menu prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm losing almost 10 percent of my business with video poker,  
and I'm not taking back my employees' salaries,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Promise Massive Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the federal government awash in money,  
House Republicans promised today to pass a massive tax cut that 
includes broad income tax relief and cuts in taxes on capital gains 
and estates. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the size of projected  
federal surpluses should allow Congress and President Clinton to 
ensure the future solvency of Medicare and Social Security as well 
as cut taxes over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have the largest surplus in history,'' Hastert told a  
Capitol Hill rally. ``As we commit ourselves to finding ways to 
secure our retirement programs, we also commit ourselves to 
bringing fairness to the tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without announcing specifics, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the  
House Ways and Means Committee chairman, said the tax bill would 
include broad income tax relief for ``everyone who made this 
surplus possible,'' as well as changes to fix the ``marriage 
penalty'' in which millions of two-income couples pay more than 
they would if single. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said that  
options for the broad-based income tax cut under consideration 
included reductions of 1 percent a year across the board -- for a 
total of 10 percent over the decade -- and upward adjustment of the 
lowest 15 percent bracket so that more people would pay at a lower 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Archer said the measure would phase out estate  
taxes, reduce capital-gains taxes on investments retroactively to 
today, increase the amount of money people can contribute to 
Individual Retirement Accounts and extend expiring business tax 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans today are paying higher taxes than any time in  
peacetime history,'' Archer said. ``They have the right to pay 
less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Archer this week had said the bill could reach $1  
trillion or more, new Congressional Budget Office forecasts for the 
10-year surplus would leave Republicans just short of that figure. 
The budget resolution passed earlier by Congress envisions tax cuts 
of $778 billion over the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., called the plan  
``totally irresponsible'' because it would not eliminate the public 
debt and would prevent investments in areas such as education. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really have left out the important priorities that we  
ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``We do need a 
tax cut. It can be far less expensive than this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, as budget surplus projections keep rising, fewer members  
of either party are seriously suggesting there should be no tax cut 
at all. The argument is increasingly becoming how large and who 
stands to benefit most. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's money for more things,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan of New York, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet moderate House Republicans told Hastert at a lunch Wednesday  
that they oppose using improving budget surplus projections to add 
to the $778 billion, 10-year tax cut already envisioned by the 
GOP's budget blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have a very large tax cut,'' said Rep. Michael  
Castle, R-Del. ``We're struggling to increase all our 
appropriations bills for education, health, the welfare of the 
country. ... My own personal vote is we should not increase the tax 
cut at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment is shared by many Senate Republicans, who say  
they would prefer a bill that can attract Democratic support and 
that could be signed by Clinton, as opposed to a political 
statement aimed at the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a decision to make,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.  
``Do we align ourselves with some kind of symbolic statement ... or 
do we fashion a doable measure? Let's move this forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For conservative Republicans, a tax cut of up to $1 trillion is  
a clear signal to voters they want to stop government from 
expanding through new spending out of the surplus, which they 
consider an overpayment by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a trillion-dollar overage,'' said Rep.  
J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. ``It's important for us to show that we are 
here to provide much-needed tax relief for American families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats are also beginning to craft alternatives as the  
tide of surplus cash erodes their arguments that Social Security 
and Medicare cannot be made solvent for the future if Congress 
passes a massive tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., co-sponsor with Coverdell of a  
more modest tax package that embraces some of the House bill's 
concepts, said up to 15 Senate Democrats could support a tax cut if 
it is no larger than $500 billion over 10 years and is targeted to 
the middle class. Clinton has indicated he might sign a moderate 
bill as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``There clearly is considerable momentum building for a  
middle-income tax cut,'' Torricelli said. ``The fight is becoming 
not whether there should be a tax cut, but who gets the dividend.''

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans, Pork All Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures prices collapsed Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as moderating Midwest temperature forecasts 
set the stage for bumper fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, natural gas futures fell sharply, while pork  
futures retreated once more. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors removed a weather premium that had buoyed the market  
earlier this week on fears that temperatures in the upper 90s 
across the Midwest and parts of the Plains would damage young 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronomists earlier had suggested corn crops in Illinois and  
Iowa, the two largest growing states, were particularly vulnerable 
since they are entering the crucial pollination period that sees 
ears beginning to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
	But while temperatures are expected to soar, beneficial rainfall  
has been and is expected to continue to fall across growing regions 
through the weekend. And the hot weather is expected to abate by 
midweek. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean farmers this spring and early summer have  
enjoyed relatively few weather problems, putting them on track to 
harvest a record soybean crop and the fourth-largest corn crop on 
record, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	World inventories, meantime, remain high following bumper  
harvests for Brazil and Argentina and ample U.S. supplies. World 
demand has been rising amid recovering economies in Asia, but not 
quickly enough to reduce stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn for September corn fell 8 cents to $2.08 1/4 a bushel;  
September wheat fell 5 1/2 cents to $2.58 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans 
fell 8 cents to $4.52 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after an industry report showed supplies in storage rose 
at a sharper-than-expected rate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gas Association reported natural gas in storage  
rose 91 billion cubic feet to 2.03 trillion cubic feet last week. 
That put supplies 1.1 percent higher than this time a year ago and 
left them at 63 percent of storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas is used to power turbines at electrical plants for  
air conditioning and heating. But with forecasters calling for 
moderating temperatures and industrial demand expecting to fall 
over the long Fourth of July holiday, there was little buying 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	August natural gas fell 8.5 cents to $2.309 for each 1,000 cubic  
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and unleaded gasoline edged higher, posting new 19-month  
highs, as investors bet inventories later this year will dwindle as 
world oil producers continue to limit production. 
</P>
<P>
	August crude rose 10 cents to $19.39 a barrel; August unleaded  
gasoline rose .26 cent to 57.03 cents a gallon; August heating oil 
fell .20 cent to 48.82 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, continuing a weeklong retreat brought on by concerns 
about large swine herds. 
</P>
<P>
	August lean hogs rose .03 cent to 44.60 cents a pound; August  
pork bellies fell .30 cent to 36.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Does Gore Independence Bug Clinton? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a political pastime, watching presidents  
and vice presidents for signs of stress or rifts between them is a 
Beltway favorite. Never more than now, as Al Gore tries to show his 
independence from President Clinton -- especially from his scandals 
-- for the 2000 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is said to have been angered at Gore's hard words about  
his personal conduct when the vice president kicked off his 
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But those reports come with no names on them, as is customary in  
such situations. Rift-watchers note that there has been no firm 
denial Clinton was miffed, and so judge that he must have been. 
That may well be the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is what it all means, and the answer is probably  
not much. Although not for lack of stoking, as in the New York Post 
commentary of sometime Clinton adviser Dick Morris, who calls it 
war and says Clinton is furious, livid. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House says not. ``I talked to him half a dozen times  
while we were in Europe about the Gore announcement, the speech, 
the coverage, and he never expressed any anger to me,'' said Joe 
Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure point was said to have been Gore's description of  
the president's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair as 
inexcusable, and his lament of all the time wasted from real 
business because of it and the impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	That's certainly nothing Clinton hadn't heard before. But he had  
not heard it so vehemently from Gore, the loyal lieutenant who 
called him one of history's great presidents the day the House 
impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	In these situations, it is not unusual for people around a  
president or a vice president to talk, without attribution, about 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
	White House chief of staff John Podesta told Clinton aides on  
Monday that the president is with Gore 100 percent, and that none 
of them should be suggesting otherwise. He said there should be no 
more gossip or speculation about the relationship. His instructions 
to aides who might do otherwise: ``Keep your mouth shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff got much the same message. For his campaign, rumors  
of a president miffed at his rebukes might not be a bad thing, 
given the polls reporting a certain weariness with Clinton. 
Whatever the mood swings, the president is pushing hard for Gore 
and accords him a share of the credit for a major political asset, 
the thriving economy and surplus budget. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been that way for vice presidents.  
</P>
<P>
	When Richard M. Nixon ran in 1960, he claimed that his two terms  
in the job had given him broad experience in making tough 
decisions. But President Dwight D. Eisenhower undercut that, saying 
that he'd made the decisions and no one else, although Nixon 
sometimes was consulted. Then he made it worse by saying that he 
couldn't remember a major idea of Nixon's the administration had 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyndon B. Johnson kept his political thumb on Hubert H. Humphrey  
in 1968, balking when the vice president attempted even a minor 
break from administration bombing policy in the Vietnam War. The 
handicap was enough to prompt liberal Democratic governors to 
suggest to Humphrey that he resign as vice president and run as his 
own man. He said that was out of the question. Humphrey lost, 
narrowly, to Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he had to resign in a kickback scandal, Vice President  
Spiro T. Agnew took conservative issue with Nixon's initial 
openings toward China, complaining about exchange visits that were 
preludes to the reopening of official contacts. He did so off the 
record, but that cover didn't last a day. The White House silenced 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	There's always friction when a vice president starts campaigning  
to succeed the president he has served and needs to carve a role of 
his own. It is not an easy transition; George Bush, in 1988, is the 
only modern vice president elected directly from that job to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strains usually are concealed or denied, or have been  
for the past 60 years, since Vice President John Nance Garner's 
break with Franklin D. Roosevelt. Garner, no fan of the New Deal 
anyhow, wanted the Democratic nomination for himself in 1940, and 
declared himself a candidate a year in advance. To no avail. FDR 
broke tradition, ran, and won, with a new No. 2.

<HEADLINE> False Call of Rifle by White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police closed streets near the White House and  
Secret Service agents checked several buildings after an unfounded 
report today that a man with a rifle was spotted on a rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedestrians were barred from the area around the White House  
where security already had been tightened because of Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak's visit with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 1/2-hour search was triggered by an anonymous phone call to  
the Park Police that a man with a rifle was seen on a rooftop 
across from the Treasury Department building. While authorities 
searched buildings, a Park Service helicopter surveyed from above. 
</P>
<P>
	``A search was made and we were unable to corroborate the story  
or that someone had a gun,'' said Secret Service spokesman John 
Tomlinson. ``We're saying it was unfounded and we're opening the 
streets back up to traffic. The search is over.''

<HEADLINE> Headmaster After Fox Sitcom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENT, Conn. (AP) -- It's been eight years since he graduated from  
prep school and Seth MacFarlane is still being scolded by the 
headmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	MacFarlane, a 1991 Kent School alumnus, is the creator of ``The  
Family Guy,'' an animated satire on Fox television that infuriates 
the Rev. Richardson Schell. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Kent School is leading a one-man campaign to get  
advertisers to drop their sponsorship of the show, which chronicles 
the travails of a doofus husband, his wife, their slacker 
teen-agers, homicidal toddler and trilingual pooch. 
</P>
<P>
	Schell, who was in London on Thursday and could not be reached  
by telephone, told The New York Times that he finds the show 
``obnoxious.'' He also objects to the fact that the name of the 
cartoon family, Griffin, is the same as that of his assistant at 
the Kent School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with Seth, and it is not a personal  
vendetta,'' Schell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schell, headmaster at the Kent School for 18 years, has asked  
such major companies as PepsiCo., Philip Morris, DaimlerChrysler 
and Sprint to drop ``The Family Guy.'' Philip Morris and Sprint 
have withdrawn their ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Jokes on the show have touched on racism, politics and cult  
suicide. One gag involved a toy called ``G.I. Jew.'' In another, a 
boy shoots the head off a John F. Kennedy Pez dispenser, then says: 
``At least I have my Bobby Kennedy Pez dispenser to back him up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox spokeswoman did not return a message Thursday. MacFarlane,  
speaking through a Fox official, declined to comment, the Times 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Schell wrote the advertisers on behalf of ``Proud Sponsors  
USA,'' a group he acknowledges has a membership of one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Proud Sponsors, that's my name, that's me,'' he said. ``The  
reason I did it is I'm head of a school and I didn't want in any 
way to implicate the school in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Shafer, a spokesman for Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint,  
said letters from Schell and others prompted the company to 
undertake its own review of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show is out there on the edge, in terms of subject matter  
and the way that it deals with controversial subjects,'' Shafer 
said. ``The show was risky enough that we felt it didn't match the 
advertising goals of our brand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris spokeswoman Mary Carnavale said the show was  
inconsistent with the company's emphasis on diversity, in part 
because the main characters are all white and in part because of 
the potentially offensive racial and ethnic subject matter.
