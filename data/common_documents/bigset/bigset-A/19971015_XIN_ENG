<HEADLINE> EU Forecasts Positive Economic Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, said today that Europe's
economic recovery is well established, with its economic growth
gaining speed.
</P>
<P>
The autumn economic forecasts published by the EC said the
situation is in line with the trend implied in the Commission
services' spring forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The figures published today forecast average gross domestic
product (GDP) growth in the EU to strengthen progressively from
1.8 percent in 1996 to 2.6 percent in 1997, and to 3.0 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the spring forecasts published in April, the
figures represent an upward revision of 0.2 percent of GDP in both
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The same trend is observed at the level of most individual
member states. The EU growth is expected to accelerate further to
3.1 percent in 1999, on the assumption of unchanged economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
The report says member states are making good progress with
economic convergence required for participation in the EMU
(Economic and Monetary Union).
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain at historically low levels --
the EU average is expected to be 2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.2
percent in 1998, apparently putting 14 member countries on track
to respect the Treaty criterion for inflation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This has confirmed the Commission's view that a majority of
member states should be capable of meeting the necessary
conditions to participate in the euro from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicates positive improvements in the
employment situation in Europe, but says the member states need to
take further structural measures to ensure more significant
reductions in the levels of employment.

<HEADLINE> GCC to Finish Commodity Classification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) committee met today in Saudi capital Riyadh to finalize the
classification of commodities as part of an effort to unify
tariffs among its member nations.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the GCC said the customs committee is
working on the remaining 36 commodities prior to the GCC summit
scheduled for December in Kuwait, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,240 commodities had been categorized in accordance with
an internationally accepted classification list in the previous
meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The GCC summit is expected to give the final say on the
unification of tariffs, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The commodities fell into three categories - goods exempted
from tariffs, basic goods to be levied for a tariff of 4 to 12
percent, and other goods without a set tariff limit.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Al-Khlaifi, GCC's assistant secretary general for
economic affairs, expressed optimism Monday that the organization
would soon finish the work of unifying tariffs, which at present
range from 4 to 25 percent in different countries.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the unification of tariffs among GCC member
nations would prove be a major step toward the proposed formation
of an Arab common market in the future.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political and economic organization founded in 1981,
consists of six Arab countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Unveils Investment Plan in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
permitted some of its companies to do business with the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The state-invested Korea Land Corporation (KOLAND) and four
other firms were endorsed to do business in the DPRK's
Rajin-Sonbong Free Economic Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
The KOLAND, with Pyongyang's Committee for Promotion of
External Economic Cooperation as its partner, is planning to build
a 1,320,000 square meters industrial park in the zone through
direct investment, the first investment in the DPRK by Seoul.
</P>
<P>
It hopes to expand the construction of the industrial park, the
first of its kind in the zone, to 6.6 million square meters by the
year 2000, the KOLAND said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to take inter-Korean economic cooperation into a
higher gear," said Cho Kun-shik, director-general of the
Intra-Korean Interchange and Cooperation Bureau at the Ministry of
National Unification.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the four other companies are not hesitating in
investing in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Daesang Super Express Incorporation is expected to pour 4.2
million U.S. dollars into a logistics center.
</P>
<P>
Samchuly Bicycle Industrial Company and LG Business will
jointly invest with the DPRK's Kwangmyonsong General Trading
Corporation in an 8-million-dollar bicycle factory.
</P>
<P>
Taeyong Fisheries and LG Business, together with
Kwangmyongsong, will invest two million dollars in a scallop farm
in either Wonsan or Rajin-Sonbong.

<HEADLINE> German 1998 Economic Growth Set for 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's gross domestic product
(GDP) will increase by 2.5 percent this year and the growth will
rise to 3 percent next year, a leading German economic institute
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic report released today, the Cologne-based
Institute for German Economy said about 130,000 jobs will be
created in western Germany in 1998 while some 30,000 jobs will be
lost in the eastern half of the country.
</P>
<P>
This will bring some relief to the country's record high
unemployment, which stood at nearly 4.5 million in September, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The current economic upswing could almost solely be attributed
to booming exports, which were expected to expand by 9 percent
this year, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
A quick solution to the current standstill in structural
reforms would be a key remedy to revive the weak domestic demand,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Papon Trial Revives Memory of 1961 Massacre of Algerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The proceeding trial of former
Vichy official Maurice Papon for crimes against humanity has
revived memories of another distinctly different atrocity
connected with Papon -- the 1961 massacre of Algerians by Paris
police.
</P>
<P>
Papon is being tried for his role as a Vichy official in the
deportation of 1,690 Jews from southwest France to Nazi death
camps, from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
He was Paris police chief when the massacre took place on
October 17, 1961, a few months before the end of the 1954-1962
Algerian War.
</P>
<P>
The French civil group, Movement Against Racism, Anti-Semitism
and for Peace (MRAP), is organizing a series of actions to
memorize the victims of the 1961 massacre, including a press
conference on Friday in Bordeaux where Papon is standing trial.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration will be held in Paris on Friday at the Pont
Saint-Michel by the Seine River, which was the scene of the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
French police brutally suppressed a peaceful demonstration by
Algerians in Paris, who defied a curfew imposed on them on October
17, 1961. The government said three were killed and 64 injured in
the suppression, but the actual number of victims stood at around
200.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were drowned after being thrown into the
Seine, crushed by subway trains after being pushed onto the tracks
by police, beaten to death or shot.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-Semitism led to the crimes of the Vichy: anti-Algerian
racism allowed the massacre of October 17, 1961," said the MRAP in
a communique today.

<HEADLINE> Oslo to Host Conference on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- An International Conference on
Child Labor will be held in Oslo, Norway, on October 27-30, the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference, to be hosted by the Norwegian
government with the participation of the International Labor
Office (ILO) and UNICEF, is to contribute to the development of
new strategies to eliminate child labor at national, regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
According to new estimates quoted by UNICEF, more than 250
million children between the ages of five and 14 work today around
the world, in countries rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children are at risk from hazardous and intolerable
forms of labor. Many are denied education and trapped in cycles of
poverty. Their most basic rights, their health and even their
lives are sometimes placed in jeopardy.

SANTIAGO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile's international striker
Ivan Zamorano said he would not miss the decisive World Cup
qualifier against Bolivia on November 16.
</P>
<P>
Zamorano, who plays in Inter club of Italy, has been absent
from three qualifying matches due to a pulled muscle.
</P>
<P>
A win of the decision will send Chile on the way to the 1998
France finals. The other three qualifying teams in South American
zone are Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay, alongside with
defending champion Brazil, who qualifies for finals automatically.
</P>
<P>
"It would be very difficult for me to miss such an important
match," said the 31-year-old Chile best matchmaker, who tops the
scorers list of South American series with 12 goals.
</P>
<P>
Zamorano came back for Sunday's match against Peru, in which
Chile thrashed Peru 4-0, though he just sat on the bench watching.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Opposes UNESCO Joining Celebration of Ottoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today expressed his opposition to the participation by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
in the celebration by Turkey of the 700th anniversary of the
founding of the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the remark after a meeting with Armenian President
Levon Ter-Petrossian in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNESCO's participation in the ceremonies could be
considered by Armenians as an insult to 2 million victims of the
1915-1918 genocide committed by Turkish troops against Armenians,
who were considered to be allied with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that "Turkey can do all the ceremonies it wants,
as this is its most strict right." But he added that he is not
favorable to a participation by UNESCO to "these commemorations
of repetition."
</P>
<P>
"I have the intention to say that one cannot celebrate
everything, at the risk of reviving the memories which are
historical and which can lead to aggressive reactions or defense,
which can hurt, which can humiliate. Thus one should be prudent,"
said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Seeks Government Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro sent the government back to parliament today for a
confidence vote after the caretaker government and the Communist
Refoundation party reached a compromise on the 1998 draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The announcement from the president's office came following a
deal between the government and the hard-left party on a program
to ensure Italy's entry into the single currency union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Considering it was necessary to resume the work of both
government and parliament immediately, Scalfaro rejected Prime
Minister Romano Prodi's resignation and told him to go before the
parliament "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Prodi tendered his resignation to the president last Thursday
after finding it was not possible for his draft budget for 1998 to
be passed by parliament without the support of the communist
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Refoundation party, holding the balance of power
in the lower house of parliament, complained that the budget had
too many deep cuts in social and welfare spending and few measures
to stimulate employment, and vowed to back away from it.
</P>
<P>
The budget would help the country become one of the charter
members of the European economic and monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Quebecers Are Facing Reality, Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said people in the French-speaking province of Quebec are
facing reality about the consequences of separation.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by provincial premiers to solve the unity crisis and
his own government's work have opened up communication between
Quebec and the rest of Canada, providing a reality check for
Quebecers, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"This road to heaven just by voting independent has to be put
in a realistic context, and it's what we've been able to do for
the last two months," he was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
The premiers' unity initiative in Calgary and the "war of
words" between the federal and Quebec government have helped
clarify the issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Before, they (separatists in Quebec) were selling a dream, and
now I guess that they have to look at the reality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several
decades. People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of
separation in the October referendum two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold
another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial
election, which is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he
promises another referendum in the next election because "people
in Quebec don't want any referendum," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
"They're fed up. They don't want us to discuss that any more.
He (Bouchard) is dividing the families, creating economic
uncertainty," Chretien added.

<HEADLINE> Common-law Couples More Common in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Marriage has lost its appeal and
common-law is becoming increasingly popular in Canada, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Of all family structures, growth was strongest among
common-law couple families," the federal statistics agency said in
its third release today about the 1996 census.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, common-law couple unions rose 28 percent from that of
1991. And one couple in seven in the country was living by
common-law, compared to about one in nine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Common-law families were by far the most frequent in Quebec
province, where one couple in four lived common law.
</P>
<P>
While common-law unions had traditionally been more prevalent
among people in their early 20s, they have become more popular
among older individuals as well.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, marriage appears to be a fragile bond for more
and more individuals.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were over 1.6 million people who said they were
divorced, a 28 percent increase from 1991.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Drops Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation was pegged at 14.4 percent in September, in a drop that
came as a surprise to many in the market who had expected the
rate to be higher, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rate was 3.6 percent lower than August figure of 18
percent and came against the backdrop of warnings of severe
underlying inflationary pressures by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
(RBZ) during the month.
</P>
<P>
While details about the cause for the decline were not
available, most market analysts were sceptical about the
authenticity of the figures produced by the central statistical
office.
</P>
<P>
President of Zimbabwe Economics Society Kenias Mafukidze
described the latest set of figures as "unbelievable", especially
following the recent statement by RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba who
warned that inflation could be as high as 21 percent by the year
end.
</P>
<P>
Financing of the 1997/98 budget deficit, recent wage and
salary settlements and a spate of administered price increases
during the past few months had been expected to exert pressure on
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit, which was last year 7.1 percent of gross
domestic product, is this year expected to be over 12 percent as
the impact of the government's decision to pay former freedom
fighters over five billion Zimbabwe dollars (400 million U.S.
dollars) in gratuities and pensions starts to trickle into the
economy.

finishing touches to the document on the ZIMPREST which would
target alleviation of poverty and reduction of rampant
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"It is my intention to bring the ZIMPREST document to
parliament as soon as it is brought before cabinet. It is my
intention to place it before cabinet in the next week or two," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa also commented on lessons learnt from the first phase
of the economic structural adjustment program (ESAP one)
(1991-95), saying reform program must embody the aspirations of
the people and must resolve the imperatives of giving the
majority of the people a meaningful stake in the economy of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The reform program must be pursued as a coordinated program
for the whole of government and the community.
</P>
<P>
The reform program, he added, should be an integrated package,
and any seepage in one direction would have profound
repercussions in the other areas.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Production Price Index Falls in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annual
production price index (PPI) for August fell to 5.9 percent --
the lowest since May 1996 when it was 5.8 percent, Central
Statistics Services (CSS) figures show.

<P>
The monthly increase in this index also slowed down to 0.1
percent compared with 0.2 percent in July, South African Press
Association quoted CSS as saying.

<P>
The annual rate of increase in the PPI for locally produced
commodities in August was 6.5 percent, 1.0 percentage point lower
than July. From July to August, this index increased by 0.4
percent, while the seasonally adjusted index went up by 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The PPI for imported commodities reflected an annual increase

corresponding annual rate of 3.9 percent in July and the lowest
since March 1994, when it was also 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
From July to August, this index declined mainly due to a
decrease of 9.1 percent in the price of imported crude petroleum,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sanctions Should be Used Sparingly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- As the Sixth Committee
(The Legal) continued its discussion on the implementation of
Security Council sanctions, many representatives expressed the
views that sanctions should only be used as a last resort when all
other means of settling disputes had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the sixth Committee, Sudanese representative Omer
Dahab Fadol said sanctions must be resorted to as a last measure
and in exceptional instance, after all means of peaceful
settlement of disputes had been exhausted. It must "be limited in
time and must not be deformed by dualism and selectivity".
</P>
<P>
The representative said that his country supported the view
that the adoption of sanctions should not be approached from
politically or ideologically partial or emotional positions.
</P>
<P>
He said a clear criteria should be employed for determining
the use of such measures. Concerned states should be able to
participate in the informal discussion of the Security Council
on the question of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the Sixth Committee, Chinese representative
Gao Feng said China never supported the use of sanctions as the
primary means to settle international disputes. China was
concerned that it was mainly developing countries which suffered
from the effects of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative said that the international
community should show understanding of the legitimate demands of
the states affected by the implementation of sanctions and give
them practical support.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem could be resolved by reducing sanctions
to a minimum and limiting their duration, if they had to be
imposed. He called for the establishment of a mechanism for
consultations between the affected third states and the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said China supported the the proposal by Sierra Leone on the
establishment of a dispute prevention and a early settlement
service. Such a body would be conducive to elimitating and
reducing the further expansion of disputes and would also
eliminate or reduce the possibility of large-scale United Nations
action, including imposition of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Cuban representative Caridad Yamira Cueto Milian said that
there was widespread demand from developing countries that the
United Nations address the problem of the effects of sanctions
on third states. The issue should continue to be the priority
for the special Committee on the Charter.
</P>
<P>
she said that the responsibility of the Security Council, as
the body that imposed sanctions, could not be diluted, and it
should assume the responsibility of examining and repairing the
consequences of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian representative Nabail A. Elaraby said his country
welcomed the the report by the UN secretary-General on the
effects of sanctions on third states. Broader freedom should be
given to the sanctions Committee to deal directly with
applications for relief from the affected third states.
Countries which would be affected by the imposition of the
sanctions should be allowed to participate, without a vote, in
informal discussions of the Security council on the subject.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue should be dealt with comprehensively. The
Security Council should have a time-frame for imposing sanctions
to avoid unnecessary suffering by vulnerable groups in the
affected third countries. The objective of the sanctions should
be clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
He said his country welcomed Russia'proposals on the effects of
sanctions on third countries which should be considered. It also
supported the principles proposed by Russia on peacekeeping
operation, as well as the proposals of Sierra Leone on the
establishment of a dispute prevention and the early settlement
service.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Against Controls over Global Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan warned today that it would be a mistake to
impose controls on the billions of dollars of investments made
daily by traders around the world.
</P>
<P>
The comments, prepared for a seminar at the Cato Institute, a
Washington think-tank, represented Greenspan's most extensive
review of the financial turmoil that has engulfed several Asian
countries this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the increased flow of investment from one country
to another has worked to the benefit of developing nations and
raise the standard of living for their citizens.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the 1994-95 peso crisis in Mexico and
more recently the severe currency turmoil that has struck several
Southeast Asian nations underscored the financial problems that
can quickly strike when sentiment suddenly changes and investors
stampede to remove their money from a particular country.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan conceded that the speed at which investors can send
money in and out of a country has been accelerated by computers
and global communications networks, but he said it would be
impossible to revert to a simpler time.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad last month
threatened to clamp controls on foreign currency trading and
blamed his country's troubles on currency speculators such as
George Soros.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said today that any efforts to impose restrictions or
controls on financial flows would likely have "adverse, unintended
consequences." The biggest danger would be that investors would be
less likely to put up the money developing nations need to produce
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Rather, Greenspan urged that technology be used to contain the
new stresses on financial market by enhancing the ability of a
country's banks to detect bad loans and improve the quality of
statistics government agencies release.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that in the case of both Mexico and Thailand,
not enough accurate economic information was released in a timely
manner to head off a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Such disclosure would help to avoid sudden and sharp
reversals in the investment positions of investors once they
become aware of the true status of a country's and a banking
system's financial health," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian FM Assails U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy has assailed the U.S. Congress for its
increasingly isolationism.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the congress' go-it-alone mentality
threatens international relations, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy told a meeting on Canada-U.S. relations here Monday
that new demands in the new world order require co-operation among
countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
And Canada and the U.S. should be working closely on issues
ranging from human rights to the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But one thing gets in the way of that kind of relationship,
and that is what I see is an increasingly isolationist trend
taking place in the U.S. Congress," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The congress "does not recognize this increasing need to work
in partnership according to a broad-based international set of
rules," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It seems to be working in the opposite direction where "it
tends more and more to want to go it alone."
</P>
<P>
He took the instances of Cuba and its refusal to pay
long-accumulated dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Any powerful country resorting to unilaterally changing
international law introduces a "virus" that erodes the established
structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Long-time convergence in Canadian and U.S. policy should not
mean that the two countries will continue to agree on everything
in a world where new issues are emerging.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to look at what happens when there is far more
diversity in the system and far more opportunities for niche
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"We understand there has to be a degree of accommodation,
understanding, and at times areas where we can agree to disagree,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> 22 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two militants of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed today by Turkish
government troops in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Emergency Regional Governor's Office
said these rebels were wiped out in operations launched in
retaliation for their attack on a military vehicle of the
government troops on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ten soldiers of the government troops were killed in that
ambush, it said.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, a group of PKK militants reportedly attacked a
military post in northern Black Sea town of Giresun, killing nine
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels, who have been fighting a separatist war in
southeastern Turkey since 1984, are trying to build new bases in
the Black Sea region after Ankara sent troops into northern Iraq
to sweep their camps there, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by jets
and artillery fire, crossed into northern Iraq, an area beyond
control of Baghdad since the 1991 Gulf War, in a bid to eradicate
PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
A total of 837 PKK rebels were killed in the operations, which
triggered strong protests from Iran and some Arab countries.
Turkey announced on Monday that it had started to withdraw some of
its troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 soldiers, civilians and anti-government
militants have been killed in armed conflicts between the
government troops and the PKK over the past 13 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lopo Do Nascimento, president
of Angola's ruling party, People's Movement for the Liberation of
Angola-Workers' Party, said today that national entrepreneurs
must be supported to ensure the development of national economy.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement here today during discussions on the
current situation of native entrepreneurs sponsored by the
Entrepreneurs Forum of Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to him, without the efforts by national businessmen,
economic rehabilitation and development will be an empty talk.
</P>
<P>
It is not enough for the government to simply provide loans to
the native entrepreneurs, Nascimento said, adding that they
should be organized to become genuine entrepreneurs and take
their place in the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Ambrosio de Lemos, chairman of the Angolan Entrepreneurs
Forum, said the forum has been striving to organize, unite and
support national businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government is at present working hard to solve
problems facing the entrepreneurs, especially in meeting the
demand for loans, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The forum was founded in November 1996 with the aim to promote
support and cooperation among the entrepreneurs. It now has 160
members.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD to Play Greater Role in Globalization, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens
Ricupero has stated that the phenomena of globalization and
liberalization have reinforced the utility of UNCTAD, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero was speaking at the opening session of the annual
meeting of the Trade and Development Board (TDB), UNCTAD's highest
executive body between the quadrennial ministerial conferences.
</P>
<P>
During the session on October 13-24, delegates from many of
UNCTAD's 188 members will focus their discussions on the broad
issues of economic interdependence and globalization, and their
impact on developing countries, notably, their socio-economic
development and competitiveness, according to a UNCTAD press
release. The main specific agenda items relate to Africa and the
Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
"Greater international flows of goods, finance and investment
associated with globalization are not the only basis on which the
development process should be judged," Ricupero said. "The
ultimate objective of development policy is raising living
standards for everybody. measuring economic performance should
thus pay greater heed to growth and distribution than has so far
been the case."
</P>
<P>
"The business of UNCTAD is development. Not only for a few, but
for all men, and for man as a whole," Ricupero pointed out. "It
takes a multilateral body with a universal membership and a
mandate like ours, to examine the interdependent nature of complex
economic phenomena, to make sense of the confusion and propose
appropriate measures to policy-makers."
</P>
<P>
Ricupero expressed the hope that the TDB would make headway in
identifying policy considerations which would help policy-makers
everywhere to meet the challenge of making globalization
compatible with domestic social and political stability. UNCTAD's
message, he said, is that globalization carries the potential for
raising living standards worldwide, provided action is taken at
the global and national levels,, aimed at a more equal
distribution of its benefits.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq again called on the United
Nations Security Council to lift the seven-year-old sanctions
against it, Iraqi News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came in a message sent by Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to the U.N. Security Council, according to the
agency.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in his message that the U.N. Special Commission on
Iraq has adopted a prejudiced stance in its report about Iraq's
weapon programs submitted every six months to the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
This has misled the Security Council in questioning Iraq's
capability to produce weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commission, set up after the 1991 Gulf War in which
occupying Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by allied forces,
is responsible for inspecting and destroying weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that more than six years have passed since the
commission started its work, but there is nothing to indicate when
it would announce that its duties are over.
</P>
<P>
He accused the commission of dragging on its work on purpose to
keep in place the economic sanctions, including the oil embargo,
the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its troops
invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, Aziz expressed Iraq's readiness to cooperate with the
U.N. Special Commission on outstanding problems between them and
to seek appropriate solutions.

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Reaches Agreement on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of Germany
and France today reached an agreement on how future members of the
single European currency (Euro) should informally coordinate their
economic policies after the currency's introduction in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel and his French counterpart Dominique Strauss-Kahn, finance
ministers of those EU states that form the single currency should
first meet in an "informal forum" to coordinate their economic
policies prior to the next EU finance minister meeting due in
November, said the two ministers after their meeting in the
western German city of Muenster.
</P>
<P>
Describing the forum as "a bit like the Group of Seven
industrialized countries", Strauss-Kahn said it would discuss
exchange rates, fiscal reforms and structural policies.
</P>
<P>
Waigel meanwhile stressed that economic coordination should not
compromise independence of the future European central bank.
Moreover, meetings of the EU finance ministers should still play a
pivotal role in economic coordination.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement between Bonn and Paris apparently represented
a compromise over their dispute concerning the management of the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist government had been demanding the
establishment of an economic council for policy coordination among
the members of the Euro club, which would serve as a political
counterweight to the European central bank.
</P>
<P>
Germany, however, wants the new central bank to be as
independent as Germany's Bundesbank. It also prefers to leave
economic coordination in the hands of the finance ministers of all
15 EU member states, fearing that a body limited to the Euro
member countries would create a divisive, two-speed Europe.

LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Tuesday appointed Northern England's West Yorkshire Chief
Constable Keith Hellawell as the country's first "Drugs Czar".
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old top policeman will lead the fight against drug
abuse and co-ordinate efforts to tackle traffickers and addiction
problems.
</P>
<P>
Michael Trace, Director of the Rehabilitation for Addicted
Prisoners' Trust, was named as his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the move, the Prime Minister said that real progress
was needed to reduce drug misuse especially among the young.
</P>
<P>
Hellawell pledged to tackle "one of the biggest challenges
facing the country" and said that he hoped to be able "to make a
difference".
</P>
<P>
"I know about the pervasive and damaging effects drugs have on
our communities," Hellawell said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his first priority in the job would be to
"consult widely" so the best solutions could be found.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Britain's Home Office, the
number of people being treated for opiate or cocaine addiction
have risen 17 percent to more than 43,000 in the past year, and in
1996, 113,000 people were apprehended by police for drug-related
offences, up from 87,000 in 1994.

Simitis today met with visiting Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
to discuss the long-protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, Simitis attributed the
failure of the meetings between the two communities in Cyprus to
the continued intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need of realizing the two main goals of Greece
and the island republic, which were the resolution of the Cyprus
problem in accordance with U.N. resolutions and Cyprus' entry into
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed the hope that "significant
developments" could be expected over the next few months,
especially with regard to Cyprus' accession negotiations with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
He warned that there would be difficulties if no progress was
made towards solving the Cyprus problem and the proposal by
Clerides for the demilitarization of the divide island was not
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Greece did not want tension or conflict with Turkey, he said,
adding that relations between the two countries could not be
normalized if there was no just and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was impossible for Turkey to want to develop a
special relationship with the EU and not to recognize fundamental
rules of international law.
</P>
<P>
Simitis called on all countries that wanted peace and stability
in the region to back efforts being made within the framework of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Clerides, who arrived here Monday evening,
thanked Athens for its support with regard to the Cyprus problem,
accession to the EU, demilitarization proposal and the effort to
strengthen Cyprus's defense capability.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Nicosia was obliged not only to continue
with the military exercises but also with arming itself.
</P>
<P>
Clerides hoped that substantial developments in the Cyprus
problem could be made after the Cypriot presidential elections
which will take place in February next year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pre- Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Direct talks have been held over the past months between
Cypriot President Glafcos and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, but no progress has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> United States Dominates International Arms Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States, the only
superpower in the world, remains the biggest international arms
trader in 1996, with its arms sales increasing from 1995's 14
billion to 17 billion US dollars, according to an authoritative
annual report.
</P>
<P>
The report named "The Military Balance", published today by
London's International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS),
said: "The international arms trade grew by eight percent in 1996
in real terms from 36.9 billion to 39.9 billion dollars, following
a 13 percent increase in 1995."
</P>
<P>
The United States, the world's biggest arms exporter, exported
various arms worth 17 billion dollars last year for a 42.6 percent
global arms sales market share.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France, which were ranked the second and third
places respectively, recorded arms sales of 8.8 billion and 5.6
billion dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
On the main factors behind the big arms sales increases, the
report said:" the unpredictable tensions in North-east Asia and
the Middle East, favorable oil prices for the Gulf states and
sustained modernization demand in East Asia" have combined to help
achieve the arms trade record.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on future international arms trade tendency, IISS
Director John Chipman told reporters: "the extent of spending in
numerous Gulf countries is likely to decline as the cycle of big
purchases made after the Gulf War draws to a close."
</P>
<P>
"Over the coming years, it will be important to look closely at
how this years currency crisis in South east Asia and the
depressed economic climate in other parts of Asia affects arms
orders," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Work of Youth, Aging, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (xinhua) -- Chinese government had
always attached great importance to the work of the youth, aging
and disableed persons, and series of laws and policies in this
regards had been formulated and implemented, Chinese representative
Lin Sha said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Committee(Social, humanitarian and
Cultural) of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, Lin
Sha said that the question relating to the youth, aging and
disabled persons constituted an important and integral part of the
work in the field of social development.
</P>
<P>
Lin Sha said that a total of 80 percent of youth, aging and
disabled persons lived in developing countries. Plagued by
poverty, backwardness and other factors, they were confronted with
a particularly difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
The representative said the United Nations should focus on
their needs, take practical and effective measures to promote
international cooperation and provide assistance and technical
services in particular, so that favorable conditions would be
created for the resolution of the difficulties and full
integration into society.
</P>
<P>
Lin Sha said the Chinese government and youth organizations, in
light of China's realities, had conducted a great variety of local
and national activities with an eye to the 21st century.
Impressive achievements had been registered in the development of
all types of education including that for youth in employment, in
the improvement of youth 's overall level of science and culture,
in the education of young peasant illiteracy and dissemination of
agricultural scientific and technical knowledge, as well as in the
enhancement of youth's professionalism and moral standards.
</P>
<P>
She said aging was a problem facing all mankind. China would
join the ranks of states with aging population by the year 2000
when the number of older people aged 60 and beyond that would
reach 130 million. The Chines government had taken notes of this
social problem affecting the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that last year, measures were taken to strengthen
institutions for the aged, and the Law of the People's Republic of
China on the Protection of the Rights and interests of the Aged
was promulgated, thereby bringing work of older people into line
with the local and national plans for economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The representative said China had 60 million people with
disabilities. In order to safeguard their rights, improve their
plight and give play to their potential, China was implementing a
policy characterized by governmental leadership, social support
and participation by the disabled. A set of measures had been
carries out and noticeable results achieved.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese government, in response to the call for
the establishment of national coordinating bodies, set up in 1993
the State Council Coordinating Committee on Disability, followed
by the setting up of corresponding organs at local levels, thus
incorporating work of the disabled into the national development
plan.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese government and organizations for youth,
the aged and disabled persons had taken a active part in UN
exchanges in these areas in support of exchanges and cooperation
with various countries. China was earnestly implementing the world
Program of Action for Youth to the year 2000 and beyond through
cooperation with international organizations in participating in
or organizing world regional conferences.
</P>
<P>
She said in carrying out the World Program of Acton
concerning disabled persons, China took an active part in
activities for the United Nations Decade of Disable persons, had
initiated, participated and financed the Asia-Pacific Decade of
Disabled Persons.
</P>
<P>
She added China would continue to attach importance to the
work of youth, aging and disabled persons, and do a good job of
it.

LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The third phase of the
international boundary demarcation exercise between Nigeria and
the Niger Republic is to commence soon, the official News Agency
of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Saidu Aliyu, Acting Administrator of the

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Reaches Agreement on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of Germany
and France today reached an agreement on how future members of the
single European currency (Euro) should informally coordinate their
economic policies after the currency's introduction in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel and his French counterpart Dominique Strauss-Kahn, finance
ministers of those EU states that form the single currency should
meet first in an "informal forum" to coordinate their economic
policies prior to finance ministers meetings of all EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to form such a forum would be submitted by Germany
and France at the next EU finance minister meeting due in
November, said the two ministers after their meeting in the
western German city of Muenster.
</P>
<P>
Describing the forum as "a bit like the Group of Seven
industrialized countries", Strauss-Kahn said it would discuss
exchange rates, fiscal reforms and structural policies.
</P>
<P>
Waigel meanwhile stressed that economic coordination should not
compromise independence of the future European central bank.
Moreover, meetings of the EU finance ministers should still play a
pivotal role in economic coordination.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement between Bonn and Paris apparently represented
a compromise over their dispute concerning the management of the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist government had been demanding the
establishment of an economic council for policy coordination among
the members of the Euro club, which would serve as a political
counterweight to the European central bank.
</P>
<P>
Germany, however, wants the new central bank to be as
independent as Germany's Bundesbank. It also prefers to leave
economic coordination in the hands of the finance ministers of all
15 EU member states, fearing that a body limited to the Euro
member countries would create a divisive, two-speed Europe.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Urged to Encourage Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has urged developing countries to encourage
investment from world food producers to ensure that the poor and
hungry get their share of food.
</P>
<P>
FAO made the appeal on the eve of World Food Day, which falls
on October 16.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, FAO said with external
assistance to agriculture declining, " the way forward will be
for governments to work with farmers and the private sector, and
with non-governmental organizations and the international
community, to encourage investment al all levels from the food
producers upwards especially to ensure that the poor and hungry
get their share of the food that is produced."
</P>
<P>
In order to increase food production in developing countries
to match demand until the year 2010, FAO estimates that gross
annual investment of about 86 billion U.S. dollars in primary
production will be needed, 43 billion dollars for processing,
storage, distribution and marketing facilities and 37 billion
dollars for support services and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In a World Food Day message released earlier, FAO
Director-General Jacqes Diouf said, " By choosing investing in
food security we will highlight the need to create conditions and
incentives that will promote investment both by private and
public sectors to enchance food supply as well as ensure adequate
access to food by all.
</P>
<P>
"All sectors of civil society must work together if we are to
succeed in our objective to achieve food for all. Investng in
food security means that grassroots and local efforts together
with government, the private sector, multilateral and bilateral
efforts at national level should all be focused on a common
vision and agenda for food security," Diouf said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia May Use Mozambique's Nacala Corridor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Chabwera, President of
the Association of Commerce and Industry of Zambia, said today
that his country might use Mozambique's Nacala Corridor for the
transportation of goods starting from next year.
</P>
<P>
Gerry made the remark after meeting officials from the
Mozambican Railways Company at Nacala, northern Mozambique,
according to a report by Mozambique News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mozambique and Zambia may reach an agreement in
this respect by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Gerry said that he is optimistic about the possibility for the
Mozambican side to open the way for negotiation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the basic infrastructures at the corridor left
deep impression on him, adding that Nacala Corridor may open
another attractive channel for import and export.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian official said that Zambia would export about
500,000 ton of goods and import 150,000 tons through Nacala Port.
</P>
<P>
Zambia may become the second foreign customer after Malawi to
use the corridor. Zambia finds Nacala Corridor to be a more
competitive transport channel than the Dar es Salaam Port, Durban
Port in South Africa, and the Beira Port in Mozambique, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 77 km of the 920 km-long Nacala Railways was destroyed
in the civil war, but Miguel Matavele, official with the
Mozambican Railways Company, said that Zambia should not be
bothered by the matter which is being solved by his company.

<HEADLINE> Two American Scientists Awarded World Food Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 World Food Prize
has been awarded jointly to two American scientists for their
contributions to new approaches to agricultural pest control,
reducing insecticide use while increasing yields.
</P>
<P>
The prize, the leading international award in recognition of
individuals whose work has advanced human development by improving
quantity, quality and availability of the world's food supply, was
awarded to Dr. Ray F. Smith, 78, from the University of California
in Berkeley, and Dr. Perry L. Adkisson, 68, from the Texas A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
"Working individually and together over 30 years, Smith and
Adkisson helped bring about a fundamental shift in agricultural
production marked by a dramatic reduction in the use of chemical
pesticides," said a statement on the award.
</P>
<P>
It said their work on new approaches, known as "integrated pest
management" (IPM), to agricultural pest control had sparked a
global ecological revolution. The IPM employs a variety of
biological, cultural, ecological and chemical techniques to
protect a wide variety of food and fiber crops from insect damage
in an environmentally sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
The new techniques have made the United States a focal point
for the development of IPM programs for fruit, citrus, vegetables,
soybeans, grain sorghum, cotton, peanuts and rice. As a result,
pesticide use on U.S. food crops has dropped by half, and more
than 77 percent on cotton.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by a number of internationals organizations, including
the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations
Environment Program and the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the two scientists have also worked to promote IPM
programs for crops, fruits and vegetables grown in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and Middle East. The IPM is practiced on millions of
farms throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"In helping to provide food security for billions of people
around the world while reducing the risk to our soil, our water,
our air and to the people who grow and consume food, Drs. Smith
and Adkisson have served their fellow human beings in truly
exemplary fashion," said World Food Prize Foundation Chairman John
Ruan, who presented the award to the winners today.
</P>
<P>
The prize was created by Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1970 for developing high-yield wheat strains as
part of the so-called Green Revolution. Since 1990, the award has
been sponsored by the foundation established by Ruan.
</P>
<P>
The prize was awarded to distinguished persons annually and He
Kang, former Minister of Agriculture in China, received the prize
in 1993 for his leadership lead to large increase in agricultural
output in the early 1980s in China.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Libya, Egypt, Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will visit three north African countries -- Libya,
Egypt and Morocco -- later this month.
</P>
<P>
"North Africa is increasingly becoming an important trading
partner for South Africa as well as an important partner within
the context of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), " a
statement of the president's office said today.
</P>
<P>
The visits emphasize the importance of the north African
region to South Africa, that is, South Africa's ability to
provide technology for the exploitation of the resources in the
region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
This will be Mandela's first north African trip since his
election as president in 1994 except his attendance of the OAU
meeting in Tunis in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's decision to visit Libya comes in response to a
long-standing invitation from Libyan head of state, Colonel Omar
Qadhafi, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is a country which was very supportive of the South
African liberation movements during the struggle against
apartheid and is one of the countries that the president has not
visited since his inauguration," it said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between South Africa and Libya have been on a sound
footing since the democratic election of 1994. Both countries
have expressed the wish to expand trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"Currently bilateral trade is limited. However, Libya remains
a potentially significant trading partner for South Africa," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa insisted on developing relations with Libya, Iran
and Cuba, defying pressure and warning from the United States, of
which the three countries are bitter rivals.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mandela's visit to Egypt will
focus on economic matters.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the two countries has grown from 61
million Rand (13 million U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 410 million
Rand (87 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will visit Libya and Egypt on his way to the
Commonwealth heads of government meeting scheduled for October
24-27 in Britain.
</P>
<P>
He will go to Morocco immediately after the meeting.

<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Defense authority today
denied a media report that some 400 of its soldiers enforcing
international sanctions in Sierra Leone have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Defense spokesman Colonel Godwin Ugbo dismissed the report as
" a mere propaganda" by the military junta in Freetown, while
briefing the press at the Lagos defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria, which comprises the majority of the
West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG), has a force of about
three battalions in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
How it is possible that one third of the Nigerian troops are
being held by the Sierra Leonean junta, he said, adding that
contrary to some media reports, the ECOMOG is holding all its
positions in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the effects of the oil and arms embargo and other
sanctions recently approved by the UN Security Council, Ugbo said
it is working.
</P>
<P>
The sanction has caused many defections, and thousands of
refugees are now heading for Guinea, Nigeria and other
neighboring countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Needs to Develop All Its Oil And Gas, Shell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) - The world will need to develop
all its oil and natural gas reserves before sufficient renewable
energy sources become available next century, according to Cor
Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times published here today,
he said, the world's largest international oil company was
committed to developing renewable energy sources into a new core
business.
</P>
<P>
But Herkstroter warned countries "not to expect miracles from
renewables". The growth in use of renewables would be relatively
slow, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chairman predicted that the market share of renewable
energy sources such as solar and biomass would grow rapidly
between 2025 and 2050, when they could account for half the
world's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
To develop renewables "is not just a matter of money.
Technology also needs to be developed and projects put together,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Herkstroter also warned a dramatic reduction in energy use
would not encourage the use of renewables, and could even slow
the pace of their development.
</P>
<P>
Such shifts could only be brought about by break-throughs in
information and communication technology and the introduction of
new industrial materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company has calculated that development of all the known
and expected conventional oil and gas resources will add about 60
parts per million to the present atmospheric concentration of
carbon dioxide of . That, Herkstroter said, would be below
most proposed limists.
</P>
<P>
The EU argues that it would be economically and technically
possible for the industrialized nations to bring their emissions
down to 15% below the 1990 level by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Herkstroter said his company supported action to reduce the
emission of greenhouse gases. But he described the EU's proposals
as "unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable cut would be what can actually be done," he said,
adding that a 5% reduction over 10 years would be a better
solution.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Greece Not to Increase Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government should
stop its policy of increasing tensions in Cyprus, a senior
Turkish official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with visiting British Minister of State Doug
Henderson, Minister of State Sukru Sina Gurel warned that if
Greece continue to intensify situation in Cyprus, the possibility
of clashes might come true.
</P>
<P>
"A very dangerous game is being played by Greece at the
moment. They are playing with fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Greek and Greek Cypriot troops are holding
one-week joint exercises, code-named "Nikiforos '97" in Cyprus
under their joint defense pact.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, a large number of Turkish military jets flew
over the airspace of Cyprus over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Ministry accused Turkey of violating Greek
Cypriot's airspace. However, Ankara rebuffed the accusation,
saying this was only a move to show Turkey's determination to
defend Turkish Cypriots' freedom and rights.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus have been worsening in recent months
because Cyprus signed in January an arms deal to buy Russian-made
S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had threatened that it will destroy these missiles if
they are finally deployed in the Greek Cypriot-controlled area of
the island country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into rival Greek Cypriot community in
the south and Turkish Cypriot community in the north since 1974
when Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island
following a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
On a shuttle mission for solution to the protracted Cyprus issue,
U.S. special envoy for Cyprus Richard Holbrooke, accompanied by
U.S. State Department's new coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller,
arrived here last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
on Monday, Holbrooke urged all parties concerned in Cyprus to
exercise restraint and avoided actions which might increase
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Both Holbrooke and Cem refrained from disclosing the contents
of their two-hour-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, who gain political, economic and
military support from Turkey, declared in 1983 a break-away
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which has been recognized
only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have been
making efforts for a political solution to the Cyprus problem,
but no tangible results have been achieved so far.

Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, Foreign Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka and Speaker of the National Assembly Ole Kaparo made the
remarks when they respectively met Chinese Deputy Foreign
Minister Tian Zengpei.
</P>
<P>
Kenya values the assistance it has received from China since
its independence in early 1960s, said Saitoti, citing the
construction of Eldoret Hospital and the Moi International Sports
Complex under China's aid.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Kenyan friendship and cooperation are extended to
more and more areas, especially in agriculture, education,
construction, health, culture and sporting, he added.
</P>
<P>
He invited Chinese companies to invest in Kenya, saying there
is access from Kenya to a wide market within the East African
Cooperation, and even the whole southern and eastern African
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said Kenya and China have always shared common views
and supported each other within the United Nations and on other
International forums. Kenya is now a non-permanent member in the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Kenya highly appreciated the fact that Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, during his first-ever visit to Africa last year, put Kenya
as his first destination, said Musyoka.
</P>
<P>
"Our 'One China' policy is absolutely clear," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan parliamentary speaker also called for more frequent
exchange of visits and cooperation between the two countries and
their parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Tian commended the sound and healthy ties between Kenya and
China for years, saying the two countries face similar problems
and challenges ahead and both could learn a lot from each other.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government hopes Sino-Kenyan relations can
be enhanced to a new level through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to its ties with Kenya, a
country of significant influence on the African continent, and is
always willing to widen and deepen its cooperation with Kenya,
Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Kenya's independent, non-alignment,
good-neighborness foreign policies which pay much attention and
have made great contributions to regional peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Forces of Sassou Nguesso Announces Capture of Brazzaville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The forces of the former
president of Congo Republic Denis Sassou Nguesso announced today
that they have captured "totally" the country's capital
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Isidore Mvouba, the spokesman
of the Democratic and Popular Forces (FDP) party of Sassou
Nguesso, as saying that FDP forces have "taken the total control
of Brazzaville and are massing upon the bridge of Djoue" at the
southern end of the city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "last pocket of residual resistance" of
troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and Prime Minister
Bernard Kolelas were "eliminated by mid-day."
</P>
<P>
The FDP forces took the district of Bacongo and Makele-Kele
from the militiamen loyal to Kolelas, while the presidential
palace fell on Monday, AFP quoted the spokesman as saying in
Libreville, Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Mvouba said that a dozen government soldiers were killed in the
fighting, while the loss on the FDP side was "actually nil,"
because the FDP soldiers were proceeded by several tanks.
</P>
<P>
He also said that FDP used a Mig-21 combat aircraft to bomb a
camp of government forces on Monday, killing about 20 government
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He called on the forces loyal to Lissouba and Kolelas to lay
down their arms to prevent more sufferings be inflicted upon
Congolese people, who he said had "already suffered more than
they counted."
</P>
<P>
The FDP estimated that 10,000 people have been killed since
fighting broke out in Brazzaville on June 5.
</P>
<P>
The FDP spokesman also said that the FDP would not tolerate any
attempt to divide the country and intends to maintain the unity of
Congo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Continue Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece today agreed
to continue executing their joint defense pact unless a just
solution to the Cyprus problem is reached.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Cyprus' Acting President
Spyros Kyprianou and Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos,
who is on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
The two were reviewing the five-day military exercises launched
by Cyprus' National Guard and participated by Greek naval and air
forces.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, also Speaker of the House of Representatives of
Cyprus, expressed satisfaction with the success of the exercises
code-named "Nikiforos (Victorious) '97" which started on October
10.
</P>
<P>
The Greek defense minister said that the high efficiency of the
maneuvers has sent a message to all "whose behavior is nothing but
a threat." He stopped short of naming Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed in 1993 the Common Pact on defense,
under which Greece will provide Cyprus with military assistance in
case the island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Cypriot joint military exercises have drawn strong
protest from Turkey, which warned it will negatively affect the
Cyprus peace talks. Turkey sent troops onto the island in 1974 and
maintains 35,000 troops in its northern third to protect Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Minister Sukru Gurel said today that the
exercises will not only poison the relations between Turkey and
Greece, but can also lead to an increased possibility of
incidents, including armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over territorial
waters and seabed mineral rights in the Aegean Sea, the
sovereignty of a couple of uninhabited islets and the protracted
issue of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since Turkey troops seized its northern
part following a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by Turkey, against the
internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus controlled by the
Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> US Special Coordinator for Cyprus Visits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A radical lifting of the
deadlock in relations between Greece and Turkey would be very
important, but if this was not attainable, weight might be placed
on small steps in various issues, said U.S. State Department
special coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller today.
</P>
<P>
Miller made the statement after meeting with Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos here today.
</P>
<P>
Miller arrived here this morning from Turkey to discuss with
Greek officials ways of resolving the Cyprus issue and improving
Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Miller said that the spirit of the Madrid communique guiding
principles for bettering ties, signed by Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis and Turkish President Suleyman Demirel in July, was
still alive and that it was a "dynamic text on the basis of which
we are trying to build new efforts."
</P>
<P>
His statements came only days after Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz declared in Strasbourg that "the spirit of Madrid is
dead," blaming the Greek government and Pangalos in particular for
their "radical statements" regarding Ankara.
</P>
<P>
As for the situation in the Aegean, Miller said that efforts to
achieve progress in the recent meetings between Pangalos and his
Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, in New York had not been
materialized, but Miller expressed the hope that this could happen
in future.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the Cyprus problem, he reaffirmed that the
U.S. supported the creation of a bi-zone, bi-communal federation
in the island republic. Washington had made it clear to the Turks
that it also fully backed Cyprus' accession to the European Union
(EU), he added.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that EU accession negotiations with Cyprus must
be conducted with the Republic of Cyprus after the participation
of the Turkish Cypriots in a single negotiating delegation was
secured.
</P>
<P>
He hailed Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides's proposal for a
demilitarization of the island as "positive," saying that the
condition was that it took into account necessary security
measures for the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed deployment of Russian-made S-300
ground-to-air missiles on Cyprus, Turkish threats over the
missiles and infringements of Greek and Cypriot national air
space, he said that these did not help in the necessary reduction
of tension in the area.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Bus Attackers Deny Joining Islamic Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The two Egyptians on charge of
killing nine German tourists in an attack in downtown Cairo on
September 18 today denied they had joined any Islamic
fundamentalist group.
</P>
<P>
Saber Farahat Abu el-Ela and his brother Mahmoud were standing
trial today at the Higher Military Court for the deadly attack
which killed an Egyptian driver as well.
</P>
<P>
Before the hearing began, Saber, the main defendant, told
reporters from behind a steel cage that he and his brother did not
join any Islamic group but admitted leaning towards the ideology
of the banned Al-Jihad (Holy War) organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that his association with Al-Jihad is purely spiritual
and that he was not a member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
He confessed to reporters that he had meant to deal a blow to
the country's resurging tourist industry and he had been ready to
use knives to kill the tourists in case his pistol malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
In the appalling attack, the Farahat brothers shot randomly at
German tourists in a bus parked in front of the renowned Egyptian
Museum and then threw a petrol bomb inside it, killing nine German
tourists and the Egyptian driver.
</P>
<P>
Saber had been admitted to the Abbasiya mental asylum where he
escaped about three days before carrying out the attack. The head
of the hospital has been arrested for taking bribes from Farahat's
family.
</P>
<P>
The mental status of Saber, who had been declared insane by a
court in a previous trial for murdering three foreigners at a
Cairo in 1993, is yet to be determined by the military court.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his that attack, Saber said it came after the
breakout of conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina that involved the
Muslims, Croats and Serbs. "I wanted to go there on a Jihad
mission, but I could not make it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Saber, who refused to be treated as a nutcase, said he had a
whole month to plan for the attack, which took place in Cairo's
busiest square at rush hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Saber claimed his attack was to avenge blasphemous
posters put up by an Israeli woman in Hebron depicting Islam's
Prophet Mohammed as a pig. The drawing came under fire across the
Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud told reporters that he and his brother agreed to launch
the attack together using a pistol, ammunition and steel
weapons. Other seven men, who sold them the weapons and
ammunition, have been named co-defendants in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Amid tight security, the first hearing was held at 11
a.m. (local time) today in a courtroom thronged with Arab and
foreign reporters. The second hearing is scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Farahat brothers, on charges of manslaughter, arson,
sabotage, illegal possession of weapons and attack on police
officers, could face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The case was transferred to the military tribunal from the
state security on September 22 on an order of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak for a speedy trial.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to contain damages to its multi-billion-dollar tourist
industry, the Egyptian government has laboriously denied the
attack was staged by Islamic extremists as in the previous cases
and was quick to ban media coverage on the court's investigations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,255 people have been killed since 1992 by
fundamentalist militants in a violent campaign against Egypt's
secular government.

<HEADLINE> London Silver Business Rises Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Silver business rose sharply on
the London bullion market last month, with average daily turnover
jumping by more than 19 percent to 314.3 million ounces, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures released by the London Bullion Market
Association (LBMA), the newspaper said that the average silver
price in London also rose from 4.50 US dollars a troy ounce in
August to 4.73 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the daily value of silver turnover also increased
by 25 percent to 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive of the LBMA said that the main cause of the
increase in silver business was a high level of physical demand
and increased activity in the forward market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average daily gold business also rose last month
although more modestly, with daily clearing turnover up by 3.3
percent to 34.3 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
The average daily turnover in value terms rose from 10.7
billion US dollars in August to 11.1 billion US dollars in
September although the average price fell from 324.01 US dollars
an ounce to 322.82 US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's military cooperation
with Israel is aimed at promoting tranquility in the region, a
senior Turkish official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with visiting Israeli Chief of Staff Amnon
Shahak, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Ismet Sezgin told the press
that Turkey and Israel always do their utmost to ensure peace and
stability in the region and will continue to do so, the Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin, also defense minister, made the remarks in a bid to
soothe Arab countries, which have expressed grave concern over the
growing Turkish-Israeli military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Shahak arrived here Sunday on a three-day visit aimed at
enhancing bilateral military cooperation. During his visit, he
exchanged views with Turkish government and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Shahak and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Hakki Karaday
reportedly discussed a joint project to produce Delilah long-range
missiles during their Monday meeting.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local reports said the Israeli chief of staff would
persuade the Turkish military to replace its tank units with
Israeli-made Merkava 3, one of the world's most sophisticate types
so far.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli cooperation in military and defense fields
has expanded rapidly since early last year, when they signed two
agreements to allow, among other things, their warplanes to be
trained in each other's airspace.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled joint naval exercises involving Israel, Turkey
and the United States on November 16 might be further postponed at
U.S. request. The exercises were originally set for May.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation, has been condemned by
Iran and some Arab countries for betraying the interests of the
Muslim world by developing closer ties with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> EU Gets Support for Proposal to Reduce Gas Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) today welcomed industry support for the European Union's
proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent by the
year 2005 and by 15 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
A report released today offers a set of 12 recommendations on
climate change policy which were jointly elaborated by Shell
Netherlands, the WWF Netherlands and the Center for European
Policy Studies (CEPS).
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the CEPS, is a result of a series of
workshops between the WWF and representatives of European oil,
electricity and energy-intensive industries which took place
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The workshops were sponsored by the WWF Netherlands and chaired
by Leen Koster, the director for environmental affairs of Shell
Netherlands, according to the WWF European Policy Office in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"This report shows that the industry's negative attitude
towards climate change is starting to change in the light of
overwhelming evidence that climate change is a real threat and
needs to be dealt with," said Sible Schone, climate change expert
of the WWF Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
He added that the oil business had recognized that the climate
summit in Kyoto would only be the beginning of the climate
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives also recognize the precautionary
principle and support the EU proposal to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 7.5 percent by the year 2005 and 15 percent by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The WWF and industry both agree that much stronger energy
efficiency policies are necessary, according to the WWF European
Policy Office. It also says that the WWF welcomes the support from
industry for policies like progressive energy efficiency standards
for cars and appliances, and a life-cycle assessment obligation
for new appliances.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Secret Military Pact with Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military today
denied a Danish press report that Turkey and Denmark had signed a
secret pact to jointly intervene any possible exigencies in
southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency, the
military called the report, published in a daily called Jylland
Posten, as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper report said that under the military agreement,
Denmark will send warplanes and missile experts in case of
emergency in southern Turkey, but Copenhagen had tried to keep it
secret due to Turkey's poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the report as unfounded, a high-ranking official
from the Turkish General Staff who preferred anonymity said such
an arrangement is not a bilateral agreement between Turkey and
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
This should be realized within the framework of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) if there is any trouble in the
bloc's southern flank, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is sending troops to different places within the
understanding of NATO solidarity, and in turn, other countries
can send troops here," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, Germany, Italy and Belgium all sent
their warplanes to southern Turkey's NATO air bases to join the
battle against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Danish Embassy here was not immediately available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has shared bitter relations with its southeastern
neighboring countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria, which were
accused by Ankara of harboring its outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war against the
Turkish government since 1984 in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Instrument Company Eyes on Wider China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Curtis Instruments Inc., a
small company by the American standard but a world leader in
instrumentation and controls for electric vehicles for decades, is
now finding its way into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Its newly established production line in Suzhou, east China,
will soon begin to turn out the electronic speed controllers for
electric bicycles, motorized wheelchairs and other vehicles. It is
a solely American invested venture, which cost more than 6 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China will become our important technical base after an
electric transportation," Edward Marwell, President of the Curtis
Instruments Inc., told the reporter during an interview recently.
</P>
<P>
Curtis has joined a growing number of technical companies
devoting resources to the challenge of supporting the quest of
many Asian nations to find a clean, viable alternative to the
noisy, air polluting 2-cycle engines widely in use in Asia. Using
electric devices to replace the pollutant emitting engines has
become a trend of the market.
</P>
<P>
Marwell said that Curtis will work closely with primary Chinese
bicycle manufacturers to facilitate electrification of standard
bicycles, which continue to be an important transportation method
in Asia. It will also cooperate with other foreign investors in
China such as Linde, the major forklift manufacturer of Germany,
and Nacco, a U.S. forklift maker in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This important product development program will be spearheaded
by the Curtis China Co. at the new, highly modern Suzhou
manufacturing plant, which was approved by the Chinese government
in September, 1995. The Suzhou plant is now producing modules, the
chip-on-board gadgets for various kinds of LCD and LED indicators
used in vehicles, mobile working tools such as forklifts and
bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
Marwell also said that gradually Suzhou will produce most of
its modules and electronic control boards for the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
He said he has been excited by the success in his new plant in
China. Now the Chinese are fully responsible for the management of
production, personnel and financial matters. Its Beijing office
assists the sales on the Chinese market. "They have been doing
very well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the forthcoming U.S. visit by the Chinese
president Jiang Zemin, Marwell said that it, by all nature, will
become an important visit to enhance bilateral relations in all
fields. The two countries traditionally have close relations,
which should be further promoted, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the local authorities of the Suzhou High-Tech
Zone have been very cooperative during the whole process of
establishment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the success of his China business also lies in the
high technology and the use of smart people who not only know the
actual conditions of the country but also have real expertise in
the technology.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou plant is expected to turn out 1 million modules next
year, which is really a big size compared to the world's market
needs of 2.5 million to 3 million pieces annually, according to
Marwell.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Asked to Refrain from Challenge on Islets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today demanded that
Japan refrain from taking issue with Seoul on the sovereignty over
the Tokto islets (Takeshima islets in Japanese).
</P>
<P>
The request came in reaction to a Japanese Foreign Ministry
spokesman's expression of regret over a South Korea's defense
white paper which described Tokto (Takeshima), two tiny islets
located in the middle of the sea between the two countries, as
South Korean territory.
</P>
<P>
Director Park Joon-woo of the South Korean Foreign Ministry, in
charge of issues with Japan, called in Hideaki Mizukoshi, the
First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy. He said that Tokto was
South Korean territory from "an historical as well as legal
viewpoint" and this was based on international law.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto said the
previous day that Japan had officially filed a complaint with the
South Korean Embassy in Tokyo, complaining that Takeshima (Tokto)
was included in the South Korean defense white paper.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais said today that the State Duma's
no-confidence vote in the government would considerably damage the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting at the Ministry of State Property, Chubais
said the vote may cause a governmental crisis which could lose the
country 300-400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The motion will also complicate the situation with the Russian
national debt servicing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the lower house of parliament criticized the
country's economic performance in the first nine months this year
and rejected the government's 1998 draft budget.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, who have 140 members in the 450-seat State
Duma, initiated the no-confidence vote against the government.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma convened today to decide the fate of the
reformist government.
</P>
<P>
If the no-confidence vote passes through, State Duma has to
vote again within three months to force President Boris Yeltsin to
dissolve either the cabinet or the legislative body.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Accuse Foreigners of Looting Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The accusations against
foreigners in relation with the looting of Somalia's national
assets are not confined only to the sea and land, but they are
also stretched up to the air space.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Somalis from the former civil aviation
department have accused foreigners in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi, for misusing funds collected from the planes using
Somalia's air space.
</P>
<P>
Osman Isse Abdi, spokesman for the Somali civil aviation, an
office that handles all air traffic business over Somalia's air
space, remains open in Nairobi since the departure of the
multi-national forces from Somalia in early March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Abdi furthermore said this office is run by a Canadian
national, J.W. Drunswig.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman from Mogadishu's former main tower said every
plane that passes through Somalia's air space is charged with 427
US dollars per hour. Abdi believes this money is used by Brunswig
all by himself, "Unfortunately this money goes straight to the
pockets of Brunswig, and there's no one to control him," said
Abdi.
</P>
<P>
Abdi said they have already forwarded their accusations to
Brunswig himself who, according to them, claimed to have been
giving salary to many Somalis from the Somali civil aviation
department. Abdi has called the United Nations agencies and the
Somali leaders to take appropriate measures against the so-called
"looting of Somalia's air space."
</P>
<P>
Few former civil aviation employees are currently working for
the factions in their local airstrips where the narcotic leaves
of khat and few aid agencies's planes land every day around the
capital and several regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy rains from the Deyr season have started
falling in several regions in the country. In Mogadishu and its
surrounding areas, it has been raining for the last 24 hours, but
no damage or casualties are reported thus far despite the havoc
it is posing for the traffic in Mogadishu by creating puddles of
water everywhere in the ruined streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports from VHF radios also indicate that heavy rains have
also fallen in the central and northern regions. In the
northwestern region of Sanag, the rains have badly affected many
farm lands, water wells and houses.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, nearly 50 houses were destroyed while
about 1,000 animals mainly cattle and goats were also killed by
the rain waters.

STOCKHOLM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- American Professor Steven
Chu, French Professor Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and American
scientist William D. Philips have won the 1997 Nobel Physics Prize
"for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser
light," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced today.
</P>
<P>
The new methods of investigation developed by the Nobel
Laureates "have contributed greatly to increasing our knowledge of
the interplay between radiation and matter," the Academy said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they had opened the way to a deeper
understanding of the quantum-physical behavior of gases at low
temperatures, said the Academy. And the methods might lead to the
design of more precise atomic clocks for use in practices such as
space navigation and accurate determination of position.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 1.3 Billion in Developed World Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- About one-third of the
population in the developing world, or 1.3 billion people,
currently live on less than one U.S. dollar per day, according to
a press release issued here today by the Bangkok-based United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The largest number of poor people, about 950 million, live in
the Asia-Pacific region, and almost 40 percent of the total number
of poor, or about 500 million, live in South Asia, said the
release issued before the International Day for the Eradication of
Poverty on October 17.
</P>
<P>
Poverty in the Asia-Pacific region is still, to a large extent,
rural, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
However, as more and more poor people move to cities to seek
employment in hope for a better life, there is a trend towards the
urbanization of poverty.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, poor people tend to be women, with the
number of poor women growing faster than that of poor men.
</P>
<P>
Community development and empowerment of the poor are
increasingly recognized as prerequisites to poverty alleviation.
This has been the experience of countries which have tackled
poverty in the Asia-Pacific region, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
To mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty,
ESCAP will organize a "hunger lunch" at its Bangkok headquarters
serving simple meal of vegetarian fried rice and fish sauce to
raise money for the construction of a day-care center for poor
children in the Chao Phraya community in Yannawa district,
Bangkok.

NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- One out of every five
tuberculosis (TB) patients in India is infected with the HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus) that causes AIDS, the Press Trust
of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a study published in the Indian Journal of Medical
Research, the prevalence of HIV in TB patients has shot up six
times in the past six years, rising from 3.2 percent in 1991 to 20
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in HIV-positive cases was steeper in the last
three years, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The high incidence of HIV among TB patients shows that HIV
infection has already made an impact on the tuberculosis situation
in India, the study added.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out by a team of Indian scientists and
doctors who tested TB patients in Pune, Maharashtra, for HIV
infection over the last six years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Congo's Strategic Oil City Falls to Angolans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The four-month war in the Congo
Republic took a dramatic turn today as troops from the Angolan
enclave, Cabinda, captured the country's strategic oil city
Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
Coordinated reports from Congo said Angolan troops, backed by a
dozen tanks, took Pointe-Noire at 6:30 a.m. (5:30 GMT) this
morning after crossing from Cabinda, an enclave thrusting into
Congo and less than 100 kilometers from Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Angolan troops in Pointe-Noire was confirmed by
both the French consul there and the Belgian Defense Ministry, but
the Angolan government denied the report.
</P>
<P>
The commander in the Pointe-Noire military zone of the
government forces of Congo, Colonel Louembe, told Radio France
International today that he had ordered his soldiers to lay down
their arms and stop shooting.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a bloodbath. We want to keep this city," he
said. " Whoever the conqueror is, they all need this city to
re-make the rest of the republic. It is peace which interests
us. One should save the city."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic and Popular Forces (FDP) of former
Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who is fighting with
President Pascal Lissouba, announced this morning the capture of
Pointe-Noire by FDP forces.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces are circulating now on the principal artery of the
city, Avenue Charles de Gaulle. Residual resistance remains in
certain peripheral districts, but from now to mid-day, we will
have finished sweeping the last militiamen, the Zulus, Cocoyes and
other Mambas (supporting President Lissouba)," said FDP spokesman
Isidore Mvouba.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest development, France put its troops
deployed in Gabon and Chad on alert for a possible intervention to
evacuate about 1,600 French nationals now in Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
But the French oil group Elf said the situation in Pointe-Noire
is calm and normalizing.
</P>
<P>
Pointe-Noire is Congo's second largest city, and is the base
for several oil companies engaged in offshore oil exploration in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
The oil trade volume of the city in 1997 is estimated at 800
billion CFA francs (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), with an expected
net income of some 380 billion CFA francs (600 million
U.S. dollars) for Congo.
</P>
<P>
The city accounts for 85 percent of the total oil product
exports of Congo, whose gross domestic product (GDP) heavily
depends on the oil industry. The Djeno oil terminal in the city
handled in 1995 traffic of 9.4 million tons of oil and liquefied
gas.
</P>
<P>
Elf-Congo, a branch of the French oil group Elf-Aquitaine, is
the biggest oil operator in Pointe-Noire, producing 720 million
barrels of crude oil out of the 870 million barrels produced there
each year.

</P>
<P>
"By witnessing the fierce competition, I was as nervous as I
was awaiting my first child in the hospital," said Fok.
</P>
<P>
As one of the ace cyclists in Asia, Wong won the Tour of the
Philippines and Tour of Chinese Taipei and finished second in the
Asian Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, a 16-year-old teenager from Liaoning province, reapt
her third gold medal by taking the women's 400-meter freestyle in
an Asian mark.
</P>
<P>
Chen who broke the world record in the 400-meter individual
medley on Monday and won the 200m freestyle on Tuesday, clocking
the year-best of four minutes five seconds in the 400-meter

Her winning timing beat the previous Asian mark of 4:09.22 set
by Zhou Guanbin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Wang Luna of Shanghai who lost to Chen in the 200m freestyle,
finished second again in 4:07.86. Chen Hua of Zhejiang bagged
home the bronze in 4:09.56.

World record holder He Cihong of the Chinese Army was beaten to
second place by Zhen Yingjuan of Guangdong province in the women's
100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Zhen, 19, was timed at one minute and 0.22 second, only six
hundredths of a second shy of the world mark, which was set by He
in the Rome Swimming Worlds in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Le Jingyi also had something to cherish after
anchoring her teammates to win the women's 4X100m freestyle relay
in three minutes and 42.30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100m freestyle, local favorite Jiang Chengji
displayed his prowess by taking the gold in 50.62 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the breakthrough for the Chinese men swimmers by
finishing the record fourth places both in 50m and 100m freestyles
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped to set a new Asian record," said the disappointed
Jiang. "And now I can only hope to challenge the foreign ace
swimmers in the World Championships."
</P>
<P>
The men's 200m butterfly was taken by Xie Xufeng of Guangdong
in one minute and 59.07 second.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Scientists Have High Hopes for Tibet Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists think that the
Tibet Autonomous Region could follow in the footsteps of the
oil-rich Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
After years of oil exploration, potential oilfields have been
mapped by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the
China National Petroleum Corporation in the Qiangtang Basin in
northern Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Thick oil layers have been discovered in the Gangba Basin in
southern Tibet on more than 10,000 sq.m. of ground, according to
Qiu Dongzhou, of the China Academy of Geological Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Geologists found the region's first deep oil deposit, with 200
million tons, in the Lhupola Basin, and 1.5 million tons of proven
reserves have been found.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have found 6-sq. km. No. 1 field, and a major oil
formation has been found along the Changliu Spring-Tsony-Baitan
Lake Block in the Qiangtang Basin.
</P>
<P>
Many geologists believe that Tibet has favorable geology for
oil formations. The strata are of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
periods and similar to oilfields in the Persian Gulf and the
Karakorum in Central Asia. Tibet is called "the last and largest
oil belt on the continents".
</P>

<HEADLINE> President Kim's Son Appeals His Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The second son of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam today appealed his case to the Seoul
District Court, two days after being sentenced to three years in
prison for bribery and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Through his lawyer, Kim Hyun-chul contended that it was
unreasonable for the court to find him guilty of evading taxes
which he was never asked to pay.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's ruling, the court ordered the junior Kim to pay
524.2 million won (about 580,000 U.S. dollars) in penalty for
receiving the same amounts of bribes from businessmen. He was also
fined 1.44 billion won (about 1.51 million dollars) for tax
evasion with the "political funds" he received from them.
</P>
<P>
It was the first case in South Korea, in which someone was
punished for failing to pay tax on political funds received.
</P>
<P>
But some taxation experts are skeptical about the court
judgement, and it is not clear whether the same principle will be
applied to other politicians against the background of the
sharpening political dispute on political funds.
</P>
<P>
It has been a common practice in South Korea for decades for
politicians to get funds from businessmen.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Wong Kam-Po won the first gold
for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at the
National Games by taking the men's 180km cycling competition on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 24, clocked four hours 10 minutes and 7.50 seconds for
the historical title, the first won by HKSAR in the National Games
after it returned to China in July.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pround to win the first gold for Hong Kong," he said
after beating a field of 56 riders.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok, head of the Hong Kong delegation for the Games,
said the gold will enhance the morale for other Hong Kong
athletes.
</P>
<P>
"By witnessing the fierce competition, I was as nervous as I
was awaiting my first child in the hospital," said Fok.
</P>
<P>
"Our participation in the Games and the first gold for Hong
Kong athlete, demonstrated the acknowledgement of its Hong Kong
compatriots by the motherland," he added.
</P>
<P>
As one of Asia's ace cyclists, Wong won the Tour of the
Philippines and Tour of Chinese Taipei and finished second in the
Asian Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Tang Xuezhong finished second with 0.34 second behind
and Tianjin's Zhang Hao settled for the bronze with 4:10:27 as
the course was shortened to 157.88 kilometers due to rains.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR has sent in a 257-member delegation with 168 athletes to
vie for medals from 20 sports.

<HEADLINE> EU to Improve Aid Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today decided to improve the
implementation of its aid to third world countries.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said it made the decision because its aid
programs currently had neither the visibility or the political and
geo-strategic impact they should have.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, programs and the number of countries in which
the Commission operates have increased while the Commission staff
has not grown in proportion to the workload.
</P>
<P>
The decision aims to simplify and rationalize the
implementation of the various programs, increase coherence and
transparency and make effective use of economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
By delegating technical tasks to a Joint Service, staff in the
external services would be able to better concentrate on the
primary tasks of aid.
</P>
<P>
The new structure was needed to enable the Commission to
effectively use an ever increasing aid budget amounting to almost
seven billion ECUs, or nine billion U.S. dollars, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The proposal reconciles the need to improve co-ordination and
coherence between the wide range of programs, while maintaining
their flexibility to respond to individual countries' needs or
specific situations, such as urgent humanitarian aid.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Spain scored a 5-2 win over
the Netherlands, who squandered its many opportunities at goal, in
the men's hockey Champions' Trophy tournament Wednesday night in
Adelaide, Australia,
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in seven meetings that Spain defeated the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Spain, whose captain Joaquin Malgosa played his 203rd match to
set a new Spanish hockey record, demonstrated brilliant defensive
skills and stick control under intense pressure from the current
Champions Trophy holder.
</P>
<P>
Despite two early Dutch attempts on goal, one from the field by
captain Stephan Veen and one penalty corner, Spain took the lead
with two goals in the first 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Javier Arnau scored twice for Spain who has six points from
three games.
</P>
<P>
Teun de Nooijer netted twice in three minutes before halftime
to briefly bring the Dutch back into the match.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands failed to capitalise on any of its six penalty
corners during the second half.
</P>
<P>
European champion Germany moved into second place in the
standings on seven points, two behind unbeaten host Australia,
with a 3-1 win over Asian champion South Korea later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Bechmann, Patrick Bellenbaum and Oliver Domke hit for
Germany, who has played one more game than their close rivals,
after Seong Tae Song gave South Korea an early lead.

<HEADLINE> Exodus Triggered by Continuing ECOMOG-S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian forces in the west
African peace-keeping forces (ECOMOG) traded heavy artillery
overnight with the Sierra Leone army at Jui, 13 miles east of
Freetown, which resulted in an exodus of civilians today fleeing
into the capital.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Sierra Leone ferried a large number of troops to
the warfront in what is seen as a preparation for a pitched
battle with the Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul Bangura, a medical statistician at the main
hospital in Freetown told Xinhua that a total of about 30 cases
have so far been recorded as a result of clashes since last
Friday between government troops and ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangura, two unidentified corpses and 11 injured
victims were brought to the hospital on Friday, which included
six males, five females and four children under 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The victims sustained injuries when they were hit by fragments
and explosions in the nearby village of Wellington, he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to 19 cases were recorded from Saturday to Monday including
four deaths, two of whom, were children, Bangura said, adding
that no cases were reported on Tuesday and victims with minor
wounds have been treated and discharged.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Anderson, spokesman for the chief of staff at the
military headquarters, also gave what he called preliminary
figures of military casualties over the five-day period.
</P>
<P>
Two government soldiers and five members of the people's army
(former rebel combatants) died, he said.
</P>
<P>
A defense source disclosed that Captain Solomon Musa, chief
secretary of state (Prime Minister), survived a one-mile long
ambush in Grafton (near Jui) by Nigerian soldiers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources said seven Nigerian soldiers were killed by
rocket-propelled grenades while the Sierra Leone side suffered no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Musa and his team were visiting the war zone
when they ran into the ambush.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman told Xinhua that government troops were
occupying all strategic points in Jui while the Nigerians were
either at a former medical college building or a slope
overlooking Jui.
</P>
<P>
"It is from these directions that they are shelling our
positions," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have pushed back the Nigerians from the strategic Orogu
bridge and established a strong military presence on the main
road but we are not allowing traffic to go through yet as the
area is still unsafe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from Kenema in the east said a Nigerian
airforce jet flew over the town at very low altitude on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The plane flew very low sending everyone into panic that it
was about to drop some bomb on the Brigade Headquarters but it
did not," said one resident.

<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- All Communist Party of China
(CPC) and government departments will no longer be allowed to
purchase what are considered luxury consumer goods like cellular
phones or to take part in expensive recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the
CPC Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection, made this
announcement at a national telephone conference today.
</P>
<P>
A new anti-corruption drive running through next Spring is
focusing on the rampant use of luxury items and extravagant
activities and reflects the essence of the recent 15th Party
Congress, Wei explained.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been some success in this since the last
tele-conference in May, it should not be overestated, Wei said,
calling the move a significant one by CPC Central Leadership and
one that will build a clean government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous
regions show that, by the end of September, local Party and
government offices had halted the following: construction work on
over 2,500 office buildings; 13,000 meetings of various kinds;
2,400 ceremonial services; and over 2,600 inspection activities.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,900 CPC members and government officials were
disciplined for being involved in extravagant activities paid for
with public funds, and a number of government-paid mobile phones
and house phones were removed with.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yan, who broke the world
record in the women's 400-meter individual medley and won the 200m
freestyle early, captured her third gold medal from the women's
400m freestyle at the Eighth National Games on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 16, clocked the year-best of four minutes five seconds
for the gold, beating the previous Asian mark of 4:09.22 set by
Zhou Guanbin in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Chen was chased by Shanghai's Wang Luna in 4:07.86. Chen Hua
of Zhejiang finished third in 4:09.56.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very satisfied with the results," Chen said. "I have
trained in Beijing for a period of time before coming over here. I
guessed I have been in a superb form."
</P>
<P>
Yet, coach Han Bingyan warned her of serious challenges in the
World Swimming Championships to be staged in Perth, Australia,
next January.
</P>
<P>
"A few swimmers have proved their strong strength in the
European Championships and the Pan-Pacific Championships this
year," Han said. "And I believe Chen can win over them thourgh
hard training in the two months."
</P>
<P>
In the men's 100m freestyle, local favorite Jiang Chengji
showed his prowess by taking the gold in 50.62 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"It's not my favorite and it's rather hard for me to win the
gold. I stopped trainning for four months after returning from the
Atlanta Olympic Games," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who swore at the opening ceremony on behalf of the
athletes, made the breakthrough for the Chinese men swimmers by
finishing the record fourth places both in 50m and 100m freestyles
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped to set a new Asian record," said the disappointed
Jiang. "And now I can only hope to challenge the foreign ace
swimmers in the World Championships."
</P>
<P>
He also denied the rumor on his retirment. "I will not quit
soon, but I will give up some events which are not suitable to my
conditions in the later international meets."
</P>
<P>
World record holder He Cihong of the Chinese Army was beaten to
second place by Zhen Yingjuan of Guangdong province in the women's
100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
Zhen, 19, was timed at one minute and 0.22 second, only six
hundredths of a second shy of the world mark, which was set by He
in the Rome Swimming Worlds in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I failed to keep my good form after the Rome Worlds," He
explained.
</P>
<P>
The men's 200m butterfly was taken by Xie Xufeng of Guangdong
in one minute and 59.07 second.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Le Jingyi anchored her win in the women's
4X100m freestyle relay with a time of three minutes and 42.30
seconds for the host Shanghai team, which also included Cai
Huijue, Zhu Yingwen and Wang Luna.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Accused of Defying Sanction on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, whose troops are
leading the enforcement of sanctions against Sierra Leone, has
accused Ukraine of defying the United Nations order on the
severance of relations with the military junta by shipping goods
to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
One week after the U.N. Security Council announced oil, arms
and other sanctions against the junta, "Ukraine is shipping goods
and services to Freetown," Nigeria's defense spokesman, Col.
Godwin Ugbo, said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These developments "are gradually showing that sanctions may
not work because of varied interests in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both the sub-regional economic community known as ECOWAS and
the Security Council are imposing sanctions for an early
restoration of the legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah ousted in a coup on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the junta in Sierra Leone hired
Ukrainian shipping companies to import fuel and food in the wake
of the ECOWAS economic embargo on the troubled country two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Expo Times, a Sierra Leone newspaper seen as the
mouthpiece of the junta, once quoted a Ukrainian captain as
saying "in the event that we are attacked while delivering food
and other essential supplies to Sierra Leone, we will prove to
Nigeria what military might we also have."
</P>
<P>
The west African peacekeeping forces led by Nigeria and
mandated by ECOWAS to enforce the embargo has warned it will
attack any violators of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has also said if sanctions fail to press the junta out
of power, it will consider the use of force to oust the coupists.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between ECOWAS peacekeepers and the junta's army has
been reported over the past few days even after ECOWAS decided
last weekend to resume dialogue with the illegal regime in Sierra
Leone.

<HEADLINE> France Puts Troops in Africa on Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- France has put its troops
deployed in Gabon and Chad on alert for possible intervention in
the Congo Republic, French military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
This order was issued after the Congo Republic's oil city,
Pointe-Noire, fell to Angolan troops this morning.
</P>
<P>
Angolan troops entered the city earlier today from the Angolan
enclave of Cabinda and took control of the city, meeting little
resistance from Congolese government forces, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is confusing in Pointe-Noire... France has put
into place all the means for ensuring a possible evacuation of all
the French nationals if the situation calls for it," said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
French military sources said that if necessary, French troops
will evacuate about 1,600 French nationals, now in Pointe-Noire,
to Libreville, the capital of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is now very very critical. The Angolan troops
entered (Pointe-Noire) very early... around 6:30 (5:30 GMT). The
city is entirely occupied and submitted to looting," the French
consular in Pointe-Noire, Andre Querton, told French television
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry set up a crisis team and opened a
telephone service for relatives of the French nationals trapped in
Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
However, the French oil group Elf-Aquitaine, which has a branch
in Pointe-Noire, said earlier today that the situation was calm.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ASEAN Free Trade Area in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Council
Meeting of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) was held here today
with ASEAN member countries agreeing to speed up the schedule and
tariff cuts for the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
All the nine ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam -- reaffirmed at the one-day meeting their commitment to
realizing the AFTA by the year 2003 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
The AFTA was mooted in 1992 with an objective to create an
ambitious single market within 15 years beginning from January
1993, to enhance ASEAN's position as a competitive production base
geared towards servicing the global market.
</P>
<P>
To implement the AFTA concept, the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme was launched on January 1, 1993.
Since then, much progress has been made towards that direction.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for realizing the AFTA has been moved up from the
year 2008 fixed originally to the year 2003 when import taxes must
be no more than 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 93 percent or 40,755 tariff lines of the original six
ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand -- are included in the inclusion list for
CEPT concessions.
</P>
<P>
As for new members, a grace period has been given for each of
them to join the AFTA. Vietnam, which joined ASEAN in 1995, has
been given a grace period until 2006 to join AFTA while Laos and
Myanmar, which joined ASEAN in July 1997, are allowed until 2008
to complete cutting import taxes to an average five percent or
less.
</P>
<P>
An encouraging sign in the creation of AFTA is that over 85
percent of intra-ASEAN trade is already at between zero and five
percent under the CEPT scheme.
</P>
<P>
Regulations contained in the CEPT scheme clearly spell out
commitments to tariff reduction and "what countries can or cannot
do".
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, member countries can exclude products from the
CEPT scheme, for the protection of their national security, human,
animal, or plant life.
</P>
<P>
There are goods that need to have preferences, or protection,
but there is an avenue for them under the temporary exclusion list
(TEL), or even the "sensitive" or "highly sensitive lists" such as
rice and sugar. Eventually, they have to be brought under the TEL
and thereafter under the CEPT scheme.
</P>
<P>
The result is that some countries, such as Indonesia and the
Philippines, have more items on the "exclusion list", a list which
makes the goods ineligible for tariff reduction. Others, such as
newcomers Myanmar and Laos, need not satisfy the tariff targets
until nine years later.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of unprocessed farm products in the tariff
reduction scheme has been a thorny issue for ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
To complement the region's AFTA scheme, ASEAN members decided
last year to implement the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), details of
which are expected to be finalized by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The AIA seeks to promote ASEAN as a single investment region.
Through it, ASEAN would strive to make the region a more
attractive location for foreign direct investment by reducing
barriers to the free flow of capital and the adoption of more
transparent rules.
</P>
<P>
The fact that ASEAN, one of the world's fastest growing
regions, sits right in the middle of the Asia-Pacific region, the
hottest investment destination in the world today, has made it the
focus of attention. Its market potential of some 500 million
people is indeed attractive.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Is Crucial to China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's one-child policy is
expected to have a far-reaching influence on the country's
sustainable development, experts said at the on-going 23rd
International Union for the Scientific Study of Population's
General Population Conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They held that China must persist in its population controls to
ease the pressure of its already immense population on the
environment and limited resources.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable development means development achieved without
making conditions worse for later generations, according to Wang
Qiming, an official with the national center of the 21st Century
Agenda.
</P>
<P>
Although the rate of population growth in China is falling, the
number of new births remains large, Wang noted. By the end of
1996, China had 1.22 billion people, 22 percent of the world's
total. Each year, about 21 million babies are born, and the net
population increase is about 13 million.
</P>
<P>
If China does not control its population growth, deterioration
of the environment is inevitable, said Lu Yu of the Shandong
Academy of Social Science.
</P>
<P>
"This would threaten sustainable development and the basic
living condition of the Chinese people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China's one child policy is estimated to have reduced the
population by 300 million.

<HEADLINE> Seoul's Share Prices Dip to Five Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the South Korean
stock market plummeted to nearly 600 points today, to the lowest
level in five years, as the cash-strapped Ssangbangwool Group
applied for court mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Stock Price Index (KOSPI) dropped a hefty 15.94
points to close the day at 604.74 points, two days after the
government announced a set of bourse buoyancy measures.
</P>
<P>
The index marked the lowest level since October 28, 1992 when
it stood at 585.34.
</P>
<P>
Ssangbangwool's application for court mediation chilled
investors' sentiments, prompting a widespread selling-spree on the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
Panic fed rumors of imminent bankruptcies of numerous other
large business groups, which were reportedly suffering an acute
shortage of funds over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all sectors fell victims to today's drop, with firms
rumored to be suffering from cash-flow problems experiencing
considerable drops in their share prices, said bourse analysts.

<HEADLINE> Intra-ASEAN Trade Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Intra-ASEAN trade
grew at more than twice the rate of about 3.7 percent the world
merchandise export enjoyed from 1995 to 1996, it was officially
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at the end of the one-day ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Free Trade Area (AFTA)
council meeting here, total ASEAN exports expanded from 296.7
billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 323.4 billion dollars in 1996,
increasing by 8.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the successful implementation of the AFTA's
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme, Intra-ASEAN
trade continued to expand much faster than the member countries'
total trade.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Intra-ASEAN exports grew by 13.4 percent
from 68.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 77.8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Intra-ASEAN exports of CEPT products grew by 11.3 percent from
56.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 62.6 billion U.S. dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's total exports grew from 228 billion U.S. dollars to
245.6 billion dollars, rising 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was double the growth of world trade and showed ASEAN's
strong fundamentals, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the AFTA Council endorsed the CEPT packages
submitted by the new ASEAN members, Laos and Myanmar, which joined
ASEAN in July.
</P>
<P>
The council also examined the growth of intra-ASEAN trade and
strengthened the CEPT agreement by making emergency provisions
consistent with the World Trade Organization and examined the
progress in eliminating non-tariff barriers and harmonizing
customs.
</P>
<P>
Ministers at the council meeting agreed that the CEPT package
would be implemented by member countries in the coming year, and
the 1998 package would be finalized by November 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On CEPT tariff rate, the statement said that the average CEPT
tariff rate of products in the inclusion list had fallen to 6.38
percent in 1997 from about 12.76 percent in 1993 at the start of
the tariff reduction program and is scheduled to fall to 2.55
percent by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The council agreed that trade barriers, including bureaucratic
and administrative barriers and delays in decision etc., should be
eliminated to support the AFTA process.

<HEADLINE> Indian Industry Shows Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- India's industry has started
to show signs of recovery with improved performance of the
manufacturing and electricity sectors during the first four months
of the current fiscal year, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest quick estimates of the Index of
Industrial Production (IIP) released here today by the Central
Statistical Organization, industrial production grew by 6.4
percent in April-July compared with 5.2 percent in the first
quarter of the current fiscal year (from April 1997 to March
1998).
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector staged the most remarkable recovery
particularly in the month of July with a growth rate of 9.1
percent as against a mere 3.0 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall performance of a 6.4 percent growth
registered in April-July remained relatively poor compared with
10.5 percent in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The official figures were released barely a day after Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's Tuesday meeting with manufacturing
industries to find ways out of the sustained industrial slowdown.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the government promised to announce
a series of measures to spur the economy within a week.

HELSINKI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Speaker Riita
Uosukainen said today that Finland and China enjoy a friendship as
solid as the Finnish forest.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks when meeting visiting Chinese Deputy
Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) Tomur Dawamat.
</P>
<P>
Recalling her visit to China in 1994, she said the rapid
development of China left her with a deep impression. She stressed
the fact that the development of friendship between the two
countries had gained strong momentum in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Tomur Dawamat noted that the distance of the two countries does
not affect the existing good relationship. On the contrary, the
relationship is developing very smoothly in all spheres,
particularly in trading, where there has been 20 percent increase
every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since China is a big market and Finland has
many advanced technologies, there is a great potential for
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC's Standing
Committee, Tomur Dawamat invited Riita Uosukainen to visit China
once again. Uosukainen accepted the invitation.

<HEADLINE> EC to Lower Telecommunications Entry Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive agency, today agreed to reduce
charges for telecommunications operators.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation on the prices is due to apply after the
opening of the liberalized EU telecommunications market on January
1, 1998, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Interconnection charges constitute one of the biggest cost
items for new entrants in the telecommunications sector, some of
whom find that up to 40 percent of their cost has gone in payment
to established operators.
</P>
<P>
"With this recommendation, the Commission is sending a strong
signal to the market that we expect interconnection prices in
Europe to be very competitive," said EU Commissioner Martin
Bangemann, on whose initiative the recommendation was agreed.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation sets out "best current practice" prices,
which will be based on the lowest prices from three EU member
states. It will make some original operators' charges two or three
times lower.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation also aims to lower the cost of calls from
mobile phones to fixed networks, and that of long distance calls
between EU member states.

<HEADLINE> China Has To Confront Aging Challenge in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Demographers at an
international conference on population in Beijing say that China
needs to improve its social security system while developing its
economy in the next two decades to meet the aging challenge of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the proportion of children in China will
continue to drop while the proportion of elderly begins to
increase in the 1982-2025 period.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenfan, director of the China National Aging Committee,
explains that up to the 2030s, the proportion of working people in
the total population will remain above 60 percent and the annual
increase of six million provides good labor sources for economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
China has had a sharp drop in fertility since it started the
one-child policy in 1980, and experts predict that China will
become an aging society at the end of this century. The number of
people above 60 will increase to 130 million by then, 10 percent
of the population, then to 280 million in 2025, and to about 400
million in 2050, amounting to more than a quarter of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Bijun, of the Chinese Social Science Academy, says that
China is aging faster than its economy is growing as a result of
family planning. He explains that developed countries normally
encounter this challenge during periods of economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Xiong predicts that this imbalance will remain for quite a long
period of time.

<HEADLINE> EU to Promote Combined Heat, Power Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today accepted a proposal on
the promotion of combined heat and power generation (CHP).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, adopted at the initiative of Christos Papoutsis,
EU commissioner responsible for energy, suggests a strategy to
facilitate CHP development and remove barriers to its penetration
in the European market.
</P>
<P>
It was cited as an energy-saving and environmentally friendly
system of heat and power production.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to establish the actions and policies
required at EU level to ensure that CHP benefits are exploited by
a significant penetration in gross electricity generation in the
EU by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy we propose is another example of our
determination to promote rational use of our energy resources and
thus significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Papoutsis
said.
</P>
<P>
The CHP system is an efficient way of exploiting all the
useful energy within a fuel -- oil, gas and coal. A CHP plant can
convert 85 to 90 percent of the energy content of the fuel. Only
30 to 40 percent of energy is converted to useful energy in a
conventional way.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Produces 55 Percent of Wheat Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's gross wheat production
reached 6 million tonnes in 1996 to cover 55 percent of the need of
the nation, a net wheat importer, Minister of Agriculture Youssef
Wali said today.
</P>
<P>
This year's output is expected 3.3 percent higher to reach 6.2
million tonnes and more than double the production in the
mid-1980s, he said in an address to a symposium on "French wheat
and its uses," which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
But this amount would still leave a large supply shortfall in a
country of 62 million people with an annual per capita wheat
consumption of 200 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
As the top importer of vegetarian products from Europe, Egypt
is working to narrow the gap between its needs and actual yield of
wheat through application of high-tech methods and increasing the
cultivated plot, Wali said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the biggest importer of wheat in the world, imports
one billion U.S. dollars of American wheat annually to fill the
domestic shortfall.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it has been allocating 3 billion pounds (883.4 million
dollars) every year to provide subsidized cheap wheat bread,
which is the most important staple food of common Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
The government said it is expected to realize 75 percent
self-sufficiency in wheat production three years from now, while
the Food and Agriculture Organization predicted that Egypt will be
totally self-sufficient in wheat in five years.
</P>
<P>
Today's symposium surveyed the optimal utilization of the grain
and possible cooperation between wheat farmers in Egypt and
France, which turned from the ranks of wheat-importers to the
world fifth largest exporter.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Meets with Surinamese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
and visiting Surinamese President Jules Albert Wijdenbosch here
today discussed economic cooperation between the two countries, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is considering forming a kind of cooperation with
Suriname in the fishery sector, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have much experience in developing fish and shrimp ponds,
which Suriname is also developing at present," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
While the two heads of state had a tete-a-tete, the ministers
and senior officials of the two countries held parallel meetings
on cooperation in various fields, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
At a state banquet last night in honor of the Surinamese
president who arrived here Tuesday for a four-day visit, President
Soeharto said Indonesia wanted to share its experience with
Suriname.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia and Suriname had worked hand-in-hand through
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Group-77 and the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also said the monetary crisis in Indonesia and other
Southeast Asian nations would obviously slow down the pace of
development.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah has dropped 46 percent against the U.S.
dollar since the beginning of this year following the speculative
attacks on the currencies in the region in July.
</P>
<P>
Jules and his party will also visit Bali and Yogyakarta from
Thursday to Friday and then return home via Singapore, officials
here said.

TOKYO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
begin talks with the three ruling parties on establishing liaison
offices with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
Kyodo news service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two
non-cabinet allies -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New
Party Sakigake, asked the government to set up a formal channel
between Japan and the DPRK to discuss bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by executives of the three parties during
a meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other top
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Chief Cabinet Secretary Kanezo Muraoka told an afternoon Press
conference that the government will further discuss the call with
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The proposed liaison offices are intended as a channel for
dialogues between Japan and the DPRK prior to normalization of
diplomatic relations, a government source told Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have no diplomatic ties, agreed in
August to resume negotiations on normalizing relations.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Gas Development Has Rosy Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Mideast plans to invest
tens of billions of US dollars in its proven natural gas
resources.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the 15th World Petroleum Congress in Beijing say
that gas deposits there account for about a third of the world's
total, but there is still exploration to be done and output is
only a fifteenth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the largest producer of natural gas in the region, with
2.3 billion cubic meters in deposits, or 46.5 percent of the
area's total and 15 percent of the world's, making it 2nd after
Russia.
</P>
<P>
On September 28, France's Total signed a two-billion-US-dollar
natural gas agreement with Iran, ignoring the U.S.'s sanctions
against Iran, to help Iran develop natural gas in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Qatar reached a 25-year agreement with a Japanese power company
earlier this year to provide six million tons of liquefied natural
gas every year to the company. Last year, it started to supply the
United States with 57,000 tons of liquefied natural gas. Another
source says that Qatar will export liquefied natural gas to Spain
from November of this year to the end of 1998. This is regarded as
the first time the country has been successful in marketing gas in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and four foreign oil companies started a natural gas
development corporation in March, while Egypt has been giving
priority to oil and gas resources. A total of seven US companies,
nine European companies, and 21 enterprises from other countries
are involved in oil and gas exploration in the country. Since
early last year, 32 oil and gas fields have been discovered.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Iraq, which is suffering from UN imposed
sanctions, is also choosing appropriate partners for exporting
natural gas.

<HEADLINE> China To Look For Oil In Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has won a bid for oil
exploration in two blocks in Venezuela in the third round of
bidding there, according to Zeng Xingqiu, deputy director of the
China National Petroleum Corporation's Department of International
Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Zeng told Xinhua today that the bid was 358 million US dollars
for a 20-year contract on a 39 sq km area. The bid was CNPC's
largest ever overseas and could be a sign of recognition of CNPC's
technology and strength by the international petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 90 companies bidding, including most major
ones. Venezuela is one of the world's major oil-producing
countries and has an estimated recoverable reserves of 10.15
billion tons, and produced 170 million tons of crude oil last year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng says that China is both a big oil producer and a big
consumer. "The rich oil reserves and its opening process in
Venezuela create favorable conditions for China to enter the
marketplace," he said, and there is great potential for
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a petroleum co-operation agreement
during Chinese Premier Li Peng's Venezuela visit last
November. The petroleum industries in the two country have done
"fruitful work" since then in implementing the agreement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that the Chinese government has an oil development
strategy on developing both domestic and overseas resources and,
with this active attitude, China and Venezuela will have bright
prospects for petroleum cooperation.

<P>
SUBANG JAYA, Malaysia, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic
ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
today agreed that the recent currency crisis in the region has
made the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) more
important for the grouping.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the 11th AFTA Council Meeting held
here today which reviewed progress in the implementation of the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff, the main operating mechanism
for AFTA, announced Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz at a joint press conference at the end of
the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from all the nine ASEAN member countries -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam -- reaffirmed their commitment to realizing
AFTA by the year 2003 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the recent depreciation of the region's
currencies had created favorable conditions for further expanding
ASEAN exports, both within and outside the region.
</P>
<P>
It has created a window of opportunities for the region's
industries to enter a period of consolidation and to make
necessary adjustments to increase their competitiveness in the
long run, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that transient economic and exchange
rate fluctuations experienced by some member countries recently
would not affect the sound underlying economic fundamentals of the
region's economies.
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that the implementation of AFTA would
facilitate long-term adjustments of their economies to enhance
ASEAN's resilience towards external volatility.
</P>
<P>
They expressed optimism on the long-term economic prospects of
the region as well as its attractiveness to foreign direct
investment.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Resettlement Program Well under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 82,300 residents
had moved out of the Three Gorges Reservoir area by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 10 percent of the total number of the
people scheduled for resettlement for construction of Three Gorges
Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The
resettlement effort will serve as a basic guarantee for damming of
the main course of the river on November 8, according to
information released today by the Bureau of Resettlement and
Development under the State Council's Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee.
</P>
<P>
Houses and apartments, with a combined floor space of 3.35
million square meters, already built account for some 10 percent
of the total floor space of housing scheduled for construction.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement for the Three Gorges project commenced in 1993,
with 8.575 billion yuan spent for related efforts over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Regions outside the Three Gorges Area have played an active
role in helping with the resettlement effort. And organizations
from outside the Three Gorges area had provided 1.847 billion yuan
to fund some 829 aid projects by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bureau Spokesman Lu Chun said damming the main course of the
Yangtze will symbolize the end of first-phase resettlement. He
noted that the second phase will be even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Lu said between 300,000-400,000 people will be relocated over
the next five years, with 70,000-80,000 residents resettled
annually equalling the total for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of large towns will be moved to new areas.
</P>
<P>
Lu pledged that the bureau will extend still greater efforts to
ensure the fulfilment of goals for second stage resettlement.

<HEADLINE> 3 Condemned to Death for Reviving Egypt's Jihad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Three men were sentenced to death
today for trying to revive the ultra-radical group Al-Jihad
Organization during a massive trial of suspected Muslim militants
by an Egyptian military court.
</P>
<P>
Two of the condemned are still at large. Leaders of the
outlawed Jihad (holy war) Organization, live abroad and take a
non-conciliatory stance despite the unilateral promises by some
other armed groups in Egypt to abandon violence against the
government.
</P>
<P>
Also standing trial at the Egyptian Higher Military Court this
morning were 84 suspected Muslim militants involved in the
organization, 31 of them were acquited afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The court issued life sentences against two of the defendants
and passed imprisonment terms ranging from three to 15 years on 48
defendants. All the prison sentences are with hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Two other defendants were sentenced to serve two years in
prison and a third was fined 50 Egyptian pounds (about 14.7
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trial came exactly a month after Egypt's single largest
trial of Muslim extremists when 98 Muslims, including lawyers,
students and engineers and four women went on trial on charges of
attempting to topple Egypt's secular government by unleashing a
wave of terror.
</P>
<P>
Four were sentenced to death by hanging on conviction of
staging major terrorist attacks. They were allegedly members of
the outlawed Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group that
launched a violent campaign since 1992 to install a strict Islamic
rule. More than 1,200 people have been killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight got sentences ranging from one year to life
imprisonment and 26 others were acquited.
</P>
<P>
According to an anti-terrorism law, membership of outlawed
militants groups is punishable by death, but the punishment has
never been imposed. So far, 66 extremists have been executed but
for crimes such as murder or armed attacks on banks.
</P>
<P>
Suspected Islamic militants began to be tried in military
courts in 1993.

<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
and Chinese Academy of Engineering today announced that they will
develop an integrated, multi-purpose administration network for
state ministries and commissions to share information resources
among offices.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build its own large-scale network the near
future, says Zhu Gaofeng, deputy president of the Chinese Academy
of Engineering.
</P>
<P>
The network will be linked to Internet for more effective
high-level management, according to Lu Xinkui, director of the
General Office of the State Council Steering Committee for
National Information Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The problem with existing technology, Lu explains, is that it
cannot prevent hackers from breaking into the system, so Chinese
scientists are focusing on this technology now.
</P>
<P>
The two academies and the General Office will organize an
exhibition, the "China Adminisnet", from July 15 to 18, 1998 in
Beijing, on network equipment and technology, information
management equipment and technology, network application
technology, information security technology, and multimedia

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Industrial and commercial
enterprises in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin
Province, are developing rapidly in terms of registered capital,
but not in quantity.
</P>
<P>
By last June, the city had had 64,176 industrial and commercial
enterprises with capital topping 36.46 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and collectively-owned enterprises lead the way in
the city's overall development. There are 10,544 State-owned
enterprises involving 14.46 billion yuan in registered capital, up
2.1 percent over last year. There are 51,315 collectively-owned
enterprises with 13.72 billion yuan in registered capital, up 8.9
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Since the modern enterprise system was introduced to the city,
the number of share-holding enterprises has grown to 2,086 with
7.78 billion yuan in registered capital, up 11.7 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the growth rate of the number of industrial and
commercial enterprises in the city has been static at 6.6 percent,
compared with 13 percent in 1993. The number of newly registered
enterprises offsets those that have gone out of business.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Buy Electricity from American Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has signed an
agreement with an American company to procure electricity for a
period of 15 years, national news agency BSS reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here Tuesday night between
Bangladesh's Power Development Board (PDB) and M/S Congeneration
(Bangladesh) PVT Ltd., a full subsidiary of the Smith
Congeneration International of the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, M/S Congeneration (Bangladesh) PVT Ltd.
will sell power to the PDB on mutually variable prices, BSS said,
adding that the American company will install and commission a
100-megawatt power plant at Haripur near the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first private sector venture between
Bangladesh and a foreign company to generate electricity under the
private sector policy of the government announced last year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, based on the BOO (build-own-operate) cooperation
mode, will be implemented within 10 months of its signing. Efforts
are under way to advance the commissioning of the plant by April,
1998, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Smith Congeneration International will sell electricity
generated with liquid fuel to the PDB at the rate of 2.23 taka
(5.10 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour (KWH) in the initial stage,
BSS quoted PDB sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate will be reduced to 1.77 taka (4.16 U.S.
cents) per KWH in December 1998 when natural gas is available for
use as fuel for electricity generation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Four barge-mounted power plants each with a 100-megawatt
capacity are to be set up by the private sector in Bangladesh, the
PDB sources added.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga today condemned the explosion of downtown Colombo and
stated her government will continue the peace process in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly condemn the brutal bomb blast carried out in
Colombo this morning by some terrorist group," the president said
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
She said: "At a time when we have reached the point at which we
can resolve the present conflict and end the war, we should
realize that there are forces who are opposed to peace and the
development of the country."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed deep sympathy to the families and
friends of the victims of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to state categorically that we will not be disturbed
from our determination and commitment to bring peace to our
country," she added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Parties Urged to Refrain From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Sweden today called upon all
parties involved in the Cyprus issue to refrain from actions
hampering efforts for a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen after her meetings here today with President Glafcos
Clerides and House of Representatives Speaker Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to
discuss with Cypriot officials the Cyprus problem and island's
accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for a solution to the Cyprus problem, which
she described as important to both the people of Cyprus and to
Europe, Hjelm-Wallen told reporters that "we have heard about
overflights and military actions. That is something we are
worried about. It can hamper the whole peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Greek navy and air forces took part in the five-day Greek
Cypriot National Guard's annual military exercises which ended
Tuesday. The Turkish jet fighters were reported to frequently
violate the Greece and Cyprus' airspace over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen urged all sides, both the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities on the island, as well as Greece and Turkey
to "refrain from military actions and work in a constructive way
toward a solution" to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when the island was
divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish minister suggested that Greece and Turkey consider
once again a moratorium of flights of their warplanes over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' prospects to become an EU member before a
political solution was reached, Hjelm-Wallen said "we want to see
Cyprus in the EU but there must be a solution. The two should be
parallel."
</P>
<P>
She said she is unhappy with Ankara's threats of annexing the
northern part of the island if the EU proceeded with the
accession of Cyprus to the EU.
</P>
<P>
She also described as "not constructive" Turkey's role in the
U.N.-led direct talks between Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash in New York and Montreux, Switzerland, in July and
August.
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of direct talks ended in failure due to
Denktash's refusal of further negotiations unless the EU freezes
the plan to start accession talks with Cyprus in early 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fish Yield Increased Dramatically by Gender Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese technicians have
increased the yield of the "mouth breeder" fish by transforming
its gender.
</P>
<P>
After a period of ingesting a kind of Chinese herb together
with fish fodder, female mouth breeders will undergo a sex change, which
increases an individual fish's weight by more than 200 grams, said
Qin Deshan, head of the Beijing Changping Aquatic Farm.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is an important base in northern China for breeding the
fish, which originated in the Nile River of Africa. The fish has
become widely accepted for consumption in China.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the gender-change technique was developed by
technicians at the aquatic farm. By adopting this method, their
fish yield has increased by 90,000 tons in nine months, which is
equal to the establishment of one and a half aquatic farms.
</P>
<P>
The female mouth breeder is a fertile fish, but its weight
averages only 100 grams in one year. The natural ratio of male
and female mouth breeders is 50-50. Using the gender-altering
technique, the ratio now is 80 males to 20 females.
</P>
<P>
In another development, scientists at the Beijing Aquatic Research
Institute have found another way to increase the yield by
developing a distant hybridization method to cause infertility in
female mouth breeder.
</P>
<P>
After four years of experimentation, they have narrowed the
type of mouth breeders to two species. Using this technique, about
90 percent of newlyborn mouth breeders at the institute are males.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yinong, a senior engineer at the institute, said the net
income of a one-hectare fish pond can be increased by 50
percent using this technique.

<HEADLINE> Getting Oil Industry To Care About Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A major topic at the World
Petroleum Congress, which is going on in Beijing, is how to get
environmentally-minded people to be confident in the future of the
petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum products for industrial use have become the major
source of energy in the world and oil and gas consumption in
developing countries is expected to surpass the amount of member
countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development by early next century.
</P>
<P>
John Lemlin, general secretary of the International Petroleum
Industry and Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), says
that any attempt to restrict the production of petroleum and
natural gas before a suitable energy replacement for petroleum can
be found will have a disastrous effect on society.
</P>
<P>
However, oil and gas spilled while being transported and the
pollution caused by oil refineries and exhaust gas emissions from
cars and buses pose a serious threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Some international environmental protection organizations say
that their mission is to terminate petrochemical production
quickly and permanently.
</P>
<P>
So, oil companies' representatives and research institutes
agree that the key to dealing with the contradiction between oil
production and environmental protection lies in with the oil
industry itself, which should improve technology and increase
contacts with the public.
</P>
<P>
And, efforts have been made to get oil and natural gas at
deeper layers by the least destructive means, said one
expert. Engineers have developed an oil catamaran to prevent oil
leakage caused by marine accidents, and lead-free gasoline is now
widely used around the globe.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these developments, however, some research findings
have not been applied. And, people in the oil industry and the
public disagree about environmental protection needs. The former
claim that their disaster and pollution estimates are based on
scientific evidence, while the latter say they base everything on
their own concept of value.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is reported to be co-operating with the
International Maritime Organization to work out an international
guideline on controlling oil pollution, and some in the industry
are working on guidelines for dumping waste.
</P>
<P>
Lemlin said the petroleum industry faces a challenge on how to
produce oil and gas in a moral way that is acceptable to mankind
and the environment, and he has appealed to the industry to take a
more active approach to change its image.

DHAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today called for effective measures to make the management
of cooperatives more organized and dynamic, the official news
agency BSS reported.
</P>
<P>
"We could not get the desired results of cooperatives in our
economy and society due to mismanagement, corruption and lack of
sincerity and honesty in the past," she said while addressing a
function today to mark the awarding of the national cooperative
prize.
</P>
<P>
Cooperatives have been making important contribution to poverty
alleviation and developing socio-economic condition of the poor
people, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cooperatives are significant in generating employment for the
poor and in increasing their income through agriculture, small
industries, fisheries, poultry and livestock, she added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that farmers, fishermen and weavers
 should become organizers of their respective cooperatives in its
true perspective.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government is now implementing 28 cooperative
projects in the current fiscal year for the development of the
poor, have-nots and womenfolk at a cost of 1.71 billion taka
(about 38.51 million U.S. dollars), the prime minister said,
adding that such projects are being encouraged in the private
sector as they have been playing a positive role in poverty
alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Says IMF Team Won't Touch Amount Of Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia said it will not
discuss the amount of loans it needs to tide over its currency
crisis at the meeting between the government and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said Tuesday night that at
the meeting the IMF officials were told about the country's plan
to overcome its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
A team of the IMF and the World Bank arrived here Friday at the
invitation of the Indonesian government to discuss the country's
financial crisis. IMF officials and Indonesian officials started
discussion here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesia said it considered to seek long-term loans
from international financial institutions including the IMF to
help prevent its rupiah from further depreciation against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the rupiah has dropped 46 percent since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has instituted programs to resolve
the monetary crisis that hit the country since July, a step the
IMF would most likely want to know in detail, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
"If they (IMF) have the capacity to help us, why don't we take
it?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the government programs concern how to boost
non-oil/gas exports, how to stabilize the rupiah and how to
prevent businessmen from buying up the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's central bank intervened in the money
market Tuesday to bolster the rupiah, dealers said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank bought the rupiah at 3,495 against the U.S.
dollar, apparently guarding the 3,500 barrier as offshore dollar
buying emerged in early trading, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The intervention helped send the dollar down to the 3,450 level
before domestic purchase pushed the U.S. currency back up to the
3,470/80 level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said some big buying from local operators pushed the
dollar up, breaking the 3,500 barrier up to a high of 3,510.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear how much the central bank sold at the money
market.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prices of Basic Commodities Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Prices of basic commodities in
the Philippines has gone up 3 percent due to the depreciation of
the peso, the Department of Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Moreno, chief of the prices monitoring team of the
department, said that sardines, powdered milk and coffee are among
the goods whose prices have the highest surge.
</P>
<P>
Moreno attributed the price hikes to the plunge of the peso,
which has devaluated 30 percent to today's 34.3 pesos per dollar
since the financial turmoil swept Southeast Asia in early July.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists said the fall of the peso and the hike
of prices were not fully reflected in inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, the country's inflation
rate stood at an average of 4.7 percent, much lower than last
year's 8.4 percent.

<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Armed men wearing masks
kidnapped eight men and killed another today in a village near
Isabela, Basilan province, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Provincial police director Isah Abdullah said the kidnappers
were believed to be members of Abu Sayyaf, an extremist group
operating in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The victims were on board two passenger jeepneys and a truck
when they were stopped along a highway by the armed men. All the
passengers were asked to line up along the road.
</P>
<P>
The abductors selected nine men from the passengers and allowed
the others to go unharmed. One of the selected was shot dead when
he tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
The police can not ascertain the number of passengers who were
freed as they each went their way after being told to leave.
Neither can the police get the identities of the kidnap victims,
Abdullah said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expects Higher Economic Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may record an economic
growth rate higher than last year's 3.21 percent in 1997 but may
not attain the target of 5.5 percent growth, a senior government
official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Finance, Alhaji Abu Gidado, made the
statement at a meeting of the National Council on Finance and
Economic Development in Katsina.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state said the rise of Nigeria's external
reserve to over seven billion U.S. Dollars by September is an
indication of growth.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's external debt fell from 32
billion Dollars in 1995 to 28 billion Dollars in 1996, thanks to
improved debt management, Gidado said.
</P>
<P>
For the 1996 and 1997 fiscal year, two billion Dollars had
been budgeted each year for debt repayment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state stated that the country's revenue
performance has also witnessed substantial improvement. He
predicted that the revenue from the Value Added Tax will increase
from last year's 29.2 billion Naira (about 356 million Dollars)
to about 35 billion Naira (about 427 million Dollars).

HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) welcomed today Germany's
announcement that HKSAR passport holders who were frequent
travelers to Germany may be granted multiple-entry visas valid for
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
"The favorable treatment reflects a vote of confidence in the
SAR passports and signifies the strong commitment of the German
government to Hong Kong's continued success," a SAR government
spokesman said.

A press release issued earlier today by the Consulate General
of Germany said, the German government has decided to grant
multiple entry visas with a validity of up to five years and a
permitted duration of stay of up to 90 days per six months to
HKSAR and British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) passport holders.

the consulate general, and "so far, visas with a maximum validity
of up to one year have been issued."
</P>
<P>
The decision was conveyed by Head of the German Foreign
Office's Legal Department Dr. Hartmut Hillgenberg to HKSAR
Director of Immigration Mrs. Regina Ip on the occasion of his
visit to Hong Kong, according to the consulate general.
</P>
<P>
The German government's decision signals its confidence in the
SAR and its government, the consulate general pointed out.

<P>
In responding to the German statement, the SAR spokesman said
that the SAR government continues to welcome German nationals to
visit Hong Kong and to enjoy visa-free stays for up to one month.

HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Electronics
Fair, the largest-ever electronics trade fair in Asia, has
attracted many thousands of visitors from over 110 countries and
regions since it was opened in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 exhibitors from 20 countries and regions are
taking part in the four-day fair, which features an eye-opening
display of eight major categories: audio visual equipment, home
appliances, electronic gadgets, computers and multimedia,
electronic and electrical accessories, telecommunication
equipment, security systems and other related services.
</P>
<P>
The China Pavilion is stronger than ever with 111 exhibitors at
the fair. "We consider this a very important fair because it is a
good chance to meet face-to-face with our buyers and at the same
time learn from our visitors," said Qiao Benyuan, president and
chief executive officer of the China National Electronics Import
and Export Corporation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Europs Less Interested in S. A.'s Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- European investors, who
account for 52 percent of direct foreign investment in South
Africa, have low level of interest in black economic empowerment
opportunities, an Euro-Chamber survey disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The survey, quoted by "Business Report" today, said about 37
percent of respondents were not considering black empowerment, 35
percent were still considering it, 13 percent had already
implemented it and 15 percent were still in the process.
</P>
<P>
The survey was circulated to 600 companies of European
majority share-holding or origin operating in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"European firms are moderately committed to affirmative
action. But to our surprise, there is very little interest in
black empowerment," said Johannesburg-based Euro-Chamber
consultant Anahid Harrison, adding that it was difficult to
explain the reason for the disinterest.
</P>
<P>
The affirmative action was proposed by the South African
government in a bid to promote black people's social position
following the abolition of apartheid in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations concerned, a considerable percentage of
black people must be involved in all trades and professions in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Although general confidence had declined, more than 80 percent
of European investors were reportedly positive about South
Africa's economic situation and its prospects.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that respondents were generally positive
about the political framework and the context for economic
policies in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the South African government led by African
National Congress was showing consistency and commitment in its
economic policies, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Lost 4 Percent In Five Trading Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite a positive bond
market,
the Australian sharemarket fell again today after losing more than
4 percent of its value in the past five trading days.
</P>
<P>
Brokers and fund managers could not point to a definitive
reason for today's 8.3-point drop in the all ordinaries index
which fell to 2,653.7.
</P>
<P>
"I guess the major non-influence in the market today is that
the bond market is better yet equities are still down," said
broker Andrew Sekely of Intersuisse.
</P>
<P>
Don Hamson, an investment director at Westpac Investment
Management, said he could not explain the downward close, citing
rises in European and North American markets.
</P>
<P>
He said other factors could be the heavy falls in Hong Kong and
other Asian markets today, adding: "Asia has generally had a bad
day. But I would have thought it's not a big deal."
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was down 5.3 points at 1,313.5 and the
all industrials index was down 12.4 points at 4,357.8.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 327.24 million shares traded with a value
of 909.18 million Australian dollars (668.24 million U.S.
dollars), and falls of 680 easily outnumbered rises of 427.
</P>
<P>
Among the resources majors, Rio Tinto was down 35.7 cents, WMC
was down 1.9 cents, and bellwether BHP was down two cents.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five trading days, brokers have cited a range of
reasons for the falls in the all ordinaries index, from
less-than-convincing fears of the 10th anniversary of the Black
Tuesday to more concrete explanations such as falls on Wall Street
and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, National Australia Bank was down five
cents, ANZ Banking Group was down one cent, Commonwealth Bank was
down five and Westpac Banking Corp. was up two cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was down 2.6 points at 1,323.0, gold bullion
closed at 327.00 U.S. dollars an ounce, down 0.95 dollars on the
opening of 327.95.

<HEADLINE> Troops Invade Congolese Oil City From Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Troops coming from the Angolan
enclave Cabinda invaded Pointe-Noire, the "oil capital" of the
Congo Republic, this morning and met little resistance from the
government troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Democratic and Popular Forces (DPF) loyal to
former President Denis Sassou Nguesso said hours later in
Libreville, capital of Gabon, that the DPF forces had taken
Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
Quoting reports from Belgian expatriates in Pointe-Noire, the
Belgian Defense Ministry confirmed that Pointe Noire had fallen
into the hand of Angolan troops.
</P>
<P>
However, Angola immediately denied that its troops had
penetrated into Congolese territory or had entered Pointe-Noire.
</P>
<P>
"Angola has not sent soldiers to Congo," said a spokesman of
the Angolan Foreign Ministry in Luanda on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda, which is an Angolan enclave which thrusts into Congo,
is less than 100 kilometers from Pointe Noire.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted witnesses as saying that a
"column of armored vehicles arrived at Pointe-Noire at 6:00 a.m."
after crossing the border from the Angolan enclave of Cabinda.
</P>
<P>
Government forces did not make any serious resistance although
some cannon shots were fired in several parts of the city, the AFP
reported.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the forces invading Pointe Noire and their number
were not clear.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was still going on this morning in the Total market in
Bacongo between the DPF and the forces loyal to Prime Minister
Bernard Kolelas, who is allied with President Lissouba, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Gabonese President Omar Bongo, the president of the
international committee of mediation for Congo Republic, today has
"invited" the warring sides of Congo to start a ceasefire from
mid-night of October 17.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dips on Pressure by Profit Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
lower today, pressured down by profit-taking by investors, with
traders suggesting it might have been overbought recently.
</P>
<P>
But traders said local exporter interest to buy the unit at the
lower end of the day's trading range had seen it supported to the
close of the local session.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 73.51 U.S. cents, down from
73.78 previously.
</P>
<P>
"There was a bit of a pass-the-parcel down to the 73.50 area
and under that there were some stops (sell orders) that went off,"
said St George Bank foreign exchange dealer Tim Gillis.
</P>
<P>
Citibank Australia senior dealer Geoff Last said the Australian
dollar had been over-bought during the past few days following
last week's stronger-than-expected jobs data. Yesterday it touched
74.15 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Expectations are now growing in the market that the Reserve
Bank of Australia won't ease policy again in the short term.
</P>
<P>
But next week's third quarter inflation data are seen key to
supporting, or reversing, that outlook.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are
expected to show inflation remained subdued in the period.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 89.23 from 89.53 against yen,
and at 1.2853 from 1.2926 against mark.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Pledges to Strengthen Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai monetary authorities
stated here today that a package of future measures are to be
taken to strengthen the financial system in the financial
turmoil-worn Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has already taken a package of actions to
deal with the recent currency turmoil sweeping the Southeast Asian
region and Thailand in particular, the Thai Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Thailand said in a joint statement circulated
during the ongoing World Economic Forum's Six East Asia Economic
Summit.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to these immediate steps, several medium-term
actions to strengthen the financial system will be taken," the
statement said, adding that "these measures include a complete
overhaul of supervisory practices as well as legal and regulatory
reforms."
</P>
<P>
It said: "This program will be supported by extensive technical
assistance from abroad. The World Bank has already agreed with the
(Thai) government on a program for such assistance."
</P>
<P>
In the next step, the statement continued, the Ministry of
Finance and the Bank of Thailand will cooperate with concerned
authorities to improve the foundation of the Thai financial
system, particularly in the part that is still outdated, to be in
line with the international standards.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the measures to be taken soon
include improving a number of laws such as the Bankruptcy Act; the
system of accounting and public disclosure; and the efficiency and
timeliness of supervision and examination of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
All this will be under close consultation with experts from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it said, the experiences of the present adversity will
be used to lay the foundation for a better future and the
opportunity to achieve fundamental reforms will create a truly
strong financial system, which will give the base for future
economic growth and prosperity in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's goal is to make its financial system a very
efficient one in Asia by year 2000, the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Negative Impact on Sino-US Cooperation Urged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States should
introduce further steps to reduce the negative impact of
governmental conduct on Sino-US economic and technological
cooperation, according to Zhu Yuli, General Manager of Aviation
Industries of China (AIC).
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed the hope that the United States will take the
advantage of the forthcoming US visit by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to create a favorable political atmosphere for strengthening
mutually beneficial long-term cooperation in the realm of high
technology, including the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Xinhua, Zhu said that President
Jiang's visit to US will mark a new stage in Sino-US relations. He
said China and the United States should further intensify and
extend overall economic and technological cooperation to suit the
new situation of the improving Sino-US political ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the aviation industry is a high-tech and
strategic industry. Aviation industries in China and the US, he
added, have recorded major progress in the realm of
multi-patterned cooperation, with joint efforts covering
wide-ranging areas.
</P>
<P>
However, he also cited the latent capacity of cooperation in
the field. He said the main reason centers on US government
conduct which has limited possibilities for more extensive
cooperation between businesses.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed the hope that US political circles and businesses
will fully consider long-term interests when viewing the Chinese
market, and will "not let certain periods or events create
meaningless conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Wide-ranging Sino-US aviation cooperation currently involves
aircraft, engineers, mechanical installations, raw materials and
personnel training. Modes of cooperation include aircraft
assembling, and cooperative, subcontracted and joint manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The largest Sino-US cooperative aviation project involves the
assembly and co-production of aircraft. Shanghai Airline
Industrial Company (SAIC), an AIC affiliate, has assembled MD-82
aircraft of the former McDonnel Douglas Co. since 1985. The
company delivered 35 MD-82 in 1994, including five aircraft for
companies in the United States. SAIC is currently co-producing 20
MD-90 aircraft, with the first shipment scheduled for delivery in
1998. The two contracts are valued at 1.7 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Negative Impact on Sino-US Cooperation Urged (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Subcontracted production represents yet another important form
of cooperation. Several AIC affiliates, including aircraft
manufacturing companies in Chengdu, Xi'an and Shenyang, and the
Xi'an Aircraft Engine Co. have subcontracted with Boeing and
McDonnel Douglas. The Chinese companies have produced tail
sections for Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft, with related contracts
valued at closed to one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said his company imports 100 million US dollars worth of
avionics equipment, machinery processing equipment, raw materials
and computers annually. They account for some 60 percent of the
nation's total imports of related products, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said China continues to seek new forms of cooperation with
the US aviation industry, and noted that aircraft engine companies
in Chengdu and Xi'an are currently cooperating with United
Technologies Corporation of the US.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed to the Boeing-McDonnel merger as "purely a domestic
affair involving the restructuring of US enterprises".
</P>
<P>
He said the merger will strengthen the competency of the two
largest aviation companies in the US, and stressed that it should
have no bearing on the normal development of Sino-US contracts.
</P>
<P>
China has had one of the world's fastest growing aviation
industries in recent years. Although the industry ranks at the
forefront in the world in terms of scale and equipment, its
technology remains relatively backward.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that strengthened ties between aviation industries in
China and the US will benefit the latter's economy and provide
better access to the former's vast market.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that AIC, as one of the nation's largest
industrial enterprises, has been named as an experimental
enterprise to introduce shareholding system. This will provide an
excellent opportunity for the two countries to expand and
introduce new modes of cooperation, he added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Faces Two Challenges, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), which plays an influential role in
Southeast Asia, is faced with future political and strategic
challenges, an Indonesian expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a plenary session of the World Economic Forum's
Sixth East Asia Economic Summit held in the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center, Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of the Supervisory
Board of the Indonesian Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said regional peace has given its members for the first
time the chance to develop economically and to build nation and
state.
</P>
<P>
However, there are "many challenges to ASEAN's cooperation,
stature and influence in the future," he said, noting, "The most
important and basic challenge is whether ASEAN can adjust and
change in the face of these new challenges."
</P>
<P>
"The first challenge relates to the enlargement of ASEAN," he
said, adding that "the postponement of Cambodia's membership due
to domestic conflict, specifically due to the use of force by one
of the coalition parties to change the government, is the most
vivid example."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which was formed 30 years ago, now groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. The entry of Cambodia, which ASEAN had
agreed to admit together with Laos and Myanmar earlier this year,
was later deferred owing to the situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Another important challenge is the increased participation of
ASEAN non-official organizations and peoples in shaping ASEAN's
future cooperation," Wanandi said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since no more wars are expected to break
out among its members, ASEAN may cease to be taken seriously by
its members.
</P>
<P>
"Only with greater support, participation and attention by its
people as well as its non-governmental organizations and leaders,
can ASEAN remain relevant in the future and become stronger and
more cohesive to face its future challenges in Southeast Asia," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Enhancing Economic Competitiveness Is HK's Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Enhancing economic
competitiveness is a top priority for post-handover Hong Kong,
figures from media, commercial and political sectors said here
today on a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
The panel discussion was held on the last day of the East Asia
Economic Summit, organized by the World Economic Forum, to review
the first 100 days of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) and
look beyond them.
</P>
<P>
Three speakers were Urban Lehner, executive editor of Dow Jones
Asia, Hong Kong, C.Y. Leung, member of both the SAR Executive
Council and Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), and James Tien,
chairman of Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and also a PLC
member.
</P>
<P>
Education was universally mentioned by them as critical to
improving competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
As Lehner put it, a higher percentage of GDP should be
allocated to education, while Tien stressed that the quality of
teachers should be paid much more attention to.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong ranked the third this year for the third consecutive
year in global economic competitiveness, after the United States
and Singapore, according to an annual report compiled by a
world-renowned research institute based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the first 100 days of SAR, the three speakers agreed
that it has enjoyed an extraordinary successful start, with the
life which Hong Kong people accustomed to exactly unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On press freedom, they shared the view that there has been no
problem so far.
</P>
<P>
"Press freedom is guaranteed by the Basic Law," Leung said,
adding that as far as he knows, reporters have not been told to
write this or that story.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no instance of any pressure put on the media
for them to change," Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
Lehner also pointed out that demonstrations, which constitute
part of Hong Kong culture, continue after July 1, while no
People's Liberation Army soldiers are seen on the streets.
</P>
<P>
The editor told the discussion that the confidence level of
local community has been "very high" with their Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa enjoying popularity.
</P>
<P>
Only tourism has been frustrated after the handover, Lehner
said, attributing the depressing situation to the sharp decline in
Japan tourist arrivals since too many came to Hong Kong during a
couple of months leading to the handover. The currency devaluation
in Southeast Asia, another short-haul market of Hong Kong, as well
as the rainy weather this summer, should also be blamed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Allows Dong to Fluctuate More Around Official Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- State Bank of Vietnam has decided
to allow the country's legal tender, known as dong, to fluctuate
more around official exchange rates against foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The decision to widen the range, from previous plus or minus 5
percent to 10 percent, was made by the central bank on Monday and
carried by Vietnamese news media here today.
</P>
<P>
The measure, the bank said in a statement, was designed to give
traders an increased scope to arrive at more realistic prices to
better suit supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
It would also help curb speculation and discourage the hoarding
of foreign currencies, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank vowed to continue managing and controlling exchange
rates flexibly in accordance with supply and demand, thereby
preventing the national economy from changing greatly.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it said, the move will contribute a lot to
encouraging exports, controlling imports and increasing state
reserves of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of this new measure, official exchange
rate between U.S. dollar and dong set by the Bank for Foreign
Trade of Vietnam went up obviously.
</P>
<P>
The bank today quoted the buying price of one U.S. dollar at
11,782 dong and the selling price at 11,796 dong, against 11,703
and 11,726 unit on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Definitions of Oil Reserves Released in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A set of new definitions of
petroleum reserves has been released as a 3-year joint effort by the
World Petroleum Congress and the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
</P>
<P>
The new definitions have been designed to permit more flexibility
in the methodologies used and to provide a template for future
improvements made possible by technological advances or made
necessary by changing economic or political conditions, according
to the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress here.
</P>
<P>
The fresh move has been made carefully so that it will not
revolutionize the definitions or generate major disruption in the
way oil fields are evaluated at present, according to the congress.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new release, the two international bodies relied on
their own sets of definitions to classify petroleum reserves,
leading to confusion and misunderstanding in many cases.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two organizations said that the new definitions
will be used until future adjustments in the light of changing
technical and economic realities.

<HEADLINE> Import-Export Tax Revenue Below Targets in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's tax revenue from import
and export in the first nine months of this year reached 9,700
billion Vietnamese dong (roughly 822 million U.S. dollars) or 69.3
percent of the target set for the year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The customs sector foresaw that it will fail to meet the
government target of 17,500 billion dong (nearly 1.5 billion
dollars) in tax revenue for 1997, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
General Director of the Customs Department Phan Van Dinh
attributed the shortfall to structural adjustments of imports and
exports.
</P>
<P>
The government has imposed a tightened control over imports by
raising import taxes since early this year in a bid to protect
local producers.
</P>
<P>
Imports of fully-assembled motorbikes and under-12-seat
automobiles were stopped in mid-April, as were 12 categories of
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the import volume of consumer goods saw a
year-to-year drop of 18.9 percent in the first six months of this
year, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The restriction on steel and paper imports also deducted 89
billion dong (7.62 million dollars) and 42 billion dong (3.59
million dollars) from import tax revenue forecast in the first
half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to increase revenues, the Customs Department has
toughed its anti-smuggling and anti-tax evasion measures.
</P>
<P>
It cracked 10,900 smuggling and tax evasion cases involving
commodities worth over 400 billion dong (34 million dollars) in
the past nine months, doubling the figure of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1997, the department uncovered 4,519
cases of commercial fraud involving a total of 200 billion dong
(17 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army on Alert in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army and security
forces in the north are on alert in the wake of infiltration out
of a besiege last week by some 250 rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA), "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government detachments are deployed at all sub-counties in
Aruu and Agaga counties of Kitgum District to block the road for
the rebels to escape.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said their fellow soldiers have stepped up
patrol in the southern part of Kitgum bordering Gulu.
</P>
<P>
James Oryem Canogura, Kitgum assistant resident district
commissioner, confirmed the military reinforcement in the areas
of his district. But he did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
Another report said some LRA rebels raided a prison farm in
Ajumani in the northwest Sunday and freed some 80 prisoners. But
the report had not been confirmed by the Ugandan army.
</P>
<P>
A security source insisting on anonymity said a plane destined
for Ajumani was delayed at Entebbe International Airport
yesterday following the report on the matter. The report said the
rebels had planted mines in the airport in the town of Ajumani.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is a rebel group operating in the north and has some
450 fighters, but it had more than 2,000 soldiers in previous
years. An earlier report said Joseph Kony, leader of LRA, was
pinned down in a remote valley between northern Gulu and Kitgum
districts.

<HEADLINE> Saturn Bound, Cassini Probe Takes Off Aboard Space Rocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Cassini, the probe destined
for Saturn, took off early this morning on a seven-year journey to
explore the remote planet and its rings and moons.
</P>
<P>
As the largest, most expensive interplanetary craft ever
assembled in the United States, it took a hike into space aboard a
Titan 4-B rocket blasting off from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Delayed for weeks amid protests against a potential radioactive
catastrophe from Cassini's plutonium power source, the launch took
place at 04:43 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time, or 08:43 GMT.
</P>
<P>
But preparation for the interplanetary mission, with a record
high 32 kilograms of the extremely poisonous nuclear fuel loaded
into the craft, took 11 years and cost 3.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) said a radioactive leak is unlikely, even if
an accident happens and showers the earth with the probe's debris.
</P>
<P>
As precautions, the plutonium is in hardened ceramic pellets
encased in heat-resistant iridium and graphite to keep it from
being pulverized and dispersed into the atmosphere in an explosion.
</P>
<P>
On its billions of kilometers flight toward Saturn, Cassini is
scheduled to loop its path around the Venus, the Earth and the
Jupiter to get the gravity boost needed for closing in onto its
destination.
</P>
<P>
Ground controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California, are to monitor the probe's track throughout
the entire space odyssey.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China Scores Tremendous Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The third generation of the
collective leadership of the Chinese Communist Party made a series
of important decisions at the Party's 14th National Congress in
1992 and 15th National Congress in 1997. During the past five years,
China has scored tremendous achievements in reform and opening-up
and in economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
At its 14th National Congress, the Chinese Communist Party made
three important decisions. Namely, the Party would seize
opportunities to speed up development, the goal of China's
economic reform was to build up a socialist market economy, and
the Party would erect Deng Xiaoping Theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics as its guideline.
</P>
<P>
The Party's decisions have pushed China's economy onto a fast
development track. From 1992 to 1996, the Gross National Product
(GNP) of China grew by 12.1 percent annually, which was 4.2
percentage points more than the average annual growth rate of 7.9
percent during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period and which also
exceeded the 10.7 percent annual growth during the Sixth Five-Year
Plan period.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the past five years have the following
features:
</P>
<P>
-- While maintaining a rapid economic growth, the country
has effectively curbed inflation, avoiding the usual boom-bust cycle;
</P>
<P>
-- Agriculture has grown fast in a coordinated pace with
industrial growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Headway has been made in adjusting the industrial structure,
with infrastructure and basic industry developing rapidly. The
1992-1996 period saw the fastest growth rate in railway,
highway and port construction;
</P>
<P>
-- People's living standards has risen considerably, with the
annual per capita income increasing by 7.2 percent in cities and
5.7 percent in rural areas.

<P>
Following the Party's 14th National Congress, China has made
unprecedented strides in its reform, which is aimed at building up
a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee of the CPC
in 1993 passed a resolution on a series of issues toward building a
socialist market economy, outlining a comprehensive strategy for
China's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
An overhaul of the macro-economic management system was
unveiled in 1994. During that year, breakthroughs were made in
fiscal and tax reforms, with the establishment of a tax-sharing
fiscal system and a turnover tax system centered around a
value-added tax. The different income tax rates for Chinese-funded
enterprises were unified. Also, the State Treasury is prohibited
from borrowing from the central bank, but allowed to issue bonds
to cover fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, the power of the central bank has been
greatly enhanced, which in turn has improved and diversified
the means of financial regulation. The separation of policy-oriented
banking with a commercial system has helped the specialized banks in
their transition to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been made in the economic planning and
investment systems. A guideline-style planning system was
established to better regulate the macro-economy and to serve as a
control on investment in fixed assets.

China has made encouraging achievements in science and
technology, education, culture, public health, family planning,
sports and other fields since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Out of more than 150,000 items of scientific research,
some came up to the world advanced standards such as the development of
"Yinhe" super computers, computer-integrated manufacturing systems
(CIMS), a heavy ion accelerator, a free electron laser
(FEL), superconduction, satellite-based seed breeding and cloning
technology.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological circles have contributed more
significantly to the economic growth compared to five years ago,
through carrying out some national plans for conducting
high-technology research, turning advanced technology into
productive force and spreading the use of research results into
vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-96 period, 153,000 people received Master's
degrees and 3.456 million students graduated from
universities. Meanwhile, over four million students completed studies
at polytechnic schools.
</P>
<P>
The number of persons with a college background has increased from
19 per 10,000 people in 1992 to 25 at present.
</P>
<P>
A total of 24.41 million illiterates have learned how to read in
the past five years, lowering the country's illiteracy rate to 12
percent from 15.8 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has made big strides in improving
socialist democratic and legal systems and modernizing national defense.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1 marked the
significant success of the concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Because of thorough implementation of an independent foreign
policy of peace, China is maintaining good relations with
neighboring countries and sees remarkable improvement of its
international status along with increased influence in the
international society, which creates a favorable international
environment for China's policy of opening up and modernization.

In 1994, China unified its foreign exchange rate system and put
into practice a new system of managing hard currencies. Starting
on November 1, 1996, the Renminbi yuan became convertible under
the current account.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has improved its management on important items
of imports and exports, by allowing bidding quotas for some of
exports and greatly reducing tariffs.
</P>
<P>
In reforming the pricing system, the government lifted controls
on the prices of over 95 percent of industrial commodities and
over 90 percent of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
All these reform measures have helped establish a macro-economic
regulatory system, under which the market plays a major role in
allocating resources.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, State-run enterprises have also
been at the forefront of reform. Most large- and medium-sized
enterprises have more autonomy in daily operations and are
responsible for their own profits and losses. Quite a number of
large firms have picked themselves up from difficult situation by
merging and reorganizing assets.
</P>
<P>
The Party's 14th National Congress has boosted China's foreign
trade and cooperation. From 1992 to 1996, China's total foreign trade
volume reached 1.168 trillion U.S. dollars, representing an average
annual growth rate of 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the last five years, the country utilized foreign capital
totaling 204.3 billion U.S. dollars, of which 151.5 billion are
direct investment. The country now has more than 290,000 foreign-funded
ventures, 80 percent of which were established during this period.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the state foreign exchange reserve reached
105 billion U.S. dollars from 42.6 billion in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Trade Unions Might End Strike: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland trade unions
might call off the national strike which began earlier Monday,
South Africa's Business Day newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions' general council met
Monday night to decide whether to call off the national strike,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Swazi sources as saying there were strong
indications that the federation might call off the action in view
of growing signs that workers were ambivalent about the strike.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of the strike ending comes about despite its
continuance in forestry and the majority of sugar companies,
while workers at Swazi Rail and other transport companies joined
the strike Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, mixed reports were received as to whether
the teachers, who had embarked on a separate strike in support of
an 18 percent wage increase, would continue their strike.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Swaziland National Teachers' Association
went to ground at the outset after it became clear that they had
failed to explain honestly to their members the status of
discussions with the government.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Wants Achievements Better Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) will focus on establishing an information
mechanism to make itself better known both in the sub-region and
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The regional organization, established in 1975, has so far
achieved much but the international community and citizens of
ECOWAS countries are ignorant of these achievements, according to
Lansana Kouyate, executive secretary of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The major reason is "the information mechanism is deeply
lacking," he said, quoted by the Guardian newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate, a Guinean who replaced Edouard Benjamin as the
executive secretary at the August ECOWAS summit in Abuja, the
Nigerian capital, is in the United States for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary stressed the extent of ignorance of
the international community on ECOWAS, saying that "here in New
York, for instance, when you ask people about ECOWAS, they will
say it is a peace-keeping operation in Liberia."
</P>
<P>
Therefore he vowed to devote efforts to having a strong
information mechanism for ECOWAS both as an instrument of
education and mobilization.
</P>
<P>
Beside, poverty eradication will also be the major policy
thrust of the sub-regional economic bloc, he said, adding that
the creation of a conducive environment for economic prosperity
was fundamental to the achievement of the ideals of ECOWAS.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM to Discuss Israeli Concern Over Iran's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov is due to visit Israel at the end of October to
allay Israel's concern over Russia's support to Iran's missile
program, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is scheduled to hold talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his Israeli counterpart David Levy
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on amending the bilateral
ties that have been strained by Israeli protests against Russian
aid to Iran's missile program, which Israel regards as top threat
to its security.
</P>
<P>
In a September 27 interview with a local newspaper, Mordechai
sounded alarm about Iran's missile program, saying Tehran is
nearly completing its development of long-range missiles that will
threaten both Israeli and U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai revealed that Israel and the United States had
received intelligence that Iran has progressed faster than
previously thought in both its medium-range ballistic missile and
nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
He warned that, at the current pace of development, Tehran
would be able to produce missiles that can hit Israel, Gulf
states, Asia and parts of Europe by 1999. He believed that Iran
also wants to increase its chemical weapons and produce
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials believed that Iran has embarked on three
missile programs classified in ranges of 1,500, 3,000 and 5,500
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the U.S. have been trying to pressure Moscow to
stop its aid to Iran in developing mass destruction weapons, but
they disagreed over how to exert the pressure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government wants to concentrate on quiet diplomatic
efforts, while Israel is lobbying the U.S. Congress to cut off the
U.S. aid to Moscow, which stands at 95 million U.S. dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by U.S. refusal to cut aid to Russia, Israel had to
increase diplomatic efforts. Israeli officials have actively
lobbied their colleagues in Europe, Russia, and the U.S. to stop
the transfer of missile technology to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Israel had also tried to seal a fat deal to buy Russian
natural gas with Moscow in exchange for its halt to aiding
Iran. But the first Russian visit by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in mid-March has failed to reach an agreement
in the respect.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Russia has strongly denied that it is helping
Iran develop ballistic missiles, and insists its nuclear aid to
Iran is only limited to developing a civilian nuclear
reactor.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Large Oil Projects in Kazakhstan  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has committed to
undertaking its largest-ever overseas oil program in neighboring
Kazakhstan to meet its rising domestic demand for energy,
according to a Kazakhstan official at the 15th World Petroleum
Congress (WPC).
</P>
<P>
Paythan Sarmurzina, director of the Department of Economy and
Trade with Kazakhstan's Ministry of Economy and Trade, told Xinhua
today that the program will include construction of two
trans-national pipelines and the joint development of the Uzen
oilfield, Kazakhstan's second as well as three other oilfields.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative partners signed the agreements in Alma-Ata,
capital of Kazakhstan. Experts estimated the cost at 9.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Sarmurzina, the two pipelines are expected to pump
crude oil from the northwest parts of Kazakhstan to China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Iran.
</P>
<P>
A project official with the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) revealed that the 3,000-km, 3-billion-US dollar
pipeline project is slated to start next year. The annual
transmission capacity is designed to reach 25 million tons upon
completion in 2005, which would resolve the crude oil shortage in
western China.

Another pipeline, with a length of 800-1,000 km, will link
Kazakhstan with Iran via Turkmenistan. The project is considered
beneficial for both China and Kazakhstan to tap the gradually
opening Iranian oil market.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreements, the CNPC is also committed to
developing the Uzen oilfield, whose recoverable reserves are
estimated at 110 million tons. Oil experts said that the annual
crude output could peak at some 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, CNPC last June purchased a 60 percent stake in
Kazakhstan's Aktobemunajgaz Oil and Gas Corp. CNPC is expected to
ship the first batch of oil this month in accordance with the
production-share contract.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yan, vice-president of CNPC, in a recent interview with
Xinhua, said that China's rapid economic growth increased oil
consumption and led to a shortage. "The annual demand rises at the
pace of 5 percent while the production could only increase less
than 2 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's petroleum industry has been actively involved in
overseas exploration and development since 1992, he said..
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that China will ship back more than one million
tons of crude from overseas as the country boosted its cooperation
in the petroleum industry with other countries including
Kazakhstan," he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Radio-like Mechanism in Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The brain interprets sensory
input using a mechanism similar to that of an FM (frequency
modulation) radio, Israeli scientists reported in today's issue of
"the proceedings of the National Academy of Science".
</P>
<P>
Ehud Ahissar, of the Weizmann Institute's neurobiology
department, and his two assistants showed that the brain uses
this radio-like mechanism to "tune in" to a particular frequency,
allowing data gathered via touch to be translated into
information about external objects.
</P>
<P>
They did their study on rats, which twitch their whiskers
when looking for food. The rats' hairs oscillate at a rate
of about eight motions per second, informing the neurons in
their brain to tune in to a "transmission frequency" of
about 8 Hertz.
</P>
<P>
When the hairs touch an object, they trigger more neutral
signals that modulate the regular 8 Hertz transmission. The
timing is determined by the object's location, enabling the
brain to create an internal "image" of the object's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our study will contribute to the deciphering of
the neutral code -- the way in which information is encoded
by the sensory organs, and decoded by the brain," said
Ahissar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cracking the neural code could advance brain
research tremendously, just as the deciphering of the human
genome code has gradually revolutionized genetics and molecular
biology.
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists studying touch or the other senses
have focused on identifying the cells in the brain that
receive the signals and on assessing their intensity. But the
Weizmann scientists found that the brain actually knows what
it is being told by the senses, and that the timing of
the signals also plays a vital role in this process.
</P>
<P>
Ahissar says the brain seems to be tuned to its own
"radio stations." He shows that neural signals generated by
touch modulate the oscillation frequency of these cells. As
they are regular and persistent, these oscillations provide the
brain with a "yardstick" with which the timing of incoming
signals can be compared.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Continue Global Oil Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, 15 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia will continue its policy
of fulfiling global demand for oil under both normal and extreme
conditions, according to Ali L. Al-Naimi, its minister of
petroleum and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at today's session of the 15th World Petroleum
Congress, Al-Haimi said that Saudi Arabia has consistently adhered
to a policy of ensuring a stable world petroleum supply, and will
remain committed to providing reliable supplies for three major
consuming regions -- North America, Europe and Asia. Balancing the
supply and demand for oil is basic to our marketing strategy, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer and
exporter, has proven oil reserves of over 263 billion barrels, or
26 percent of the worldwide total. The country, which produces
eight million barrels of crude oil and 700,000 barrels of liquid
natural gas daily, recorded total 1996 oil sales of over 51
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has also expanded efforts to market oil in Asia
over recent years, with the daily export volume standing at four
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that Saudi Arabia's oil policy is based on
five building blocks -- huge oil reserves, prolific production,
reserve capacity, stable and consistent oil marketing policies and
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country has its own fleet of ocean-going
supertankers.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is developing a large oilfield in the remote
southeast to promote oil growth, with the project scheduled for
completion in mid-1998. Saudi-based Aramco has drafted a
three-year program to produce 10 million barrels of crude oil
daily.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia continues to promote cooperation between OPEC
members and other outside oil producers, according to Al-Naimi.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that his country is greatly concerned
about environmental problems. "The Kingdom and neighboring
countries are introducing steps to reduce and prevent ocean
pollution resulting from shipping activities," said Al-Naimi.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Oil to Play Greater Role in World Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Huge reserves and increased
exploration will help heavy oil play a greater role in world
energy supply in the future, a leading international expert said.
</P>
<P>
The potential in heavy oil production is of "the utmost
importance to the energy position of the world," said Richard
Meyer, a researcher with Canada's Unitar Center for Heavy Crude
and Tar Sand, at the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress.
</P>
<P>
He added that the world heavy oil resource is comprised of about
210 billion barrels of unproved reserves and 299 billion barrels of
original reserves.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative production has amounted to about 88.8 billion barrels
to date, with annual production standing at about 2.4 billion
barrels, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that a major proportion of heavy oil is
contained in 52 giant fields worldwide, and 183 of the
approximately 1700 heavy oil fields are at least partially
offshore.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the large resource base of heavy oil is
favorable to exploitation and countries with potential in this
field have stepped up development.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Jets Bomb PUK-Controlled Area in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) has confirmed that Turkish warplanes bombed its
area in northern Iraq, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments took place Monday while Turkish jets
attacked Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels in
the area, Shazad Saib, a senior official at the PUK Ankara
office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In one incident, several PUK positions were hit by the bombs
dropped by Turkish warplanes, Saib said.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by air
and artillery fire, launched a cross-border incursion in
northern Iraq in a bid to destroy newly-built PKK camps.
</P>
<P>
Turkey started to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq
early Monday, leaving some units in the area to prevent a
possible comeback of the rebels, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Saib stressed that the PUK expects Turkey to take a neutral
stance in northern Iraq, indicating that Ankara helps the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Massoud Barzani in their
fightings against the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The KDP has been fighting against both the PUK and PKK in
northern Iraq after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein lost control
of the area due to a crushing defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The PUK, which allegedly gains support from Iran and
maintains a relaxed relationship with the PKK, vows to topple
the Saddam regime through armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
However, the KDP, backed by both Baghdad and Ankara, has been
wrestling with its main rival PUK for the control of northern
Iraq and has also been fighting alongside with Turkish troops in
the area against the PKK rebels over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had repeatedly accused Tehran and Damascus of
supporting the PKK, vowing to eradicate the Kurdish separatists
with force. Ankara has frequently launched cross-border
operations aimed at wiping out the PKK militants in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saib had denied earlier that the PUK was sheltering the PKK
rebels in northern Iraq, describing as "baseless" media reports
that the PKK militants, escaping Ankara's offensive, had been
taking refuge in PUK-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The PUK, KDP and representatives from Turkey, Britain and the
United States, three sponsors for the northern Iraq issue, met
in London last week to discuss the situation in northern Iraq,
but failed to achieve any positive results.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Celebrates 10 Years in China, Makes Investment Commitment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Motorola, on the occasion of
the 10th anniversary of its entry into China, expects to invest
2.5 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, P.Y. Lai, president of the Motorola (China)
Electronics Ltd., said the company will spend at least another one
billion U.S. dollars annually on material and services from
Chinese suppliers.
</P>
<P>
A new office building, Motorola's headquarters for its China
operations, is nearing completion in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to place Motorola's headquarters in Beijing shows
our confidence in investing in China and our commitment to the
country's future," said Rick Younts, executive vice-president of
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of its Beijing representative office in
1987, Motorola has set up one exclusively-funded enterprise and
six jointly-owned ones. With a total commitment of 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars, Motorola is the single biggest U.S. investor in
China as well as the biggest foreign investor in China's
electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
"The past 10 years have seen Motorola's good cooperation with
China," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Motorola will continue participating in the development of
China's central and western region, he said. In 1995 Motorola
funneled 30 million U.S. dollars into southwest China's Sichuan
Province and founded its first joint venture there.
</P>
<P>
In response to a government call for revitalizing the
state-owned enterprises, Motorola has committed the bulk of its
annual projected investment of one billion U.S. dollars to the
purchase of state-owned enterprises.

<P>
Robert Galvin, chairman of the Motorola's executive committee,
attributed the company's achievements in China to the Chinese
government's reform policies, rapid economic progress and a good
investment climate.
</P>
<P>
"Mutual trust is Motorola's precious experience in working in
cooperation with China. The trust that China gives to Motorola has
provided it with opportunities for development, which is valuable
for both." Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, together with other U.S. companies based in China,
has launched the US-China Ties Normalization Initiative, a
non-official organization aimed at boosting bilateral commercial
and business contacts.
</P>
<P>
Lai held that problems in U.S.-Chinese relations such as the
intellectual property rights and most-favored-nation (MFN) trading
status should be dealt with through appropriate channels and in a
spirit of mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how U.S.-China relations are troubled by unfavorable
factors, a sound commercial link is indispensable for stable
growth ... and it has always been an important part of Motorola's
efforts to promote bilateral ti," Lai said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Emerges as S. Korean's Biggest Exports Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has emerged as South Korea's largest export
destination, leaving behind the United States for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said Wednesday that
South Korea shipped 14.021 billion U.S. dollars in goods, or 15.9
percent of its total exports, to the ASEAN bloc between January
and August.
</P>
<P>
The country also exported 13.926 billion dollars to the United
State, 10.344 billion dollars to the European Union and 9.899
billion dollars to Japan in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the United States was South Korea's biggest market
with exports worth 21.671 billion dollars, to be followed by ASEAN
(20.270 billion dollars), Japan (15.767 billion dollars and the EU
at 15.325 billion dollars, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Increased exports to ASEAN was attributed to the expansion of
the regional grouping which accepted Myanmar and Laos as its new
members in July and the expansion of economic cooperation between
the bloc and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, ASEAN was South Korea's fourth biggest
import market. In the first eight months of this year, South Korea
imported 8.395 billion dollars worth of goods from ASEAN
countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, trade volume between South Korea and the ASEAN
registered 22.416 billion dollars, ranking fourth among the
country's major trade partners.
</P>
<P>
"As ASEAN's goods and services trade is expected to reach 707
billion dollars in 2000 and 1,273 billion dollars in 2005, the
bloc will play an important role in the world economy. Despite its
recent currency crisis, ASEAN's trade with South Korea will
steadily increase," a ministry official said.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After four months of fighting, the battle for Brazzaville,
the capital of Congo Republic, has entered its final phase. The
southern part of the city, which was spared from fighting until
Monday, saw its population fleeing the area under heavy
bombardment and air raid by a Mig-21 combat aircraft from the camp
of former President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Congolese President
Pascal Lissouba is in Kampala seeking military aid from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite pressure from Washington, London and Ankara for an
end of fighting, two principal factions of Iraqi Kurds have been
engaged in a fratricide combat since Monday in the northern part
of Iraq along the line of demarcation between the two
factions. But different from the inter-Kurdish war in August and
September 1996 which resulted in the death of thousands, Iraqi
troops are less involved this time in the feud between the forces
of Massud Barzani and Jalal Talabani.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Radio-like Mechanism in Brain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The brain interprets sensory
input using a mechanism similar to that of an FM (frequency
modulation) radio, Israeli scientists reported in today's issue of
"the proceedings of the National Academy of Science".
</P>
<P>
Ehud Ahissar, of the Weizmann Institute's neurobiology
department, and his two assistants showed that the brain uses
this radio-like mechanism to "tune in" to a particular frequency,
allowing data gathered via touch to be translated into
information about external objects.
</P>
<P>
They did their study on rats, which twitch their whiskers
when looking for food. The rats' hairs oscillate at a rate
of about eight motions per second, informing the neurons in
their brain to tune in to a "transmission frequency" of
about 8 Hertz.
</P>
<P>
When the hairs touch an object, they trigger more neutral
signals that modulate the regular 8 Hertz transmission. The
timing is determined by the object's location, enabling the
brain to create an internal "image" of the object's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our study will contribute to the deciphering of
the neutral code -- the way in which information is encoded
by the sensory organs, and decoded by the brain," said
Ahissar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that cracking the neural code could advance brain
research tremendously, just as the deciphering of the human
genome code has gradually revolutionized genetics and molecular
biology.
</P>
<P>
Until now, scientists studying touch or the other senses
have focused on identifying the cells in the brain that
receive the signals and on assessing their intensity. But the
Weizmann scientists found that the brain actually knows what
it is being told by the senses, and that the timing of
the signals also plays a vital role in this process.
</P>
<P>
Ahissar says the brain seems to be tuned to its own
"radio stations." He shows that neural signals generated by
touch modulate the oscillation frequency of these cells. As
they are regular and persistent, these oscillations provide the
brain with a "yardstick" with which the timing of incoming
signals can be compared.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Security
authorities have vowed to take measures to curb killings and
violent activities to protect farmers.
</P>
<P>
Special police and defense force operations would be stepped
up to protect farmers, especially in the Free State, Divisional
Police Commissioner Andre Pruis said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The concrete measures include road blocks, tactical response
teams and special units to track down suspects, Pruis said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the remarks after President Nelson
Mandela announced an intelligence probe into the spate of
killings on farms.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to root it out," Mandela told reporters
after meeting a South African Agricultural Union (SAAU)
delegation in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The SAAU presented Mandela with a memorandum demanding that a
commission be appointed to investigate the possibility that the
violence was part of an orchestrated campaign to drive farmers
off their land.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, attacks on farmers have increased by
53 percent during the first three months of the year, compared to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The SAAU described as "nauseating and atrocious" statistics
that farmers were being murdered at a rate four times higher than
other South Africans.

<HEADLINE> Relocation Funds Spent on Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has spent 5.31 billion
yuan to relocate residents displaced by construction of the Three
Gorges Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The state has budgeted 8.575 billion yuan for the resettlement
of residents affected by the first stage of dam construction.
</P>
<P>
Through June this year, 6.915 billion yuan has been spent,
according to Qi Lin, head of the Bureau for Resettlement and
Development of the State Council's Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee.
</P>
<P>
The entire relocation of residents for the gigantic water
control dam is expected to cost 40 billion yuan, which will be
distributed to Hubei province and Chongqing municipality.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, financial management organizations have been
established at central and local organizations to monitor the
distribution of resettlement funds.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997, 53,000 residents and 102 factories have been
moved from the Three Gorges reservoir area. Houses with a floor
space of 1.35 million square meters have been built to provide
shelter for those displaced by construction.
</P>
<P>
Other accomplishments during construction include: 6,800
hectares of wasteland reclaimed; 2,502 water control facilities
built; 1,525 kilometers of roads constructed; 88.9 kilometers of
power transmission lines and 206 kilometers of telecommunications
lines put up; and 6.08 million square meters of land leveled in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Xingshan county of Hubei province and seven other units have
been cited by the Three Gorges Committee for its use of
resettlement funds.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Crush Garlic Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers at the
Weizmann Institute have revealed a molecular mechanism that
serves as the basis for some of the plant's therapeutic effects,
local English daily The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Professors David Mirelman and Meir
Wilchek of the Biological Chemistry Department of the institute.
</P>
<P>
They developed a unique procedure for producing large
quantities of pure allicin - garlic's main biologically active
ingredient. Produced when garlic cloves are crushed, allicin
naturally protects the plant from soil parasites and fungi and
is also responsible for its pungent odor.
</P>
<P>
In the study which appeared in the October issue of the
American Society for Microbiology's Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy, Mirelman and Wilchek explained how allicin fights
infection.
</P>
<P>
Their research supports the idea that garlic is an excellent,
albeit noisome, antimicrobial drug that can disable a large
variety of pathogens, including certain bacteria, fungi and
viruses.
</P>
<P>
The second study, soon to be published in the
Netherlands-based journal Biochimica Biophysica Acta, could help
clarify the role allicin serves in preventing heart disease and
other disorders. Both pieces of research revealed and
characterized a molecular mechanism by which allicin blocks
certain groups of enzymes.
</P>
<P>
The studies revealed that allicin kills amebas that cause
dysentery by blocking enzymes vital to their life cycle. This
discovery could lead to the use of allicin as a medication
against bacteria that have developed resistance to certain
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Since similar enzyme activity is involved in the formation of
cholesterol, the researchers think allicin may be able to
prevent its production and accumulation on the inside walls of
coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
Mirelman and Wilchek also confirmed that allicin prevents the
formation of oxygen-free radicals, which can set off the process
of tumor development.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Powerful Blast Rocks Downtown Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A powerful truck-bomb exploded
in Downtown Colombo this morning, killing at least five people and
injuring more than 100.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at 7:10 local time in a car park in the
Galadari Hotel, a seaside landmark in the business district of the
Sri Lankan capital.
</P>
<P>
The blast was so powerful that people living 10 kilometers off
the scene could hear the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police immediately sealed off the area, allowing
only military vehicles and ambulances to enter.
</P>
<P>
The security forces also engaged an unknown number of the LTTE
rebels, who were believed to have conspired the incident, soon
after they cordoned off the area. Several people were reportedly
injured during the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said in a news release at noon that the
troops "were able to kill a number of terrorists who were involved
in this explosion."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses saw at least five people were lying dead at the
scene. The National Hospital, the biggest medical facility in
Colombo, has so far admitted more than 100 injured people. Among
the injured, the hospitals said there are about 30 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Galadari Hotel, the Hilton Hotel, the Bank of Ceylon and
the twin-tower of the World Trade Center, which was declared open
by President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Sunday, were seriously
damaged. Several government buildings were also damaged.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the glass walls of the buildings have all fallen
down, making a mess in the area. About 50 vehicles were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Industrial Development Minister C.V. Gunaratne
denounced the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for its
terrorist activity in Colombo when he visited those injured in the
National Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the explosion was carried out in retaliation
of the U.S. announcement that the LTTE is a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State of the United States Madelene Albright
announced on October 8 that the LTTE, along with 29 other
organizations in the world, was on the country's terrorist
organization list and would be barred from entering and raising
funds in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake also visited the wounded
in the hospital. He said the number of casualties could have been
much higher if it were not the Full Moon holiday today, on which
people do not need to work in office.
</P>
<P>
Police have tightened up their security in the capital.
Additional road blocks were also put in place.
</P>
<P>
After the bomb went off, many people fled the scene and caused
great chaos and traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 14-year ethnic war with the
government for a separate state of their own in the north and east
of the country.
</P>
<P>
They have carried out many suicide bombing attacks in the
capital before.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, this year, a train carrying several hundred Colombo
office workers back to their home towns in the south was blasted
by two bombs at a railway station in suburban Colombo, killing
more than 90 people and injuring 400 others.
</P>
<P>
On January 31,1996, the building of the Central Bank of Sri
Lanka, which is located one block away from the Galadari Hotel,
was hit by a truck-bomb driven by LTTE suicide bombers. The
explosion killed more than 100 people and injured 1,400 others.
</P>
<P>
In October, 1995, the country's main oil storage facilities in
Colombo was destroyed by the rebels and 29 people were killed in
that accident.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Join Hands in Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China have spent
three years studying the physical feasibility of two pipelines to
transport the natural gas of Siberia to China's coastal areas, Ott
Victor Logancsvich, Russian vice-minister of fuel and energy,
said at a press conference of the 15th World Petroleum Congress
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the senior energy officials of Russia and China
will hold further negotiation on the two projects during the
conference.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the two pipelines will have a maximum
transporting capacity of five percent of Russia's gas output
annually, and will also supply the gas markets of other Far East
nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengwu, chief representative of the China National
petroleum Corporation in Moscow, said that one of the pipeline
projects will link the natural gas reserves of Russia's Irkutsk
and Rizhao of China's Shandong Province, and will reach the
Republic of Korea and Japan at its final stage.
</P>
<P>
The other pipeline, running from West Siberia to Shanghai, via
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is expected to help ease the
energy supply bottleneck in the booming southeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics here, natural gas will
experience a big-margin rise over the coming decades. In 2000 and
2020, the output of natural gas is estimated to be 26-35 billion
cubic meters and 58 to 85 billion cubic meters, respectively,
while the natural gas consumption will be 26-29 billion cubic
meters and 88-105 billion cubic meters. The gap will exist beyond
the year 2020, and thus leave a huge market potential for foreign
gas companies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Excises on Luxury &AMP; Imported Goods Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Excise duties on 21 items of
luxury and imported goods and oil in Thailand have begun to
increase starting today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the government's endeavers to meet the budget
surplus target of 1 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal
1998, as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Since early hours today, gasoline and diesel oil prices have
been among the first to rise, by one baht per liter (36.55 baht to
one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
This is the 13th oil price increase since the baht was floated
on July 2, and the Thai currency has depreciated by 41.7 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's economic revival plan, unveiled on
Tuesday by Deputy Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangkura and Finance
Minister Thanong Bidaya, tax increases were announced.
</P>
<P>
Excise duties on alcoholic liquors, including beer, increased
by between two percentage points and 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Excise duty on tobacco products rose by two percentage points,
from the old 68 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
On imported items, all are subject to a 10 percent surcharge,
except items on which customs duties are now less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, imported automobiles (completely built-up units)
will face a new customs duty rate of 80 percent, compared to 42
and 68.5 percent in the past depending on different cylinder
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Customs duties on cameras, lenses, spectacles and frames,
watches and clocks, pens and lighters will all jump by 25
percentage points, from 5 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import duty will increase by 10 percentage points (from 20
percent to 30 percent) for perfume and cosmetics, leather handbags
and belts, leather and canvas shoes, crystal and costume jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to generate 40 billion baht (1.1 billion
U.S. dollars) in additional income from these tax and duty
increases, which will remain in force until December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, the value-added tax (VAT) rate was raised from 7
percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tax increase on oil could be a double-edge sword. While it
will bring more revenue for the government and cut petroleum
import bills, it will also affect industrial and commercial
operators, who will have to pay more for their energy costs.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that so far this year an estimated 700,000
people have lost their jobs and the number could pass the one
million mark next year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has said recently that it
may take two to three years before the economy revives.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rupee Devalued by 3.53 against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) today re-adjusted the Rupee by Rs 3.53 downward against U.S.
dollar setting the spot buying and selling rate at Rs
44.0500/44.2703.
</P>
<P>
According to an official notification of SBP received here, the
revised rates at which authorized dealers will buy and sell U.S.
dollar to the public with effect from October 15, 1997 are as
follows: Buying Rs 44.0060 and selling Rs 44.3144.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth adjustment of Rupee against Dollar at official
level since last April. The value of Rupee was last re-adjusted on
June 28, this year, by 7 paisas against U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of Pak Rupee has apparently been made due to
mounting pressure by the exporters, particularly, those concerned
with European markets, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
European currencies have long been adjusted downward against
U.S. dollars and had been adversely affecting Pakistani exports,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Depend More on Mideast Oil: Research Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Asia's dependence on oil from
the Middle East is set to grow heavier over the next decade and
proper measures should be considered for the region's energy
security, Japanese research results obtained here today show.
</P>
<P>
Oil imports from the Middle East accounted for 75 percent of
Asia's total in 1995 and the figure is likely to climb up to
nearly 90 percent by 2010, Kazuya Fujime, managing director of
Japan's Institute of Energy Economics, said in a paper submitted
to the ongoing 15th World Petroleum Congress here.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, oil demand is expected to keep soaring as economic
growth maintains a fast pace, but scant increase in oil production
will leave an expanding gap in balance between demand and output,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Kazuya Fujime forecasts that East Asia's daily oil demand will
increase by 4.4 percent annually to reach 14.9 million barrels in
2010 while daily crude oil production will rise by just 0.6
percent annually to six million barrels in 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said that the present two biggest crude oil producers in
Asia, namely China and Indonesia, will both be net oil importers
in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In China, oil demand is expected to reach 6.5 million barrels a
day in 2010, while crude oil output will total just 3.9 million
barrels a day, Kazuya Fujime said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's daily oil demand will be 1.6 million barrels by
that time and its daily output then will be 1.3 million barrels,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia as a whole will have to import 21.2 million barrels of oil
a day in 2010, of which 10 percent will be covered by countries
such as Mexico, the United States, CIS and Africa, and 90 percent
will come from the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that for energy security, Asian countries have to
have enough oil stock to absorb the shocks due to short-term
supply cut of Mideast oil, diversify importing oil sources in
Pacific Rim countries, develop indigenous energy sources and save
energy.
</P>
<P>
Regional organizations like APEC will also be useful to work
out and implement proper joint action programs in the field, he
said.

<HEADLINE> About Half Million S. Africans Use Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half a million
South Africans are using the Internet and most Internet service
providers are growing their customer base by 10 percent a month,
according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
There is a minimum estimate of about 450,000 Internet users in
South Africa, the 1997 South African internet services industry
survey compiled with the cooperation of all the major South
African service providers said.
</P>
<P>
The survey divided the Internet market into three categories:
dial-up users accessing the Internet via modems, corporate users
gaining access through company networks, and academic users
gaining access at schools and tertiary educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 154,276 South Africans are using dial-up modems via
service providers. There is an estimated 200,000 corporate users
and potentially 500,000, but not less than 100,000, users in
educational sector, the survey showed.

<HEADLINE> Community Service Offers New Opportunity for Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Urban residents here can park
their bikes at outdoor sheds after work and not worry about having
them stolen because laid-off workers have been given jobs
providing security.
</P>
<P>
The bike guards are just one example of finding useful jobs for
redundant workers as an increasing number of China's surplus
laborers turn to community services for employment.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 4,000 displaced workers in Nanchang, capital of central
China's Jiangxi Province, have found new jobs in community
services since June.
 "I never thought of doing community service," said Zhao Long, a
laid-off worker who now runs a second-hand goods market.
</P>
<P>
"The market didn't cost me too much and, more importantly, my
experience as a worker is of great help in the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city has organized 748 community service units and plans to
employ 10,000 more laid-off workers this year.
</P>
<P>
Home-based jobs have become popular such as carrying coal and
gas, taking care of the elderly and child care. As a result, one
tenth of the city's laid-off workers have found employment in
community service.

<HEADLINE> Shoe Manufacturer Plans to Open 2,000 Chain Stores in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest shoemaker, the
Double Star Group, plans to open 2,000 stores in the next three
years to sell its unique brand, according to today's "Market
Daily."
</P>
<P>
Based in the coastal city of Qingdao in east China's Shandong
Province, the company grossed more than 2 billion yuan in 1996.
Two-thirds of that revenue came from the company's 600 chain
stores. The group has expanded an average 100 stores per year
since its founding in 1991.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on operating and expanding chain stores
was conducted by the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
With daily turnout registering 150,000 pairs of various kinds
of shoes, Double Star's chain-store sales have allowed it to keep
its top market share over the past five years.

YANGON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and his wife, after concluding their visit to China's Hong Kong,
arrived here today beginning a three-day state visit to Myanmar at
the invitation of Chairman of the Myanmar State Law and Order
Restoration Council Senior-General Than Shwe and his wife.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and his wife were greeted by Than Shwe and his wife as
well as other Myanmar leaders and high ranking officials at the
Yangon International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Ramos will hold talks with Than Shwe later today and the two
countries will sign some agreements including that on promotion of
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for a Philippine leader to visit Myanmar
in the past several decades and is also the first trip to the
country by a leader from an ASEAN member state after Myanmar's
joining of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is President Ramos's second leg of his five-day trip to
Hong Kong and two newest members of the ASEAN -- Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
Despite few economic links between Myanmar and the Philippines
in the past decade, senior officials of the two countries
exchanged visits in recent two years.
</P>
<P>
Adviser to the Philippine President Jose T Almonte came to
Myanmar in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister of Myanmar U Nyunt Swe in April 1996
and Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines Rodolfo
C Severino in June 1997 visited each other's country.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Opens Up Agriculture to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has opened up its agricultural sector to overseas investors in an
attempt to modernize it.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of the leading grain producers in China, has
created 12 export-oriented agricultural development zones. By end
of June this year, 690 million yuan had been invested in
development on a 212-square-kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have approved 71 overseas-funded and 254
domestic firms to operate in farm produce processing, fruit
preservation, flower cultivation, poultry and domestic animals
breeding and raising.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province has 4.7 percent of the arable land in China
but produces 8 percent of the grain and 13 percent of the
cotton, and its output of meat, vegetable oil, aquatic products and
silkworm cocoons was among the highest in the country, said Jiang
Daoyuan, deputy secretary-general of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the provincial government has established a
series of preferential policies to channel more overseas
investment into agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies are exempt from paying agricultural and
income taxes for cultivating older and hilly areas, exploring
untapped natural resources and developing high-technology products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, the province had secured
contracts worth 850 million U.S. dollars for 480 projects, Jiang
said. The export value of farm and sideline produce totalled 5.3
billion U.S. dollars in 1996, accounting for 37.7 percent of
Jiangsu's foreign trade volume, Jiang said.

experiencing rapid growth fueled by foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
A 20-hectare "field and garden" scenic spot has been opened to

<HEADLINE> Britain to Continue Land Discussions with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain will only help finance
land acquisition and resettlement in Zimbabwe if farms are
acquired from willing sellers in a transparent manner and with
full and fair compensation, a senior British diplomat has said.
</P>
<P>
David Quarrey, head of political section at the British High
Commission in Harare, told the Zimbabwe News Agency Tuesday that
his government remained prepared to continue discussions with
Zimbabwe on that basis.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to help meet the cost of land acquisition if
it was bought from willing sellers, and of land resettlement
provided it was bought in a transparent manner with full and fair
compensation," Quarrey said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came in the wake of comments by Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe who, during the start of his provincial
tours in Matableleland South Monday to assess the land
redistribution program, said Zimbabwe would continue compulsory
acquisition of land and would not compensate for the land.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's land resettlement program hit a snag in 1989 when
Britain, which solely funded the program since 1980, withdrew
assistance, saying the initial program was a failure.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean government went ahead and passed the
land acquisition act of 1992 under which the state can
compulsorily acquire land, a step heavily criticized by western
donors.
</P>
<P>
Since then negotiations to resume British funding for the
resettlement and land reform have not been fruitful as Zimbabwe
refuses to meet the given conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Monday, "we are prepared to pay for development,
not the soil. However, if Britain wanted compensation they should
have given us the money and we would pass it on to their
children."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe still needs more than two billion Zimbabwe Dollars
(160 million U.S. Dollars) to fund the acquisition of over 2,000
farms identified countrywide.
</P>
<P>
At least 62,000 people have been resettled since independence
but another 100,000 still wait for the land which the government
has been promising for the past 17 years.

disease or insect pest situation in their area or in neighboring
areas.
</P>
<P>
Farmers can also learn about plant disease control and about
how to eliminate pests. The programs are easy for farmers to
understand, and they can even provide the new information soon
after it appears.

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma Junren Appears At National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Legendary coach Ma Junren made
his apperance as expected in the Shanghai Stadium but sent a down
note about his disciples at the National Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"No miracles will be created before the 2,000 Olympic Games,"
said Ma who has been training a new "Ma's Family", including many
teenager runners, after the 1994 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who led his "Ma's Family" to dominate the women's middle
and long distance events in the track in 1993, arrived here as the
head of the Liaoning provincial athletics team instead of a coach.
</P>
<P>
He has become the centerpiece of the reporters at the National
Games, but there is no sure report about his whereabouts after the
Games opened on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Instead of staying in the star-rated hotel designated by the
Organizing Committee of the Games, he chose by himself a small and
unknown hotel in a corner of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious coach was very cautious in his talking with
coaches of other teams.
</P>
<P>
"I was not in charge of coaching the athletes," he said. "My
responsibility is to cook meals and drive cars for them. I'm a
chef and a driver here."
</P>
<P>
No body was expected to believe in his words as he was playing
possum. After coaches of other teams left, Ma came over to help
his assistant coaches in arranging training plans for his 31
disciples.
</P>
<P>
"Tell them to speed up," Ma told his assistants, shouting to
the athletes "Cheer up, cheer up!"
</P>
<P>
He signalled his athletes to relax after two-hour training.
</P>
<P>
"The rubber track here was too hard," Ma told Xinhua before he
left the stadium with his athletes at dusk.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Excises on Luxury &AMP; Imported Goods Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Excise duties on 21 items of
luxury and imported goods and oil in Thailand have begun to
increase starting today.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the government's endeavers to meet the budget
surplus target of 1 percent of gross domestic product in fiscal
1998, as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Since early hours today, gasoline and diesel oil prices have
been among the first to rise, by one baht per liter (36.55 baht to
one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
This is the 13th oil price increase since the baht was floated
on July 2, and the Thai currency has depreciated by 41.7 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Under the government's economic revival plan, unveiled on
Tuesday by Deputy Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangkura and Finance
Minister Thanong Bidaya, tax increases were announced.
</P>
<P>
Excise duties on alcoholic liquors, including beer, increased
by between two percentage points and 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Excise duty on tobacco products rose by two percentage points,
from the old 68 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
On imported items, all are subject to a 10 percent surcharge,
except items on which customs duties are now less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, imported automobiles (completely built-up units)
will face a new customs duty rate of 80 percent, compared to 42
and 68.5 percent in the past depending on different cylinder
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Customs duties on cameras, lenses, spectacles and frames,
watches and clocks, pens and lighters will all jump by 25
percentage points, from 5 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import duty will increase by 10 percentage points (from 20
percent to 30 percent) for perfume and cosmetics, leather handbags
and belts, leather and canvas shoes, crystal and costume jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to generate 40 billion baht (1.1 billion
U.S. dollars) in additional income from these tax and duty
increases, which will remain in force until December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, the value-added tax (VAT) rate was raised from 7
percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tax increase on oil could be a double-edge sword. While it
will bring more revenue for the government and cut petroleum
import bills, it will also affect industrial and commercial
operators, who will have to pay more for their energy costs.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that so far this year an estimated 700,000
people have lost their jobs and the number could pass the one
million mark next year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has said recently that it
may take two to three years before the economy revives.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Targets Funds to Upgrade Port Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province is seeking to
raise 20 billion yuan from foreign and domestic sources for a
large-scale port upgrading project.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the departments in charge of the
project, the upcoming construction will be divided into two
phases.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase to 2000, the province will need 8 billion
yuan to construct 59 ports, including 21 deep-water berths which
would add 38 million tons to the province's port handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase through 2010, another 11.6 billion yuan
will be needed to develop 62 berths, including 41 deep-water
berths.
</P>
<P>
The province will have a combined port handling capacity of
181.7 million tons and 111 deep-water berths when the project is
completed. Major ports will be able to accommodate ships ranging
from 20,000 to 100,000 tons each.
</P>
<P>
With more than 3,300 kilometers of coastline and many natural
bays, Fujian Province has the advantage of developing port
transportation. The province has six natural ports which could
handle 50,000 tons each.
</P>
<P>
Six large ports in the province -- Xiamen, Sandu'ao, Luoyuan,
Meizhouwan, Dongshan and Shacheng -- each has a handling capacity
of 100,000 to 500,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Woos International Loans for Road Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia is wooing international
loans to overhaul its outdated highways, which have become a
"bottleneck" in the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Expressways now only account for one percent of Slovakia's
highway systems, 60 percent of which are third-class roads that
are in poor conditions, the Czech media said.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia recently decided to invest 140 billion crowns (4.4
billion U.S. dollars) in the next eight years to build new
highways and update the existing roads.
</P>
<P>
Because it is short of funds, the Slovak government has turned
to international banks for help.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the European Investment Bank
(EIB) provided Slovakia with a loan worth one billion crowns (30
million U.S. dollars) for constructing the expressway linking
Bratislava, the Slovak capital, to the area bordering Hungary and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
In August, the government signed another agreement with the
Industrial Bank of Japan for a loan worth four billion crown (120
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that loan protocols with other international
banks are also under negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Quadrangle Plan Needs Boost: Thai Deputy Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Finance Minister
Thawatwong na Chiangmai has stressed that the economic quadrangle
plan needs to be pursued with greater vigor, the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been experiencing a slowdown with the number of
investment projects falling.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need for improved transportation and
communications systems to enable better coordination for the plan,
Thawatwong told a seminar in Chiang Mai at the weekend on Chiang
Mai's role in the economic quadrangle plan, which is involved with
Northern Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the plan, initiated in 1992 to encourage trade
and tourism among the four countries, would bring great benefits
to the estimated 200 million people living in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said the Thai Cabinet has already given Chiang Mai,
Thailand's second largest city 700 kilometers north of Bangkok,
the right to coordinate the work of the economic quadrangle plan.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai can take a leading role to help press the plan
forward so that it can emerge as a center of economic cooperation
in the sub-regional quadrangle, he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the Thai Finance Ministry has recently given soft
loans to Myanmar to continue construction and expansion of the
167-km road linking Tachilek, a Thai border town, with Keng Tung,
Eastern Myanmar. The project is expected to complete by the end of
next year.

Thailand next year and even the 2000 Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Heng, head coach of the Chinese national shooting team,
said he hopes the four-time Olympian can stay in the team and
continue to win honor for the country.
</P>

"But it's more important for him to keep fit," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Wang collapsed after his last shot in the Atlanta Games which
squandered his 3.8-point lead. He blamed his disastrous last shot
to blackout caused by the injury.

returning from Atlanta. He was recovering but could not be healed
of the injury, doctors said.

<HEADLINE> Two Confirmed Dead in Colombo Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Two people have been confirmed
killed in a bombing which ripped the business district in Downtown
Colombo early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake told Xinhua that so far
there have been two deaths as a result of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties could be much higher if it were not
the Full Moon holiday today, on which people do not need to work
in office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the National Hospital in the Sri Lankan capital said 30
to 40 people were killed in the incident. The hospital, the
biggest medical facility in Colombo, has so far admitted more than
100 injured people, including two Americans. Ambulances are still
moving in more wounded.
</P>
<P>
Senanayake said the fresh bombing was carried out in the same
way as the bombing of the Central Bank building on January 31,
1996.
</P>
<P>
In that incident, several LTTE rebels driving a truck, which
was loaded with explosives, slammed into the bank building and set
off a major explosion, killing more than 100 people and injuring
1,400 others.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been fighting a
14-year ethnic war with the government for a separate state of
their own in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports saying that the bomb was planted in a
car parked near the Galadari Hotel in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Industrial Development Minister C. V. Gunaratne said
the explosion was carried out by the LTTE, which was recently
declared a terrorist organization by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was in retaliation for the announcement, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on October 8
announced that the LTTE, along with 29 other organizations in the
world, was on the country's terrorist organization list and would
be barred from entering and raising funds in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Ceylon and the twin towers of the World Trade
Center, which was declared open by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
three days ago on Sunday, were seriously damaged in the explosion.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, Iraq to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Iraq have decided to
enhance their cooperation in rice farming and oil production in
anticipation of what is called Iraq's post-embargo period,
following talks between officials from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to reports released here today, Iraq will reserve
10,000 ha of arable land for an Iraqi-Vietnamese joint-venture in
rice-growing while reserving an oil field with an estimated
deposit of two billion barrels of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The venture is a result of talks between the Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Mohammed H. Al-Zubaidi, who arrived here monday for a
six-day official visit to Vietnam, and Vietnamese Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai and his Vietnamese counterpart Deputy PM Nguyen Cong
Tan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraq will invest in growing tea and take part in
building an oil refinery in Vietnam. All tea products made by an
Iraqi-Vietnamese joint-venture will be sold in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese also asked Iraq to consider the possibilities of
Vietnamese labourers traveling to Iraq to work, and establishing
another joint venture in growing cotton in Iraq after the current
embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese people and government were very sympathetic with
the Iraqi people for the current difficulties caused by a
prolonged economic embargo, Deputy Prime Minister Tan told his
guests.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that "Vietnam fully supports the genuine
aspiration of the Iraqi people, calling for an end to the current
embargo against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Iraq appreciated Vietnam for its support to Iraq, particularly
through the United Nations program of exchanging Iraqi oil for
food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Over the first nine months of this year, Vietnam sold food and
other commodities to Iraq worth more than 58 million
U.S. dollars. Subsequent sales contracts already signed amounted
to another 70 million dollars, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq would continue buying Vietnam's products through
the U.N.-sponsored program.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Seeking Viable Environment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here today that his country is willing to change its
environmental preservation policy.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Brasilian counterpart Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, Clinton expressed his willingness during a press
conference to create a viable plan to seek solutions to
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President defended a wide international accord on
preserving the environment by reducing gases that contribute to
the greenhouse effect.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the establishment of a Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA), Clinton said the economic bloc is important
because it would help usher small Latin American countries toward
democracy, which is a basic requirement to entering the bloc.
</P>
<P>
On trade between the United States and Brazil, Clinton said the
tax barriers the United States imposed on Brazilian imports were
small hurdles that can be solved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Brazil could export more goods to the United
States or to the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Clinton apologized to Brazil for a
document released by the U.S. embassy before his South American
tour. The document said corruption in Brazil is an endemic part
of its culture. Clinton said this criticism is wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A giant explosion shook
Downtown Colombo early this morning and government troops who
rushed to the explosion scene are reportedly fighting with LTTE
rebels who are said to have carried out the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still going on between the government troops and
the rebels near a downtown hotel in the Sri Lankan capital, where
a strong car-bomb ripped the business compound at around 7:10 a.m.
local time, sources quoted the military and police as saying.
</P>
<P>
The National Hospital in Colombo said 30 to 40 people were
killed in the incident. The hospital, the biggest medical facility
in the capital, has also admitted 88 injured people, including two
Americans. Ambulances are still moving in more wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Ceylon and the twin towers of the World Trade
Center, which was declared open by President Chandrika Kumaratunga
three days ago on Sunday, were seriously damaged by the car-bomb
which had been planted in a car park in the Galadari Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the glass walls of the buildings have all fallen
down, making a mess in the area.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake was in the hospital
visiting the injured on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
Police have tightened up security in the Sri Lankan capital and
additional road blocks have also been put in place.
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosion took place near the Galadari Hotel, a
five-star landmark by the seaside.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police have sealed off the area, allowing only
military vehicles and ambulances to enter, and military
helicopters were hovering over the scene.
</P>
<P>
Local sources close to the military said the explosion was
carried out by the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), which has been fighting a 14-year ethnic war with the
government for a separate state of their own in the north and east
of the country.
</P>
<P>
LTTE has carried out many suicide bombing attacks in the
capital before.
</P>
<P>
A train carrying several hundred Colombo office workers back to
their home towns in the south was blasted by two bombs at a
railway station in suburban Colombo on July 24, killing more than
90 people and injuring 400 others.
</P>
<P>
On January 31,1996, the building of the Central Bank of Sri
Lanka, which is located one block away from the Galadari Hotel,
was hit by a truck-bomb driven by LTTE suicide bombers. The
explosion killed more than 100 people and injured 1,400 others.

<HEADLINE> Two Kinds of Hanta Virus Found in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two different species of
rodents to transmit the Hanta virus were found by two U.S. experts
at the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the American experts have investigated
the virus for two weeks during an outbreak in Chile and they made
their research in the southern provinces of Chile to gather
information on the incidence of Hanta virus over the population.
</P>
<P>
In a final report, the researchers said they found the possible
existence of two kinds of Hanta virus in two different rodent
species trapped in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The investigation said about 13-15 percent of the rodents in
the south of Chile is infected by the virus.
</P>
<P>
CDC experts are yet to determine if the virus found in the
second species corresponds to the kind "Hanta Andes", which
exists in Chile and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Chilean health sources reported 20 cases of Hanta virus have
been detected in Chile, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
The national laboratory on Hanta virus detection and study will
be working in late November to speed up the adoption of suitable
measures to prevent the virus from continuing spreading.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Women Want More Information Before Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- American women who didn't
vote in 1992 or 1994 cited learning about issues and candidates,
lacking the time to go to the polls and not knowing how to use a
voting machine as the biggest inconveniences of voting.
</P>
<P>
The Women's Vote Project, a coalition of 110 national women's
groups in the United States, sponsored the survey of 620 women
from five states -- Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri and
North Carolina -- to find out what motivates and discourages women
from voting.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed women did not participate in the 1992 or 1994
elections, but did register for the 1996 elections. Eighty-seven
percent of them said they actually voted.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 33 percent of the women found getting
information about candidates was a problem; 90 percent said they
would like nonpartisan voting guides mailed to them before
election day.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that white women were more likely than black
or Hispanic women to receive information by mail or phone about
election issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition, getting to the polls was a dilemma for many women.
Listed as problems were finding the time to vote, 22 percent;
knowing where and when to vote, 15 percent; getting time off work,
14 percent; long lines at polls, 15 percent, and finding a
babysitter, 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The women overwhelmingly were interested in issues about
children, families, education and equal pay.
</P>
<P>
The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary of State to Visit Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will go to Haiti on Friday to seek an end to
the political crisis in the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit by a U.S. secretary of state to
Haiti since June 1995 when Albright's predecessor Warren
Christopher visited the nation.
</P>
<P>
Albright will stop off in Haiti on her way back from a trip to
South America with President Bill Clinton, State Department
spokesman James Rubin announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary's visit is intended to demonstrate our
continuing interest in Haiti and our support for Haiti's efforts
to develop a democratic society and to reconstruct its economy,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Haiti has made considerable progress since a U.S.-led
military force reinstated the elected government in 1994. He
acknowledged, however, that much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
Since Haitian Ex-Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned in June,
there has been no agreement on a replacement.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Zambia's Road Sector Investment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a credit of 70 million U.S. dollars to support Zambia's
road sector investment program.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to reform the road sector policy and
institutional framework to enhance capacity, increase the
efficiency of the use of resources and improve planning and
implementation performance.
</P>
<P>
It is also designed to reduce the strain on limited government
revenue as well as create greater opportunities for the private
sector to participate in the design, construction and maintenance
of roads and create 14,000 new jobs by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The project will also establish a pilot program for community
road management in at least three districts to test approaches for
sustainable improvements in maintenance of undesignated roads and
to promote increased usage of non-motorized transport means.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
wing for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Sets Sights upon 2,000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Wang Junxia, Olympic champion
in the women's 5,000 meters in Atlanta, said here on Tuesday that
she will take part in the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wang, the most glittering star from the Ma's Family of the
legendary coach Ma Junren, was showing up at the courtside of the
track and field competition of the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
On her prospect for the next Olympic Games, the star runner
dubbed as "the Mysterious Oriental Deer" nodded her head in
confirmation. "Sure, the 2000 Sydney Games," the local Xinmin
Evening News quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old runner, also silver medalists in the 10,000m in
Atlanta, was hindered in her training after her Olympic glory,
complaining of a nagging headache.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I have a full recovery from the illness," she said. "I
feel very good in training."
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Deer who broke the 10,000 meters world record four
years ago in Beijing, backed to the track in August after the
Chinese athletes failed to bring home a single medal for the first
time from the World Athletics Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Wang disclosed that she is pondering upon the idea to establish
an athletics school to provide a training base for the young
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm now too busy and I hope to focus my attention
on it after the National Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who still holds the 10,000m world record, was expected to
compete in the National Games to repeat the glory as she did four
years ago in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But she refrained herself from competing in the Games at the
moment, saying she was not ready for such a big Games as she was
still regaining her top form.
</P>
<P>
In the last edition, Wang emerged as the top long-distance
runner in the world by beating the 3,000m world record twice in 24
hours and setting a new world mark in the 10,000m event.

LIMA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Embassy in Peru,
which was occupied by a group of rebels for 126 days during the
hostage crisis, began to be torn down today.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen armed men of the Revolutionary Movement Tupac Amaru
broke into the embassy on December 17, 1996 and held hostage the

and releasing 71 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government decided to tear down the building but
there has not been a decision yet on the future of the place,

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Parties Prepare For Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 14 (Xinhua) -- With a new parliamentary election
law finally in place, political parties in Ukraine will need to
run national campaigns and also seek campaign funding.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian candidates for the parliament -- the Supreme Soviet
-- used to campaign strictly as individuals. The new elections law
approved on September 24 this year reserves half the 450 seats in
the next legislation for candidates elected from party
lists. Ukraine's political parties for the first time have to
worry about a war chest, advertising budget and fundraising.
</P>
<P>
Experience offers few clues on what to expect in the coming
parliamentary elections due in March 1998, said Sergy Odarych,
president of the Ukrainian Perspective Foundation. In the 1994
parliamentary elections, some winning candidates spent up to four
million U.S. dollars and others as little as 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first experience of party elections, which
makes it really difficult to talk about cost," Odarych said.
</P>
<P>
The parties themselves say they have not come up with campaign
budgets yet, and some parties are not going to have an election
budget at all.
</P>
<P>
Georty Ponomarenko, deputy chief of the Communist Party
campaign staff, said he is under no illusion about rich
supporters. "We will rely on party membership dues," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the party treasury currently contains merely
10,000 hryvnas (about 5,400 U.S. dollars) and no one knows how
many donations will come in. It is unrealistic to talk about a
full-fledged campaign budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists, the second largest faction in the present
parliament behind the Communists, also claim empty coffers. Party
spokesman Viktor Yakovlev acknowledged: "Our members pay us one
percent of their income, but considering that pensions and wages
have not been paid for a long time, we do not get very much."
</P>
<P>
Roman Zwarycz, head of the Rukh National Democratic party's
electoral campaign, said his party is well prepared for the
pending elections. "We started collecting money from sponsors who
are interested in forces supporting businesses in Ukraine," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Rukh also collects money from ordinary citizens throughout
the country. "Regional headquarters are providing for campaigns in
their regions," Zwaryca added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Rukh plans to communicate its campaign programs to
the public through both print and broadcast advertising. An
initial series of Rukh advertisements have already hit the
country's television screen, and further commercials with
conservative social messages are planned.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists will seek publicity in a different way.
</P>
<P>
"Our party is unable to pay for TV advertising and we cannot
buy full page ads in the newspapers," said Yakovle. "Nevertheless,
our party is well-known in Ukraine and people will vote for it."
</P>
<P>
He said his candidates will go to people's homes to talk to
them so that every candidate will really have to earn his
mandate." This type of work with people proved to be very
successful in the 1994 elections, especially in villages," said
Yakovlev.

PRAGUE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland, the first three countries invited to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), are aiming to further
strengthen their cooperation in a wide range.
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Havel and Goncz Arpad, presidents of the Czech Republic

ZHENGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Voltan Solymar, a Canadian
hydraulic engineer, has been awarded a "friendship prize" for his
superb work at the Xiaolangdi dam project.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Since coming to Xiaolangdi in 1995, Solymar's proposals have
proved helpful and he has shared his experience with his Chinese
colleagues and younger technicians without any reservation. One of
Solymar's proposals saved two million U.S. dollars in production
costs.
</P>
<P>
To date, approximately 700 overseas experts and engineers from
50 countries have worked on the Xiaolangdi water control project,
the largest of its kind on the Yellow River. The dam is expected

BUDAPEST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungary and Israel signed a
free trade agreement here today in a bid to promote economic
development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, signed by Hungarian Minister of Industry,
Commerce and Tourism Fazakas Szabolcs and visiting Israeli
Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky, the two countries
will gradually lift trade tariffs reciprocally by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
After the treaty takes effect on January 1, 1998, 97 percent of
the products exported from Hungary to Israel will be granted the
status of duty-free. Also Hungary will open more duty-free trading
areas to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Israel have seen an increase in bilateral trade
since the two established diplomatic ties in 1989.
</P>
<P>
And Hungary is a major foreign investment recipient from Israel

<HEADLINE> Correspondence Classes Popular with Farmers in Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A song popular among farmers
in east China's Zhejiang province begins:
</P>
<P>
"No school buildings, no enclosures,
</P>
<P>
The earth serving as classrooms,
</P>
<P>
Crops and poultry as experimental tools,
</P>
<P>
Teachers, students scattered all over the country."
</P>
<P>
These lyrics are part of the school anthem of the China
Farmers' Correspondence Technology University, launched by the
China Association for Science and Technology in 1985. The school
offers courses to farmers in plantation, breeding, processing and
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The university has trained thousands upon thousands of farmers
since its founding and has become a major channel for farmers to
learn new agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 majors are offered, and farmers can take year-long
courses by paying only 35 yuan. Annual enrollment has grown from
hundreds to the present 40,000, said Wang Yangjie, an official of
Zhejiang's Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition to correspondence courses, governments also invite
experts to visit fields or cottages for face-to-face lectures. As
a result, about 80 percent of the learners pass written exams or
field tests, and 40,000 have been promoted to farmer technicians.
</P>
<P>
The province has had 270,000 farmers trained by the university,
and set up 88 correspondence branches, as well as guidance centers
in more than 900 townships.
</P>
<P>
"Without the university, I would have been still in poverty,"
said farmer Huang Defa in Tangkun village of Linhai city. Three
years ago, he grew citrus on one-third hectare and earned 4,000
yuan, which was not enough to pay his debts.
</P>
<P>
But, last year, he made nearly 100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars)
off the same land. Now his story of getting better off, along with
100 others, has been written in a book to encourage other
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Oil Expert Calls for Technological Advancement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Technological advancement will
be the key for the world petroleum industry in dealing with major
challenges in the 21st century, a leading international expert
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Under the growing pressure of competition between energy
players, we will need more technological advances and
breakthroughs," said Philippe Jaffre, chairman and chief executive
officer of the French oil giant Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a plenary address to the ongoing 15th
World Petroleum Congress (WPS) this morning.
</P>
<P>
Application of new technologies will be used not just to reduce
costs but also to discover and produce new diversified reserves,
Jaffre noted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that although discovery rates have been greatly
improved, companies are still wasting two-thirds of their
exploration budgets in drilling dry holes, Jaffre said this means
that the oil industry still have a large potential for improvement.
</P>
<P>
"We need technology to help us in the field of geology,
geochemistry, seafloor mapping, geophysics, and also for better and
faster seismic interpretation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will encourage new enhanced recovery studies, in particular
on old production sites," he said, adding that the industry will
benefit from multilateral drilling techniques, 4-dimension seismic
field monitoring and improved ways for chemical injection.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in technology will also be needed to reach new areas
such as the Arctic zone or additional reserves such as
non-conventional crudes from sands and bituminous shales, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jaffre also underlined the industry's need to strive for
improvements in pipeline networks, in liquefaction processes and
on-site conversion from gas to liquid fuels, especially high quality
middle distillates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he held that technological improvement in itself is
not enough for the industry. "Major management responsibilities will
be needed to withstand major changes and pressures," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls on Greece, Turkey to reinstate Overflight Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Tuesday urged Greece and Turkey to resume their ban on military
fights over Cyprus as tension rose between the two
Mediterranean neighbors over the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all sides appreciate the benefits of reinstituting a
complete, open-ended moratorium on overflights of Cyprus by
Greek and Turkish military aircraft at the earliest possible
time," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Greek Cypriot forces have been recently holding
naval exercises, and Turkish and Turkish Cypriot forces also
plan to stage the similar naval exercises soon.
</P>
<P>
Rubin called the two exercises "unfortunate" as they
complicated an overflight ban.
</P>
<P>
"There is a spate of exercises going on, and that is
unfortunate in light of the desire for an overflight ban ... We
think fewer military activities are better than more military
activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, according to Rubin, would not take sides
but said Washington had backed separate announcements on May 9
by both Greece and Turkey that they would stop military
overflights of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyrus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish Cypriot north since Turkish troops entered the
northern third of the island in 1974.

Meanwhile, Boris Nemtsov, First Deputy Prime Minister, pointed
out the possibility of a cabinet crisis incurred by the vote. This
would harm the country's economy severely, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's 1993 constitution, a no-confidence motion can be
passed if it has the support of a majority of the total number of
deputies in the Duma. Thus the votes of at least 226 of the 450
deputies are required. Nikolai Ryzhkov, First Deputy Speaker of
Duma, said today they had already acquired the 226 votes needed.
</P>
<P>
If the motion is passed, Yeltsin has the choice of dismissing
the government or simply rejecting the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
If the Duma expresses no confidence in the government a second
time within three months, the president must then either dismiss
the government or dissolve the Duma and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma will start the debate on the motion on Wednesday
at noon GMT.

<HEADLINE> Massachusetts Public Colleges Urged to Ban Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- After two students died from
overdrunk, Massachusetts' Board of Higher Education today
unanimously voted to urge all 29 state colleges and universities
to ban most alcohol use on campus.
</P>
<P>
The ban would prohibit alcohol on campuses or in dormitories
where any of the residents are under 21. Violators would be
subject to dismissal.
</P>
<P>
But licensed establishments such as on-campus pubs and limited
events at which everyone was 21 or older would be allowed to serve
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
The ban was an enforcement in the crackdown on alcohol abuse
that followed the deaths of two students from the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Scott Krueger, an 18-year-old freshman at MIT died last month
of alcohol poisoning after attending a fraternity party. Adam G.
Prentice, a 21-year-old junior at Umass-Amherst, died earlier this
month after falling through the roof of a greenhouse while drunk.
</P>
<P>
Some board members acknowledged that, even though the legal
drinking age is 21, illegal drinking and alcohol abuse are
widespread among undergraduates.

BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The presidential election of
the Republic of Srpska will be held on December 7 according to
schedule, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Srpska member of the Presidency of the
Republic of Bosnia, said that it would be impossible to hold the
parliamentary elections unless the president is elected in the
Srpska Republic, Yugoslav Press reports said.

Srpska Plavssich and himself.
</P>

The three held a meeting in Belgrade on Monday, Krajisnik said,
and all details of the agreement were re-confirmed, except that
the parliamentary election was postponed from 15 to 23 November to
make sure that the observers from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe can be in the republic again to ensure
that the election is held "in a democratic way".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Uses Line-Item Power to Veto Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144
million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed 13 relatively obscure research and spending
programs, almost all the military spending increases approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The new vetoes came weeks after he vetoed 287 million dollars
from a separate 9.2 billion dollars military construction bill.
</P>
<P>
The cuts included 39 million dollars that would have kept the
remaining three SR-71 Blackbird spy planes flying. Pentagon said
that the SR-71 was no longer needed because of the capabilities of
spy satellites, improved U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned
robot planes.
</P>
<P>
Other cuts included 30 million dollars that would have financed
research on tracking and intercepting asteroids before they
collide with earth, 3 million dollars for microsurgery research
and 3 million dollars for an underwater noisemaking device.
</P>
<P>
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as
being affected compared to two Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers added 750 projects to the defense appropriations bill
that were not in Clinton's original defense spending plan. All but
13 of those survived the line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as
being affected compared to two Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers now threatened to consider repealing the
line-item veto law, passed only last year as a budget-balancing
measure.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Poland reaped 100,000 tons more
grain this year, up 0.4 percent over last year, despite adverse
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Central Bureau for Statistics reported today that
the grain output this year totalled 25 million tons. Potato output
dropped by 22.5 percent to 21.1 million tons, compared with that
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The output of beet amounted to 15.2 million tons, with a 14.6
percent drop from the previous year. Fruit output was down 3
percent to 2.2 million tons and vegetables totalled 5.1 million
tons, about the same level of last year.
</P>
<P>
Poland has witnessed abnormal weather this year with a severely
cold and snowless winter and a late spring. Frequent heavy rains
in the summer gravely flooded 500,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The slight rise in grain output has resulted from the increase
of about 200,000 hectares of seeded land. The grain quality,
however, is inferior to that last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The British Athletics Federation
was plunged into a trouble because of bankrupt and unlikely to
survive when the national governing body announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The British Athletic Federation (BAF) said it had been forced
to call in interim managers to determine its future administration
because it had debts of 530,000 pounds (858,000 U.S. dollars) with
running costs of over 100,000 pounds a month.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has been caused by reduced income from sponsorship
and television while the BAF had been troubled by large legal
costs as against doping bans.
</P>
<P>
The BAF's Birmingham headquarters could be sold to meet the
deficit while the jobs of its 36 members, including national
coaches and development officers are also under threat.
</P>
<P>
However, British teams will be able to compete at competitions
such as next year's European Championships in Budapest supported
by other financial sources.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Debts Increase This year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The total debts incurred by the
Philippine national government in the first eight months of this
year reached 1.203 trillion pesos (about 35.3 billion U.S.
dollars), slightly higher than the 1.155 trillion pesos for the
whole 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine Central Bank report, which was
published here today, domestic debts accounted for the bulk of the
total borrowing at 727 billion pesos while foreign debts were
placed at 15.73 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as the foreign debts were incurred at an
exchange rate of 30.165 pesos to the dollar, the depreciation of
the peso, now around 34 pesos against the dollar, would cost the
government much more for the repayment.
</P>
<P>
It said the foreign debts were incurred from the issuance of
bonds which were floated in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The rise in government obligations is due to the effect of the
currency turmoil which prevailed during the period under review,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current fiscal program, the government is allowed to
earmark only 73.9 billion pesos of the total budget for debt
service.

<HEADLINE> IDB to Support Central America Countries' Entrace to NAFTA </HEADLINE>

<P>
SAN JOSE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
Inter-American Development Bank Enrique Iglesias said the
bank will support the attempt of Central American
countries to be admitted in the North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
Iglesias was quoted today by Costa Rica`s daily "La Nacion"
as saying he was optimistic about the possibility that the U.S.
Congress grant President Bill Clinton the fast track authorization
to negotiate the setting up of the Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Iglesias, who is currently under medical treatment in a Sao Paulo
hospital in Brazil due to a renal problem, met last week with
journalists from Central America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The head of the IDB asserted that the entrance of Central America
to NAFTA must be a previous step to the setting up of FTAA,
expected by 2005. NAFTA was enacted since 1994 in United States,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Central America must step on its own integration and insist,
as it did last May during U.S. president visit to San Jose,
on its entrance to the North American bloc, he added.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA was proposed by Clinton to Presidents and heads of
states of 34 hemispheric countries in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Men Show More Responsibility in Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Family planning, which used to
be thought of as a woman's affair in China, has more men getting
involved, according to experts at an international conference on
population in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two million Chinese men got vasectomies in 1995, or half
the world's total for that year, according to the China State
Family Planning Commission (SFPC).
</P>
<P>
"Although the country's rate of vasectomies is about 10
percent, because the population is so large, China is still in the
lead in the world in using this male sterilization method," said
Professor Liu Yunrong of the SFPC's Science and Technology
Institute.
</P>
<P>
UN statistics show that the world's average prevalence rate of
vasectomies is five percent. The prevalence rate is an index of
popularity of a particular contraception method.
</P>
<P>
The number of condom users in China has been increasing year by
year, and was eight million in 1995 for couples of reproductive
age. China produces one billion condoms annually.
</P>
<P>
The use of this convenient and safe contraception tool should
be increased, experts say.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese couples are asking for information on
childbearing, fertility regulation, and reproductive health, and
are making decisions together, experts say, adding that many
would-be fathers are playing an important role in helping women
through the period of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, when China began encouraging couples to have only
one child, the government has said that men and women should both
be responsible for family planning. The Constitution says that
husbands and wives should participate in family planning.
</P>
<P>
Demographers say that the active participation of men will
ultimately benefit women and children, and will help to protect
women's rights, and will help avoid risks and health problems
caused by induced abortions.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that Chinese males will choose condoms more
frequently, especially in coastal and border areas, while the
vasectomy rate will remain stable for quite a long time.

President Scalfaro rejected Prodi's resignation, tendered
Thursday after the Communist Refoundation refused to support the
1998 budget draft, and told him to go before Parliament "as soon
as possible".
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he did not know if there will be a formal confidence
vote to officially register the return of his majority.
</P>
<P>
Prodi resigned before a formal vote could be called showing the
government had lost its majority, therefore, a confidence vote may
be replaced by a less-divisive motion backing Italy's effort to
join the single currency, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
The speakers of the Lower House and Senate would have to decide
"the procedures to follow," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi met with Senate Speaker Nicola Mancino and Lower House
Speaker Luciano Violante separately this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro sent the government back to Parliament after Prodi and
Bertinotti, in a meeting today at Palazzo Chigi, finalized an
agreement on the 1998 budget draft that restored the government's
majority.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget aims to cut pension and welfare spending to
help Italy maintain the financial discipline required to join the
single European currency to be launched on January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payments Yields Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) position yielded a surplus of 3.164 billion U.S.
dollars in the first semester of the year.
</P>
<P>
The BOP surplus was registered with the narrowing of the
country's current account deficit, local newspaper Manila Bulletin
today quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Current account deficit for the first six months of the year
shrunk by 22 percent to 2.1 billion dollars from 2.7 billion
dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement, similarly, caused the current account deficit
as a percentage of gross national product to drop to 4.5 percent
from 6.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This means that the country's export performance is slowly
inching up although not enough to outpace the demand for imported
products, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
He said the improvement in the current account position was
driven by a 6.2-percent increase in the net earnings from trade in
services.
</P>
<P>
A smaller merchandise trade deficit, too, contributed to the
current account improvement.
</P>
<P>
Singson also said the current account deficit could have
narrowed further if there had not been the negative effects of a
weak currency, which was the overall sentiment in the region.

<HEADLINE> Stockton to Be Sidelined For the Start of NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Utah Jazz's star guard John
Stockton, who had knee surgery on Monday night, will be bystander
for the first six to eight weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old guard, known for assists and steals, had
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee to remove loose
cartilage. The team's orthopedic surgeon Lyle Mason said the
injury did not heal easily.
</P>
<P>
Stockton has only missed four games during his entire NBA
career. He has played in all 127 playoff games in Jazz history and
led the team to the NBA finals for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Stockton is the third big-name player who will miss the start
of the season with a major injury. Miami's Alonzo Mourning with
knee surgery will be out eight to 12 weeks and Chicago's Scottie
Pippen with foot surgery will be out two to three months.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Strengthening of International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- With the conclusion and
implementation of a number of international arms control and
disarmament legal instruments, it was obviously highly necessary
to strengthen the international non-proliferation efforts, Sha
Zukang, Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the First Committee of the 52nd session of the
General Assembly, Ambassador Sha Zukang said the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the conclusion of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the completion of the negotiations
on the Additional Protocol to Safeguards Agreements, the entry
into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the negotiations
to enhance the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention
had enhanced and would further enhance international
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Sha said it was easy to see that all the above
non-proliferation regimes established on the basis of relatively
broad participation while taking into account the need of peaceful
uses as much as possible. They would therefore be relatively
effective and have vitality.
</P>
<P>
Sha said that at the same time, a small number of developed
countries, with the purpose of deterring their opponents, set up a
series of so-called non-proliferation mechanisms and arrangements
during the Cold War period. Although these mechanisms and
arrangements might have played a certain role in
non-proliferation, they were discriminatory and exclusive in
nature and non-transparent in practice.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that as the above-mentioned international
legal instruments were already or about to be in place,
maintaining or even enhancing these discriminatory and exclusive
mechanisms and arrangements clashed with the relevant
international legal instruments. What was even worse, they would
continue to impede the social and economic development of all
countries, the developing countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
Sha said what was most serious was that some countries, under
the pretext of preventing proliferation, interfered in and blocked
the legitimate and normal economic and technological exchanges of
the countries, particularly the developing countries. They had
adopted double standards.
</P>
<P>
Sha said that China had determined its position and policy on
international affairs on the merits of each case by proceeding
from the fundamental interests of the people of China and of the
world as a whole. China would never yield to any outside pressure
or enter into alliance with any big power or group of countries;
nor would it establish any military bloc, participate in the arms
races or seek military expansion.

<HEADLINE> Merger Wave Emerges in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A merger wave has been emerged
in a wide rage of European companies as the continent is heading
towards a single economy.
</P>
<P>
Several merger and takeover bids announced over the weekend and
on Monday involve amounts of billions of U.S. dollars, a variety
of sectors and companies across the borders, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
They include a 30 billion dollar merger plan involving the
insurance business between Britain's B.A.T. Industries and the
Switzerland-based Zurich Group and a 9.4 billion dollar takeover
bid by Italy's Assicurazioni Generali for France's Assurances
Generales.
</P>
<P>
Other merger and takeover bids unvealed involve the industries
of beverage, publishing, cement and banks in Holland, Finland and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the merger wave to reasons such as
ever-fiercer global competition, the imminency of Europe's planned
launch of a common currency, and booming stock prices that make
it attractive to offer shares as payment for takeovers.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates in Europe are also a factor which is pushing
companies to make more productive use of their cash.
</P>
<P>
U.S. banks in Europe are believed to have their influence
behind such a merger trend but analysts say Europe's merger move
may reshape parts of its business landscape and raise the
competitive threat for U.S. companies in global markets.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Endorses Thailand's Efforts for Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), today issued a
statement endorsing Thailand's efforts for restructuring its
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted the Thai government has made a significant
announcement today about its detailed strategy to restructure its
troubled financial sector. The announcement contains the key
elements of the restructuring process for 58 suspended finance
companies as well as measures to beef up the remaining
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the institutional framework for the
restructuring or liquidation of the suspended finance companies
has been clarified, and two new institutions are being created to
implement and oversee this process," Camdessus said. "I
particularly welcome the announcement that the strongest possible
criteria will be adopted and that only the very strongest finance
companies will be allowed to reopen."
</P>
<P>
Although the some Asian countries along with the IMF put
forward an assistance package of some 16 billion U.S. dollars in
August to help Thailand solve its financial crisis, the IMF chief
said it would go a long way toward resolving remaining market
uncertainties about the implementation of financial sector
restructuring and other elements of the economic program.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus also reaffirmed that the IMF, together with the World
Bank and other agencies, would continue to work closely with the
Thai government to help implement the financial restructuring
strategy.

<HEADLINE> China Makes New Progress in Promoting Respect, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China had made new
progress in promoting the respect and acceptance, the
dissemination and wider appreciation of the principles of
international law, Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to
the United Nations, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sixth Committee (Legal), Ambassador Qin said the
reform and the opening-up over the last two decades had vigorously
promoted the development of China in the political, economic,
social and cultural fields, and broadened on a large scale the
scope of interaction and cooperation between China and the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that against this backdrop, the legal framework in
China was being gradually completed, and rule of law over all
respects of social life was rapidly gaining weight. Legal
awareness and knowledge, including that of international law, had
been widely spread among the people. This was highly significant
for China in its commitment to the policy of reform and
opening-up, and in its renewed efforts to participate in
international exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the Chinese government and its people
had made new progress in promoting the respect and acceptance of
the principles of international law. China, amidst reform and
opening-up, enjoyed social stability and economic growth, thus
providing more adequate guarantee for improving human rights of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China would sign the international Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and was carefully studying
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The
principle of universality of human rights would receive
increasingly wider respect in China.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China had long adopted a positive attitude towards the
actions of the UN Decade of International Law. The Chinese had
hosted several seminars under the Program of Actions dedicated to
the Decade, and participated in a number of other actions under
the Programs. During the final term of the Decade, China would
work closely with others to make active contribution to the
successful conclusion of the Decade.

<HEADLINE> US Leads in Inventory Management: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States continues to
top Japan and Europe in inventory management in the electronics
industry, an annual study showed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. levels of inventory as a percentage of revenue are
significantly lower than the Japanese and European levels, with
the U.S. standing at 12 percent, Japan 24 percent and Europe 19
percent, the Massachusetts-based PRTM company reported today.
</P>
<P>
Inventory management is a strong measure of a company's
operational health and it is a major cost of doing business,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The items used in the just-released study include inventory
turns, asset turnover, inventory as a percentage of revenue,
growth rate, gross margins and cash-to-cash cycle time.
</P>
<P>
On every indicator except asset turnover, the U.S. led in
performance, the study said.
</P>
<P>
PRTM is a globally-oriented management consultancy focusing on
core processes at high-tech companies. The study, now in its 19th
year, received responses from 354 companies in the U.S., Japan and
Europe.

<HEADLINE> GCC Classifies Goods for Unified Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) finished classifying commodities today, thus
clearing an obstacle on the way to unifying tariffs among its
member nations, Kuwaiti News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
GCC's Customs Committee started a meeting earlier today in
Saudi capital Riyadh to work out the classification of the
remaining 36 commodities out of a total of 1,276.
</P>
<P>
All the commodities are now divided into three categories -
goods exempted from tariffs, basic goods to be levied for a tariff
ranging from 4 to 12 percent and other goods without a set tariff
limit.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,240 commodities had been categorized in accordance with
an internationally accepted classification list in previous
meetings of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Al-Khlaifi, GCC's assistant secretary general for
economic affairs, said Monday that the common customs duties of
the GCC members would range between zero and 12 percent on basic
and non-essential goods, which at present vary from 4 to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the unification of tariffs among GCC member
nations would prove to be a major step toward the proposed
formation of an Arab common market in the future.
</P>
<P>
GCC, a political and economic organization founded in 1981,
consists of six Arab countries of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
