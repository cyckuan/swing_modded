HULL SCORES 1,000th POINT IN VICTORY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brett Hull broke his silence, broke out of a brief
scoring slump and broke the collective back of the Boston Bruins
last night, leading the Stars to a 3-1 victory and scoring his
1,000th career point.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who had not spoken to the news media for a week since he
commented about ice time in a game, addressed reporters on the
goal, the Stars' big victory and what he called ``unfair''
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was a hard week, because it was so uncalled for. I
didn't do anything,'' he said. ``I didn't \Rgripe\S and moan about
ice time. I played 24 minutes two or three games earlier. I'm
playing as much as I did in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media frenzy got so bad that the Toronto Globe and Mail
speculated Friday that Hull would ask for a trade. Hull dismissed
the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull added that sometimes ``when you think you want a bigger
piece of the pie, just go along with it.'' He said there has been
``an emotional adjustment'' in his game that he is becoming aware
of.
</P>
<P>
   But if weekends keep turning out as this one did, he won't have
a problem. The win against the Bruins completed a two-night road
trip in which the Stars not only won, but also played well. The
Stars, in beating the Detroit Red Wings, 5-1, Friday and coming up
with a hard-fought win against the Bruins, answered key questions
that had dogged them after a 2-0 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes on
Wednesday, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some of our better players playing well and we have
our role players starting to fill roles,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're
hopefully building a very functional group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars moved to 9-3-2 on the season and won their third
consecutive road game after starting the season 0-2-1 away from
home. Hull's performance added to that performance.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old winger, who signed as a free agent in the
summer, scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season and is tied
with Mike Modano for the team scoring lead at 13 points. He is the
53rd NHL player to reach the plateau. He and his father, Bobby
Hull, are the only father-son combination to score 1,000 points
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking to Johnny Bucyk,'' Hull said of the former
Bruins great. ``And I told him to have my name mentioned with guys
like that, it's a real honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who had one ``fluky'' goal in the previous four games,
broke out of his self-proclaimed slump with another goal on a
fluke. Down 1-0 in the first period, Hull drove hard to the net and
flicked a shot at Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe. Dafoe stopped the
shot, but Hull ran into him. In the collision, Bruins forward Jason
Allison deflected the puck into his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's just what I needed to break this little slump,''
Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained tied throughout a fiercely contested game as
Modano and Bruins winger Sergei Samsonov each put on puck-handling
clinics and both sides threw their share of big hits.
</P>
<P>
   But it took another lucky bounce to change the game. After a
clearing pass bounced off an official, Modano stole the puck and
fed Hull moving in on Dafoe. Hull kept the puck an almost
impossible amount of time as he moved from the slot to deep on the
goal line to right of the net. Dafoe finally went down to block the
shot and Hull lifted a wrister over him from almost a 90-degree
angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a solid foot to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Jamie Langenbrunner saw it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how that puck went in the net,'' Langenbrunner
said. ``I guess that's how you score 1,000 points, with shots like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Stars a 2-1 lead with 4:26 remaining in the game,
but the excitement wasn't over. Hull almost recorded his first hat
trick as a Stars player a few minutes later. However, his shot at
an empty net caromed off the post.
</P>
<P>
   Modano hustled to retrieve that puck and fed Hull behind the
net, who set up linemate Jere Lehtinen for the empty-net tap-in and
the 1,000th point.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a dream come true?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you dream of 1,000 points,'' Hull said. ``To be
honest, there's only one dream in my head, and that's winning the
Stanley Cup.''

UCLA CLINCHES ROSE BOWL _ AT LEAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The defense arrived, the special teams surprised, and
now the Rose Bowl is their consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA Bruins clinched the Pacific-10 championship Saturday
with their most complete game in five weeks _ a 36-24 victory over
Washington, before 72,391 at Husky Stadium, that secured a berth in
the Rose Bowl regardless of what happens against USC and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was, `Let's win this week, let's get the Rose
Bowl this week,''' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``Nobody can take it
away from us at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning their 19th consecutive game, the Bruins (9-0, 7-0)
celebrated briefly with Rose Bowl representative Mel Cohen and a
few thousand fans nestled in the southwest stands, then turned
their gaze to the Trojans and Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even emotionally high,'' guard Andy Meyers said. ``I
can see sobriety in some of the guys. We haven't finished our
business. There are no roses on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the showers, guys were already talking about USC.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in weeks, the (Cade) McNown and (Danny)
Farmer Show stepped off center stage, leaving behind several
unlikely contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The defense held Washington to 17 points when it mattered _ the
Huskies scored a meaningless touchdown with 45 seconds left _ as
beleaguered coordinator Nick Aliotti charged through the locker
room wearing a towel and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sailer kicked five field goals for the first time in his
career, including a 47-yarder, his longest of the season. Tailback
DeShaun Foster, his sprained knee finally healed, rushed for 73
yards. And punt returner Ryan Roques made a spectacular 77-yard
touchdown return just before halftime that gave UCLA a 20-10 lead.
It was UCLA's first punt return for a touchdown in three years.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the defense and special teams carried the day, as
the offense scored touchdowns on two of eight trips inside
Washington's 35.
</P>
<P>
   But when they needed it most _ ie: when Washington closed to
26-17 at the end of the third quarter _ the Bruins responded with
their most impressive possession of the game. After a first-down
pass, they ran on eight consecutive plays, covering 74 yards and
grabbing a 33-17 lead on Foster's 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, UCLA handed its fate to the offensive line. In
the first half, the Bruins had 17 passes and 16 runs. In the
second, they had eight passes and 30 runs (for 135 yards). What's
more, the line held Washington's No.1-ranked pass rush _ No. 1
 &UR; !ital! &LR; in the nation!off! _ without a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in at halftime and talked to Bob and we agreed we
needed to run the football,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said.
``We got such a great push on the line of scrimmage, it didn't make
sense to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   But this performance was a week, not a half, in the making. It
began Monday, when Toledo both pounced on Aliotti and pronounced
this a title game _ a ``ring game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't. The Bruins needed to beat either Washington
or USC for the Pac-10 crown, and putting disproportionate weight on
Washington could have backfired with a loss. But after 18
consecutive wins and a soft midseason schedule, Toledo guessed
(correctly) that a ring game would energize his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That triggered something,'' receiver Brian Poli-Dixon said.
``We seem to get up for the big games. I don't know what it is, but
he put a lot of emphasis on this. He turned it into a big game.
That's what we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo also instructed Aliotti to simplify the complicated
defense. He halted the last-second substitutions and eliminated
line calls, when plays and assignments are changed at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The alterations _ which included starting Marques Anderson at
cornerback, in place of Roques _ enabled the Bruins to think less
and react more. Yes, Washington's comatose running game gained 248
yards, but the Huskies had just two plays of 25 yards or more. Last
week, by contrast, Oregon State had five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been tense the last few weeks, not having fun,'' end
Travor Turner said. ``But we got back to the old UCLA today, the
UCLA of last year. We play better when we're relaxed and just
reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   The preparation concluded Friday night at the team meeting, when
video coordinator Ken Norris showed highlights from the first eight
games. When it ended, Toledo issued his final challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them if they wanted to get on the highlight film when
the season's over,'' he said, ``then they had to make big plays
today.''

COYOTES GET UP, KICK SAND IN TAMPA BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes have been kicking sand in people's faces
since the season started. Even the big boys of the NHL. But
Saturday night, they almost let a 98-pound weakling of a team push
them over.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, it was the bumbling, stumbling Tampa Bay
Lightning that was the push over. The Coyotes eventually came to
their senses and delivered the knockout, humbling the Lightning,
4-1, in front of a sellout crowd at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory pushed the Coyotes' undefeated streak to eight games
(6-0-2), tying them with the Buffalo Sabres for the longest active
streak in the league. It also put Phoenix (8-2-2) six games over
.500 for the first time since December, 1991, when the
then-Winnipeg Jets opened the season 15-9-7.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Tkachuk, Jeremy Roenick and rookie Daniel Briere each had
a goal and an assist. Rick Tocchet also scored.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's goal was his team-leading ninth of the season. Briere
snared his first. Roenick's goal gave him 325 in his career, moving
into the NHL's top 100 goalscorers. Tocchet, meanwhile, moved
closer to getting No. 400. He now is just 10 goals away from the
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Waite, making his third straight start in goal, had a
relative easy night, facing 21 shots. He saw nine in the first two
periods combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tough games for goalies, though,'' he said. ``The
goalie on the other end is playing well and making a lot of saves.
And you're not too busy, so you really have to keep your
concentration up. But the the guys really played well in front of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes jumped on Tampa early, but seemed to lose some
interest in the second period. Even after the Lightning got a goal
from Darcy Tucker to make it 2-1 and keep things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But who could really blame the Coyotes for falling asleep? After
all, they were playing a team that was coming off two straight
disasterous performances. Tampa got whalloped by the New York
Rangers on Tuesday, 10-2. On Friday, the Lightning got zapped by
Colorado, 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   That's 18 goals against in two games _ two goals more than
Phoenix had allowed all season entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the eighth time in 12 games, the Coyotes grabbed the
first-period lead. And they've been incredibly succesful when they
do over the past couple years. Dating back to last season, they now
are 31-1-2 when holding the lead after the first 20 minutes of
play.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk and Roenick delivered the goods this time, with Roenick
taking a Jyrki Lumme pass and threading the puck to a cutting
Tkachuk for a big goal right after a faceoff. Only 1:54 remained in
the period, and the most surprising thing was that Phoenix only had
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Considering they outshot the Lightning, 17-3 _ their highest
output in a period thus far _ and had four power play
opportunities, it could have been a laugher from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Puppa wasn't laughing, though. Early in the second, the
Tampa Bay goalie faced a barrage of shots, including three straight
breakaways by Briere, Roenick and Dallas Drake. But you had the
sense the dam was going to break at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   With 6:19 left in the period, Briere made it 2-0 with his first
goal of the season, a nice slapshot of a Tocchet rebound while
getting pushed to the ice by Tampa rookie Vincent Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty gratifying to finally score,'' Briere said. ``The
first line (of Tkchuk, Roenick and Dallas Drake) has really been
carrying us the last few games. Personally, I don't think I've been
playing all that well lately. I haven't been moving my legs very
well. But this was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere hadn't registered a point in three games since getting an
assist and racking up several scoring chances during a 3-0 win in
Los Angeles _ his first game featured as the club's No. 2 center
following the Cliff Ronning trade to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't see much ice time in the third period of any of
the past three games. Schoenfeld, though, said Briere is
progressing along just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our past three opponents (Detroit, Colorado and
Dallas) and you look at their No.1 and No.2 centers, and then you
factor in they were all real close games, if you get a lead, you're
going to go with your guys who can nail it down for you,''
Schoenfeld said. ``That's a growing process young players go
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juha Ylonen, for example, the last couple games he's playing
great so his ice time is increasing. It's not that somebody else
isn't having a good game. It's just that you recognize this guy or
that guy is having a great game. Just like (Brad) Isbister the
other night (in Dallas). He was really on his game and we kept him
out there and he did the job.'' &QL;

ROQUES' RETURNS SPARK BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the kind of dark, dreary November afternoon that
explains why there is a coffee bar on every corner in this city,
UCLA turned somewhere else to jump-start its day.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Roques proved to be the perfect pick-me-up for the Bruins
with two kick returns that sent them on their way to a Rose
Bowl-clinching 36-24 win Saturday over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Roques' 81-yard kickoff return to the Washington 12 set up a
Chris Sailer field goal. But he turned in the most dazzling play of
the game on a 77-yard punt return for a touchdown with 41 seconds
left in the half to put UCLA ahead 20-10 going into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bruins' first punt return for a touchdown since Paul
Guidry's 70-yarder against Arizona State in 1995 and proved well
worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can get a big play just before halftime, it gives
you momentum and puts a little doubt in the other team's minds,''
UCLA coach Bob Toledo, who for one of the few times this season
found himself discussing a big return by someone he coaches. ``It
was a crucial play in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On the punt return, Roques broke two tackles and left two more
Huskies groping for something to hold up their Apple Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a punt block on so I knew we were going after it,''
Roques said. ``I wasn't going to have much blocking. You just run
to daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   The kickoff return was much more straightforward. The wedge
opened a gaping hole and Roques made one feint to his right at the
UCLA 40-yard line, then cut back to his left and raced down the
sideline, though not fast enough to avoid being caught from behind
by kicker Craig Hawley.
</P>
<P>
   He came that close to becoming the first Bruin to return a
kickoff for a touchdown since JoJo Townsell in 1980. ``I thought I
was by him. I thought I broke his angle,'' said Roques, explaining
the play with a smile to a more forgiving audience than the one
he'll face Monday in film study. ``But that's a kicker. You can't
let a kicker bring you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The returns helped ease the disappointment of losing his
starting cornerback job to Marques Anderson, a decision that was
made earlier this week but not announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing with less confidence and we wanted to take the
pressure off him,'' said defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti, who
also coaches the punt return team. ``I knew he wasn't happy about
it, but that's OK. He shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   The returns also reminded Roques, a fourth-year junior, how
thrilling it is to have your hands on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He came to UCLA as a running back, but after playing sparingly
as a redshirt freshman, he asked to be moved to cornerback. He got
his first significant playing time this year and was handed the
punt-returning duties when Freddie Mitchell broke his leg and
DeShaun Foster was sidelined with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love getting my hands on the ball,'' said Roques, who
returned five punts for touchdowns as a senior at Moreno Valley
High. ``It's a big rush when you look up and know 11 people are
after you. In high school, punt returning was my favorite thing to
do. I was hoping I'd get a chance to do it.''

NORTHRIDGE REFUSES TO FOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ There were only 10 minutes remaining and his team
led by 10 points, but Cal State Northridge coach Bobby Braswell
sensed trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So he called a timeout, sat the Matadors down and reminded them
what they (begin ital)had not(end ital) done to build their
comfortable lead against host Cal State Long Beach on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They (begin ital)didn't(end ital) make selfish plays, Braswell
told them. They (begin ital)didn't(end ital) play sloppy defense,
and they (begin ital)didn't(end ital) stray from their offensive
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, after Northridge buckled down with a 19-8 run
on its way to a 83-65 win, Braswell allowed himself a smile and a
bit of bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to an assistant coach, then nodding assuredly, Braswell
whispered: ``We come into (Long Beach's) place, take their
guaranteed (money) and get the win,'' said Braswell, who was making
his first appearance in Long Beach since he was an assistant there
from 1989-92.
</P>
<P>
   What Braswell didn't mention was that Northridge was over .500
for the first time in his three years at the school, that the
Matadors (1-0) won their first season opener since 1988-89 and that
for the first time in school history, they'd won a road game in
which they were guaranteed a slice of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   None of it would have happened had Northridge not tightened up
at the midway point of the second half. The Matadors seemed in
control, but a few lapses defensively and some one-on-one plays at
the offensive end convinced Braswell that a reminder was needed.
Northridge, which got 18 points and six rebounds from Jeff Parris,
answered with a big run to stretch its lead to 79-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``They responded, and as a coach that's something you love to
see,' Braswell said. ``We got some plays defensively and started
doing what we had been doing offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   They also got some timely performances from a few unlikely
sources. Hewitt Rolle, who frustrated Braswell with some lackluster
practices recently, came off the bench with 13 points. Two other
bench players _ Greg Minor and Markus Carr _ had 13 and 11 points,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when heralded newcomer Rico Harris struggled to get
into a flow because of foul trouble, Minor, Carr and Rolle stepping
up was especially significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see those guys get the job done,'' said Jason
Crowe, a starter who finished with three points. ``We know they've
got our back and we've got theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a 6-9 forward who originally signed at Arizona State and
played the past two years at L.A. City College, had hoped for a
better debut. But he sat all but three minutes of the first half
with two fouls, then played sporadically in the second after
picking up his third and fourth. He finished with nine points in 17
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating, but we got the win and that's the
most important thing,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge will need more from Harris and Crowe when it travels
to the University of Tennessee on Tuesday. Still, Braswell was
pleased with the collective play of the team to support the off day
from its key players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can go on the road and get a win it's something to
feel good about,'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt to make $10,000, either. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

   Ultimately, only 14 of the 87 three-person teams completed the
insufficiently staffed, poorly marked 100-mile course through the
Tonto National Forest on Oct. 23-24. But the event was simply the
end game of a venomous yearlong drama played out as much in the
courtroom and in cyber space as the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Steffen, an adventure racer who as a rookie race director hoped
to cash in on the sport's lucrative potential, overextended her
administrative abilities and mortgaged her future.
</P>
<P>
   Ill-equipped first-timers, paying a $1,000 entry fee per team,
overestimated their ability to handle a 17- to 24-hour test that
drew participants from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   And disputes between the original partners in the venture and a
feud with a potential investor led, ultimately, to a chaotic
weekend and startlingly different futures for all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not without blame, there's no doubt about it,'' said
Steffen, 35, of Phoenix. ``But these people, most of them were way
over their head. It was beyond any of our anticipation. This is not
a triathlon, this is not a 10K. This is an extreme sporting
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventure racing is a sport with a traceable history going back
barely a decade, and before that a sketchier lineage branching off
endurance triathlon. But with Discovery Channel sponsorship of the
Eco-Challenge giving adventure racing widespread recognition, the
chase is on to market the sport to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area, with rugged, spectacular desert nearby, seemed
like a perfect locale. ``Voila,'' Desert Quest, was born. Steffen
advertised the event in 10 major markets during the April telecast
of the 1997 Eco-Challenge, held in Australia. Come to Arizona, the
commercial beckoned, for up to 24 hours of running, biking,
kayaking and climbing. Your chance to be an eco-guy/gal for a
bargain price in a sport where the entry fee for exotic expedition
events starts at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The slick, full-color Desert Quest entry form projected $100,000
in event awards and giveaways, a figure Steffen said she reached by
including such perks as running suits for the first 25 teams to
register.
</P>
<P>
   But the total cash awarded was $7,500 and the fourth-place team
received free entry into Desert Quest 1999, a prize that could be
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   What Steffen and her partners devised, the thrill-seeking
audience bought. By May, Desert Quest had reached its original
limit of 75 three-person teams and expanded to 105, larger than any
adventure race in the world involving overnight competition.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the fourth Eco-Challenge went off in Morocco last
month with 55 four-person teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got big sponsors wanting big TV and big TV wanting big
sponsors,'' Steffen said before Desert Quest. ``So somebody's got
to put up. That happens to be me.'' &QL; 
Winners' check bounced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors and TV mean nothing on race day when a few volunteers
at the finish are scrambling to transport gallons of water from
miles away in Mesa to the Tonto National Forest race site. And
sponsorship couldn't even pull together anything resembling a line
for the winners to cross after a 17{-hour effort.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the event, on adventure racing bulletin boards, the
likelihood of success was debated. The criticisms were echoed
afterward, in cyber space and in interviews with ``The Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not enough event staff.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with course markings that led to racers getting lost
and running out of water.
</P>
<P>
   A bottleneck at the difficult, if not unsafe, climb late in the
event.
</P>
<P>
   And it would have been nice if the winners' check hadn't
bounced.
</P>
<P>
   First-time adventure racers Clint Graham, Lisa Barnes and Rick
Wightman competed as Team Wilderness Adventure in Desert Quest.
Some four miles into the opening 6.5-mile run, in the light of a
quarter moon and headlamps, they negotiated the turn from Forest
Road 13 to 1863. Many others missed it, triggering a chain of
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead teams covered an estimated 20 miles instead of
6.5 before finding its way to the mountain bike stage. After a
36-mile ride, the team had to choose between taking unauthorized
water and disqualification or treking dehydrated and without water
for 15 miles to a transition area where water refill was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the instructions,'' said Barnes of Glendale, whose
team finished second. ``That section was not marked, so the whole
time we were kind of questioning it, but it did say in the
instructions to go to 1863. We had doubts in the back of our mind,
but we went that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen contends that the course was sabotaged by someone
removing ribbons that marked the course there and on the final leg
to the finish at Usery Mountain Park. Inexperience of many racers
compounded the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two-way radios she expected were not delivered,
staff communication was restricted to cell phone in an area with
known dead zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Joe Bell (of first-place Trident Adventures) came in and
said, `Janeen, there are no ribbons,' I immediately fly into a
panic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steffen's thin resources, estimated by her to be 60-70
volunteers, were stretched by real, imagined and non-existent
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have stressed more the fact that if you quit
someplace in a race, you had to get down to a point where we could
get you out,'' Steffen said. ``You don't just stop and leave your
bikes and leave your gear and walk away and expect volunteers to
pick up after you.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started shuttling people to try and prevent a major
medical situation, that's where I was cut short on the back side. I
was having to run from here to here to here to here. . . . What I
see now, to handle the inexperience level that was at this event, I
would have needed 200-plus volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, said one volunteer, all those working at his station
would not return if Desert Quest is held again. The volunteer cited
unkept promises (for example, volunteers had to pay for meals and
park entrance fees) and being left without sufficient backup or
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way to know who was medical personnel,'' said the
volunteer, who asked for anonymity. ``There was no designated
person with (medical) clothing on. It was very stressful. Nothing
seemed to be organized as well as it could be. Every time we turned
around, we got knocked down another notch. She (Steffen) was very
lucky nobody got hurt.'' (There was one injury, a broken collarbone
in the bike portion of the trek.)
</P>
<P>
   Changing partners &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many problems might have been averted if Steffen had partners
familiar with staging a race and more volunteer hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Steffen's relations with her original partners disintegrated
_ so much so that she took out restraining orders against them.
Another prospective partnership ended with another restraining
order. Other potential last-minute partnerships fell through.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, predictably, follows the money _ more than $100,000
in entry fees. To understand where Desert Quest lost its way, you
need to track down Jack Dunn in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, one of the early collaborators, couldn't have been happier
to be in north Africa early last month, yanking on the reins on his
camel, instead of in Arizona trying to keep Desert Quest afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it worked out the way it did,'' said Dunn, 36, an
operating engineer from Scottsdale. ``Obviously I would have loved
to stay involved with putting the race on, but I didn't want to do
it with her (Steffen).
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks she knows a lot more than she does, and that
bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and Nick Moore, 33, who owns a pool company in Palm
Springs, Calif., were in Morocco as half of Epinephrine Adventure
Racing, chosen in a lottery to be the 12th and final United States
entry in the Eco-Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity came after a nasty split with Steffen and her
former racing teammates in mid-June that sucked much of the
organizing expertise out of Desert Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, Moore and another racer/partner, Louis Paciello, wanted an
accounting of entry fees and other funds that Steffen refused to
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never equal partners,'' she said. ``When I asked
them to do that back in September-October (1997), they wouldn't do
it. They never felt this would be the level it's at. They hoped
we'd have 30 teams. It was just too much for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen said she left a job in computer sales to work full time
on Desert Quest, on which she said she spent $65,000 or more of her
own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't or couldn't do it. So what am I supposed to do?
Say `Race over' and fold up my tent? No, I begged, borrowed and
stole, as the saying goes, to make this race. I've cashed in my
401K, my stocks. Mortgaged my house. Everything to do this and also
make a living and pay my bills. They weren't willing to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   On her attorney's advice, Steffen took out restraining orders
June 17 against all three men, primarily based on a taped phone
conversation the day before with Dunn. ``Threatened to stop race,''
she wrote of Dunn in the injunction against harassment. ``(Said I)
need to watch my step. I will be unhappy girl in next couple
days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did leave a message on her recorder, and she took it as a
threat,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said: ``When she said we didn't have a right to look at
the books, we started to see some handwriting on the wall, to put
it nicely. We weren't second guessing, but we wanted to see what
was coming in and where it was going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a formal partnership agreement, which Steffen told
Moore her attorney was drafting, the restraining orders arrived,
putting Tonto National Forest and Upper Lake Mary in Flagstaff
off-limits to the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I can't step into the state of Arizona,'' said
Moore, who had been commuting on weekends to set the Desert Quest
course. ``But everything happens for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Paul Romero, captain of Team Epinephrine.
</P>
<P>
   He met Dunn and Moore at the Met-Rx Adventure Race, June 13 at
Lake Perris (Calif.) State Park, where they were forced to pay
their own entry fee because Steffen canceled her check for them to
race as Team Quest. The next week, within days of the restraining
orders, came Romero's invitation to what Moore calls the big dance,
his third Eco-Challenge and Dunn's second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to put on a good, clean race, and if there was
any money left over, divvy up the pie,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know so many people, and they know Jack's reputation and my
reputation. That takes a while to build. We let actions speak for
themselves.'' &QL; 
Cliffs chaos &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that went wrong with Desert Quest _ from the partnership
split, through Steffen's unanswered appeals for help in the final
pre-race weeks to the Maricopa County Sports Commission and Grand
Canyon State Games, to a rushed and cursory inspection of equipment
and climbing backgrounds during check-in _ culminated at the
Goldfield Cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of loose rocks, inexperience and fatigue, teams stacked
up like Sky Harbor airplanes at Christmas trying to complete the
200-foot ascent and rappel. Steffen pulled the plug on the climb at
approximately 3 p.m., two hours ahead of the scheduled cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped most of the teams at the ropes,'' she said.
``Logistically, they could have finished by the mandatory (overall
24-hour) cutoff, but none of them took headlamps. There was no way
I was sending 20 teams (into the desert at dark).''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Mounts of Team Extreme Madness was fuming because she
couldn't retrieve her headlamp at the second transition after the
4.2-mile kayak stage on Saguaro Lake. ``They did not transport our
gear box (from the transition into the kayak) like promised,'' she
said. ``This had all our food, water, lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were told we were DQ'ed, I felt like someone took a
part of me. I broke down and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Burdette of Desert Mountain Sports, whose performance on
race day drew respect from all sides, was in charge of the climb
and at the top of the cliff. He made the decision to shut down the
middle of three rope setups to reduce the risk of falling rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the loose rock could have been cleaned out,'' with
more volunteers, Burdette said. ``But nobody was hit, there were no
reports of (rock) injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdette is not sure the unqualified climbers could have been
weeded out during check-in or if any of the 18 teams that made it
to the top and back had an unsafe climbing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do that ascent in five minutes,'' he said, ``but not
after 18 hours. It would have taken me a long time. You could have
been wildly qualified and still failed. We weren't catering to
people who had never ascended.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen isn't so kind, saying had she been free to reach the
ropes section sooner she would have disqualified many teams for
improper equipment and/or insufficient skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't climb for them, I can't train for them, I can't run
for them,'' Steffen said. &QL; 
Plans fall through &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As race week end neared, Steffen's search for help became more
and more desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Her plans for national sponsorship/television and a blowout
entertainment expo at the finish area fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Most destructive, Steffen said, was a short-lived business
relationship with Tim McGill of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to me with a story and sucked me in on how he had
these national sponsors and was trying to do a race like mine,''
she said. ``From what we can determine, he saw big dollars, big
potential, single women, big entry fees and a chance to make some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   McGill, 35, who said he has business dealings that reach to
Africa, tells a different story. In July and August, he says, he
proposed a merger of his company, first called Treasure Quest and
now Extreme Sports Inc., with Steffen's and that she would not
provide her financial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure if I'm paying for a red apple, it's not
yellow,'' McGill said. ``I started talking to some other people
about her and decided to call it quits with her.''
</P>
<P>
   As their dealings melted down the Internet heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Through an on-line news group offered by the Adventure Racing
Association and the Desert Quest bulletin board, McGill began
posting his doubts about the event, questioning insurance, permits,
kayaks and Steffen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this guy started posting all over the Internet, people
started getting edgy,'' said Chad Smith, who provided support for
Team Reebok/Sisyphus that traveled from Maryland for Desert Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Even Robert Nagle, a Harvard professor and a founder of the
Adventure Racing Association, , could not sift the truth out of the
charges and countercharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect me to serve as Solomon, but there is only so
much you can do in life,'' said Nagle, whose team is a two-time
winner of the Eco-Challenge. But in a Solomon-like decision, he and
the ARA board put Steffen and McGill on probation, making their
submissions subject to his approval before being posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they had an opportunity to inform everyone on the e-mail
list of the potential problems at DQ, or lack thereof, the messages
became more animated than informative,'' violating the ARA policy
of no flaming (personal attacks), Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to Desert Quest was substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (McGill) stirred up a lot of trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steffen accused McGill of being the one who sabotaged the course
on race day. He denies it.
</P>
<P>
   More races planned &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGill said he is in final negotiations for a $250,000, six-race
adventure series. He is offering free entry to his first Extreme
Sports Inc. event to all Desert Quest teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't cause her race to go (expletive),'' McGill said.
``She caused me to go goodbye. The difference between my first race
and hers? You'll all see.''
</P>
<P>
   He projects the first race of his series for February or perhaps
a month or two later, probably in the San Francisco Bay area. ``I
planned Northern Arizona,'' he said, ``but I can't start there
because of the bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen lists two 1999 races, one in March and the other in
October, on her Desert Quest web site and said she is making a tape
of the 1998 race to peddle to ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, she is trying to sell what remains of her dream to
save her house from foreclosure. She told Bob Kite that her race
debts are $35,000 to $40,000, half of that for materials, and that
she has bounced some checks, including one for $3,500 to the Desert
Quest champions.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, the only one of Steffen's 1997 teammates not to have a
restraining order taken against him by her, is considering a
bailout purchase of Desert Quest. He then would turn the property
over to an established race director like Rob Wallack of
Phoenix-based Raceplace Events or Norm Klein of the Western States
100 to pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Wallack has a 20-year history of producing runs and triathlons
here and elsewhere, including national series and Arizona's largest
fitness event, Phoenix Race for the Cure (14,000).
</P>
<P>
   Except for Race for the Cure, which turns its profits over to
breast cancer research groups, he said he's had nothing close to a
$100,000-plus budget for an event. His typical budget for a
regional marathon would be $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racers should have every expectation of a high-quality
event (at Desert Quest),'' Wallack said. ``This is not a feather in
the cap of Arizona event production. The whole thing was
inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kite said he didn't pull any punches with Steffen. ``I told her
what you've got established is a bad reputation, and what value is
that? Maybe it can be salvaged under new ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Steffen said a buyout is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give it away,'' she said. ``I've got to get a
job. I can't stay home and run this full time without some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is a market for the sport. About that, Steffen
was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janeen did a lot of talking, which got her to a certain point,
but then when we had to back up her words, she didn't have it,''
Moore said. ``She thought we were replaceable, just grunts or dumb
jocks. We knew it was going to be a fiasco.'' &QL;

FOREST SERVICE WANTS YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service is completing revision of a strategic
plan for the use of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good idea. Agreed, national forests should be multiuse
resources. Since we all hold ownership of these public lands, they
should be managed to accomodate as many public uses as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But historically, the Forest Service has been somewhat one-sided
in its management of the resources.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity users _ the timber industry and ranchers _ received
special considerations. Congress was of little help. It believed
the forests should make some money from timber and ranching
operations. After all, these industries contributed to the gross
national product. They should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble became that these industries basically made
nothing for the Forest Service. They may have provided lumber and
food, but the Forest Service was expending too much of its
financial resources to provide the opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency resisted change, but the pendulum and began swinging
the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, recreationists and wildlife conservationists,
who were growing in numbers, began to demand their fair share of
resources. At first, they fought together. The environmentalists,
especially, began winning their share of battles against
management. They often did it in court and still do. Witness the
battles over spotted owls and other endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the united groups began battling. Some environmentalists
and hiking groups believed other recreational groups were doing
more damage than good. As with the timber and ranching industries,
there were sweeping accusations that certainly didn't involve the
entire group.
</P>
<P>
   Off-highway-vehicle users were among those attacked. That
includes a large number of enthusiasts from those who drive 4x4
vehicles to those who operate all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   There became an outcry to close some forest roads and keep these
blighters confined to controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   There was some justification. Some OHV users are cowboys _
people looking only for a thrill, not conservation. But that
sweeping condemnation is akin so saying that most shooters are
gang-bangers. It's a statement so outlandish that it's laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have called for the elimination of large numbers of
back-country roads. It's true that some logging roads should be
eliminated, especially those that parallel or duplicate one another
or those that cause huge erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious that some environmental groups just have a
problem with any OHV activities that aren't in confined areas.
Accepting that view would eliminate opportunities to explore that
only Arizona can offer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Forest Service, the goals of the 1997 strategic
plan are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Ensure sustainable ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Provide multiple benefits for people within the capabilities of
ecosystems. (No harm, no foul.)
</P>
<P>
   Ensure organizational effectiveness. (That's one that will be
debated a lot.)
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service wants to know if these are the goals that
should be included in the revised strategic plan and if there are
others that should be added or substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other questions, the Forest Service wants the public to
answer:
</P>
<P>
   What should the agency define as its long-term priorities or
objectives?
</P>
<P>
   Given these strategic goals and your sense of how long-term
priorities or objectives should be defined, what do you think
agency managers should focus on as the critical indicators of
success or failure?
</P>
<P>
   From your perspective, what are the most important outcomes or
future resource conditions on which you would like to see the
Agency focus?
</P>
<P>
   What other issues and concerns would you like the Forest Service
to know about and consider in the revision of its strategic plan?
</P>
<P>
   Any individual or organization may participate. Comments via
e-mail, letter or fax are welcome at any time.

INJURIES BECOME EPIDEMIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New York Islanders prospect lost his right eye Friday.  &UR; Jeff
Libby had to have it surgically removed six days after being cut in
the face by a skate during an American Hockey League game.
</P>
<P>
   If you saw replays of Dallas defenseman  &UR; Darryl Sydor
dangerously running  &UR; Jeremy Roenick headfirst into a support beam
last week, you'd think the Coyotes center was lucky the same thing
didn't happen to him. It looked ghoulish, but JR escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it a few times already. No big deal,'' Roenick said
cooly. ``Hey, that's just part of the game. That's hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it getting worse? There were nearly 100 concussions
suffered by NHL players last season. Some of them were bad enough
to force early retirements. The Coyotes, who led the league with
473 man-games lost to injury, have already had five different
players suffer concussions this season.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, players are falling at an alarming rate.
Washington recently had as many as nine skaters on the shelf.
Colorado had eight. Los Angeles, Montreal and Ottawa had at least
seven each.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are inevitable, but according to Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Schoenfeld, the problem has been compounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice surface is the same size. The players are bigger,
faster and stronger, so there's less ice to maneuver on. The speed
at which they're confronting each other is greater. So when you get
these two big locomotives coming and there's no room to get out of
the way, something's got to give,'' Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough game. We play three, four times a week and we
travel coast to coast. Football plays 16 games in a season and they
take a week to heal up. We can't do that. But it's a real grueling,
grueling way to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, like many, also subscribes to the theory that there
is less respect among players in today's NHL. He blames improved
equipment for part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more equipment you wear, the less regard there is,'' he
said. ``First of all, you think, `I've got to get through this
shield of armor to get to the flesh, and I can do almost anything
to get through this shield of armor.' I really do think that
players have less regard because of helmets, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played when a lot of guys didn't wear helmets, and our
sticks were carried lower. And you didn't bash a guy's head into
the glass. It was the odd time, but it wasn't the norm. A better
example is the kids who wear the cages. Now, instead of cuts and
getting teeth knocked out, you get spinal injuries. That's way more
severe. . . . But you think you're invincible and you can't hurt
the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is taking a more active stand this season on doling out
suspensions for flagrant and even borderline hits. But injuries and
accidents will keep coming. As Roenick said, ``That's hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you appreciate seeing a guy like  &UR; Danny Briere out
there,'' Roenick said of the Coyotes' 5-foot-9 rookie center.
``He's playing the toughest game in sports, and he's not afraid to
get hit. He's not afraid to go into the corners and take his lumps.
There's a lot of people in this game who don't sacrifice themselves
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid is amazing, though. I saw him on TV the other night,
and I swear to God, he looks like a freshman in high school.'' &QL; 
Don't be like Mike &QL; 
It's been a few months, but Florida Panthers General Manager
 &UR; Bryan &UR; Murray is still seething about the way goalie  &UR; Mike Richter
double-crossed him this summer during negotiations with the
then-unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray, Richter agreed to a six-year, $31 million
overture from Murray during a phone conversation, but only used it
to drive up the price to re-sign with the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was assured when I made the offer that there was no right to
match as far as the Rangers were concerned,'' Murray said. ``But
the second I got off the phone, the first thing (Richter) did was
run to (Rangers GM)  &UR; Neil Smith with my offer. It was upsetting at
that time, and it's still upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Mike afterward, I don't think he showed much
character or honor by doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter reacted by saying, ``I could understand him being upset.
But I don't have any bones to pick with him at all. He's a good
man. He made me an offer and these are high stakes. But I was a
free agent and New York made me an offer. I considered it and I
took it. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.'' &QL; 
Kudos to Cullen &QL; 
He's battled back from cancer, and instead of accepting an offer
from Tampa Bay to retire and take a seat behind the Lightning bench
as an assistant,  &UR; John Cullen decided to stick it out and play in
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for Tampa's farm team in the International Hockey
League, Cullen tied a Cleveland Lumberjacks team record last
weekend by recording a seven-point night _ two goals, five assists
_ during a 7-3 win over the Chicago Wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hockey gods are on my side,'' Cullen said. ``Every bounce
was going my way.''
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Dave Michayluk set the original record for Cleveland back
on Feb. 27, 1988, Cullen happened to be on the ice as a member of
the Flint Generals. &QL; 
Just plain ugly &QL; 
After the Coyotes ambushed the Stars, 2-0, last week in Dallas,
someone asked Coach  &UR; Ken Hitchcock if he was concerned about star
center  &UR; Mike Modano not scoring a goal in eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm concerned,'' Hitchcock said, raising a few eyebrows.
``He's going to have to find out how far he's willing to dig in to
score. You don't score from the perimeter in this league. How many
shots has he had from the inside? Look where he's scored his three
goals earlier this year. All were inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who finally ended his slump during Friday's 5-1 win over
Detroit, said he plans to get his nose dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to hang around the net more,'' he said. ``You don't get
too many chances to score pretty goals. It's an ugly league. You
have to score ugly goals.'' &QL;

SAILER KICKS FIVE FIELD GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yes, he's healthy _ or healthier. But what Chris
Sailer really needed was a chance.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's red zone offense sputtered against Washington for the
first time this season, and Sailer was there to lend a foot. He
made a career-high five field goals _ from 27, 25, 25, 47 and 29
yards _ equaling his total from the previous seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to contribute,'' said Sailer, a senior from
Burbank. ``It's nice to finally do the things I knew I could do all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer injured his right groin in late September and was unable
to kick in practice for a month. When Saturdays arrived, he had no
strength, no trajectory and no rhythm. With rest and treatment, the
leg slowly healed, and for the past two weeks he has kicked during
practice.
</P>
<P>
   As his strength returned, so did his trajectory and distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kicking in practice is a huge benefit,'' he said. ``It allowed
me to get my rhythm back (during games). This is definitely the
best I've felt, and I'm getting better week by week. I'm almost 100
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still running: UCLA's defense, while improved, nevertheless had
trouble stopping the previously ineffective Washington running
game. The Huskies not only had their first 100-yard game by a
tailback _ they had two.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Hurst rushed for 114 yards and Braxton Cleman rushed for
100.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credit goes to the blockers for the push they had,''
Huskies coach Jim Lambright said. ``It was obvious at times when we
would gain two, three or four yards just by the push of our line.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone at the top: UCLA quarterback Cade McNown broke Steve
Stenstrom's Pacific-10 record for total career offense when he
completed a 12-yard, third-quarter pass to receiver Brad Melsby.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, who has 10,231 total yards, played a solid, mistake-free
game but did not dominate like he did last week at Oregon State.
Saturday, he completed 12 of 24 passes for 233 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: Linebacker Mike Wiley recorded two tackles in his
first game in two months and gave outside linebacker Santi Hall
some much-needed rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played about 25 plays, which is a lot considering how long
I've been out,'' said Wiley, who was sidelined with a bad back and
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Please leave: UCLA coach Bob Toledo offered to help fund
Washington quarterback Brock Huard's early departure to the NFL.
Huard, a fourth-year junior, is considering leaving early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure hope he goes out,'' Toledo joked. ``I'll chip in
$1,000. He needs to go to the NFL now.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of speed: Washington used a no-huddle offense to move 80
yards in 10 plays for its first touchdown, a 23-yard run by Cleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we had trouble was people were moving closer to the
sideline to get the call, and we weren't ready for the play,''
safety Larry Atkins said. ``Once we lined up on our man and got the
calls from our spots, it wasn't a problem.''

ATHLETICS OWNERS PERSONIFY GREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late  &UR; Walter Haas, one of baseball's best friends during the
16 years he owned the Oakland Athletics, would be appalled to learn
what
 &UR; Steve Schott and  &UR; Ken Hofmann are up to with his beloved A's.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, which bought the club from Haas in his dying days for
a driven-down bargain price of $80 million or so, has the club for
sale at $155.3 million. The co-owners claim the club is worth $135
million (no way) and want an additional $20.3 million from the new
buyer to pay off deferred contracts and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, who transformed Levi Strauss from a sleepy jeans company
into a worldwide heavyweight, never asked Schott (surprisingly, no
relation to  &UR; Marge) and Hofmann for deferred compensation. All Haas
sought was an owner who would keep the club in the Bay Area, also
the home of Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning the co-owners began showing their intentions.
Before they even watched their first game as owners they drove
 &UR; Tony La
 &UR; Russa out of town, wondering how a manager could possibly be paid
$1.5 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that La Russa gave the A's credibility, money was all
that interested this pair from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, the likes of  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre,  &UR; Dennis Eckersley
and
 &UR; Rick Honeycutt were former A's. It wouldn't be long before  &UR; Mark
 &UR; McGwire, who, at the time, wanted to remain in Oakland, had priced
himself out of the A's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The payroll last season was less than $20 million. Attendance
has not come near the levels it reached under Haas, and now Schott
and Hofmann have even made it one of their requirements that any
prospective owner pony up $15 million (10 percent of the sale
price) simply to review their books.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, the Oakland Coliseum Authority filed to take the
sale to arbitration. The Authority, which recruited Schott and
Hofmann to buy the club, wants the two to sell for the original $85
million plus 10 percent of that figure for each of the three years
they've owned the club and any capital they have put into the club
since taking over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have walked away with a profit of $40 million,''
Oakland City Council member  &UR; John Russo told the ``Oakland
Tribune.'' ``But it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is nothing short of a white-collar crime. &QL; 
A near California collision &QL; 
Talk about a blockbuster. San Diego and Los Angeles nearly pulled
off a nine-player deal that would have sent Padres outfielder  &UR; Greg
Vaughn, pitcher  &UR; Joey Hamilton, second baseman  &UR; Quilvio Veras,
shortstop  &UR; Chris &UR; Gomez and reliever  &UR; Randy Myers to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, San Diego would have acquired outfielder  &UR; Gary
Sheffield, pitcher  &UR; Ismael Valdes, second baseman  &UR; Eric Young and
shortstop  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was initiated and approved by the Padres. Los Angeles
thought hard before backing out, believing it wasn't receiving
enough. &QL; 
Just go away, already &QL; 
Former Florida Marlins owner/pariah  &UR; Wayne Huizenga couldn't depart
from Major League Baseball without one last laughable comment.
Huizenga insisted he sold the team at a ridiculously low price of
$158 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kansas City Royals, who have their own stadium, are on
the block for nearly $80 million, how can Huizenga make such an
absurd comment?
</P>
<P>
   He also said he turned down a $250 million offer from a group
that wanted to move the club to northern Virginia because he wanted
to keep the Marlins in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. This is a guy who once sent his attack-dog
attorneys to the corner pizza man because his business was named
Blockbuster Pizza, forcing the small businessman to change the
name. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Talk about covering a story: Two years ago  &UR; Andrea Pacione, a
Cleveland TV reporter, was sent to Jacobs Field to do a story on
the Indians. Last week she married first baseman  &UR; Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This will surely go over well: Mets Manager  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Valentine, assessing his newest player: ``I think  &UR; Bobby Bonilla is
a guy who comes with some risk who also comes with a lot of reward.
The risk is whether he catches the ball when it comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Pete Falcone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gee, that's awfully nice of you, Frank: White Sox designated
hitter (he no longer considers himself a first baseman)
 &UR; Frank Thomas last week said he was troubled with his name surfacing
in trade talk, especially after choosing ``to stay in Chicago and
settle for less.'' Thomas begins the first year of an eight-year
deal worth $78 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Suddenly, it's all the rage:  &UR; Al Martin joined Diamondbacks
outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey in becoming another big-league player
who has opted for laser eye surgery in an effort to revitalize his
career. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
 &UR; Robin Ventura, the best free-agent third baseman available, has
made eyes at San Diego. Ventura, who could command $10 million a
year, has received little more than a blank stare in return.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that  &UR; John Smiley, who won at least 10 games in eight
of 10 seasons through 1997, may never pitch again. Smiley, who
broke a bone in his arm while warming up 14 months ago, recently
passed through waivers without being claimed. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Once  &UR; Kevin Brown and  &UR; Randy Johnson, the two big fish among this
year's free agents, sign with new clubs, expect the clubs that lose
out to aggressively talk with Toronto about trading for  &UR; Roger
Clemens. The list of possible suitors: Houston, Los Angeles, Texas,
Anaheim, St. Louis, Atlanta and the Yankees. &QL;

MINOR GAINS MAJOR ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When he turned his attention to professional baseball,
 &UR; Ryan Minor was best known as a prolific scorer for the Oklahoma
basketball team. He was even Big Eight Player of the Year in 1995.
But forget all that. Minor has an even greater claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, less than two weeks after being called up from
Baltimore's Double-A affiliate in Bowie, Md., Minor started at
third base for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In place of  &UR; Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That ended Ripken's consecutive games streak at 2,632 and
certified Minor as the answer to a trivia question. But he wants to
be much more than that, which is why he is extending his season and
honing his skills as a member of the Grand Canyon Rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he will never be far from the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it,'' said Minor, who was 8 when Ripken's
streak began on May 30, 1982. ``It's just one of those things that
I happened to be on the team that night and they just called my
name. It was a good experience. It was fun. It was something I'll
always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor was sitting in the home team dugout at Camden Yards
sipping a cup of coffee before a game against the New York Yankees
when Manager
 &UR; Ray Miller pulled him into an adjacent bathroom to tell him he
would be starting in place of Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Minor, ``Does he know this?''
</P>
<P>
   Assured that Ripken was informed, Minor went 1 for 4 and played
flawlessly in the field. He even made a diving catch of a line
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to do too much, not make any errors,'' said
Minor, who is one of baseball's tallest infielders at 6 feet 6{.
``It turns out I had a pretty good game.''
</P>
<P>
   As he took the field, Minor turned back and looked into the
dugout, ``to make sure everybody was with me and that it wasn't a
joke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he was the center of attention, but said his
experience as a Sooners basketball player helped him. A 33rd-round
pick in baseball's June 1996 draft, Minor was drafted by
Philadelphia in the second round of the '96 NBA draft. He was cut
and played in the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   This was just Minor's second full season of professional
baseball, and he hopes to make a good impression this spring. He
has been playing a lot of first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes being a utility guy or playing a position I'm not
used to playing, I'll do it ,'' he said. ``I just have to work hard
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor is considered a top prospect, and there is talk he is
being groomed as Ripken's replacement. But if it doesn't work out,
he can always return to basketball. Here are two words to remember:
 &UR; Danny
 &UR; Ainge. &QL; 
Another one &QL; 
Since the Fall League began in 1992, at least one its alumni has
been named Rookie of the Year every season. The streak continued
last week when Oakland Athletics outfielder  &UR; Ben Grieve won
American League honors.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, who played for the Phoenix Desert Dogs in 1996, joins
 &UR; Mike
 &UR; Piazza (1993),  &UR; Bob Hamelin (1994),  &UR; Marty Cordova (1995),  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Hollandsworth (1996),  &UR; Derek Jeter (1996) and  &UR; Nomar Garciaparra
(1997).
</P>
<P>
   The second and third-place vote-getters in the AL, Tampa Bay
pitcher
 &UR; Rolando Arrojo and Chicago shortstop  &UR; Mike Caruso, also played in
the Fall League. So did Colorado first baseman  &UR; Todd Helton and
Diamondbacks first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee, runners-up to Cubs pitcher
 &UR; Kerry Wood in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   As a reminder that Fall League statistics often mislead, Grieve
hit a modest .277 with three home runs and 23 RBI in 40 games for
Phoenix. With the A's, Grieve hit .288, leading all major league
rookies in runs (94), hits (168), walks (85) and on-base percentage
(.386), and led all AL rookies in home runs (18) and RBI (89). &QL; 
Roster moves
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations to Toronto pitcher  &UR; Roy Halladay, who left the
Grand Canyon Rafters to go home to get married. In his second major
league game for the Blue Jays last season, Halladay came within one
out of a no-hitter. He was 4-0 with a 1.85 ERA for the Rafters. &QL;

SCOTTSDALE IRONMAN FINDS ADVENTURE ON ROAD IN MOROCCO  
 CHALLENGE COMPETITION BRINGS RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Dunn had never been on a camel until he arrived in
Essaouria, Morocco, the North Atlantic coastal town where the
Eco-Challenge began Oct. 6. That day dawned with camels to his
left. Camels to his right. The largest assembly of camels since
``Lawrence of Arabia'' was filmed more than 35 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they had Arabs riding on them (in the movie),'' Dunn
said. ``For this, they lined up 220 camels and said go, and there
were 220 camels going in 220 directions.'' The massive saddles
beneath many Eco-Challenge racers slipped under the camels'
bellies, making the animals unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   Team Epinephrine _ captain Paul Romero of Big Bear Lake, Calif.;
Dunn, of Scottsdale; Nick Moore of Palm Springs and Karen Lundgren
of San Bernardino, Calif. _ has excelled since Dunn and Moore were
cut off from Desert Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Picked by lottery as the 12th and final U.S. team allowed in the
55-team Eco-Challenge, Epinephrine finished eighth in one of the
top adventure races in the world. It has lined up a lucrative
sponsor for the coming year and expects to get plenty of air time
when Discovery Channel's coverage of the Eco-Challenge is broadcast
to 144 countries in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out after the race we were on their `A' list,'' Moore
said. ``In the 20-minute highlight video (to close Eco), we were
plastered all over the thing. We were just having a good time and
had a fun attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend of Desert Quest, Team Epinephrine, just back from
Morocco, placed fourth at the Hi-Tec Adventure Race series finale
in Los Angeles. It also was first in Portland, Ore., second in
Sacramento and next year will be compete as Team Hi-Tec, a coveted
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, said Dunn of his second Eco-Challenge, was
incomparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to see human beings going through pain and torture
and wondering why,'' Dunn said. ``It's amazing to see what the
human body can endure and keep going. I know people who did Desert
Quest and said that took me 18 hours, I couldn't imagine getting up
three hours later and doing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the drill at Eco-Challenge and Raid Gauloises, day
after day of numbing treks, climbs and rappels, divided in Morocco
by a 30-mile ride on Arab Barbary horses. All by navigation,
finding the way with map and compass.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we saw for six days was rock,'' Dunn said, 175 miles worth
that with the up-and-down represented 80,000-90,000 feet of total
elevation gain. ``I didn't know Morocco had mountains like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievably cold, wind 40 miles per hour, water
freezing in the bottle. We were just praying we'd get to the next
checkpoint so we could get off the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   After the nine-mile camel ride, the Eco-Challengers advanced
from three miles in full packs to a 48-mile kayak in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water was unbelievable,'' Dunn said. ``Major, major
swells. The biggest water I've ever seen in any race.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayakers were forced to shore from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., when the
ocean was ruled a dark zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could always see land, so there was this overwhelming
calm,'' Moore said. Right up until teams were given the option of
having one member swim to a checkpoint rather than fighting to
land. Moore, in a 10-second decision, accepted his duty as the
group's best swimmer to fight through waves rivaling those on
Hawaii's North Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Team Epinephrine completed the kayak in 24 hours and in 15th
place, up from 21st after the camel ride, and boarded a bus for the
nine-hour ride to the aptly named Atlas Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the way through, the team moved into sixth
place and then, briefly, into fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn developed an infected blister. Romero pulled a
quadricep muscle and injured the other while compensating. When the
110-mile mountain bike ride from Ali-n-Ito out of the mountains to
the finish at Marrakech began, Epinephrine was in ninth place and
on life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could walk faster than he (Romero) was moving (via bike),''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigging two bike tubes as a tow system, Moore, playing Superman,
started to pull Romero out the Moroccan equivalent of the Grand
Canyon. Then Dunn took a turn. They towed for four hours, covering
15 miles. ``I was ready to lay down and die,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Romero, a paramedic and pioneer of snowboard patrolling,
found his legs and was able to ride the top half of the canyon and
what became an 80-mile express from the rim to Marrakech and an
eighth-place finish in eight days, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many great teams and great athletes from all over
the world,'' said Moore, a 14th-place finisher in Eco Australia in
1997. ``To think about finishing in the top 10 is stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went there with a great attitude and let the race come to
us. We didn't make any big mistakes.'' &QL;

CZECH WILL BE MONEY PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He spoke not a word of English when he arrived in America last
Feb. 3 from the Czech Republic, a 17-year-old hockey player of vast
skills suddenly in a land of strange voices and customs.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he felt almost like an alien stranded on another
planet, an interloper unable to comprehend the labyrinth of roads
that pass for the L.A. freeway system.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't believe the frenzied pace of life that was such a
contrast to the slow-motion tempo of the land of his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything so much faster here,'' says Patrik Stefan, the Long
Beach Ice Dogs' teen-age prodigy. ``The cars. The people. The
places you go. Better. Better than my country. More opportunity.
More to do. I like it here. Long Beach. Beautiful. Great weather.
Nice people. Yes, I like it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Stefan is seated across from me at a restaurant table on
a recent evening, smiling shyly, a trademark expression for an
endearing fellow who dropped out of high school at 15{ to pursue a
sport that soon will make him a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his brief stay in this country, he has been able to
learn enough English to communicate his thoughts, and he does so in
a sincere manner bereft of the silly artificial poses favored by so
many of the U.S.-born athletes of his age category.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Stefan just might be the warmest gate attraction in the
International Hockey League the Ice Dogs' center has been second in
the league in scoring and he figures to be among the first five
players chosen in the NHL entry draft next June.
</P>
<P>
   And, if that weren't enough to make one envious, Stefan also is
extraordinarily handsome with movie-star features on a face
highlighted by a strong jaw and Paul Newman blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He's become a terror on the ice who's inspired comparisons to
Pittsburgh Penguins' All-Star Jaromir Jagr, but off it he's a
modest, humble, self-effacing man who's handling his sudden
celebrity with calm discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no change,'' says Stefan, who will perform with the Ice Dogs
in today's 4 p.m. match against the Las Vegas Thunder at the Long
Beach Arena. ``I got lot more to learn about hockey. I learn all
the time. I get better since I been in America, but I got long ways
to go. Long ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan would have been eligible for the NHL draft this year had
he been born a day earlier than Sept. 16, but he has no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good I play in IHL the entire season,'' he says.
``I'll be ready when times comes for me to play in the NHL. I still
have many things to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   He lives in an apartment on PCH near the Traffic Circle with
teammate Jan Nemecek, and spends his spare moments going to movies
and e-mailing friends in the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to movies all the time. ... that's where I learn to speak
English,'' he says. ``I like adventure movies, but also comedies. I
see `Waterboy.' Very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, an ex-hockey player himself, started teaching
him the fine points of the game when Stefan was a mere 7. And his
father Karel, who's in town for a month, took over supervising
Stefan's career when the grandfather moved to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Stefan put up some impressive numbers during his career
in the Czech Republic, scoring 484 points (330 goals and 154
assists) in 327 games.
</P>
<P>
   He says there were strained feelings back home when he bolted
Sparta Praha earlier this year to play for the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I felt I must do to make it in the NHL,'' he
says. ``Hockey here is much different. The players are bigger and
stronger and faster. The game is so much faster.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, John Van Boxmeer, envisions a bright NHL future for
Stefan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrik is very mature for his age and works extremely hard,''
says Van Boxmeer. ``He has all the physical tools, and is strong on
the puck. He's a very instinctive player, and isn't afraid to mix
it up. I said before the season that I think by the end of it he
will be the elite player in the IHL. I still think that way. He
just gets better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, Patrik Stefan has the proper
physical equipment, but he also has the proper mental outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he's human. He admits he's finding it difficult to resist
all the temptations that go with being young, rich, handsome and
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no girlfriend yet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to return to the classroom in the off-season to get the
equivalent of a high school degree, but college isn't on the
horizon for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No time. ... I plan to play hockey for a long time,'' he
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the restaurateur, Phil Trani, comes to the table and
beseeches Patrik Stefan to sign his famed Wall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Stefan walks into Trani's kitchen, and sees all the signatures
of athletic personalities on the walls and shakes his head softly
when he's informed who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure you want my name up there?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' replies Trani, handing Stefan a pen. ``I think
one day you'll be as famous as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudgingly, Patrik Stefan writes in flawless English a few
commendatory words and affixes his signature.
</P>
<P>
   The kid, indeed, is precocious.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Stefan has been in this country for only 10 months, and
his penmanship already is vastly superior to that of most American
citizens.

DEVILS UNLIMITED FIRES BOTH BARRELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. - It has long been my belief that hunting would be
more sporting if the animals could shoot back.
</P>
<P>
   We have the right to bear arms. Why not arm bears?
</P>
<P>
   If you're unclear what any of this has to do with the Arizona
State football team maybe you didn't hear the latest. On a gray
chilly afternoon, amid's autumn's red-gold glow _ Duck hunting
weather _ the Oregon Ducks reversed the roles. The hunted became
the hunters, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who had lost three in a row to the Sun Devils and
grown tired of being an easy target, came out blasting Saturday.
They let the visitors have it with both barrels. One barrel goes by
the name Akili; the other Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith threw and threw and threw. Reloading, he kept firing
away until he had four touchdowns (to wide open receivers) and
almost 400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's offense scored on its first four possessions. Smith was
accurate. Elusive. Relentless. It was as if, in Oregon's eyes, the
ASU secondary represented every sportsman who ever put on a plaid
flannel shirt and an Elmer Fudd cap and oiled the old 12-gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ASU had no cover. No place to hide. At times it looked as if the
Ducks had 12 players on offense. Someone, it seemed, was always
open.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils knew it was over late in the third quarter _ if not
long before _ when they fumbled their second kickoff return and a
Duck named Mallard _ honest _ recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' supply of ammo seemed almost as inexhaustible as this
hunting analogy. Bottom line: Ducks Unlimited prevailed, 51-19. The
Devils, after winning three in a row, sank to 5-5. This overrated
team that began the season ranked among the nation's Top 10 won't
be going to a bowl unless the Devils beat rival Arizona in their
annual spleen-vent the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   If ASU's plan was to lull UA into a feeling of overconfidence
the Devils may have succeeded. ASU lost to Oregon by 32 points.
Oregon lost to Arizona by 35. The Wildcats won't be 67-point
favorites, but if they can beat their state brethren by that
margin, they will.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder called the UA game a ``one-game season.'' Sadly, it
has come to that. If the Devils find a way to win in Tucson they
can salvage a measure of respect and feel better about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But they can't win without Ryan Kealy. They can't win without a
healthy J.R. Redmond. Kealy didn't play against the Ducks. After
sitting out two games, Redmond returned to the backfield and
sprinted 57 yards for a touchdown on his first carry.
</P>
<P>
   In the end zone J.R. playfully pointed to his suspect ankle as
if to tell the crowd, many of them tooting duck calls, that he is
fine, just fine, fully recovered from a sprain. Fact is, he still
isn't healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Steve Campbell did an adequate job in only his second
start. At 6-foot-8, Campbell is America's tallest quarterback and
off the field he was the easiest player for the Oregon media to
identify. The drubbing over, a TV guy held up a microphone and
asked Campbell if he had ``fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell fought the urge to wrap his hands around the
questioner's throat and lift him to eye level. ``Fun? It was
51-19,'' he said, as if that said it all, which it should. ``No, it
wasn't too much damn fun. I'd rather sit on the bench and us win
than play and get beat by thirty-something points . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell felt embarrassed. So did the Devils defense. Cornerback
Courtney Jackson and his teammates spent the long day back on their
heels, in retreat. Members of the secondary may have felt as if
they were wearing ASU mascot Sparky's costume, the one with orange
flames licking up his pants legs. Smith burned them early, and
often. ASU gave up 493 yards. Jackson conceded that Smith created
``a little bit of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   When the gun mercifully sounded, Snyder jogged to midfield,
shook Oregon coach Mike Bellotti's hand without breaking stride and
then looked for Smith. The ASU coach had nothing to say to
Bellotti, who earlier in the week suggested the Sun Devils are
guilty of intentionally chop blocking. This was akin to a doctor
going to the media and saying that a fellow physician is committing
medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder congratulated Smith. Wished him well. Then he retreated
to the inner sanctum of his locker room and told his team _ what?
</P>
<P>
   What does a coach say after a game like this? &QL;

NO SUNSHINE FOR ASU IN OREGON  
 DRUBBING DROPS DEVILS TO .500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Like the foliage surrounding Auzten Stadium,
Arizona State showed its true colors Saturday. It wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon manhandled ASU, 51-19, in front of 43,723. The Sun Devils
couldn't wait to make like a tree and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the loss were huge:
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (5-5, 4-3 Pac-10) must beat Arizona in their
regular-season finale to be eligible for a bowl game. Keep in mind
this is a Wildcats team that destroyed Oregon, 38-3, two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ASU is in danger of its first losing season since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose (against Arizona), we put the pads away and don't
take them out until spring,'' cornerback Courtney Jackson said.
``Who wants that?''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was ASU's worst since a 77-28 defeat by Nebraska in
1995 and Coach Bruce Snyder's second-worst at ASU. The 493 yards
were the most the Sun Devils have allowed this season.
</P>
<P>
   ASU played without quarterback Ryan Kealy and with a tailback,
J.R. Redmond, still limited because of an ankle injury. Had both
been 100 percent, it probably wouldn't have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon still had quarterback Akili Smith, who was a one-man
wrecking crew. He completed 21 of 30 passes for 397 yards and four
touchdowns. He threw three in the first 10 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about him,'' Snyder said. ``I really admire
him. This is clearly his football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' defense wasn't up to the task, especially in the
first half. The line wasn't able to put any significant pressure on
Smith, and the rest of the defense appeared to have trouble
adjusting to Smith's play-making abilities.
</P>
<P>
   When he scrambled, look out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the worst thing you could do is cut him off,''
Jackson said. ``Because then he improvises and scrambles. It would
result in a little bit of chaos between the linebackers and
cornerbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said, ``We're playing a lot of young guys, but it is the
10th game of the season. We have to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   The ineptness of ASU's defense was summed up in a fourth-quarter
drive, highlighted by a 55-yard pass play involving Oregon's
6-foot-4, 245-pound tight end Jed Weaver. He escaped the grasp of
four Sun Devils before being pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Just when ASU appeared to get a handle on the drive, it was
tagged for two pass-interference plays in the end zone. Ultimately,
Herman Ho-Ching carried it in for a 2-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The game was billed as ``Chop-gate'' because of Oregon Coach
Mike Bellotti's comments early in the week accusing the Sun Devils'
offensive line of chop-blocking. But it was never an issue in the
game and other then a few flare-ups, emotions were kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and Bellotti even briefly shook hands after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a pretty clean game,'' Oregon defensive tackle
Masi Heamish said. ``I had fun and I think those guys had fun,
except for losing.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU's offense couldn't do much either. Senior Steve Campbell,
starting in place of Kealy, was solid but not spectacular,
completing 11 of 24 passes for 217 yards and a touchdown. He seemed
poised for only his second career start.
</P>
<P>
   And confidence was clearly not a problem. At one point, with the
crowd roaring, he waved his arms to encourage fans to be louder,
then put his hand to his ear, suggesting he couldn't hear them.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan was to run the ball, but the Sun Devils rethought
their strategy at halftime because the Ducks' front seven was
effective at stopping them. They opened up the passing game in the
second half but it didn't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond carried 10 times for 72 yards. Backup Davaren Hightower
managed just 29. Gerald Green didn't play because of a shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out about 80 percent,'' Redmond said. ``I didn't have
full range of motion.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like that the first time he was handed the ball
after being sidelined for two games. He sprinted 57 yards upfield
and into the end zone and tied the score at 7.
</P>
<P>
   But Oregon bounced right back with touchdown passes of 22 and 35
yards to LaCorey Collins and Damon Griffin, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The second was set up by Lenzie Jackson's fumble of a kickoff
return. Oregon took over at ASU's 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we lost was a surprise,'' Campbell said. ``Any time
you get your butt handed to you, it's a surprise.'' &QL;

K-STATE TRUMPS NEBRASKA  
 UNBEATEN WILDCATS END 29 YEARS OF FUTILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ They started digging the hole for KSU Stadium
in the late 1960s, figuring, as one longtime resident of the
``Little Apple'' put it, that if this football deal didn't work
out, they could always fill the thing with silage.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such backup plans now.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still didn't believe that Kansas State has arrived
as a national power, the second-ranked Wildcats proved it Saturday
by defeating 11th-ranked Nebraska, 40-30.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day that bathed the purple-clad crowd of 44,298 in
sunlight, the Wildcats (10-0) not only furthered their chance of
playing in the Fiesta Bowl for a national championship, but they
cleansed themselves of a demon that has haunted the program for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State hadn't beaten Nebraska (8-3) since 1968. The
futility streak since then had spanned 29 games and six presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm humbled by it, honestly, just because of the amount of
time it's taken to do this,'' said Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder,
who has directed the biggest transformation since Dr. Frankenstein
took off his lab coat for good.
</P>
<P>
   It is unchartered territory for the fans of this school in the
Flint Hills two hours west of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know how to react Saturday, and their attempts at
celebrating near the end of the game are sure to spawn numerous
Aggie jokes.
</P>
<P>
   When linebacker Jeff Kelly returned a fumble 23 yards for a
touchdown to give the Wildcats a 40-30 lead with three seconds
left, students flowed onto the field like spilled grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   They were ordered back to the sidelines by the public address
announcer, but after quarterback Michael Bishop's two-point
conversion attempt failed, the crowd rushed the field again,
thinking the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, the announcer ordered them off. When Nebraska was
stopped on the ensuing kickoff, the crowd poured onto the field for
good and began trying to remove the north goal post, and after
considerable effort, finally busted it off.
</P>
<P>
   The victory assures Kansas State of an appearance in the Big 12
title game Dec. 5 in St. Louis against Texas A&AMP;M. It would be the
Wildcats' first conference title since 1934, when they won the Big
Six championship.
</P>
<P>
   It also kept alive their hopes of a return trip to the Fiesta
Bowl, where they beat Syracuse last year. This season, the Fiesta
Bowl will match the two top teams in the country as determined by
the Bowl Championship Series formula, which has the Wildcats ranked
third behind fellow unbeaten teams Tennessee and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that if we lost this game, people were going to call
us flukes and start disrespecting us,'' said defensive end Joe Bob
Clements, a senior from Emporia, Kan. ``I've watched Nebraska
pummel Kansas State for years and years. I'm glad I never had to
look back and say, `I wish I could have did this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was far from easy, however, and the final score is deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Kansas State appeared intent on bungling this chance,
too. Nebraska went 80 yards in eight plays on its opening drive to
take a 7-0 lead. Bishop fumbled five times in the first half,
losing three of them, two of which led to 10 points by Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers took a 14-7 lead early in the second quarter
after freshman quarterback Eric Crouch threw a 45-yard touchdown
pass to receiver Kenny Cheatham, a senior from South Mountain High
School, who made an amazing one-handed grab.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, however, brought the Wildcats back all day. He threw for
306 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 140 yards and two more.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas State took a 24-17 lead in the third quarter, it
looked as if the game had finally turned in its favor. The Wildcats
allowed Nebraska to gain just 15 yards in the third quarter, and
Kansas State's offense was moving at will.
</P>
<P>
   That changed quickly when Wildcats running back Frank Murphy,
playing for an injured Eric Hickson, fumbled, and Nebraska's Ralph
Brown returned it 74 yards for a touchdown to tie the score at 24
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska scored to go ahead, 30-27, in the fourth quarter, but
Bishop brought the Wildcats back again.
</P>
<P>
   On his team's final scoring drive, Bishop entered the huddle
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bishop) said, `We're going to go down and score, and then I'm
going to help the fans tear down the goal posts,' '' said receiver
Darnell McDonald, who caught 12 passes for 183 yards and two
touchdowns, including an 11-yarder that gave Kansas State a 34-30
lead.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know Bishop's version of the events because Snyder
hasn't allowed him to speak with the media for the last month, with
the exception of an ESPN interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska wasn't quite done. But in the closing minutes, Crouch
was sacked by linebacker Travis Ochs, who appeared to take Crouch
down by the face mask. There was no call.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch said he thought it was a penalty. Ochs probably did, too,
although he wasn't admitting it after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around on the floor, didn't see a flag and went on my
merry way,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska got the ball back in time for one more play. But Crouch
was hit by Clements, and Kelly picked up the fumble, returning it
for the final score, placing an exclamation point on this piece of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years of history passed,'' said Kansas State tight end
Justin Swift. ``We swept it away.'' &QL;

CAN'T BLAME FANS FOR FRENZY  
 BIG WINS A RARITY FOR CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - What the stiff-necked geeks in the NFL office _
the party patrol that's not phat and happy _ never understood about
the Cardinal fans' victory lap was that it was spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   There were no clandestine meetings or huddles in the stands to
map out a parade route.
</P>
<P>
   This was spur-of-the-moment bedlam, years of bent-up frustration
of watching the Dallas Cowboys and their fans come into Sun Devil
Stadium, talk trash, back it up and leave stoked.
</P>
<P>
   The wild scene that ensued after the Cardinals ended a 13-game
losing streak against the Cowboys last season was understandable.
After all, can you name the last big victory in the Cardinals' 100
years before Kevin Butler banked a 20-yard field goal off the left
upright and through for a 25-22 overtime win?
</P>
<P>
   Don't give us the 1947 NFL title game, the last time the
Cardinals won in the playoffs. That was before MTV and sports-talk
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, the Cardinals rallied from a 28-point deficit
to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31-28, the biggest comeback in
team history. But who cares? It improved the Cardinals' record to
3-5.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, they moved to the desert and shocked the world.
Coach Gene Stallings called a fake field goal in the home opener
against Dallas, and a ``Monday Night Football'' audience watched in
disbelief as the first half ended on a feeble rushing attempt by
kicker Al Del Greco.
</P>
<P>
   From Del Greco's debacle to today's NFC East first-place
showdown against the Cowboys at Sun Devil Stadium, there have been
few BIG games in 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive the Cardinals and their fans if they get excited
about the Outback Steakhouse Madden Cruiser being parked in our
little burg this weekend. It doesn't happen very often.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cardinals stun the Cowboys two years in a row, the
fuddy-duddies who get a kick out of fining players for too much
eye-black shouldn't spank the locals for bad behavior. Folks might
even run onto the field to see the freshly planted winter rye.
</P>
<P>
   They promise to stay a way from the $3,000-a-piece goal posts.
They have set their sights bigger this year. Remember fan Doug
Hustin of Mesa's proclamation after last year's win: ``Next year,
we're taking down the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Just try, say the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't the Fiesta Bowl,'' Cowboys offensive guard Nate
Newton said. &QL; 
Marching down Mill &QL; 
The post-game party could have been wilder after last year's Dallas
win.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the fans hoisting the north goal post on their
shoulders, carrying it out of the stadium and down Tempe's Fifth
Street to Mill Avenue, where it was thrown off a bridge into the
Salt River bed, they could have celebrated the way Arizona State
fans did a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ASU students, giddy over beating Nebraska, tore down a goal
post, marched it across campus, through the student recreation
center and dropped it into a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals rookie safety Pat Tillman, a seventh-round pick from
ASU, played in the victory over the Huskers and was on the field
when the fans climbed out of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he had just finished a film session in ASU's
Intercollegiate Athletics Building, which overlooks Sun Devil
Stadium, when Butler's game-winner caused Cardinals' fans to go
berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like when Kennedy was shot, where you remember
exactly where you were at the time,'' Tillman said, ``but it
obviously was a huge win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals trailed, 22-7, in the third quarter. But they
rallied for two touchdowns, including a 1-yard pass from Kent
Graham to tight end Pat Carter with 1:06 left in regulation. Graham
hit wide receiver Rob Moore for a two-point conversion to send the
game in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas recovered a fumble early in overtime, but then running
back Sherman Williams fumbled the ball back after a hit by middle
linebacker Ronald McKinnon. Cardinals outside linebacker Terry
Irving recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hot, and I was under the pile cramping up,'' Irving
said. ``I wanted to get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Completions of 19 yards to Moore and 29 yards to fullback Larry
Centers set up Butler's kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great feeling, exhilarating,'' linebacker Jamir
Miller said. ``But after that, we didn't win (another) game for six
weeks, so it defeated the whole purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he watched the stands empty but never saw the goal
post come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran off the field,'' he said. ``It was kind of rough out
there. It was a nice atmosphere, but not one for players to be
standing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham, a Denton, Texas, native, found his family
in the stands and waved to make sure everyone was OK. He celebrated
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid growing up (near) Dallas, being a Cowboys fan, having
the draft come around and having them pass on a hometown kid left a
bad taste in my mouth,'' said Graham, a fourth-round pick of the
Cardinals in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials, seeing the goal post come tumbling down on
national TV, phoned Sun Devil Stadium director Tom Sadler the day
after the game. They weren't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happens on Saturdays (in college games), the
prevailing mentality is that these are students,'' said Sadler, now
assistant athletic director at ASU. ``On Sundays, it's more of a
business. After talking to the league, we all agreed that it's
something that can't be tolerated. Can you imagine if it became a
habit?'' &QL; 
Beating the best &QL; 
The Cardinals' first big victory in the Valley of the Sun was one
of their unlikeliest.
</P>
<P>
   They trailed eventual Super Bowl-champion San Francisco, 23-0,
in the third quarter in November 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a mass exodus going on in the third quarter,'' said
former Cardinals running back Ron Wolfley, now a talk-show host on
KMVP-AM (860) radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just out of total defiance, I was yelling at the crowd,
`You're going to miss the greatest comeback in NFL history.' I'll
be doggone if it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite giving up 17 unanswered points in the third and fourth
quarter, the 49ers still seemed to have the game in hand until
linebacker E.J. Junior stopped quarterback Steve Young inches short
of a first down with 1:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Neil Lomax directed the Cardinals, who had no
timeouts, 66 yards in seven plays, the game-tying score coming on a
9-yard pass to wide receiver Roy Green with three seconds left. Del
Greco's extra point gave the Cardinals a 24-23 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place went nuts and (49ers coach) Bill Walsh was just
crushed,'' Wolfley said. &QL; 
The victory left the Cardinals at 6-4. They beat the New York
Giants the next week to move into a tie for first place in the NFC
East, but they never won again that season.
</P>
<P>
   Lomax suffered a career-ending injury and the Cardinals lost
five straight. &QL; 
Holiday heartbreak &QL; 
Coach Buddy Ryan's Cardinals entered the 1994 season finale on
Christmas Eve in Atlanta knowing they needed the Cowboys to beat
the New York Giants for any chance of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had beaten Cincinnati the previous week to go 8-7,
the first time they had been over .500 that late in the season
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited,'' said former Cardinals linebacker Garth
Jax, now a member of the team's front office. ``Never before in my
career had I experienced such an opportunity to go to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But with about three minutes remaining, the players learned that
the Giants had won, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to watch the scoreboard,'' defensive tackle
Bernard Wilson said. ``I wasn't concerned about their game. There
was nothing I could do about somebody else winning or losing. But
late in the fourth quarter, the bad news came through that the
Giants had won.''
</P>
<P>
   All wasn't lost. The Cardinals still had a chance to post the
first winning record in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But three times they were inside Atlanta's 10-yard line and
didn't score, including a failed run by Ronald Moore from the
1-yard line on the game's final play. The Cardinals were held to
only two Greg Davis field goals and lost, 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that last play, Larry Centers was sitting on the
sideline,'' Jax said. ``They put in a guy (Moore) who wasn't the
best in the league, and he got stalemated at the goal line. I don't
know who was the play-caller of the day that day, but we had the
thing in the bag and didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's decision to have Moore, not known for his leaping
ability, to try to dive into the end zone was questioned by several
players and typified a season of offensive frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the game, Ryan informed quarterback Steve
Beuerlein and wide receiver Ricky Proehl that they wouldn't be back
with the team next year. Beuerlein went to Jacksonville in the
expansion draft and Proehl was traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the flight home, we waited until Ronnie Jones, our
defensive coordinator, had a couple of `coffees,' and went up to
him to see if we would be part of the team next year,'' Jax said. &QL;

LEAF MAKING CARDS' DECISION LOOK GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He could have been the Cardinals' headache, the rookie spitball
throwing quarterback who pours beer and makes obscene gestures at
former Washington State classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cardinals traded down one spot in last year's draft
and bypassed picking Ryan Leaf, benched by the San Diego Chargers
today for bad behavior, leaving his career in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up is hard to to do,'' said Bobby Beathard, Chargers
general manager. ``But he doesn't have any choice but to do it. A
whole career could be crumbling if he doesn't wise up and
understand he isn't handling things the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't make the mammoth deal that brought them
rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth, wide receiver Eric Metcalf,
linebacker Patrick Sapp and San Diego's first-round pick in 1999
because they feared Leaf was a boor. They did it because they
believed in then-rookie quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL officials thought the Cardinals blew it at the time,
questioning them for not taking a ``franchise quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Few are doubting the Cardinals now, not after Leaf's latest
night of terror in Pullman, Wash., 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers reported that Leaf threw beer on two
students, made obscene gestures at others, was thrown out of two
establishments and banned from a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty drunk when he came in,'' Washington State senior
Nicole Sanders said of the Coog Bar. ``I was at the window looking
at him when he was standing outside (after being asked to leave),
and he and his buddies were flipping us off and spitting at the
window. They were saying that we had no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what Leaf said to a friend was, ``Let's get out of
here. These guys aren't worth it. I can buy and sell all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Leaf cursed a TV cameraman and a newspaper
reporter in separate incidents and made an obscene gesture to a
reporter after the reporter said, ``Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a term of endearment,'' Leaf said at the time, adding
that he didn't care ``what people think of me. I want respect from
the people I respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers have been so concerned about Leaf's behavior, they
talked to Leaf's family, to Washington State Coach Mike Price and
to Leaf's agent, Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf doesn't think he has a problem. He thinks he just has the
type of personality that he doesn't make friends easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that I'm not a (very likable guy),'' Leaf said. ``But
you don't have to be. When you run around and get beat up and beat
people up for a living, I don't think that's a very likable thing.
Not everyone is going to like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rypien, former Washington State and NFL quarterback, thinks
Leaf needs to take responsibility for his actions. ``He's in
denial,'' Rypien said. ``It's like some of my relatives who are
alcoholics, the hardest thing is getting them to admit `I need
help.' Maybe that's the hardest part for him. I'm in his corner. I
want to be in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs someone who is gone through the same thing, and,
brother, I've been through it all 10 times worse. They were just
waiting to get rid of me in Washington two years after going to the
Super Bowl. They said I was the only guy who could overthrow
Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to help, and, maybe Ryan just needs someone to
listen. Whatever, I know this, how he handles the situation will
determine how long he lasts in the NFL.'' &QL; 
Preseason sorely missed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Gale Sayers thinks he knows why Bears rookie
Curtis Enis has joined ex-Cardinal Garrison Hearst, Ki-Jana Carter
and Tim Biakabatuka as the fourth running back taken in the top 10
of the draft to suffer a serious knee injury his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   Enis tore his anterior cruciate ligament last week and will miss
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel it all goes back to missing training camp,''
said Sayers, the former Bears running back. ``So many people say,
`I can play pro football. It's just like college football.' It is
not. Everybody's bigger and stronger and faster. Those linebackers
you ran over in college you can't do it in pro football.'' &QL; 
Hit for a loss &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How much havoc can one penalty cause?
</P>
<P>
   First, Washington's Patrice Alexander, making his first
appearance of the season, was cut after being called for holding 10
yards behind the play, nullifying kickoff returner Brian Mitchell's
touchdown against the Cardinals a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a Fredericksburg, Va., woman acknowledged she was going to
win a free car if Mitchell returned the opening kickoff for a score
as a the result of a contest sponsored by the Redskins radio
network.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, by the way, was furious that he was released, feeling
he is a scapegoat. &QL; 
Surprise appearance &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Indianapolis Colts teammate was so startled that third-string
quarterback Paul Justin was in the game last week against
Jacksonville, he asked Justin, ``What are you doing in here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I just ran out here and nobody told me to come
in,'' said Justin, the former Arizona State product.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was kidding, but he hadn't played since the preseason
finale on Aug. 28 at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He did well. He completed 7 of 10 throws for 107 yards and one
score in his fourth-quarter appearance. &QL; 
Ultimate long shot &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fiedler, the only healthy quarterback on the Minnesota
Vikings' roster, spent last fall coaching wide receivers at Hofstra
University.
</P>
<P>
   He was the No. 3 quarterback on the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994
and '95, released by Cincinnati in training camp in 1996 and a
member of the Amsterdam Admirals of the World League the following
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great and a lot of ups and downs. Right now, my
roller coaster is riding up to the top,'' Fiedler said. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Dallas, 0-4 in NFC East road games last year, can complete a 4-0
division sweep by beating the Cardinals today at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nov. 2, 1997, Atlanta has the same record as the 49ers at
13-4. The two teams play today for the division lead.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos defensive tackle Keith Traylor, an ex-Chief, thinks
Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer, whose team is on a
four-game losing streak, is in trouble if he loses Monday to
Denver. ``I really think if we go in and beat 'em, then they'll
fold and that'll be the end of Marty,'' Traylor said. &QL;

MCALISTER, DOUGLAS SLUG IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ It was the heavyweight battle within the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cornerback  &UR; Chris McAlister versus California receiver
 &UR; Damaene
 &UR; Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas got three of his six receptions against McAlister. But
McAlister walked away feeling like the winner. And, in the most
important way, he was, by virtue of Arizona's 27-23 victory
Saturday at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always expect a good receiver to catch a couple,'' said
McAlister, who blocked a punt that set up Arizona's initial TD in
the first quarter. ``I go into any game intending to shut a guy
out. But it doesn't usually happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly a lot of trash-talk between the two throughout
a game marked by personal fouls and a record number of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the talk,'' McAlister said. ``I enjoy it. It keeps me
on my toes. It makes me mentally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister had evident respect for Douglas, who set a Cal record
of 182 receptions, three shy of the Pac-10 record. But he would not
say that Douglas was the best receiver he has faced. &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
The combined total for penalty yards was 307, breaking the
California record of 283. ``Both coaches probably wish some plays
could have been done over,'' Arizona coach  &UR; Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona defensive back coach  &UR; Duane Akina says he was told by a
Dallas Cowboys scout that McAlister is the best cornerback he's
seen this season.
</P>
<P>
   A reason  &UR; Ortege Jenkins likes to called OJ: A Bay Area
publication listed him as Cortege Junkins. &QL;

ARIZONA DODGES CALIFORNIA JINX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Arizona started playing football at the turn
of the century. The last one.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats didn't wear helmets or go 10-1 in those days. They
put on helmets sometime after the horse and buggy gave way to the
charter flight as the mode of transport to road games.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of everything changed in nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change of all happened Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats beat the millennium and California, 27-23, for
their first 10-1 record ever.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   At times, in fact, it was downright ugly as the Wildcats
struggled against a stubborn California defense, a yellow blizzard
of penalty flags and all the other assorted hobgoblins, hangnails
and hoodoos that always seem to await them at the Strawberry Canyon
setting for old Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Arizona (6-1 in the Pac-10) prevailed in what
could be their best season in this century and the last.
</P>
<P>
   After it was all over, Arizona Coach Dick Tomey was asked to
look ahead. He was asked how he might feel about his surprising
team one day while sitting in a rocking chair, presumably sometime
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, I don't plan to ever be in a rocking chair,'' said
the characteristically understating Tomey, whose 1993 team also won
10 games but had two losses before it reached that mark. ``I'll
just think about what a tremendous group of kids these are.''
</P>
<P>
   Tremendous might be a little hard to define. Resilient is not.
Above all, that is what defines these Wildcats, who are No. 9 in
the Associated Press poll and still a Rose Bowl possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Cal repeatedly threatened in the late moments. It was as if the
Bears were setting the stage for an encore of their
quadruple-overtime victory on this same field in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to celebrate,'' said Arizona quarterback Keith
Smith, who played throughout the second half as Tomey abandoned the
usual combination with Ortege Jenkins. ``There would be no
celebration until the last second came off that clock.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Smith's caution was wise.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona took control by scoring early in the third quarter
and again in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, it was running back Trung Canidate at his
explosive best. He raced for a 54-yard touchdown, his fourth of 45
yards or more over the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Arizona's touchdown was set up by a penalty, one
en route to a dubious Cal record of 154 yards. On fourth down and
inches to a first at the Cal 22, Bears linebacker Albert Dorsey
jumped offside.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, Smith tossed a 17-yard strike to Brad Brennan,
who was alone in a corner of the end zone. On the subsequent
conversion, Smith ran to the spot that Brennan had just vacated.
</P>
<P>
   The two-point conversion was important. It could been pivotal,
because Cal (5-5, 3-4 Pac 10) threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth, the Bears countered Canidate's touchdown
with with a 25-yard scoring strike from Justin Vedder to Marcus
Fields.
</P>
<P>
   Then receiver Damaene Douglas interrupted his trash-talking
exchange with Chris McAlister by taking a handoff on an apparent
reverse. He stopped, faked a pass and ran nine yards before leaping
into the end zone. But Ignacio Brache's kick for the extra point
was wide. The Wildcats held a four-point advantage with 3:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona emerged with a 12-10 lead from a first half that was
marked by stubborn defensive stands and 13 penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats place-kicker Mark McDonald provided the narrow
advantage with a career best 45-yard field goal during the half's
final 10 seconds. The beautiful kick came about 17 seconds after
Cal led, 10-9, on a 41-yard field goal by Brache.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders set up Arizona's only touchdown before halftime. Chris
McAlister blocked a punt that was picked up by A.J. Brown and
carried to the Cal 12. Three plays later, Arizona scored on an
8-yard pass from Smith to Jeremy McDaniel. &QL;

DOCKSIDE CUSTOMS INSPECTION A ONE-MAN OPERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HUENEME, Calif. _ There's a buzz of activity dockside as a
platoon of forklifts scurry about, hauling crates of bananas fresh
off the boat from Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, three Filipino crewmen stand next to the imposing Dutch
cargo ship, waiting for Christopher King, the sole U.S. Customs
officer at the Port of Hueneme in Ventura County northwest of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   An affable and easygoing man of 51, King scans the customs
declarations and asks what each of the crewmen is bringing ashore.
After a quick search of their belongings, the trio hops an airport
shuttle, the first leg of their trip home to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brethren working at larger ports, King is a
jack-of-all-trades. A typical day might find him examining
automobile import documents, peering into a British armored
personnel carrier purchased by a collector or conducting spot
checks on imported fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Or sometimes, he's just waiting for his next boat to come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars and bananas _ that's the nature of the port,'' King said.
``There are times when you're very busy. Then there are times when
you're the Maytag repairman.''
</P>
<P>
   BMWs, Volvos, Jaguars, Mazdas and Australian-built Mitsubishis
bound for the Southern California car market all arrive through the
Port of Hueneme, accounting for about 9 percent of autos imported
through the West Coast, according to the Pacific Maritime
Association.
</P>
<P>
   While autos, fruit and wood pulp account for most of the port's
shipping activity, it also gets a steady stream of unusual and
one-of-a-kind vehicles _ from rare sports cars to military tanks.
</P>
<P>
   One of King's jobs is to ensure that imported goods, be they
pineapples or tractors, are properly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job requires that I do many facets of the customs
inspector's position, as opposed to the specialized duties at
larger ports,'' said King, who has been a customs agent for 25
years, the last three at Port Hueneme. ``So I do a full gamut of
operations that some inspectors may never get a chance to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last August, for example, King inspected a Czechoslovakian-made
Scud missile and launcher destined for a collector. Although the
37-foot, 5-ton missile system was not loaded with rocket fuel or
armed with a warhead, it had not been rendered inoperable before
coming into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still operational, which is a no-no,'' said U.S.
Customs spokesman Pat Jones, the point man for information on the
sensitive case, which is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   When he's not intercepting Scuds, King also keeps an eye out for
other contraband. Drug-smuggling through the port is rare, he said,
possibly because incoming shipments of South and Central American
fruit isn't assigned a final destination until it hits the docks,
making it nearly impossible for would-be dealers to know where to
pick up the narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only drug case during King's tenure at Port of
Hueneme involved a completely unsophisticated attempt by a crew
member who tried to walk ashore carrying drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Hueneme is the fourth largest among California's 12
ports, last year handling 319 ships, said Cam Quarles, director of
marketing for the Oxnard Harbor District.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the 3,655 passing through Long Beach and
the 2,569 ships that docked at the Port of Los Angeles. Customs has
156 agents assigned to the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports,
reflecting their designation as the third-busiest operation in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Customs Service operates several one-man stations
around the country, King runs the only one-person operation at a
major port. And while he likes to describe himself as the Maytag
man in reference to the ads' lonely appliance repairman, his is
hardly the slowest customs station around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a one-hour-a-day, part-time employee in Avila Beach
(in San Luis Obispo County). Customs pays the gentleman up there
one hour per day to take care of whatever customs business might
come his way,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs violations at Port of Hueneme are few and far between.
Once in a while, King will run across a stolen car destined for
points overseas or mislabeled fruit shipments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best parts of the job _ aside from pretty much being
his own boss _ is inspecting the variety of previously owned
vehicles that go in and out of the port.
</P>
<P>
   Someone's dream car _ a 1984 Citroen _ sits abandoned not far
from a screaming yellow fire engine that once doused blazes in
London. This is the end of the road for the Citroen, which was not
built to U.S. specifications. The owner abandoned it at the dock
rather than putting in a small fortune to make it legal. Its new
owner, the U.S. Customs Service, will auction it off _ provided the
car heads overseas or is brought up to standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different mental attitude _ working in L.A. County vs.
working in Ventura County,'' said King, who took a pay cut to get
the one-man position. ``I think people have more time to be
pleasant in this atmosphere. This is a very comfortable, relaxed
placed to be, and I'm happy to be here.''

PAT KICKER QUITS OVER SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Arizona State kicker  &UR; Mike Gauthier quit the team
Friday after learning the Sun Devils had received an oral
commitment from a standout local kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, a redshirt freshman who handled extra points, spoke
with Sun Devils Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder Friday after learning that
Mountain Pointe's  &UR; Mike Barth said he would sign with ASU.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 205-pound Barth originally committed to California
but changed his mind and said he wants to play for the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ASU had to scramble Friday to get a second kicker to back up
 &UR; Stephen Baker for Saturday's game against Oregon. Walk-on  &UR; John
 &UR; Nicassio, a junior from Agoura, Calif., flew to Eugene on Friday
night to join his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Baker handled all kicking and punting Saturday. He made ASU's
only extra-point attempt and connected on 2 of 3 field-goal
attempts. &QL; 
Heap of talent &QL; 
The Sun Devils had few bright spots, but tight end  &UR; Todd Heap was
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman had a career high four catches for 99 yards and was
the team's leading receiver.
</P>
<P>
   He made several big plays, including catching a 33-yard pass
late in the game that set up ASU's final touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a 45-yard catch that led to a Baker 46-yard field
goal in the second quarter and a 15-yard reception that set up
Baker's 22-yard kick in the first. &QL; 
Teammate support &QL; 
 &UR; Steve Campbell said one of his biggest supporters in recent weeks
has been quarterback  &UR; Chad Elliott. Campbell was selected over
Elliott to start in place of the injured  &UR; Ryan Kealy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad's got a bad rap,'' Campbell said. ``He's been real good
about it and happy for me when I play. In fact, he was probably
more on the emotional side than any of the other quarterbacks.
(After Campbell's performance against California), he was asking me
more about the feeling and stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real nice kid and well-liked on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott played a bit in the fourth quarter, completing 5 of 8
passes for 24 yards. &QL; 
Smith backer &QL; 
 &UR; Akili Smith has a supporter in ASU cornerback  &UR; Courtney Jackson,
who respects the Oregon quarterback for more than just his playing
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it's just nice to see a Black quarterback succeed
against the stereotypes often associated with Black quarterbacks:
They're too short, their arm's not strong enough, they can't handle
the position,'' Jackson said. ``For that reason alone, I'm glad to
see he's doing so well.'' &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
ASU receiver  &UR; Lenzie Jackson has caught a pass in 35 straight
games.
</P>
<P>
   From the rub-it-in-your face department: After Campbell threw a
pass that went way out of bounds, the Autzen Stadium public address
announcer told the crowd: ``Pass complete to Section 25.'' &QL;

BRUINS MAY END UP CAR-POOLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Huskies definitely got run over Saturday. But by
what?
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, some of the glassy-eyed victims seemed to think it
was a Geo Metro while others said, no way, it was definitely a
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the UCLA football team doesn't care how posh or
pedestrian it looks, so long as it keeps up with the traffic in
college football's fast lane. The Bruins' engine may cough and
sputter but it looks more and more like UCLA just might make it all
the way to Tempe, Ariz., for the national title game after all.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which two previously undefeated teams, Wisconsin and
Arkansas, limped over to the shoulder with flats, the Bruins
hightailed it out of Husky Stadium with a 36-24 win to keep their
unblemished record intact.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and laugh at the 248 net yards rushing the Bruins'
defense yielded or the five field goals the offense had to settle
for.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to roll your eyes like Washington senior Nigel Burton
did when asked if the Huskies had just played the best team in the
country. To his credit, Burton didn't articulate what was written
on his face, unlike a certain Cal receiver had done earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be Dameane Douglas,'' he said, ``and be a
jackass.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, why not? The Bruins don't care if you make a face like
you've just smelled a skunk, as Washington receiver Gerald Harris
did when asked if the Bruins were the best team he has faced this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins don't need your stinking approval. Their 19
consecutive wins, including nine this season, is approbation enough
for them. Even if they don't win either of their two remaining
games, against USC on Saturday and at Miami two weeks after that,
they've locked up their first Pacific-10 title in five years.
</P>
<P>
   So, they ask you, who's going to be laughing last?
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say whatever they want,'' said Bruins cornerback
Marques Anderson. ``But it's hard to go nine and oh. I think we
rise to the occasion. And getting a Rose Bowl berth is sweet. It's
hard to blemish that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's day started out bleaker than the weather, which went
from wonderful to woebegone as the afternoon wore on (paralleling
the fortunes of the hometown team).
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was badly singed on the Huskies' first play from
scrimmage when quarterback Brock Huard lofted a perfect pass to
Andre DeSaussure for a 53-yard gain that moved the chains to the
UCLA 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had to be content with a field goal after UCLA
linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo deflected Huard's pass on
third-and-four from the Bruins 18. That's the way the Bruins'
defense operated all afternoon. For all the bending it did, it
refused to snap.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again UCLA hiked up its pressure on Huard just when the
Huskies seemed to be gaining momentum, hurrying the veteran
quarterback into converting only five-of-13 third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recovered from his rough start to make seven tackles,
six of them unassisted. His resilience personifies a Bruins team
that has managed all season to extricate itself from the tightest
of situations. The evasiveness of the Bruins' offense, in
particular, would make Houdini proud.
</P>
<P>
   Under quarterback Cade McNown's direction, UCLA converted nine
of its 18 third-down plays, oftentimes emphatically. There were
passes of 61 and 22 yards to Danny Farmer, another of 28 yards to
Brad Melsby and an 18-yard run by Keith Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For the se,

TIME FOR THE LINE TO BE OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The criticism has been endless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard it until we're sick of it,'' guard Chris Dishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   They've been beaten up and beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an offense doesn't succeed, we're always the ones who get
a tongue-lashing,'' center Aaron Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   They've been targeted as the weak link, the unit most qualified
to sabotage the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything will put that to rest,'' tackle Lomas
Brown said. ``We're going to be like that for the rest of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they stand up and fight. Unless they've swallowed enough
insults and are good enough to prove otherwise. And if the
Cardinals' offensive line wants to change the running perception,
this is a good time to start.
</P>
<P>
   Big games are always won here, in the trenches. And now they
have 60 minutes against the Cowboys. Sixty minutes from first place
and a large helping of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Can they handle it? &QL; 
Message from Madden &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as his bus idled in the parking lot of the Cardinals'
training facility, John Madden was asked a simple question. As a
coach, did he ever have a young, overmatched offensive line rise to
the occasion and win a game on emotion?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Madden listed plenty of reasons why it's nearly impossible. The
advent of zone blocking schemes, necessary to handle stunts,
blitzes and other forms of trickery, de-emphasize the one-on-one
battles. It tips the scales of confrontation back to things like
talent and intelligence. And more to the point . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get your offensive line set,'' Madden said. ``And
I would say they don't have their offensive line set.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the offensive line is in flux. Lomas Brown is 35 years
old, in the last year of his contract. Lester Holmes is making too
much money to get benched for performance. The interior of the line
has been guilty of massive breakdowns. And they're relying on a
rehabilitating rookie _ Anthony Clement _ to make an impact before
the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Football is like a pyramid. Any weaknesses in the line, on
either side of the ball, and the foundation suffers. The
repercussions are felt all the way to the top, and all over the
field.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals have been able to run the football _ as they
did against the Eagles and the Redskins _ they look like a good
football team. When they can't, the offense has looked dreadful. &QL; 
What will it be? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point, they must end the mystery. Either they can or
they can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the offensive line has a chance here,'' Madden said.
``This isn't a dominating front seven they're facing, other than
one guy, and that's Leon Lett.''
</P>
<P>
   So this isn't an impossible challenge. Merely a defining moment,
and a moment of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a young offensive line getting better? Or a bad
offensive line in need of overhaul? One that will make things
difficult for the rest of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Sixty minutes to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched film from the first game, and they didn't manhandle
us,'' Graham said. ``We self-destructed. A penalty here, an
interception there. Mistake after mistake. But I think you're going
to see great strides this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're capable of running the football on these guys.
It's not about them. It's not about the Dallas Cowboys. It's about
the Arizona Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. And the offensive line knows it is under scrutiny. With
two first-round picks in 1999, they know the front office is
searching the college ranks for replacements. They know a few jobs
are on the line. &QL; 
Playoffs in picture
</P>
<P>
   They also know it's not too late. Ten weeks into the season,
despite heavy doses of ineptitude, the Cardinals are flirting with
the playoffs and the preposterous notion of a playoff game at Sun
Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A good offensive line can make the difference, and clearly, no
area of this football team has more room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hold our own against this football team,'' Dishman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Good. Now prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Stand up and fight. Run the Cowboys _ and the perception _ right
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   If you can handle it. &QL;

ANOTHER `BIG D': DEFENSE  
 COWBOYS' SYSTEM REMAINS CONSISTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the Dallas Cowboys, and thoughts of the Aikmans, Smiths
and Irvins pop into the minds of fans. Seldom do thoughts stray to
the other side of the ball _ save Deion Sanders, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It's the side that usually decides the outcome for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Think not? Since wheeling-dealing Jerry Jones purchased the team
in 1989, the Cowboys have had three coaches, Jimmy Johnson, Barry
Switzer and now Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Save for Johnson's first few seasons, when the Cowboys' talent
level was abysmal, the defense has remained rock solid throughout
the rapid turnover of head coaches and the departure of
coordinators Butch Davis and Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, when the Cowboys finished 6-10 with an offense
torn asunder by injury, free-agent defections, suspensions and
arrests, the Cowboys ranked second in the NFL in defense, allowing
282.3 yards per game while leading the league in pass defense at
156.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   This, mind you, despite losing Leon Lett, Sanders, Darren
Woodson and Chad Hennings for a total of 23 games to injury.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Dallas defense ranked No. 1 in the NFL for 11 of 16
weeks before finishing at third. In 1995, it ranked third, allowing
just 32 touchdowns en route to a Super Bowl win. In 1994, it was
No. 1. In 1993, another Super Bowl. Only Jones' mouth has worked
harder than the Dallas ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense that the Cardinals will test today for a share of
the NFC East lead tops the league with an average yield of 13.4
points per game, and has allowed the second fewest touchdowns, 14,
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with Dave Campo,'' said strong safety
Woodson, a former Arizona State star. ``He has been around here
since it all started and was here in 1992 when I got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches have come and gone, but they've stayed with the same
system. We have faith in what the system is doing and that it will
allow us to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo, who has been the Cowboys defensive coordinator since
1995, came to Dallas with Johnson from the University of Miami in
1989 as the secondary coach. He has been much more than the
caretaker, although to hear him speak might cause doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to the way our program was set up
initially,'' Campo said. ``We took a hard-nosed approach with the
players from the beginning of not accepting anything less in
practice than the way we're going to play on Sunday. Maintaining it
isn't as difficult as it might be if you didn't have some character
guys and much of a tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo breaks down the long-standing consistency into two
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we took the approach of there being no excuses,'' Campo
said. ``How you come across as a staff makes the players take on
that personality. We've always felt whatever cards we're dealt,
were dealt. When people ask how are you going to replace this guy,
or that guy, we don't talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next guy in line has to do it, and they kind of get a
succession mentality from it. We've lost a lot of players through
free agency, injury, retirement or whatever. But our guys have
accepted that tough-minded approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, and perhaps the best reason, according to Campo, is the
knowledge that the race usually goes to the swiftest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had speed here,'' Campo said. ``Speed overcomes a
lot of mistakes and bad situations. We can run. Always have since
Jimmy came in. That is my mentality, and it was Butch Davis' and
Dave Wannstedt's before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennings, a seven-year veteran like Woodson, said common sense
was exercised throughout all the coaching turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' he said. ``We've pretty
much been in the top 10, if not the top five, all along. It starts
with the coaching staff and goes down to the personnel. To play
this defense, you need guys who have speed to fly around to the
ball and get after the passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not necessarily a defense of big-name stars. But it's
one that plays pretty good technique and gets after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson added that competition between the players themselves
has been a catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have great speed,'' Woodson said. ``We're not the
biggest guys in this league, but we're fast, and it's instilled in
us to get to the ball. When you have our type of speed, it's easier
to make plays and harder for other teams to make big plays.'' &QL;

 QB HAS RALLIED CARDS TO VICTORY IN 6 OF HIS 19 GAMES

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Forget those comparisons between Jake Plummer and
Joe Montana. They're ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Joe just doesn't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do John Elway, Dan Marino or Jim Kelly, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's early. But in the first 19 games of Plummer's career he
has produced six fourth-quarter come-from-behind or ``game-saving''
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Game-saving is defined as a victory from a fourth-quarter tie.
Come-from-behind is, of course, a fourth-quarter rally to win.
Plummer also engineered a fourth-quarter comeback only to have the
Cardinals lose in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Those other great comeback quarterbacks didn't match the magic
of Jake ``the Unrattled Snake'' early in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who now has 46 comeback or game-saving victories, had
just one in his first 19 games and four in his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who came into this season with 33, had two in his first
two seasons in a total of 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons, including 32 games but only eight
starts, Montana generated only one comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   And Kelly, who had 24 comebacks, had just two in his first two
NFL seasons while starting 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to put teams away,'' Plummer said. ``But it keeps
it exciting. My mom and my family keep telling me it's getting
tough on them. My mom says she can't take it. It's too hard on her
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love it. It's do-or-die. You either succeed or lose
right there. There's nothing more exciting, but you don't want to
have to do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that very knack for producing in the most pressure-packed
situations, which Plummer often exhibited at Arizona State, that
made him so attractive to the Cardinals and local fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win games, you've got to play strong defense, run the ball,
block and tackle, et cetera,'' said Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin.
``But there comes a point in any year when a game has been lost no
matter what you've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really great quarterback finds a way to win ballgames for
you after they've been lost. In the final analysis, that's how you
judge a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've done everything you can and you're still behind,
he can move you down the field and find a way to get you the points
to win the ballgame. That's something Jake has done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comebacks require confidence from the quarterback, but also
confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big part of it,'' Tobin said. ``But he still has to
do it. It takes a great presence of mind. In those two-minute
situations, everything speeds up. Some can see things clearly in
those chaotic situations and make plays when everything is falling
apart around them. Others see nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has pulled off four comebacks this season alone,
including back-to-back games against the Eagles and the Rams and
back-to-back rallies again against Detroit and, last week, the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having that reputation because the guys are going to
believe in me,'' Plummer said. ``I think it helps that they know I
can get it done when the game is on the line if we do things
right.'' &QL;

PEPPERDINE RACES AWAY

<P>
   MALIBU _ It took about, oh, two minutes for Pepperdine to assert
its dominance over UC Santa Barbara en route to a 71-51
season-opening thrashing of the Gauchos.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes was how long it took the Waves (1-0) to build a 10-0
lead. And despite some offensive lulls, including a 8:26 stretch
when they scored just one point, the Waves were able to keep a
comfortable distance between themselves and the Gauchos (0-1)
before 1,915 at Firestone Fieldhouse on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked our energy at the beginning of the game and I
thought we defended well,'' Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said.
``Our ability to defend is what helped us pull away.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine suffered through some scoring droughts, including the
aforementioned dry spell in the first half and a 4:02 stretch in
the second half when they failed to score. But UC Santa Barbara
could never take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauchos shot 36 percent for the game and in several
instances failed to get a shot off, because of a shot clock
violation or some other miscue.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Bunton led the Gauchos, who played their first game under
former Pepperdine assistant Bob Williams, with 16 points. Erick
Ashe added 11 points and former Pepperdine forward Josh Merrill had
10 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we played them tonight instead of a month from now,''
Romar said. ``They'll be a much better after a few games, because
Bob Williams is a very good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The same thing could be said about the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pepperdine cruised, the team still has work to do
fitting the newcomers in with the returning players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we won,'' Romar said, ``because you never know
what to expect in openers. You can only speculate until you start
playing. For lack of a better term, were still finding ourselves.
We have a lot of new faces that were trying to mesh together.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known face, Jelani Gardner, led the Waves with 19 points.
The senior also had a team-high six assists.
</P>
<P>
   David Lalazarian, a transfer from Notre Dame and of the team's
seven newcomers, had an impressive debut finishing with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Lalazarian, a redshirt-sophomore from Tustin, hit two 3-point
baskets in the first two minutes to help the Waves gain their early
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty exciting finally getting out there,'' Lalazarian
said. ``I though I played OK. I had some open looks that I should
have put down, but I lost a little rhythm after the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Marc McDowell had 12 points and seven rebounds, while
Kelvin Gibbs and Louisiana State transfer, Nick Sheppard led with
eight rebounds each.

AUGUSTINE BACK WITH USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC routed the I-Can All-Stars 101-54 in an exhibition game at
the Lyon Center on Saturday night, but the bigger news was that
sophomore point guard Kevin Augustine returned to the team, and
will be in uniform for Tuesday night's season opener against San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine was on the bench Saturday, but did not dress. He said
his recent suspension from the basketball team arose because he was
feeling burned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 12 years of playing basketball, it just came to me. Is
this something I want to continue doing? It definitely is,''
Augustine said. ``I just needed some time to clear my head and
refocus. It was never any problems with my teammates or coaches. I
needed to refocus on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby said Augustine would be in uniform
Tuesday, but he was unsure if he would play.
</P>
<P>
   As for the exhibition, USC's newcomers put up the most
impressive numbers. Junior-college transfer Quincy Wilder led the
Trojans with 15 points while freshman forward Sam Clancy had 14
points and eight rebounds. Six Trojans were in double figures,
including sophomore center Brian Scalabrine, who had 10 points and
six rebounds.

JOKE'S NOT ON JOKINEN

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ For Olli Jokinen, disappointment came after the
morning skate Saturday, when he learned he wouldn't be playing that
night against the Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen, Craig Johnson and Matt Johnson were the victims of
coach Larry Robinson's attempt to shake his team out of its slump
with lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a week of ups and downs for Jokinen, who on Tuesday
scored his first NHL goal in a 5-4 overtime loss at Calgary, but
was a healthy scratch just four days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I want to play,'' said Jokinen, who has four points
in five games. ``I don't want to sit in the press box and eat hot
dogs. I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Matt Johnson sat in the press room and dined,
though he didn't have any hot dogs, which weren't on the menu. He
seemed at least as frustrated as Jokinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want big, young guys who can hit,'' said the
22-year-old Johnson, a physical player who is 6-foot-5, 232 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the lineup were Ray Ferraro, Nathan LaFayette and Sandy
Moger, who had been sidelined about 10 days with a strained back.
Moger is not known for his offensive skills, but began the game on
a line with Vladimir Tsyplakov and top center Jozef Stumpel, with
whom he played at times when the two were members of the Boston
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Of playing with Stumpel, Moger said: ``You think he's not going
to be able to get you the puck, and then all of a sudden, it's on
your stick. You've got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa out: Team physician Dr. Ronald Kvitne said Pavel Rosa, one
of the Kings' top prospects, will undergo an MRI this week to try
to determine the cause of headaches and light-headedness that have
sidelined the winger, who had been playing for the Long Beach Ice
Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 21, missed almost all of last season after suffering a
concussion during the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Kvitne said an inner-ear condition related to the concussion is
believed to be at the root of Rosa's problems, as it was last
season. He saw an ear specialist several days ago, and will do so
again this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rosa will not be permitted to skate, but how he
responds to riding an exercise bike and lifting weights will be
monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be cautious,'' Kvitne said. ``His whole career is
in front of him. ... We're not sure when we'll let him play
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The Kings activated defenseman Mark Visheau, who
had been sidelined with injuries, and he replaced Jan Nemecek in
the lineup.... New York Rangers general manager Neil Smith was in
attendance and ate dinner before the game with Kings GM Dave
Taylor. The Rangers don't play again until Wednesday, when they
visit the Mighty Ducks, and Thursday, when they visit the Kings....
The Kings have re-assigned center Jason Morgan from the Ice Dogs to
Springfield of the AHL.

JONES BATTERS GRANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ It was over in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Roy Jones Jr. needed 10 rounds to beat back the
challenge of Otis Grant Saturday night at Foxwoods, but, after
three minutes, the issue was settled. By then the World Boxing
Organization middleweight champion had been drilled in the face
repeatedly by fists he did not see and was powerless to stop. After
that it was simply target practice for the light heavyweight
champion, as he battered Grant's face and body until he could take
no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he couldn't take my body shots,'' Jones said. ``I'm the
man, I'm the best. I do whatever I have to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much whatever Jones (38-1) wanted, when he
wanted. The game special education teacher from Montreal had the
word ``MAGIC'' stitched across the front of his trunks and that is
what he needed Saturday night. He needed something that could make
Jones disappear. Instead, Jones made him disappear, although not
soon enough to prevent him from taking a terrible pounding.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the fourth round, Jones rocked Grant and after the
bell sounded the challenger looked over at him as he walked back to
his corner like a man eying an alley he didn't want to walk down.
By then Grant had an ugly welt under his left eye and no chance of
winning, but he kept coming, realizing with every step he was going
into a neighborhood where bad things would happen.
</P>
<P>
   They finally did in the sixth round, when Jones dropped Grant
with a short right uppercut that landed so solidly he collapsed on
his back, his feet rolling up over his head. Grant got up at the
count of nine, but his face was a mask of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Although his courage was admirable, Grant was merely a canvas on
which Jones was painting a horrible face until he finally ended the
night with a leaping right hand that dropped Grant at 1:08 of the
10th round. Again Grant's feet rolled over his head and, when he
got up, he was walking in dark shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's trainer, Russ Anber, realized it immediately and tried
to throw in the towel, but the corner cannot end a fight in
Connecticut, so referee Arthur Mercante Jr. threw it back out. That
didn't dissuade Anber, who leaped into the ring as Grant tottered
backward and Jones looked on until Mercante was convinced Anber's
suggestion was a wise one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been with this guy since I was 13 and he wasn't going to let
me get hurt,'' Grant (31-2-1) said, like a young man who knew it's
nice to have a friend in your corner.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, International Boxing Federation
lightweight champion James Leija learned too much Sugar is bad for
your health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar'' Shane Mosley made that obvious by pounding the former
World Boxing Council super featherweight champion for nine rounds
before Leija's corner decided their man had had enough as well and
surrendered with their fighter slumped in his corner. By then
Mosley had dropped Leija three times, cut his left eyebrow, and
dominated him so completely that when a point was taken away from
him in one round the champion still did enough to win it.

BRUINS FALL TO EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The barometer by which teams measure their success is
how well they fare against the cream of the crop. Play well against
the best and it usually means you're on the right track. Get blown
out and, well, it may mean back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had just such a test Saturday night at the
FleetCenter as they hosted the Western Conference-leading Dallas
Stars, who are widely believed to be the favorite to win the 1999
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   They lost, 3-1, which ended their unbeaten streak at four games
(2-0-2). Despite playing the Stars even for nearly the entire game
(for 55 minutes 34 seconds the Bruins were either ahead or tied),
the bottom line was the club's old bugaboo _ a lack of finish _
proved the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Against the Rangers Friday) that was a game we could've
had,'' said Bruins captain Ray Bourque. ``And tonight was the same
thing. We get one point out of four. I don't think that's good. We
can play better and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston managed a short-lived lead a little more than two minutes
into the game. Steve Heinze took out pesky forward Mike Keane along
the left-wing boards. The puck was freed up for Anson Carter in the
left circle and he dished it to Joe Thornton. Thornton didn't get
much on his shot from the inside edge of the left circle but it was
enough to trickle through goalie Roman Turek's legs, giving the
Bruins a 1-0 edge at 2:23.
</P>
<P>
   That advantage lasted 1:57 until Stars sniper Brett Hull took
advantage of a fortuitous bounce. Hull navigated his way through
the left circle, maneuvering past big Bruins defenseman Hal Gill.
He lost the puck, Bourque slid across, hit goalie Byron Dafoe and
knocked the puck out, where it caromed off Bruins center Jason
Allison's skate and into the net at 4:20.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebound came at me and I didn't want it to go by because
there were trailers coming and it would've been an empty net, so I
turned my foot at the last second to try to contain it and it
bounced off me,'' said Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque was unhappy with that particular play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was doing,'' he said. ``I came back and
kind of just slid and thought I was going to knock the puck into
the corner and I'm not sure exactly what happened. I guess I
knocked it toward Ally and it hit his skate and came back and went
in. There was no reason to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze had a great chance at 17:16 of the second when Carter
grabbed an errant Stars drop pass. He relayed it to Heinze, skated
through the left circle, cut right to the net, and tried to squeeze
a backhand shot past Turek at the left post. The goalie stopped it
with his left pad, keeping it in front just shy of the goal line.
Heinze, who had four shots on net, was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my couple chances home and we're all smiling,'' he said
ruefully. ``It's a different outcome. Personally, I should have put
a couple of pucks home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull tallied the winner on a remarkable play that started with a
lucky bounce. Bourque tried to clear the puck out of the Boston
zone at the blue line near the left boards but the puck bounced off
referee Richard Trottier and right to center Mike Modano. Modano
sent a lead pass to Hull down the right side and Hull skated the
puck toward the right goal line. When Dafoe looked to be in
control, Hull fired a high shot from a nearly impossible angle that
hit the goalie's mask and went in at 15:34. Forward Jere Lehtinen,
set up by Hull, closed it out with an empty-net goal with 33.1
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could've pushed him more to the goal line,''
said Dafoe, incredulous that the puck found its way into the net.
``I thought he was pretty much shut off. He just tipped it off the
tip of my head. Maybe if I'd had a bigger head, I would've stopped
him. I was very surprised it went in. He's a goal scorer, there's
no question about it. You give him an inch, he'll take it. That was
kind of a devastating way to lose a game.''

KINGS LOSE TO HURRICANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ If there has been a play epitomizing the rocky first
five weeks of the Kings' season, it came late in the second period
of Saturday night's game against the Carolina Hurricanes, a goal
off the stick of defenseman Steve Duchesne.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the puck ended up in the Kings' net _ a
centering pass from Ron Francis to Martin Gelinas inadvertently
deflected past goalie Manny Legace to a collective groan from the
announced crowd of 10,990 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Duchesne was expected to help put pucks
in opposing nets, but it hasn't worked out that way so far, and
Francis' deflating goal helped send the Kings to a 5-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   To the Kings' credit, they tried to battle back all night, even
after Francis' goal. But that doesn't change the fact that the
Kings (5-9-3) are 1-6-1 in their past eight games, have lost three
straight, and are 1-5-2 at the Forum this season. Mercifully, their
next two games _ Monday against the Mighty Ducks and Wednesday
against San Jose _ are on the road, where the Kings are 4-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Larry Robinson's long-threatened lineup changes
failed to produce a victory for the Kings, who were 0 for 7 on the
power play and have not scored in their last 22 chances with the
man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson put Sandy Moger (returning from a strained back),
Nathan LaFayette and Ray Ferraro into the lineup, removing Craig
Johnson, Matt Johnson and rookie Olli Jokinen. He also played
defenseman Mark Visheau (who returned from a broken hand) in place
of rookie Jan Nemecek.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a shake,'' Robinson said. ``We're trying to get a
little more scoring. And Moger will get traffic in front of the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Moger began the game on the No. 1 line with Jozef Stumpel and
Vladimir Tsyplakov (who left the game in the third period with an
undisclosed injury), but Robinson shuffled his combinations as the
night progressed and as things went haywire.
</P>
<P>
   They went haywire in a hurry, with the Kings falling behind 2-0
on goals by Ray Sheppard and Robert Kron in the first 10:33.
Sheppard's goal came when he was allowed to skate untouched into
the slot and blast a quick shot past goalie Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   Kron then beat Legace with a 40-foot slap shot on a power play,
snapping the Hurricanes' 0-for-44 stretch of futility with the man
advantage. The Hurricanes had last scored on the power play on Oct.
24 in Ottawa, the day before they lost to the Kings, 3-2, in
Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Kings didn't panic despite the early
deficit, which they cut to one midway through the second period on
Ian Laperriere's first goal this season. Laperriere _ who played on
a wing, out of his customary center's position _ received a pass
from Luc Robitaille in front of the Carolina net, shook loose from
the Hurricanes' Keith Primeau, and backhanded the puck past goalie
Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Kings, this began a cycle that would be
repeated for the rest of the night. The Kings would draw within a
goal, then allow one and have to battle again from a two-goal
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' goal off Duchesne's stick made it 3-1, but Stumpel
tipped Glen Murray's pass into the net for his first goal of the
season, at 4:34 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, Primeau restored the Hurricanes'
two-goal lead when he was allowed to waltz untouched to the front
of the Kings' net, but with 11 minutes left, LaFayette's first goal
of the season _ shorthanded _ cut the margin to 4-3. The Kings have
scored seven shorthanded goals this season, and just five on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings could not tie the score, however, and with 44 seconds
to play, Murray's ill-advised slashing penalty killed the Kings'
last hopes of tying the score. Primeau's empty-net goal with 8.6
seconds to play sealed the Hurricanes' victory.

HULL A CHIP OFF OLD BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brett Hull joined a very exclusive group Saturday night
with his two goals and one assist against the Bruins in a 3-1
Dallas win at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   He joined guys named Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe, Marcel
Dionne and Mario Lemieux, Johnny Bucyk and Phil Esposito.
</P>
<P>
   And, even more important, he joined a guy named Bobby Hull, his
NHL Hall of Fame father.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's three points were the 998th, 999th, and 1,000th of his
career, just enough to join his father, making them the only
father-son combination in NHL history to each reach 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hull finished a 1,063-game career with Chicago, Winnipeg,
and Hartford with 610 goals and 560 assists for 1,170 points. Brett
now has 560 goals and 440 assists in 815 games played over 12
seasons with Calgary, St. Louis, and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird feeling,'' said Hull. ``You start out in this
league just hoping you get a chance to make it and play and to be
able to say I was an NHLer and then all of a sudden the success
comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I just did an interview with Johnny Bucyk and now I
can say that my name can be put alongside some people like that.
It's a tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's first goal, in the first period, may have been among the
easiest of any of his previous goals or assists. He was the last
player to touch the puck before it glanced off Jason Allison's
skate and past Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the second goal. He picked up a loose puck at the
blue line, skated far to the left of Dafoe, and then, from an
almost impossible angle behind the net, put the puck behind Dafoe.
Dafoe said the puck glanced off his mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those plays,'' said Hull. ``Unfortunately
for the Bruins, they're just clearing the puck and I think it hits
the referee and goes right to Mike (Modano) and he sees me. I think
(Dafoe) has to believe I'm going to shoot it from there. He forced
me wide and I got lucky. It's a good thing I'm not a lefthanded
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Point No. 1,000 came with Dafoe on the bench for an extra skater
and the Bruins pressing for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hull blasted a shot from just inside the blue line and the puck
hit the post and went behind the net. He went in after it and
centered it to Jere Lehtinen, who potted the empty-netter with 34
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who signed this past summer with the Stars as a free
agent, said it's been a struggle for him to get going in his new
surroundings. He went into Saturday night's game with just four
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so many great chances to score and the puck hasn't
been going in,'' he said. ``When I was credited with that first
goal, I thought to myself maybe something like that's exactly what
I need to break this little hex, or whatever it is, that I'm under.
It's been an emotional change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said when he broke into the NHL he never dreamed of
challenging his father's scoring marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 1,000 points is something you really think
about,'' he said. ``You might think of 4 or 500, and what that
might be like, but 1,000? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the only thing I dream about is the Stanley Cup.
Games like this and marks like this are nice, but winning the
Stanley Cup is what it's all about.''

KANSAS STATE ENDS NEBRASKA HEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Bill Snyder made a concession Saturday night.
He was happy, which for the emotionally-challenged (at least in
public) Kansas State coach was a major concession.
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands of Kansas State fans who stormed Wagner Field
Saturday afternoon, happy couldn't begin to describe the feeling
that accompanied the posting of a final score that some people
around here thought they'd never live to see.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska 30, Kansas State 40.
</P>
<P>
   What was just one more pit stop in a journey that Snyder has
penciled into his day planner as not ending until Jan. 4 in the
national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl was a victory for the
ages for long-suffering Wildcat fans.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 30 years, Kansas State beat Nebraska. For
the first time since 1959, Kansas State fans celebrated a home win
over the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy, I assure you that,'' said Snyder, who stuck to his
plan of seclusion for some of his players by making sure no media
members could chronicle the reaction of victorious quarterback
Michael Bishop. ``I feel very good about this win.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, there wasn't much Bishop could say that could
top his effort Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch senior who has been muzzled by Snyder since
October _ except for an ESPN dispensation this past week _ overcame
lots of things in leading Kansas State to its 10th straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   He survived a first half in which he ran for two touchdowns,
fumbled the ball away three times, and was so emotionally revved up
that even Snyder had to gently wave him away after he had fumbled
away a scoring opportunity at the Nebraska 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael always fits into our plans each game,'' said Snyder,
who watched Bishop recover in the second half to throw two
touchdown passes to wide receiver Darnell McDonald (12 catches, 183
yards), including the winner, an 11-yard score with 5:25 left that
turned a 30-27 Nebraska lead into a 34-30 Wildcat edge that was
expanded in the final seconds when linebacker Jeff Kelly rumbled 23
yards into the end zone off a Nebraska fumble.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas State was going to take control of the Big 12 _ the
Wildcats clinched the Northern Division spot in the championship
game Dec. 5 in St. Louis _ it was not going to come easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers (8-3), led by freshman quarterback Eric Crouch, took
the opening kickoff and went 80 yards and scored, putting Kansas
State, which has feasted on secondary opponents all season, in the
rare position of trailing.
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter, Nebraska had a 17-7 lead and some of the
faithful who had gone through two generations of waiting to see
Nebraska lose here must have been wondering what kind of magic it
would take.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it was Bishop. Whether it was running the ball or
throwing it, Bishop had solutions for Nebraska's defensive puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the plays when he had to make them,'' said Nebraska
coach Frank Solich, who watched Bishop take apart his secondary and
run like a tailback all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 minutes of back-and-fourth second-half action, Kansas
State and Nebraska turned this into a heavyweight fight.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State seemed to pick up the tempo on defense after
intermission, limiting the Huskers to 5 yards on their first nine
plays. Aided by that and Bishop's play, Kansas State took a 24-17
lead with 5:03 remaining in the third quarter and that looked like
it might be good enough, considering Nebraska's problems on
offense.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. The Huskers came up with a defensive game-turner of
their own as cornerback Ralph Brown went 74 yards for a touchdown
off a fumble by backup Wildcats running back Frank Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it was 24-24 and the game had a
last-team-to-touch-the-ball-will-win feel.
</P>
<P>
   More give and take. A 21-yard field goal by Kansas State's
Martin Gramatica. A 9-yard touchdown pass from Crouch to tight end
Sheldon Jackson. The TD pass from Bishop to McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   With five minutes left, Nebraska had one last good chance to
spoil another Kansas State fall, winter, spring, and summer. Down
to their last play, on fourth and 8 from his 32, Crouch went back
one last time and was sacked by the Wildcats' Travis Ochs.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed it was more like a mugging as Ochs pulled down
Crouch by his face mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got face-masked,'' said Crouch. ``I thought it was a
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   So did referee John Lewis, who put his hand in his back pocket
for an instant, but never pulled out the yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see a flag,'' said Ochs, with a smile on his face.
``So I went on my merry way.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Wildcats, although they had to hold their celebration
dance for a few breathless seconds following the final touchdown as
fans kept charging onto the field before the clock had expired.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats and their fans had waited 30 years, a few extra
minutes weren't going to make a bit of difference.

MARQUETTE MAULS BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To give an example of how awful the game was, and how
much partisan fans clamored for something, anything, to get excited
about, consider this: With 5:12 remaining in Saturday night's
Boston College-Marquette game, BC guard Willie Deane stole the ball
in the backcourt and scored on a breakaway dunk that sent the crowd
into a raucous, high-fiving frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   It also cut BC's deficit to 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a very long season for Boston College
basketball. After one game, it's safe to draw that conclusion,
because Marquette is marginal at best yet it handed BC a 70-49
home-opening shellacking despite turning the ball over 19 times in
the second half and playing with as much rhythm and fluidity as
traffic on the Southeast Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette snapped BC's 25-game Conte Forum winning streak in
non-conference contests, dating to a 75-58 loss to Providence in
the quarterfinals of the 1993 National Invitation Tournament. It
also snapped BC's 24-game season-opening win streak.
</P>
<P>
   You knew those marks were in jeopardy almost midway through the
first half. BC, a team with seven newcomers and a starting point
guard (junior Dwyane Pina) who began his career as a walk-on,
converted on 5 of 17 shots from the floor over the first eight
minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of Marquette's attempts were uncontested, as on
the Golden Eagles' first possession, when forward John Polonowski's
top-of-the-key attempt caromed off the left side of the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, BC was fortunate to trail, 12-11, but Marquette,
which hit 4 of 14 shots from the floor over the first eight
minutes, found its range and outscored BC, 29-13, the remainder of
the half for a 41-24 advantage at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an indication what can happen on some nights for us,''
said second-year BC coach Al Skinner, whose team finished shooting
28 percent from the floor and was outrebounded, 46-33. ``Part of
our problem was we got impatient on offense as frustration set in
and I think we kind of bailed out.''
</P>
<P>
   BC outscored Marquette, 8-4, to start the second half to pull to
45-32 with 15:42 left. But BC had several self-inflicted wounds
that kept it from making a serious rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles would go the next four minutes without scoring.
Marquette added an occasional basket or free throw, and its
horrible second-half performance went virtually unnoticed. With
10:54 remaining, Kenny Walls scored to give Marquette a 50-34
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With eight minutes left, Mike Bargen drained a 3-point basket to
give the Golden Eagles a 57-36 advantage. Marquette's final trey of
the contest, by Jarrod Lovett with 6:15 left, gave the Golden
Eagles their biggest lead of the game, 66-36. By then, some of the
BC fans had gone from criticizing officials and Marquette players
to heckling their team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously two very young teams on the floor,'' said
Marquette coach Mike Deane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a senior- or junior-oriented group, I would be
pulling out what few hairs I have left,'' said Skinner, who went
through a similar beginning at the University of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Tyson Wheeler and Cuttino Mobley (who took URI to
the Midwest Regional Final last season) were 7-20 in their first
season. This is going to be a learning experience for us. I don't
know what our record will be, but I know we won't be 20-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Harley had a game-high 19 points for BC, which hosts
Harvard Wednesday night at 7:30.

INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER BANKING BIG ON CONCEPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Internet service provider NetZero is
boldly going where plenty of others have gone _ and failed _
before.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-employee company hopes to stick it to the likes of
America Online and Pasadena-based EarthLink Network by providing
members free, all-you-can-eat Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch is that users must provide the company with oodles of
personal data when they sign up, and access to a running list of
Web sites visited while online. NetZero uses the data to direct
advertising toward the member's screen, with ads appearing in a
small, ever-present window that overlaps the browser.
</P>
<P>
   If the concept sounds familiar, it is. Dozens of similar firms
have sprung up around the country in recent years, but most have
remained loss leaders for larger Web-based firms or gone bust due
to a lack of members and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Bigger.net, one of the earliest and highest
profile of the free providers, was the most recent victim,
declaring bankruptcy in October. In exchange for a one-time $60
fee, the company's 18,000 members were promised unlimited lifetime
access to the Internet. Instead they face an uncertain future as
the firm struggles under new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 100,000 or so registered users of the free Tritium
Network were told in October that their access was being
temporarily suspended as the company looked for fresh investors.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero's founder and Chief Executive Ronald Burr bristles at
comparisons to such failures and insists his company northwest of
Los Angeles is going to make money. Burr's secret weapon:
Deep-pocketed investors willing to keep the firm flush while it
builds a sufficiently large membership base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely going to spend millions,'' Burr said, adding
the company is backed by the venture capital wing of the
Pasadena-based Idealab. ``You've got to make an investment to get
your user base up to the critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   For NetZero, the magic number is 1 million. With a million
users, Burr figures the Westlake Village-based company will attract
enough advertisers to pay for all the staff, marketing, network
access and tangential costs of running an Internet service
provider. Anything more is gravy.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the company expects to pass the 50,000-member mark,
an impressive accomplishment considering NetZero has only been
running since Oct. 19 and has yet to roll out its national
advertising and recruiting campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're signing up about 1,800 users a day, mostly through word
of mouth, and it's growing virally,'' Burr said. ``Newsgroups
(about the service) have started all by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the firm has a long way to go before reaching its
break-even membership target _ expected in the first half of 2000 _
and further still to attract sufficient advertising. So far, 16
companies have agreed to advertise through the ISP, though Burr
acknowledged in most cases NetZero has given the firms discounts
for their business. (The ISP's rate card is based on a combination
of the number of groups targeted and impressions received for a
particular ad.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether NetZero or any free ISP can survive over the long run is
fodder for debate in the e-commerce community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for them, but I don't know if they'll make it,''
said Jay Schwedelson, vice president at Boca Raton, Fla.-based
Webconnect, a media placement firm that sells about $35 million
worth of online ads a year. Even if NetZero can attract thousands
of members, Schwedelson said, they may not be the sort of users
that advertisers want.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce advertisers are looking for people who want to
spend dollars. If it's a free service and someone's using it,
they're very likely to be a person who doesn't like to spend money
when they don't have to,'' Schwedelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, established, fee-based ISPs say theirs is the
more likely model for financial success. ``We've looked at (free
service) several times, because we can see what the mentality is
behind it,'' said Bill Heys, senior vice president at EarthLink.
``But you can only throw so much advertising at subscribers or
members before they get irritated.''
</P>
<P>
   Heys and others say most Internet users appreciate the privacy,
if not the anonymity, that the medium affords. An ISP actively
tracking where a person spends his time online, and then
essentially selling that information to advertisers, may be too
much for some surfers. ``We think you're stepping over a privacy
line at that point,'' Heys said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Zinman, founder and director of product placement at Palo
Alto-based AdKnowledge, said that as long as there are
multimillion-member, fee-based ISPs like America Online available
for advertisers, any free ISP is at a disadvantage. ``Either
everybody shifts to this model or the model can't be successful,''
said Zinamn, whose firm creates tools for Internet marketers to
manage their web advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Burr remains undaunted. And working to his advantage is the buzz
his company has generated online and in e-commerce circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do see ourselves changing the ISP industry,'' he said. ``We
don't see the subscriber model going away, but we're going to
fundamentally change the way Internet access is delivered to a
large percentage of the population.''

KINGS LOSE 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ If there has been a play epitomizing the rocky first
five weeks of the Kings' season, it came late in the second period
of Saturday night's game against the Carolina Hurricanes, a goal
off the stick of defenseman Steve Duchesne.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the puck ended up in the Kings' net _ a
centering pass from Ron Francis to Martin Gelinas inadvertently
deflected past goalie Manny Legace to a collective groan from the
announced crowd of 10,990 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Duchesne was expected to help put pucks
in opposing nets, but it hasn't worked out that way so far, and
Francis' deflating goal helped send the Kings to a 5-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was passing it across,'' Duchesne said. ``I figured
I'd try to tip it in the corner. Of course, it was a good shot by
me. I roofed it.... We're taking the laces off our skates _ suicide
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said, ``He makes a great play, a diving
stop, and it's right in the top corner. It's like a black cloud is
over everybody's heads.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Kings' credit, they battled back all night, even after
Francis' goal. But that doesn't change the fact the Kings (5-9-3)
are 1-6-1 in their past eight games, have lost three straight, and
are 1-5-2 at the Forum this season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's long-threatened lineup changes failed to produce a
victory for the Kings, who were 0 for 7 on the power play and have
not scored in their past 22 chances with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson put Sandy Moger (returning from a strained back),
Nathan LaFayette and Ray Ferraro into the lineup, removing Craig
Johnson, Matt Johnson and rookie Olli Jokinen. He also played
defenseman Mark Visheau (who returned from a broken hand) in place
of rookie Jan Nemecek, who has been reassigned to the Long Beach
Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Moger began the game on the No.1 line with Jozef Stumpel and
Vladimir Tsyplakov (who left the game in the third period with a
mild concussion and is listed as day to day), but Robinson shuffled
his combinations as the night progressed and as things went
haywire.
</P>
<P>
   They went haywire in a hurry, with the Kings falling behind 2-0
on goals by Ray Sheppard and Robert Kron in the first 10:33.
Sheppard's goal came when he was allowed to skate untouched into
the slot and blast a quick shot past goalie Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Kings didn't panic despite the early
deficit, which they cut to one midway through the second period on
Ian Laperriere's first goal this season. Laperriere _ who played on
a wing, out of his customary center's position _ received a pass
from Luc Robitaille in front of the Carolina net, shook loose from
the Hurricanes' Keith Primeau, and backhanded the puck past goalie
Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Kings, this began a cycle that would be
repeated for the rest of the night. The Kings would draw within a
goal, then allow one and have to battle again from a two-goal
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' goal off Duchesne's stick made it 3-1, but Stumpel
tipped Glen Murray's pass into the net for his first goal of the
season, at 4:34 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, Primeau restored the Hurricanes'
two-goal lead, but with 11 minutes left, LaFayette's first goal of
the season _ shorthanded _ cut the margin to 4-3. The Kings have
scored seven shorthanded goals this season, and just five on the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings could not tie the score, however, and with 44 seconds
to play, Murray's ill-advised slashing penalty killed the Kings'
last hopes of tying the score. Primeau's empty-net goal with 8.6
seconds to play sealed the Hurricanes' victory.

at guys who give everything they've got. Everything that can go
wrong does go wrong.''

GAINOUS' PLAY RESCUES FROGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ TCU forward Lee Nailon has been nominated for some
of the highest individual awards in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Horned Frogs won a thriller in a game in which
their star player showed few of the characteristics needed to win
those awards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, junior forward Marquise Gainous rode to the rescue,
putting back his own missed shot with three seconds remaining to
give the Frogs a 94-93 victory against the Oral Roberts Golden
Eagles at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lee fouled out, my goal was to come in and take over,''
said Gainous, a junior-college transfer from Jacksonville (Fla.)
College.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 27 points and grabbed 16 rebounds and Ryan Carroll
added 17 points to help the Frogs improve to 2-1. Each of the three
games have been decided in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was too much of a struggle,'' Carroll said. ``We came out
fired up, but we just didn't make enough plays on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Billy Tubbs, whose team is likely to drop out of the
Associated Press Top 25 after starting the season ranked 25th,
said, ``You have to give ORU credit. They shot the ball well
tonight, although we had a lot to do with it. Basically, they took
it to us and outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon finished with 24 points but was 6-for-23 from the field,
a 26.1 shooting percentage that was the second-worst of his TCU
career and a far cry from the 55.4 percent that led the Western
Athletic Conference last season. He fouled out with 6:08 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big guy hasn't had a big night yet,'' Tubbs said. ``But
he's getting a lot of attention and getting beat up around the
basket. I thought he got hammered two or three times underneath,
and we didn't come out of there with any \Rfree\S throws. He's got
to play better, but he's getting a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nailon struggling, the Frogs had trouble pulling away from
the Eagles. TCU's biggest lead was 74-67 with 10:55 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles stormed back, taking an 81-78 lead with 7:28 to
play, then matched the Frogs basket for basket down the stretch,
while Nailon watched from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   An upset loomed with 14 seconds remaining when Oral Roberts
guard Chad Wilkerson of Grand Prairie got inside the Frogs' defense
for a layup, giving the Eagles a 93-92 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, the Frogs got the ball to Gainous, whose short
jumper missed off the front rim. But he got his own rebound and
softly laid it back in with three seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was coming off,'' Gainous said. ``I just got it back
and hurried it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive rebound was the Frogs' 21st of the game, a total
that Oral Roberts coach Barry Hinson said was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were slippery as snakes; we couldn't get a body on
them,'' Hinson said. ``That was \Rpart\S of our emphasis in
practice the past two weeks, but that's what they do good.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive rebounding made up for the Frogs' defensive
shortcomings. The Golden Eagles shot 53 percent from the field and
had little trouble breaking the Frogs' full-court press. The Golden
Eagles were 7-of-10 from 3-point range in the first half, then
pounded the ball effectively inside in the second half when TCU
tried to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a better job inside on Lee Nailon than we did on
their inside men,'' Tubbs said. ``Offensively we can live with what
we're doing, but defensively we have to get a lot better. Our
inexperience shows up at some positions. We have a lot to learn,
but I've said that all along.'' Briefly Carroll, who suffered an
injury to the arch in his right foot before the season, has
essentially decided against redshirting. ``I'm playing with pain,
but hopefully it will go away.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon took a TCU career-high 18 free throws, hitting 12 of
them.

TECH VICTORY ELIMINATES TEXAS FROM TITLE CONTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Two defenses steeled themselves to stop someone
named Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of other names proved to be more telling down the
stretch last night at Jones Stadium, as Texas Tech (7-3, 4-3)
rallied for a 42-35 upset of No. 18 Texas that eliminated the
Longhorns (7-3, 5-2) from title contention in the Big 12 South
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's victory broke a three-game losing streak and assured
Texas A&AMP;M (10-1, 7-0) of a second consecutive trip to the Big 12
title game, where the Aggies, No. 6 in The Associated Press poll,
will face Kansas State (10-0, 7-0) on Dec. 5 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   For clearing up their postseason travel plans before a Nov. 27
trip to Austin, the Aggies can thank Tech players Rob Peters, Derek
Dorris, Chris Birkholz, Kyle Allamon and Tim Baker. All had season-
or career-best nights in an offensive blitz that saw the Red
Raiders score on eight of 16 possessions, including touchdowns on
their final three drives.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest plays in crunch time belonged to Peters, who threw
for a career-high 322 yards, and Allamon, whose leaping, 35-yard
catch set up Peters' game-winning quarterback sneak with 25 seconds
remaining. Peters' 3-yard touchdown sneak completed a comeback in
which the Raiders overcame three deficits and broke two
fourth-quarter ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why you never quit,'' said Tech coach Spike Dykes, who
tied former coach Pete Cawthon (1930-40) atop the school's career
victory list with his 76th win. ``If you had one like this every
Saturday, there wouldn't be anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech fired the game's most telling shots during a nine-play,
82-yard march that broke a 35-35 tie created when Texas receiver
Wane McGarity (six catches, 174 yards) hauled in his fourth
touchdown strike of the night from Major Applewhite with 2:18
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tech offense took the field, Peters laid down the law
to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked us in the eyes and said, `No matter what, we're not
coming off this field until we score a touchdown,' '' said Tech
tailback Ricky Williams, who rushed for 148 yards on 32 carries and
outgained his Texas counterpart (30 carries, 141 yards) for the
second consecutive year in a head-to-head setting.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who threw for 150 yards and a touchdown in the final
quarter, made good on his vow by scrambling 12 yards for a first
down. On third-and-nine from the Tech 48-yard line, he found Baker
for 10 yards. His next third-down strike went to a leaping Allamon,
who rumbled to the Texas 3-yard line to complete a 35-yard
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reached for the sky, and the ball hit my hands,'' said
Allamon, who entered the game with only 10 catches this season.
``When I turned around and saw no one was covering me, I couldn't
believe it. I just wished I was faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters scored the game-winner on Tech's next snap. It provided
the capper on a night when the Red Raiders reached the 42-point
mark against Texas for the first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Tech got there with a career night from Dorris, the former Azle
High School standout who grabbed three passes for 93 yards,
including his first two touchdowns. Kicker Birkholz booted a
career-best four field goals, including a career-long of 53 yards
to start the scoring. Baker and Allamon both grabbed two-point
conversion passes, and Peters ran for a score and threw for two
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing me loose and I don't know why,'' said
Dorris, who had touchdown catches of 44 and 17 yards. ``I guess
it's because they were worried about stopping Ricky. I'll take it.
It couldn't be a better night.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown said inconsistency killed the Longhorns
and their title hopes, especially on defense in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make the plays, and the blame is on me,'' Brown
said. ``This was a great college football game, if you didn't care
who won. We played hard but we just ran out of time.''
Ricky watch
</P>
<P>
   Texas tailback Ricky Williams had 30 carries for 141 yards,
giving him 6,020 in his career. Williams needs 63 yards in his
final regular-season game, Nov. 27 against Texas A&AMP;M, to surpass
Tony Dorsett's NCAA career record of 6,082 yards.

TECH SENDS UT DREAMS SOUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Those wearing burnt orange who kept waiting for
Ricky Williams to deliver the miracle that would save the Longhorns
last night at Jones Stadium went away sadly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown never put Williams in on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Playing cornerback _ somebody needed to _ would have been the
only way the soon-to-be Heisman Trophy winner could have kept the
Longhorns from coming out on the short end of a 42-35 shootout with
Texas Tech on the high plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great college football game,'' Brown said, sighing,
``if you didn't care who won. In Austin, any time you lose to
anybody, it's really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who began the game needing 204 yards to break Tony
Dorsett's all-time NCAA career rushing record, carved that number
down to an easily makable 63 when Texas and Texas A&AMP;M have brunch
together the day after Thanksgiving in the regular-season finale
for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   That's about all the drama the game has after the Red Raiders
knocked the Longhorns out of the Big 12 South race with the upset
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you sick,'' Brown said after watching Tech's Rob
Peters scramble in from the 3-yard line to score the winning
touchdown with 25 seconds left. ``Winning the Big 12 South was one
of our goals all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Longhorns (7-3, 5-2) two games behind the
Aggies (10-1, 7-0), who beat Missouri yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half we big-played them. but we didn't stay on
the field long enough,'' Brown said. ``And we didn't make the plays
defensively. At one point we were up 28-20 with 12 minutes to play,
and we let them overcome three third-down situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive slugfest almost made an afterthought of Williams
and his pursuit of Dorsett's record.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive season, Tech's ``Little Ricky''
Williams won the head-to-head battle with Texas' more famous runner
of the same name. ``Big Ricky'' finished with 141 yards on 30
carries. ``Little Ricky'' lugged it 32 times for 148 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Call it irrelevant, if you must. Just don't do it in front of
``Little Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a big charge out of that,'' Tech's Williams said. ``It
lets me know our defense played well and that I played well. \RUT's
Williams\S is an awesome running back. I know he'll go far.''
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming ``Big Ricky'' made the team bus after the game.
Most scribes, waiting with bated breath to hear him put his assault
on Dorsett's record into perspective for the huddled masses,
finally huffed off to the press box as disappointed as the Texas
fans who were waiting for a Williams miracle to save the 'Horns.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that while Williams has been praised far and wide for
his talent, kind spirit and charitable nature, he has apparently
yet to grasp the concept of newspaper deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting a somewhat narrow-minded disposition on the
subject, I find this to be a serious, if correctable, flaw.
</P>
<P>
   So we leave it to Brown to speak for his tardy star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a true credit to our Ricky that \RTech\S was giving up
112 yards a game rushing and he got 140-something,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stacked its defense to stop Williams, which allowed
quarterback Major Applewhite and wide receiver Wane McGarity to
click for four touchdown passes, and that wasn't enough to hold off
the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is almost certain to break the record in his final
regular-season game, at home, in front of the Texas fans, a fitting
curtain call for a remarkable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the A&AMP;M game,'' Applewhite said, knowing that says it
all. ``You can throw out the rankings, you can throw out the
numbers, you can throw out who won and who lost last year. It's
A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   It's brunch at Memorial Stadium. Just so Ricky understands that
for this one, deadlines shouldn't be a problem.

MY SLAMA JAMA: CLYDE DREXLER RETURNS TO UH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A former fraternity brother has returned to Phi Slama
Jama with the assignment of restoring the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Drexler, a former All-American who helped put the Slama
Jama in the University of Houston's basketball program in the early
'80s, has traded in his ``NBA superstar'' title for that of
``coach.'' He makes his coaching debut Tuesday when Houston plays
host to Texas and first-year coach Rick Barnes in sold-out Hofheinz
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's basketball program, which produced three Final Four
trips from 1982-84, has gradually declined to an afterthought. Last
season, the Cougars finished 9-20, the first 20-loss season in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the school has fired up the Wayback Machine. Drexler, the
native son who returned to help the Houston Rockets win their
second of two NBA titles, is expected to restore the Cougars'
national reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said former coach Guy V. Lewis when asked if the
Final Four magic can be recaptured. ``Without a doubt. How long
will it take? Depends on recruiting. I honestly don't think it will
take 'em too long. The expectations already are high.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a Cougar basketball buzz here that has been absent for
a decade. Billboards on the freeways say ``Come Glide With Clyde.''
Hofheinz Pavilion has undergone a makeover. A $1 million
scoreboard, 24 luxury boxes, 271 court-level seats. Houston, which
averaged 2,838 fans last season, has sold all of its 6,800 season
tickets. Drexler's hiring has had an economic impact of nearly $2
million according to athletic director Chet Gladchuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have hired the No. 1 assistant from any of the top 10
teams in the country and it wouldn't have fazed anybody here,''
said Gladchuck. ``I wanted to find someone who could bring back
some enthusiasm, bring the family home.''
`A no-brainer'
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the point of view, Houston hiring Clyde Drexler as
its basketball coach is inspiration or idiocy. Drexler's resume
includes one entry under coaching: ``University of Houston, March
1998 to present.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in life is a tradeoff, a balancing act,'' said
Gladchuck, who has been athletic director at Tulane and Boston
College. ``When I balanced the qualities he brings to the program
versus the learning curve he'll go through as a coach, it's a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Miller had experience only as a high school coach when he
took over at Baylor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think experience is overrated,'' he said. ``Coaching isn't
easy, but Clyde's an intelligent guy. He knows basketball. He might
not have coaching experience, but when he tells his players
something, they're going to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston is a member of Conference USA. Drexler's 11 fellow
coaches in that league average 237 career victories and 11 years of
head coaching experience. The 36-year-old Drexler understands why
people question his coaching capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people are right, but everything's relative,'' he said.
``I've never had a chance. I understand people saying that I don't
have any experience, but it's just the game of basketball,
maximizing your players' talents and being efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the game, a student of the game, my whole
life. If you have the patience to teach it and can communicate, I
don't think there's anything that stands in your way. Coaching
isn't rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's supporters point out that Larry Bird and Danny Ainge
made smooth and successful debuts as coaches in the NBA. And his
current players have quickly accepted him _ once they overcame
their awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for him to relate to the players and for the players
to relate to him,'' sophomore forward Chad Kendrick said. ``He's
been there, done that. He's fresh off the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have questions about his capability of being a
coach. It's surprising to find he knows so much about the game. So
far, he's proved that he's very capable. I don't have any worries
at all.''
`Volunteer coaching'
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-year career that included two championships and being
named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, Drexler
decided that the 1997-98 season would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   While he contemplated his next career, he had several
conversations with Gladchuck about the Cougars basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just became logical,'' said Gladchuck when he started
thinking of Drexler as the successor to the ousted Alvin Brooks.
``The coaches he has played for, the athletes he has played with,
his success he's had in basketball and in life. He's intelligent
and he's had success in nearly every phase of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he had ever thought about coaching and one
thing led to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuck made sure Drexler was aware of the job's warts. At one
meeting, he showed Drexler a stack of NCAA rules and regulations
that was eight inches high. ``I threw the kitchen sink at him and
all he did was become more enthusiastic about the job,'' Gladchuck
said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 18, Drexler was introduced as the fourth coach in
Cougars history. He signed a five-year deal that pays close to
$300,000 a year. A clause in that contract calls for him to
complete the 42 hours he requires for his degree in education.
</P>
<P>
   His salary with the Rockets last season was $6 million.
Considering the NBA lockout, Drexler is gliding compared to his
former co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it volunteer coaching,'' said Drexler, a Houston
Sterling High School graduate. ``I'm back here because this is what
I chose to do. It's been a lot of fun, a pleasant experience. If
we're really good, we can build this program back to national
prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars lost their two best players from a 20-loss team.
This season's team doesn't have a player taller than 6-feet-8. The
roster roster does include Gee Gervin and Moses Malone Jr., sons of
former NBA players George Gervin and Moses Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting from a negative position,'' Drexler said.
``This is a major rebuilding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid Gettys is on the construction crew. A former UH teammate of
Drexler's, Gettys was a year away from making partner in a
top-shelf Houston law firm when he agreed to become a Cougars
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an enormous learning curve and that makes us different
from any Division I staff,'' Gettys said. ``We don't have the egos,
don't think that we're God's gift to coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   And Drexler has something that all but a handful of coaching
staffs lack: name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest chunk, though, is recruiting,'' Baylor's Miller
said. ``He's got instant name recognition. I think it's a program
that's really going to come back. I think they're re-energized.''
</P>
<P>
   In last week's early signing period, Houston signed two highly
regarded recruits, 6-5 guard Antonio Falu and 6-8 forward George
Williams. Significantly, both are from Texas. Drexler wants to put
the full-court press on talented Houston high school players, who
in recent years have turned their backs on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Public relations, ticket sales, recruiting _ Drexler hasn't
missed a shot yet. But the degree of difficulty increases now that
the games count. For the rest of this season, every one of
Drexler's substitutions, timeouts and sideline expressions will be
analyzed and annotated. The question _ ``Can he coach?'' _ hasn't
been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get very defensive when people say Clyde can't do this,''
Gettys said. ``You can say he hasn't done it, has never done it
before, he's got a lot to learn. Don't tell me Clyde Drexler can't
do it. He has been successful at everything he's done in his
life.''

There is terror behind the dream of being a professional
ballplayer. It comes as a slow realization of finality and of the
frightening unknowns which the end brings. When the playing is
over, one can sense that one's youth has been spent playing a game
and now both the game and youth are gone...He approaches the end of
his playing days the way old people approach death. He puts his
finances in order. He reminisces easily. He offers advice to the
young. But, the athlete differs from an old person in that he must
continue living. Behind all the years of practice and all the hours
of glory waits that inexorable terror of living without the game.
From ``Life on the Run'' by Bill Bradley

<P>
   In the end, his Cowboys teammates say, Tony Tolbert could barely
jog in practice. His knees, already operated upon five times, were
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   And though owner Jerry Jones told the media on the day the
Cowboys released him, ``This is a decision that has been reached in
a mutual fashion,'' Tolbert did not leave willingly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was for pride or for his scheduled $2.5-million
salary, the 30-year-old defensive end wanted to return.
</P>
<P>
   On the week of this year's season opener, four months after
Tolbert again had surgery on both knees, the Cowboys invited their
former lineman to the annual Kickoff Luncheon to receive the Ed
Block Courage Award, the training room's equivalent of the Purple
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the road does not always come with a tickertape
parade and a champagne shower for a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Tolbert and Cowboys teammate Charles Haley, defy the
doctor and yearn to try again. Some, like former
Cowboy-turned-coach Jim Jeffcoat, allow their bodies to tell them
it's time.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the Rangers' Mickey Tettleton and the Cowboys' Bill
Bates, find themselves overtaken by emotion. There are still more,
notably the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan, who seem torn between
the eternal comeback and the final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, I knew it was time,'' said Jeffcoat, who retired
in 1997 after 12 seasons with the Cowboys and 15 in the NFL. ``I
had injured my knee, and I knew I couldn't do some of the things
that I had been doing for so many years. I couldn't picture myself
going out there at half-speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffcoat left willingly. His fellow first-year coach on the
Cowboys staff, Bill Bates, took a more reluctant path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an easy decision? Of course not,'' Bates said through
tears back in July. ``Do I want to play? I think you know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, at least, left with his health intact. Haley's retirement
was supposed to be prompted by a lingering back injury that had
reduced him to a part-time player in 1996, his last season with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Jones was stunned to receive a phone call from Haley during
the summer, asking the Cowboys for a release so that he could try
out with the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different kinds of athletes respond to the end in different
kinds of ways,'' said sports psychologist Dr. Don Beck, who heads
the National Values Center in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, the huge salaries you see today become a pair of
golden handcuffs and probably contain athletes for longer than they
have to. For others, the issue is missing the camaraderie of the
`male' thing _ the locker room _ and there's a fear of being
ushered out into a world without structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time they were in the little leagues, sports has
provided a rhythm to their entire lifestyle. To these athletes,
facing the end, that's a lonesome world, and it's fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``terror'' former Knicks player Bill Bradley spoke about in
``Life on the Run'' is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is of never playing again,'' said former Cowboys
quarterback Danny White. ``Guys just can't see themselves _ or see
life _ without the game of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember making the decision and going home that day and
sitting there, thinking, `Now what do I do?' It's almost as if life
stopped. Ended. And in a lot of ways, it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pass through the veil, if you will, from a dream world
into reality. And it can be a scary thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the retiring athlete, there is also the reality that the end
doesn't come with an adoring arena. What do they do when the
cheering stops?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are guys who thrive on that. That's the reason they play
the game _ for the attention and being in the spotlight,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't for me, but even I missed it when it was gone. Very
quickly, you become yesterday's news. And it can jolt you.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the athletes of prior generations
likely lingered a bit longer for the growing financial rewards that
their sports offered. In Tolbert's case, he faced losing more than
$5 million in salary for the 1998 and '99 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffcoat thinks the golden handcuffs issue is overrated. ``I
think players stay around because of the thrill of it _ their
competitive nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for an athlete is finding something to fill
that void,'' he added. ``It's something that gets inside of you, a
fire that burns bright, and it's hard to channel that energy into
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Other retired athletes, including former Rangers Pete O'Brien
and Jim Sundberg, also dispute the notion of being shackled by
financial chains. Money isn't what keeps a veteran player in the
game, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost think it's the reverse,'' Sundberg said, ``because in
professional sports, you can make so much money in a short period
of time, if you're a decent player, that you put yourself in a
position where you're financially flexible for probably the rest of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I always thought the large increases in salaries would
mean shortened careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, O'Brien added, the pressure to produce mandates a
certain level of performance in professional athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't `hang on' at the big-league level,'' he said. ``I
don't think the game keeps you around if you're not performing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, Tettleton was a symbol of strength
when he was with the Rangers. Rugged and intense. The ultimate
Marlboro Man.
</P>
<P>
   But on the day in 1997 he announced his retirement at The
Ballpark, Tettleton couldn't hold back the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, getting to play the game had been a dream come true,''
Tettleton said. ``You go all the way back to the hours you spent
throwing balls off the side of the house in the backyard, to
playing games with your friends and pretending you were somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave something like that, something that you really
enjoy doing, you go through some pretty crazy emotions. In the two
days leading up to that, I don't know how many times I cried at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Limping on and off the disabled list, trying to recover from his
sixth surgery, Tettleton batted only 44 times in 1997 before, at
36, he called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hobbling up and down the stairs in your own
home,'' he said, ``it's not a whole lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Tettleton was one of the lucky ones. He accepted
the finality. But sports history is lined with the dim snapshots of
athletes who tried to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   The great Willie Mays, for instance, hit 52 home runs in 1965
when he was 34. It was his last great season. But Mays continued to
hang on, hitting only 13 home runs in 1969 and then, at age 41,
being traded from the Giants where he had played his entire career
to the New York Mets. In his final hurrah, Mays, who hit 660
big-league home runs and had a career average of .302, batted .211
in his last season with the 1973 Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' Bates was one who left with a bittersweet feeling.
Unable to fit the veteran safety under the salary cap or onto the
depth chart, the Cowboys named Bates an assistant coach during last
summer's training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and running back Herschel Walker were squeezed by salary
cap rules that would have required Jones to pay them the veteran
salary minimum of $325,000. Jones reasoned that he could pay two
young players for the price of one old (36 years) Herschel.
</P>
<P>
   Bates' announcement, like Tettleton's, was emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for a player is to realize it's over,'' he
said. ``You think, `How can I walk away from the game? How can I
totally forget something that I've done my whole life?'''
</P>
<P>
   The sigh of resignation in Bates' voice, however, betrays him.
If owner Jones asked, Bates would suit up in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sundberg wouldn't. When his years as an All-Star catcher and
16-year major-leaguer were done, he found a comforting punctuation
to it all _ a Jim Sundberg Day, staged by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice finale,'' said Sundberg, who retired in 1989.
``There are a lot of fond memories attached to that.''
</P>
<P>
   After a career that saw him make three All-Star teams and earn
six Gold Glove Awards, Sundberg said he knew it was ``time to move
on.'' After 13 years as a starting catcher, he was the backup
catcher for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was never comfortable with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't easy to tell the game you love goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday in 1993, the Rangers bid goodbye to Arlington
Stadium. By the next year, the club had moved to The Ballpark in
Arlington and the former stadium would be on its way to becoming a
parking lot. An impressive ceremony formally bid adieu to the old
place.
</P>
<P>
   With the sun setting and the stands empty, a few remaining
writers in the press box noticed a solitary figure walk out. He
carried a paper cup in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sundberg stopped at home plate, where he had worked for
seven Rangers seasons, and crouching over, he began to quietly fill
the cup with dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The memories linger. The athlete can't.
</P>
<P>
   They left too soon
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, football: Ran for 1,544 yards and 17 touchdowns in
1965 and, at age 29, took his ball and headed for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax, baseball: Was only 30 years old when he struck out
317, won fifth consecutive ERA title and retired, citing arthritic
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Don Meredith, football: Tired of the Morton-Meredith QB
controversy, he turned out the lights and declared the party over
at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Orr, hockey: Hailed as the greatest defenseman ever to
play the game when bad knees forced him to quit at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed, basketball: After only 10 years, but with two NBA
titles, Willis surrendered to injuries and retired at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   Left too late
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth, baseball: Released by Yanks and fading, he signed on
with the Boston Braves and batted only .181 in final hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali, boxing: Finally ran out of comebacks and greatness
in 1981 at age 39. No one knows what physical toll his final bouts
took.
</P>
<P>
   Gordie Howe, hockey: Hockey's greatest, still scoring goals in
Houston at age 52, but why? He even played a shift in the IHL last
season at _ what? _ 69!
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Dantley, basketball: Played on seven teams, helped sink
Mavericks in late '80s, and then, at 35, signed a contract to play
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Unitas, football: After glorious 17-year run in
Baltimore, he headed to San Diego, of all places, and a 40.0 QB
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Left at right time
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell, basketball: Became Red Auerbach's player-coach at
age 33, but was still pulling down 19 rebounds a game when he hung
up his sneakers two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, track: With three gold medals, two
mighty world records and nothing more to prove, she retired after
the Seoul Olympics to start a family.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Marciano, boxing: Whisked through his heavyweight career
undefeated, 49-0, and left a champion, vacating the title at age
33.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Staubach, football: Fearful of another concussion, he left
at age 37, throwing a career-high 27 TD passes in his final season
and still able to find Drew Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, baseball: He was 42 and still batting .316 when he
hit a home run in Fenway Park on his final at-bat.

There is terror behind the dream of being a professional
ballplayer. It comes as a slow realization of finality and of the
frightening unknowns which the end brings. When the playing is
over, one can sense that one's youth has been spent playing a game
and now both the game and youth are gone...He approaches the end of
his playing days the way old people approach death. He puts his
finances in order. He reminisces easily. He offers advice to the
young. But, the athlete differs from an old person in that he must

 &HT;    REP. PAUL SAYS HOUSE GRIDLOCK NOT BAD IDEA
 &HT;    For Use Monday, Nov. 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A would-be House leader called Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Surfside, last week and asked for Paul's vote, promising that he
would ``make the trains run on time'' if elected this week.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress-speak, ``making the trains run on time'' means
moving legislation, particularly the federal spending bills, to the
House floor and passage as smoothly as possible. The chugging of
those trains is not necessarily a pleasant sound to Paul, a former
Libertarian presidential candidate who believes the Constitution
places strict limits on what Congress can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are `on-time trains' such a good thing if they carry off more
of our money and freedoms while delivering more regulations?'' Paul
asked in his weekly column. ``It may be that our leaders should
demand that we stop the trains entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul may get his wish next year: with Republicans holding 223
seats and Democrats 211, a mere six votes will decide whether the
House passes legislation or grinds to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration and gridlock may not be all that bad for those
of us who want to slow the growth of the federal government,'' said
Paul, who was re-elected Nov. 3 to represent parts of Travis,
Williamson and Hays counties in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's column didn't mention any leadership candidates by name,
but House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, who campaigned for
Paul last summer, is fighting to keep his job and has mentioned his
expertise with legislative trains. As of Friday, seven Texans were
among the 37 Republicans who had publicly endorsed Armey's
re-election. Paul wasn't on the list.

 &HT;    Developer offers bare proposition for Florida's Sunken Gardens
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ For more than 60 years, tourists have
gazed in wonder at the exotic trees, gorgeous flowers and rare
animals gathered at Sunken Gardens, one of Florida's oldest
roadside attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the pink that tourists glimpse may not be flamingos.
</P>
<P>
   A developer has proposed buying the once-grand but now
dilapidated attraction and converting it into a posh resort filled
with jacuzzis, conversation pools, saunas, masseuses _ and naked
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for an upscale, European-style naturist resort is
raising goose-bumps on some neighbors, but not from pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' said M.L. Nance, who owns a nearby
motel on Fourth Avenue, one of the main arteries leading into
downtown St. Petersburg. ``All we'll get is a bunch of slime over
there. Decent people wouldn't go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, argues the developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturists are the nicest, most decent people I've ever met,''
said Galen Ballard, who has signed a deal to pay $2 million for the
4.5-acre property and wants to sink another $3 million into
renovations. ``They tend to be much more affluent than the average
person. Just north of St. Petersburg, there are four naturists
resorts and officials there love them. No crime, no trash, no
problems. It's clean, passive recreation and will generate a lot of
tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said a cursory review turned up no apparent
problems with the proposal, but they've yet to issue final
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would be an interesting twist in the history of what
was once one of Florida's premier tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Long before there was a Walt Disney World or Universal Studios,
the state was dotted with small, mom-and-pop roadside attractions
that catered to the steady stream of sun-seeking tourists who
motored down for winter vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunken Gardens was one of the first. The gardens were actually
started in 1903 by George Turner Sr., a plumber who drained a
sinkhole and started raising fruit and flowers in the rich, mucky
soil left behind.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, Turner opened his gardens to the public
at the modest fee of 25 cents for two. Soon he was selling juice
and fruit, along with Florida crafts and curiosities, said his
grandson, Tom Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Turner's handiwork spread, and by the 1950s, Sunken
Gardens rated as one of Florida's top-10 tourist attractions,
drawing hundreds of visitors each day in the summer and thousands
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Along with beds of brightly-colored flowers, small waterfalls
and rock gardens, a mile-long path led through a stunning array of
tropical vines, trees and ferns.
</P>
<P>
   There were also rare animals, including pygmy goats, scarlet
macaws and pink flamingos. One trained bird actually played cards
with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 7 or 8 when my family went there on a vacation from
Wisconsin,'' said Ballard, now 54. ``I was absolutely in awe. I had
never seen anything like that in my life. I got to handle a baby
alligator and saw those pink flamingos. Before that I thought they
were only made out of plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida tourism began changing in the 1960s and 1970s with
the arrival of corporate giants like Disney and Busch. Competition
increased and the small mom-and-pop attractions started losing
business as tourists bypassed old favorites on their way to the new
mega-attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Turners added a ``King of Kings'' wax museum exhibition
chronicling Jesus' life, as well as an alligator-wrestling show.
But the bigger attractions kept drawing away customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the Turners put the attraction on the market,
but by then, once-bustling Fourth Avenue was a rundown stretch of
cheap motels and liquor stores drawing drifters and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The family offered to sell to the city, but wary commissioners
declined, fearing they would be saddled with a money-losing
facility.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Turners had a buyer who wanted to put in upscale
condominiums, but residents of a rejuvenated neighborhood to the
east rose up in opposition. Deluged with irate calls, city
officials turned down the condo proposal's zoning and also
designated the gardens as a historic landmark _ a move aimed at
discouraging development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just really frustrated,'' Tom Turner said. ``The city
doesn't seem to want to let us sell it, but they don't want to do
anything to help us keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, who lives about an hour north of St. Petersburg, heard
about the family's troubles through his work as a resort consultant
and developer. He recalled his fascination with the gardens as a
boy, and mulled over possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it could no longer stand on its own as an attraction,''
he said. ``But then the light bulb came on. I realized naturists
would pay $15 to $20 a day to relax in a private, natural
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballard plans to make the nudist resort a day-only operation,
with an upscale restaurant _ for clothed patrons _ to operate at
night after the naturists have departed.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to offer diners tours of the gardens, hoping that might
attract more business for the day-time, clothing-optional
operation.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the city won't try to block him by treating his
naturist resort like an x-rated adult business. If they do, he
plans to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a topless bar,'' he said. ``In Europe, they raise
their children not to be ashamed of their bodies. There's nothing
erotic about a nudist resort. It's for families.''
</P>
<P>
   As for residents who think nudism is indecent, he thinks they
should give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try it one day you'll never be the same again,'' he
said. ``You'll feel so relaxed you won't even remember you're
nude.''

 &HT;    Auction of Alamo diary causing consternation
 &HT;    WITH ALAMO-TEXT, ALAMO-MYTH
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When asked about the imminent auction in Los
Angeles of the controversial manuscript commonly called the ``Alamo
diary,'' Don Carleton began to laugh. He had to laugh, admitted the
director of the Center for American History at the University of
Texas, for it would hurt too much to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just all so unfortunate,'' he said. ``This just shouldn't
have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Carleton, it never should have come to this _ a
public auction for a document of priceless historical value that UT
previously felt it would hold for perpetuity. What makes the memoir
particularly provocative is its assertion that Davy Crockett was
captured and executed at the Alamo, contrary to the popular myth
that has him going down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter-century, this memoir from the Mexican side of the
Texas Revolution _ purportedly written by Jose Enrique de la Pena,
a junior officer in the army of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna _ has
been the cornerstone of the John Peace Collection of the John Peace
Library at UT-San Antonio. The late John Peace II was the UT regent
largely responsible for establishing a campus in his native San
Antonio, and he was one of the collectors through the 1960s and
early 1970s whose passion for Texana established a high-priced
market.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among his prized purchases was the diary, which he
acquired in Mexico from the widow of a book dealer in 1973. Peace
died the next year. It was his wish that the Alamo diary and the
rest of his Texana collection remain forever at the university
library bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was,'' agreed John Peace III, a rare-book dealer in
San Antonio who transferred the manuscript from the library to the
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction house in Los Angeles earlier this
year. ``But I think my father, if he were alive today, would have a
different opinion. The times have changed, the people involved with
the university have changed and the politics of colleges are much
more transparent these days. ... If people were aware of how
libraries treat their donations, they'd think twice. My father gave
a lot more to UT than just this diary. He gave his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Until bidding commences Wednesday (Nov. 18), it's hard to
estimate what the manuscript might bring. Peace previously put a
$250,000 price tag on it at the Cheever Books in San Antonio, which
he manages, and received no offers. Since then, however, the
auction has generated publicity ranging from an article in The Wall
Street Journal to a feature on ``The Today Show,'' eliciting
inquiries from all sorts of public institutions, private collectors
and folks who, said Peace, ``just like interesting things.'' It
remains to be seen how much of that interest is serious, and at
what price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been amazed at the response that we have gotten,''
said Greg Shaw, director of Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield's book and
manuscript department. ``I don't want to scare anybody off, but it
could go for a million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his dreams,'' scoffed Carleton. ``There could be some
person with more money than sense who would spend a million dollars
for that, but I think that's absurd, and I just don't believe it's
going to happen. It has value in the realm of historical
scholarship, but there's not really any monetary value attached to
that. Babe Ruth didn't sign it, much less Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Price aside, the manuscript has been a source of contention
throughout its stay in San Antonio. Though there's plenty of
historical revelation in its 400-plus pages, all the furor has
focused on a few lines from a single page: The assertion that David
Crockett was one of seven at the battle who surrendered to Santa
Anna and were executed. This contradicts one of the most beloved
tales in all of Texas history, which has Davy fighting to his death
against overwhelming odds. Though de la Pena's account doesn't
disparage Crockett's heroism _ ``these unfortunates died without
complaining and without humiliating themselves before their
torturers,'' he writes _ it contradicts the larger-than-life myth
that has been Walt Disneyed, John Wayned and indelibly Imaxed into
the American consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   De la Pena was no sycophantic apologist for Santa Anna. To the
contrary, he charged the Mexican military leadership with cruelty
and incompetence, asserting that the failings of Santa Anna were
largely responsible for losing the Texas campaign that was Mexico's
to win. In the early 1840s, de la Pena died as a political prisoner
in a Mexico City cell, where he had revised his diary into a
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   His account stirred little U.S. interest when it was published
more than a century later in Mexico in 1955 (ironically, just as
Disney was transforming Crockett into an all-American icon). But
after Peace brought it across the border, the diary ignited a furor
with its American publication in 1975 as ``With Santa Anna in
Texas: A Personal Narrative of the Revolution.'' Translated by
Carmen Perry, director of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas
Library at the Alamo, the work was revised into an expanded edition
that was published last year by Texas A&AMP;M University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is virtually no disagreement among historians of any
stripe that there were executions at the Alamo,'' said James E.
Crisp, a history professor at North Carolina State University who
has established himself as the foremost authority on the de la Pena
document. (His introduction to last year's edition details the
controversy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that every last man died in combat is not taken
seriously, except by tourists, chauvinists and people who believe
in fairy tales. The furor comes from people who don't want that
myth tampered with _ this highly structured story that is told over
and over again, and which is intended to inculcate certain values
and give some sense of what the Texas identity is. And part of that
Texas identity is that you don't surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Such notoriety has escalated the price of the manuscript,
particularly since Crisp's research and the verification of the
paper's age by Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield have all but conclusively
confirmed its authenticity. The controversies also gave James Peace
III some sense of the diary's increasing value and some concern
that UT-San Antonio wasn't giving the document its due. Though
everything else in his father's collection had been donated to the
university in a series of tax write-offs, the Alamo diary was the
last piece (along with some associated research documents) still on
loan to the library. When he read a newspaper report last year that
the library was considering moving the Peace Collection to the
Institute of Texan Cultures for space purposes, he felt that the
university was taking the Peace legacy for granted, and he decided
to take back the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my father had been alive to see that they were thinking of
transferring what he had donated, he'd sue 'em,'' said Peace. ``I
don't intend to go in and sue 'em, but I'm doing the one thing I
can. ... UT just wasn't utilizing it properly. It's been there for
25 years, and it had been neglected. So this has been a good
stimulus to get it out of UT and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take all those explanations that he gives you with
whatever you think they are worth,'' said Michael Kelly, director
of UT-San Antonio's John Peace Library, who said that the
collection will remain within an expanded archive there. ``The
document has received very intensive scrutiny here. I don't know
what he thinks should have been done with it, and I don't know if
he really thinks those are the reasons for doing what he did. He
complained about it being kept in a box. Well, that's what you do
with documents. You keep them in document boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard it as a major loss, but I'm not going to cry about
it being gone, because that's a decision I had no control over,''
Kelly said. ``You can draw your own conclusions as to why somebody
would want to sell a document for $200,000.'' (Peace said that the
beneficiary of the sale would be his mother, with the son receiving
a 6 percent finder's fee.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The money's a factor, buy my motivation certainly isn't the
money,'' said Peace. ``I just think that it deserves a better shot
than it has had. Only a third of it has been translated, the final
draft, so that the rough draft, all his notes, his footnotes and
references have not been translated. Having all this publicity has
been good for the document, and it's good to get it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   At 200 grand, UT might well be in the running, with Kelly and
Carleton agreeing that the UT System would need to make the
purchase since the San Antonio library lacks sufficient resources.
But with all the rumors flying around, it's hard to know whether
such a price represents the finish line or merely the starting
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every auction is an unknown,'' said Texas auctioneer Dorothy
Sloane, who specializes in rare books and manuscripts. ``When you
get the right-sized egos in the same room, who knows what might
happen? This is a research manuscript that has a lot of scholarly
potential, but that's a totally different thing from a trophy piece
you hang on a wall. It's a wonderful document for an institution;
in fact, where it was, was about the perfect place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction catalogue lists an estimated value of $200,000 to
$300,000, which Shaw maintains is ``very conservative.'' He says
that some wealthy Texas ranchers have expressed interest. Other
possible parties include Yale University and the University of
California at Berkeley, institutions that could consider the diary
a prize among their extensive Texas holdings. There was even talk
of a Hollywood production company using the diary to remake ``The
Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, UT is ``monitoring the situation very closely,''
said Carleton, without confirming that the institution would be
among the bidders. ``I just wish we were dealing directly with the
donor and could work something out. ... It's an icon, an artifact,
and I think the preservation of these things in the original is
absolutely essential. Yes, the information has been published and
so forth, but there's really nothing like the original as a link to
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping very much that a philanthropist, benefactor or
foundation will buy it and donate it eventually to an archive,''
said Crisp. ``What would be a terrible tragedy is if it ended up in
the hands of private collectors who didn't make it available to
scholars. The ultimate tragedy would be if somebody who really
hates this diary buys it and tosses it into the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the staunchest defenders of Davy Crockett wouldn't do that.
Would they?

 &HT;    The making and marketing of a hero
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though Walt Disney didn't invent Davy Crockett,
he might as well have. Amid the juggernaut of myth and
merchandising that Disney unleashed in Davy's name in the
mid-1950s, the reality of Crockett was transfigured beyond
recognition. Whatever role Crockett played at the Alamo, he proved
essential in the shift of Disney's empire from motion pictures into
television and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want any picked-over heroes,'' Disney reportedly told
his creative brain trust as they were attempting to devise a lead
figure for the ``Frontierland'' segment in both the ``Disneyland''
TV series (which debuted on ABC in 1954) and the theme park of the
same name (which opened in Anaheim, Calif., the next year). Many of
the best-known figures of the Wild West were men of questionable
character, outlaws and lawmen alike, so there wouldn't be any Jesse
James or Wyatt Earp at Disneyland. Daniel Boone was an early
favorite, but his death in peacetime as a civilian lacked the
heroic resonance Disney required.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the eventual choice was Davy, the ``David Crockett'' of
the comparatively staid history books, but soon to be memorialized
in serenade as ``Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.''
Crockett had definitely died at the heroic battle of the Alamo,
though there were conflicting accounts of the manner in which he'd
met his end. No matter what the reality might have been (one
version had him hidden under a mattress in the barracks), Disney's
Davy would go down brandishing ``Ole Betsy'' to his final breath.
</P>
<P>
   Such never-say-die fortitude struck a particularly responsive
chord against the '50s backdrop of the Cold War and McCarthyism, in
which the valiant stand against the Mexican army could easily
translate into ``better dead than red.'' A few years later, John
Wayne's ``The Alamo'' would further solidify the patriotic
connection, elevating the Alamo from a symbol of Texas independence
into a shrine of all-American courage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly after Fess Parker's TV debut as Crockett, Davy
became the hottest of merchandising phenomena, selling $300 million
in paraphernalia in less than a year (close to $2 billion in
today's dollars). Only the most deprived child of the mid-'50s
lacked a coonskin cap or a Crockett lunchbox, while more privileged
households could pick from among the Davy Crockett Outdoor Grill
(''For Frontier Living''), the Davy Crockett Frontier Torch Light
(a flashlight which ``Lights Up the Wilderness and Every Other
Place'') and the exquisitely fringed rec-room chairs for frontier
lounging, Crockett-style. To assuage conflicted opinions over
America's Western legacy, parents could choose between the Davy
Crockett Indian Fighters Game and the Davy Crockett Whistling Peace
Pipe.

 &HT;    Account of an execution
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ From the ``Alamo diary'' attributed to Jose
Enrique de la Pena, an officer who served under Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna:
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Santa Anna's speech, an unpleasant episode had
taken place, which, since it occurred after the end of the
skirmish, was looked upon as base murder and which contributed
greatly to the coolness that was noted.
</P>
<P>
   Some seven men had survived the general carnage and, under the
protection of General Castrillon (cq, no abbr.), they were brought
before Santa Anna. Among them was one of great stature, well
proportioned, with regular features, in whose face there was the
imprint of adversity, but in whom one also noticed a degree of
resignation and nobility that did him honor. He was the naturalist
David Crockett, well known in North America for his unusual
adventures, who had undertaken to explore the country and who,
finding himself in Bejar at the very moment of surprise, had taken
refuge in the Alamo, fearing that his status as a foreigner might
not be respected.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anna answered Castrillon's intervention in Crockett's
behalf with a gesture of indignation and, addressing himself to the
sappers, the troops closest to him, ordered his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The commanders and officers were outraged at this action and did
not support the order, hoping that once the fury of the moment had
blown over these men would be spared; but several officers who were
around the president and who, perhaps, had not been present during
the moment of danger, became noteworthy by an infamous deed,
surpassing the soldiers in cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   They thrust themselves forward, in order to flatter their
commander, and with swords in hand, fell upon these unfortunate,
defenseless men just as a tiger leaps upon his prey. Though
tortured before they were killed, these unfortunates died without
complaining and without humiliating themselves before their
torturers.

   Award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Gary M.
Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine to
Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529, a small propeller-driven plane that crashed in a
hayfield in West Georgia killing 10 of the 29 people aboard. In a
seven-part series, Pomerantz vividly describes the 9 minutes and 20
seconds of horror aboard the doomed aircraft and how the tragedy
has reshaped lives. Photos and illustrations for the series and
layouts from Parts One, Two and Three will be posted in a folder

   CRASH-THEFIRE _ The little propeller-driven plane with 29 people
aboard fell out of the sky at 140 miles per hour. It sliced through
treetops and bore down on a hayfield in Carrollton, Ga. The left
wing tip gouged the earth first. The wing ripped away from the body
of the plane as dirt clods and rocks flew. The plane's nose next
skidded on its underside. Then the one-winged plane went airborne
again, bouncing up a ridge about 100 feet, the first killing steps
in a macabre dance of physics. The plane was in pieces, connected
only by a common fate. (Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Ron Paul, R-Surfside, last week and asked for Paul's vote,
promising that he would ``make the trains run on time'' if elected
this week. Oops. Wrong number. In Congress-speak, ``making the
trains run on time'' means moving legislation, particularly the
federal spending bills, to the House floor and passage as smoothly
as possible. The chugging of those trains is not necessarily a
pleasant sound to Paul, a former Libertarian presidential candidate
who believes the Constitution places strict limits on what Congress
can do. (Harlan, Cox News Service) MOVED

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ For the second time in nine months,
President Clinton has taken a massive strike force to the brink of
an attack against Iraq, only to draw back in the face of
last-minute concessions from Saddam Hussein. Both men dutifully
demonstrated their now familiar abilities to engage, then withdraw,
from a dangerous, and costly, contest pitting the will of the
world's mightiest military power against the wiles of its most
menacing dictator. Moving forward, Clinton and Saddam are in much
the same position as they were when the year began. The long-term
solution, a weary Clinton said Sunday, is for Saddam to step down _
willingly or not. Developing. LEDE-ALL. (Deans, Cox News Service)

be Saddam Hussein's mouthpiece before he fled Iraq and defected.
Though the United States did not strike Iraq in this latest round
of cat-and-mouse over weapons inspections, this avuncular
66-year-old thinks the time will come. ``I am not disappointed. If
this opportunity was missed, there will be lots of other
opportunities,'' said Raheem. Raheem's Iraqi National Accord is one
of the groups that could stand the most to gain from the latest
stand off with Saddam Hussein. As ``Saddam Fatigue'' _ as one Arab
diplomat calls it _ builds, Saddam faces less support from his
traditional allies and, possibly, more active opposition. (Kaplow,

Hussein for his failure to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
Of the three permanent members of the U.N. National Security
Council that have done so, Russia has been among the most stalwart
of Iraq's allies and a diplomatic middleman between Washington and
Baghdad. Analysts say Moscow is motivated global political stature
and domestic economics. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

 &HT;    Fire in the field
 &HT;    By Gary M. Pomerantz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The little propeller-driven plane with 29 people
aboard fell out of the sky. At 140 miles per hour, it sliced
through treetops and bore down on a hayfield in Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   The left wing tip gouged the earth first. The wing ripped away
from the body of the plane as dirt clods and rocks flew. Jet fuel
spilled from its ruptured tank.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's nose skidded on its underside.
</P>
<P>
   Then the one-winged plane went airborne again, bouncing up a
ridge about 100 feet, the first killing steps in a macabre dance of
physics.
</P>
<P>
   A plane made in Brazil and bound for the Mississippi coast
became a carnival ride gone out of control. It skidded through the
hayfield, its belly cutting a narrow groove 4 inches deep and 150
feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The fuselage shattered into two primary sections. Twisted by
torque, the front section _ carrying the flight crew and several
passengers _ spun to its right, with its nose finally stopping at a
right angle to the plowed groove.
</P>
<P>
   The back section slid tail first, then rolled onto its right
side, so curiously situated that its underbelly nearly faced the
pilot's window.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was in pieces, connected only by a common fate.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Chapman, the young Army veteran in the second row, felt
the plane's belly sliding across the ground. Then she felt dirt
hitting her face.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore teacher, Dawn Dumm, screamed but couldn't hear
herself over the sound of ripping metal.
</P>
<P>
   The nervous flier in row six, Chuck Pfisterer, his body tossed
like a rag doll's, waited for the blackness to come.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth row, construction engineer David Schneider opened
his eyes. The luggage compartments shattered, and the cabin
depressurized, creating a wind tunnel of flying plane parts. He saw
a few seats break and dislodge.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Schneider held his right arm against an inner
wall of the plane, feeling the ridges of the ground and fearing a
rock or stick might break through a window. Schneider's left arm
fended off flying objects: luggage, metal fragments, another
passenger knocked from a seat across the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Then, through an opening, he saw gray sky.
</P>
<P>
   One row ahead, Kevin Bubier's face was pinned against a window
as the plane skidded. Bubier watched helplessly as grass and dirt
were plowed up like a furrow just inches from his eyes. Please
don't break! Please don't break! he pleaded with the window.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, flight attendant Robin Fech opened her eyes to an
eerie darkness. Slumped in her jump seat, she looked to the floor.
Damn, I've lost a shoe!
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts cleared. My God, we've crashed! Wires, cables and
broken pieces of the plane hung from the ceiling, poking through at
odd angles. The metal kitchen galley had fallen across the aisle.
The main passenger door to Fech's right had buckled in. She was in
her own cave, all darkness except a solitary orange light.
</P>
<P>
   She heard a few moans, then more. ``Get out!'' she screamed to
her passengers. ``Get out of the plane now!'' Fech knew what they
did not, that the solitary orange light was fire.
</P>
<P>
   The first firetruck took five minutes to reach the hayfield. If
nine minutes and 20 seconds of falling to Earth seemed like a
flash, the next five minutes in the field would seem like an
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of fire, more feared than instant death. A
moving, raging monster, it breathed 1,800-degree flames that could
leap from jet fuel to pantyhose, from alloy metal to human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   So hot are such fires, they burn through clothes, skin and
muscle. After nerves are burned, there is the body's great gift:
The pain goes away.
</P>
<P>
   On the right side, between rows four and five, two passengers
quickly slipped outside through the hole in the fuselage. Fearing
an explosion, Chuck LeMay and David McCorkell ran from the plane as
fast as they could.
</P>
<P>
   A safe distance away, McCorkell slid to a stop in the grass. He
saw no one else emerging from the plane. Slowly, carefully, he and
LeMay made their way back, keeping a safe distance at first.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had gotten out just in time. While they fled, 175
gallons of jet fuel spilled from the right wing, forming puddles
outside the opening they'd just run through. In less than a minute,
that opening would fill with flames.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman in row two had blacked out just as the dirt hit her
face. Unconscious for only seconds, she awoke to find her seat had
dislodged, and she was lying atop the passengers in 2B and 2C.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman saw blood on her T-shirt, but it wasn't hers. It came
from Angela Brumfield, the aspiring flight attendant below her in
2C, who had a cut above her eye.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the man in 2B, engineer John Tweedy, pushed Chapman's
seat off his chest. His adrenaline rushing, he climbed through a
wide hole in the plane's right wall, which had peeled back like
aluminum foil between the second and fourth rows. It provided the
primary escape route in the plane's front section.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping to the ground, Tweedy offered a hand to the dazed and
bleeding Brumfield, who followed him out. Panicked, Tweedy fell to
the ground, then stood.
</P>
<P>
   Fech, still inside the plane, appeared behind him. She had
crawled through the pile of broken plane parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move!'' Fech shouted at Tweedy. Then she emerged, in
stockinged feet, her head bleeding, her right wrist broken. Running
out on the wing, she shouted, ``Move it! Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, she saw passenger Alfred Arenas, his pants and
sneakers on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hopping and twisting, Arenas didn't know what to do. He heard
Fech shout, ``Roll on the ground!'' As he did, he felt an
indescribable heat melting the sneakers into his feet.
</P>
<P>
   At almost the same moment, Barney Gaskill, a 57-year-old Ohioan,
pulled his colleague, Ed Gray, from a heap of broken plane parts in
row four. ``Don't worry, buddy, I'll get you out of this,'' Gaskill
said.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled Gray across the aisle and through the opening that
Fech had just passed through.
</P>
<P>
   As Gray emerged from the fuselage, his pant leg caught flames.
He heard someone yell, ``Roll on the ground, Ed!'' In his
confusion, Ed Gray looked around for someone named Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskill pushed him down. Gray rolled and the fire went out. He
winced and suddenly held his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Gaskill pulled and cajoled Gray to a safer spot in the field,
all the while fearing that his buddy was having a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the fuselage, where the plane had turned on its
right side, the rear exit door offered no escape: It was pressed
against the ground. The only way out for the remaining passengers
was the hole in the fuselage between rows four and five. To get
there, they would have to walk and crawl over the windows and
seats, the fallen baggage and debris, balancing with their hands
pressed against overhead luggage compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the hole, they would find it blocked by flames, through
which they could see only a blurred sky.
</P>
<P>
   A line of passengers formed. They were pushed back by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to go through the fire,'' Charles Barton, the
Virginia deputy, called from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Several seats in the back had broken loose. A few were intact,
leaving strapped-in passengers dangling from seat belts. The young
deputy, Tod Thompson, allowed Sonya Fetterman, a 37-year-old mother
of three from Texas, to slip down from her back-row seat onto his
shoulders as she undid her seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson moved Fetterman and Lucille Burton, a grandmother, in
front of him. Thompson didn't want to be the type of man who took
the lifeboat before the women.
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, the wall of flames lowered. Seeing this, Alan
Barrington, in row six, thought firetrucks must have arrived. He
believed the plane must have landed near a runway with firetrucks
on alert. But then flames filled the opening again, and Barrington,
no longer imagining firetrucks, looked to the passengers in line
behind him. They all looked like zombies.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington yelled to those at the front of the line: ``You have
to go through the fire! Just go! Go! Go!'' He saw one man disappear
into the flames. And then another.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they lunged into the fire. Barrington leaped through
and landed with a somersault. Somehow he was only grazed by the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   But the fire was intensifying by the second. For those who
followed, survival would be random.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes after ASA Flight 529 skidded to a stop, black smoke
was billowing from the fuselage. Nearby grass burned, too, with
flames spreading 15 feet or more from the fuel puddles.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of the field, several neighbors dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Thompson saw Lucille Burton in flames, rolling in the
grass and calling for help. He had seen her and her husband,
Lonnie, board the plane in Atlanta. They were leaders in the
African-American community in Asheville, N.C., and Thompson was
struck by their kind faces: ``They looked like somebody's
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, he ran to Mrs. Burton, stripped off his shirt and
used it to suffocate the flames. ``Roll!'' he screamed, and she
did. But she was soaked in fuel, having stumbled through a puddle
outside the burning plane. Thompson could smell fuel on her as he
fought to save her. Finally, the flames put out, she moaned in the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   She asked about her husband.
</P>
<P>
   All around him in the field, Barrington saw passengers on fire:
standing, running, rolling, screaming. He ran to one man ablaze in
the grass. Barrington heard others yell, ``Roll!'' so now he yelled
to the man: ``Roll! Roll!''
</P>
<P>
   Drenched in fuel, flames shooting out from all over his body,
the man didn't roll. He's like a log in the fireplace, Barrington
thought. He yelled, ``I've got to take off your clothes! Take off
your pants!'' On the ground, the man undid his pants and pushed
them down his hips. Barrington couldn't even see the man's face
beneath the flames as he grabbed the man's pants and threw them
off. Now the man's white socks, saturated in fuel, were in flames.
Barrington used his bare hands to smother them, burning his fingers
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The man's shirt still burned. So did his arms and hair.
Barrington tried to rip off his own shirt to use against the
flames, but pain stabbed at his shoulders, dislocated in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   So Barrington undid his shirt one button at a time as the man
burned in the grass. Once removed, the shirt didn't help, so he
furiously grabbed fistfuls of grass and dirt and threw them at the
man, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington turned and walked away from a man whose name he still
does not know. Tears in his eyes, he was certain this man was
beyond help.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Fetterman, her shorts on fire, raced past. Her
scream, pained and prolonged, would long haunt Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   Fetterman rolled in the field and unbuttoned her shorts, which
Barrington grabbed and flung through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Fetterman lay naked in the grass until Thompson gave her the
shirt and shorts from his overnight bag. She fanned her severely
scorched arms up and down in a cooling motion as Schneider consoled
her. ``You're going to be fine,'' Schneider told her.
</P>
<P>
   Fetterman, thinking about her toddler daughter back home in
Texas, said, ``My baby! She's so beautiful. She's so cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see her again,'' Schneider said. The rest of
Fetterman's upper body looked free of burns, and Schneider figured
that youth was on her side. He smiled at her and said, ``We made
it!''
</P>
<P>
   Across the field, Chapman had walked from the fuselage in a
daze. She had seen the trees and the grass and wondered, Where am
I? The answer, she had decided: ``In the middle of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she came upon a middle-aged man, burned, in the grass. He
wore a white shirt, sleeves rolled up to the elbows, and a tie. But
his pants were gone, his shoes melted and his legs burned.
</P>
<P>
   He told her his name was Bond Rhue. A 56-year-old U.S.
Department of Justice prosecutor, Rhue was en route to Gulfport,
where he was investigating riverboat gambling. After the propeller
broke, he had changed seats with Lucille Burton, who didn't want to
sit near an emergency door.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Chapman if she thought he was going to die. ``No,
you're not that bad,'' she said. His face and arms appeared
sunburned, his hair singed. ``You just look like you've been laying
out in the sun,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Rhue asked, ``Is my tie crooked?'' His tie, the one featuring
pigs, had melted, so she just nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you straighten it?'' Rhue asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman took a deep breath. Then she said, ``Why don't we just
take it off ...''
</P>
<P>
   When the plane came to a stop, the large metal galley storing
drinks and snacks had collapsed across the front row, trapping
Baltimore teacher Dawn Dumm.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Mary Jean Adair, couldn't push away the wreckage.
Suddenly, hydraulic fluid sprayed, scalding Dumm's head, shoulders
and back. She tucked her chin and screamed.
</P>
<P>
   So did her mother: ``Please, help my daughter! She's being
burned!''
</P>
<P>
   No one came, but the spraying stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Together, mother and daughter again pushed at the metal galley.
As it lifted, Adair thought she saw the silhouette of a man
helping. But no one was there.
</P>
<P>
   When Dumm pulled her left leg free, her foot flopped out, nearly
severed.
</P>
<P>
   Through the debris of shattered overhead bins and the broken
galley, Dumm saw the flight attendant's vacant jump seat. Then she
looked back at the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Thickening black smoke made it seem as if someone had hung a
sheet across row four. All around her, the seats were empty.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm pulled herself over her seat and into the second row. With
her mother in tow, Dumm gazed out a hole in the right wall and saw,
perhaps 20 feet away, a peculiar image _ flight attendant Fech
standing with a man wearing only his underwear and another holding
a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still here!'' Dumm screamed as the black smoke billowed
higher. ``We need help!'' She saw Fech's head turn, but no one came
right away.
</P>
<P>
   She would have to do it alone, and slowly. Inching out the hole
and toward the front edge of the wing, only a few feet above the
ground, Dumm heard her mother scream: ``Dawn! Help me, I'm being
burned!''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her, Adair, 64, was stretched out across the wing where
flames from underneath shot up and scorched her.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm inched back up the wing and pulled her mother closer. They
crawled to the ground. There, Fech and several passengers came to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Adair was in pain and unwilling to crawl farther from the plane.
Several passengers helped move her a few feet. Thompson asked, ``Do
you have grandkids?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why don't you get up and move so they can see you
again?'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm held her dangling foot as she crawled away from the plane;
she moved well ahead of her mother. Fech couldn't persuade Adair to
crawl, so she called out to Dumm, ``Your mother won't move unless
you call her!'' Dumm called back to her mother, encouraging her to
keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   Crawling through the field, Dumm noticed the maypop blossoms
growing on vines in the field. She watched a butterfly and reached
out to grab it. It flew from one maypop to another, and she crawled
after it. The pain in her foot worsened, and the field grew darker.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm knelt in the field and recited the Lord's Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   She saw three neighbors standing on a hill. She waved to them.
Elbert Eason came and reached out to her and said, ``I won't leave
you.'' Dumm pulled from her fanny pack the goodbye note to her
husband and sons: ``You are the Lights of My Life. Always, Mommy.
Lucas and Zeke: Be Good Always. Prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eason took the note from her. Dumm asked him to call her
husband, and she gave him the home phone number. Eason promised to
call. He got a towel, wet it with a fire hose, then used it to wash
Dumm's face.
</P>
<P>
   Check on my mother, Dumm said. Thirsty, so thirsty, Dumm held
the towel in her mouth, biting it to fend off pain and also to
drain whatever water it held.
</P>
<P>
   When the firetrucks and rescue teams pulled up, the hayfield
resembled a Civil War battlefield, filled with casualties,
confusion and surreal images.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the grass, Maine shipyard worker Bubier saw a woman in
a flowered dress. ``You OK?'' he asked. She said her back hurt, and
she trembled with fear. Bubier calmed her, and they embraced.
Sitting now, Bubier felt pain in his right leg, and he pulled his
pant leg up. He saw his own burned flesh. ``Aw, man!''
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the flowered dress flinched. ``I don't want to see
it!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bubier suddenly grew faint. The woman in the flowered dress
soothed him. As he drifted in and out of consciousness, he thought
of the woman in the flowered dress. Who was she?
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if she might have been his guardian angel. Whoever
she was, he would always love her.
</P>
<P>
   Walking around the plane's tail, a shirtless Barrington came
upon another passenger: a burned man, in his 30s, wearing only
underwear and walking toward a house at the edge of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't you get burned?'' the man calmly asked Barrington.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington didn't know what to say. What could he say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Barrington replied, never making eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   The burned man, Michael Hendrix, a Maryland engineer on his
first week of a new job, walked past the first house and went to
the house next door. There, on the porch, he met Polona Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the plane,'' Hendrix began. ``Yes,'' Jeter said, ``I
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix said he needed a phone to call his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter brought her phone out to the porch and dialed for him. In
her nervousness, she dialed the wrong number. He took the phone,
dialed, and got his answering machine. Jeter heard Hendrix say,
``Linda, my plane crashed ...''
</P>
<P>
   Next door at the home of Paul Butler, owner of the hayfield,
Barrington called his wife in Roswell. He didn't want the Butlers
to pay for the call, so he used his business calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was passing out blankets to injured passengers in his
field when he found Rhue. ``I'm burned over 75 percent of my body.
I'm going to die,'' Rhue said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler lied, ``Naw, you just look red. It ain't that bad.'' But
the government prosecutor insisted, ``No, I've got third-degree
burns. I'm going to die!''
</P>
<P>
   Putting a blanket over him, Butler said, ``Just be calm, man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, an EMT carrying a portable oxygen cylinder
discovered Jennifer Grunbeck, 29, who was on a business trip while
her husband and young son were at home in Maine. A local minister
sat beside Grunbeck and told the arriving EMT, Bud Benefield,
``This is Jennifer.''
</P>
<P>
   Benefield looked at Grunbeck. She had second- and third-degree
burns over her body; her blouse was shrink-wrapped onto her skin;
and she had singed flesh near her mouth and nose, indicating she'd
breathed fire. ``Jennifer, can you talk to me?'' he asked, not
expecting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Benefield didn't think she'd survive. He figured her airways
would swell, she'd go into shock and then her organs would fail. He
immediately put her on high-flow oxygen. Then he told the minister,
``I don't want you _ or the man you work for _ to leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers arrived with a stretcher, and Grunbeck was
carried to an ambulance. ``Please, don't drop me,'' she said. She
asked Benefield to tell her husband and son she loved them.
Benefield thought, How could any human being survive a burn like
this? Later, doctors estimated that Grunbeck had been burned over
92 percent of her body.
</P>
<P>
   At the ambulance, Benefield quietly told the waiting paramedic,
``This is one of the worst burns I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramedic said, ``Have you seen my patient?'' Benefield
looked inside the ambulance and saw Lucille Burton, her hand curled
into a claw, pleading, ``Please, God, let me die!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nervous flier, Chuck Pfisterer, had wandered
across the street, where he approached two elderly women.
</P>
<P>
   He had removed his pants earlier in an attempt to beat back
flames consuming another passenger. Now he made quite a sight: He
wore a bloody T-shirt, boxer shorts, black shoes and socks. In one
hand, he held his belt and wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to bother you,'' Pfisterer said, ``but could I have a
glass of water?'' The elderly women led him inside their home,
where he phoned his wife in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos and confusion, no one knew that someone was still
alive in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The young co-pilot, Matt Warmerdam, was pinned in his cockpit
seat and had no one to help him in his claustrophobic trap: melted
plastic in the ceiling dripping on his shoulders; flames,
flickering from behind, burning his back, legs and left arm. He
never saw the flames but felt them _ at least as long as it took
for the burns to advance to third degree, at which point his nerve
endings, and the pain, died.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam saw pilot Ed Gannaway next to him, curled in a fetal
position, unresponsive. The official report would indicate that
Gannaway, 45, died of burns.
</P>
<P>
   Warmerdam had been flying with Gannaway for a month and a half.
He liked him, especially his sense of humor and his devotion to his
wife and kids, whom he talked about always. He also had enormous
respect for him as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   To Warmerdam, a 28-year-old Californian, flying wasn't merely a
job, it was his passion and his craft. He had moved beyond flight
school and Piper Warriors and was living out a childhood dream. His
wife cheered him on, and his final words before impact were a
tribute to her: ``Amy, I love you!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he was trapped in the cockpit, Warmerdam concentrated on
procedure: The captain is dead, the chain of command comes to the
first officer. We are in the middle of nowhere ... He reached for
the small hatchet stowed for emergencies, but he barely had room to
swing it. Breaking a 4-inch hole in the thick glass side panel
exhausted him.
</P>
<P>
   As smoke filled the cockpit, Warmerdam cried out, ``I need some
help!''

THE MICROSOFT-INTEL CHRONICLES: RIFT AND RECONCILIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is not merely a legal prizefight. With its
parade of witnesses and mountains of documents, it has opened a
window to the inner workings of Microsoft Corp. and how it deals
with the rest of the computer industry, raw material for a
digital-age ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's episode: Family Feud.
</P>
<P>
   The story told in a federal courtroom in Washington was how,
from the spring of 1995 to the summer of 1996, an extraordinary
rift developed between Microsoft and Intel Corp. _ partners in the
most lucrative business relationship in modern capitalism _ and how
it was patched up.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, people in the computer industry knew about the
Microsoft-Intel split over multimedia software developed by Intel,
called ``native signal processing,'' or NSP.
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of the rift, its significance and the personal
animosities involved were not really apparent until last week with
the testimony of an executive of Intel and internal e-mail and
documents from both companies that were submitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The crack in the partnership was repaired personally by the
chief executives of the two companies, Bill Gates of Microsoft and
Andrew Grove of Intel, over lengthy dinners, which included
shouting matches and frequent e-mail dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Intel backed down from a technology initiative that
Grove once described in an e-mail to Gates as ``key to the growth
of the PC industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust issue in the case is: Why did that happen? The
government argues that the Intel episode demonstrates how Microsoft
unfairly uses its market muscle to bend the industry to its will _
in this case even Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so sinister, Microsoft scoffs. Intel, Microsoft says,
was eventually persuaded to stop pushing a misguided technology
effort that could have hobbled the rollout of new personal
computers running Windows 95, the operating system Microsoft
released in August 1995. It was a decision that assuredly helped
Microsoft, the company admits, but it was also in Intel's
enlightened self-interest because the giant chip maker's main
business is selling new computers powered by Intel microprocessors,
and the increased demands of each new iteration of Windows sends
buyers scurrying to buy more powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft and Intel often debate which technology
standards to champion. But the debate over NSP became a more public
and a more significant issue than most. Intel's senior executives
had declared at industry conferences that NSP could help encourage
more households to buy personal computers because improving audio
and video performance would make ``the PC sing and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a software effort, NSP was clearly seen by Microsoft as
an unwelcome foray into its domain. ``The main issue was that it
was crucial software that Microsoft did not control,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail submitted in court sheds light on the ambivalence in
the Microsoft-Intel relationship, painting an environment in which
they circle each other warily. There is mutual distrust and
personal sniping on both sides. Yet ultimately, the benefits to
both sides of the sometimes bumpy ``Wintel'' partnership led them
back to a pragmatic accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1995, Microsoft had awakened to the potential
significance of Intel's NSP effort. After a meeting with Microsoft
executives, Gerald Holzhammer, an Intel executive, wrote in an
e-mail to his colleagues on April 13, 1995, that Microsoft was
``upset with us being in `their' operating system space _ no
surprise there.''
</P>
<P>
   By May, Gates decided to protest directly to Grove. In an e-mail
on May 25, 1995, Gates called NSP ``a significant problem here that
is on a path to get a lot worse.'' Clearly upset by software being
developed at the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore., he
complained to Grove, ``I don't understand why Intel funds a group
that is against Windows 95.'' Later, he added, ``In software you
have a group that won't allow us to lead and has all the prestige
and profits of Intel to drive them forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Gates' e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft
executive, noted on the same day that there was ``a strong faction
within Intel'' that wanted to use NSP as a step toward expanding
Intel's intellectual property claims in the industry. ``We have to
be very careful about this,'' Maritz wrote in his e-mail to Gates
and others, ``given our recent discussions about needing balance to
Intel in the market'' _ an apparent reference to Microsoft's work
with other chip makers to keep Intel from becoming more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Grove made his appeal for NSP to Gates. Terming
it ``key to the growth of the PC industry,'' Grove added that while
Microsoft and Intel had ``differences of opinion on the detailed
approach,'' he was confident that the two companies could resolve
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a philosophical digression, Grove wrote, ``I think Microsoft
and Intel have special responsibilities toward the PC industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added: ``If you believe that what we are trying to do
is good for the industry, please help us (plural us: Intel and
Microsoft and whoever else needs to participate) achieve it. Merely
being critical of what we have undertaken is not helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 1995, Maritz wrote to Ron Whittier, an Intel
executive, to inform Intel of Microsoft's stance on NSP in no
uncertain terms. Microsoft, he wrote, had told personal computer
makers that ``we have major issues with NSP and our advice to them
is NOT to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1995, Gates sent an e-mail to a group of Microsoft
executives briefing them on a three-hour dinner with Grove two days
earlier in San Jose, Calif. ``Fundamentally,'' Gates began, ``Intel
and Microsoft have not been doing a very good job of working with
each other in most areas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem between us right now is NSP,'' Gates wrote.
``We are trying to convince them to basically not ship NSP.''
</P>
<P>
   Not known for being awed by the intelligence of others, Gates
included an aside about Grove: ``Although Andy is super-smart in
software-related areas and in some aspects of the PC market, it is
amazing what he doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   By August 1995, when Windows 95 was released, Microsoft's
pressure on Intel and personal computer makers to step back from
NSP had succeeded, Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president
testified last week. By then, McGeady said, he believed Intel's NSP
program had been ``shot in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 18, 1995, e-mail, Gates told several executives that
Intel felt that after Microsoft's ``NSP chill'' personal computer
makers would not do anything to fine-tune their machines to exploit
Intel's new multimedia chip, the MMX, for Windows 95 ``unless we
say it's OK.'' Gates added, ``This is good news,'' because it meant
the computer makers ``are listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular meetings between Gates and Grove continued. While
conflicts persisted, especially over what Microsoft viewed as
Intel's support for its rivals in the Internet software business,
like Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., the
Microsoft-Intel relationship clearly was on the mend after the NSP
issue was settled.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, 1996, Gates wrote an e-mail to his senior executives,
briefing them on a two and a half hour meeting he had had two days
earlier with Grove. ``Our relationship with Intel is advancing on
many fronts,'' Gates began in a lengthy e-mail sent at 10:26 p.m.
on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The strengthening of the Microsoft-Intel relationship was a
message Gates was eager to communicate to a wider audience. He and
Grove had recently given a chummy performance for Fortune magazine.
He passed this along in his e-mail to his colleagues: ``The Fortune
magazine coming out in a week features a joint interview with Andy
and I where we are very friendly to each other.''

   DEATH-PENALTY-DEBATE (Chicago) _ In the 22 years since the
nation resumed executions, the anti-death penalty movement has been
battered and bloodied. But on the edge of Lake Michigan this
weekend, death penalty opponents mounted a public relations
counterattack, bringing together for the first time 28 of the 72
men and two women who have been released from death rows across the
country since 1976, usually after many years on the soul-shredding
edge of extinction for crimes they did not commit. By Don Terry.

WHAT PRICE `E.R.' SYNDICATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When NBC decided to pay $13 million an episode to keep showing
new episodes of ``E.R.'' this fall, it made history: No one had
ever paid more for a show. And with the show's ratings still by far
the best in television, the network is at least getting value for
price.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC was not the only network spending big money for the
series this fall. The cable channel TNT also paid a record price of
$1 million an episode for four years of repeats of the series.
Judging by the ratings from the first two months of the season, the
value-price quotient in this case is a bit more risky.
</P>
<P>
   The deals point up some continuing conflicts adding financial
pressure to the television business. Most shows do not make money
for the studios that produce them until their repeats are sold in
syndication; but the play of repeats in syndication frequently has
a negative effect on the continued life of a series in its
first-run episodes on a network. And in the increasing vertical
integration of the television industry, corporations are facing
tough decisions when their separate divisions have competing
interests in a show's future.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``E.R.'' TNT, one division of Time Warner, has
found it impossible to maximize its investment in the show's
repeats because of opposition from another division of Time Warner,
the Warner Brothers television studio. And the result has been a
ratings return for the ``E.R'' repeats that is not in the same
league with the ratings still being scored by the show's new
episodes on NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly if TNT was expecting ``E.R.'' to dominate cable
ratings the way it does broadcast ratings, the results would have
to be labeled disappointing. So far this season the repeats of
``E.R,'' which run on TNT each weeknight at 7 p.m., have pulled in
an average audience of about 1.6 million people a night.
</P>
<P>
   That is only marginally better than the 1.45 million the network
was averaging last fall with repeats of ``Lois and Clark,'' a
series nobody would ever accuse of having dominated broadcast
television. (It was canceled after three seasons.)
</P>
<P>
   But TNT's executives profess to be unworried. Barry Koch, vice
president of research for TNT, pointed out that the show's ratings
have been improving in recent weeks, having grown from just a 1.3
rating in homes that receive the channel to a 1.7 rating in the
most recent weeks. (A ratings point for TNT represents 745,000
homes, as opposed to a rating for a broadcast network, which
represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Koch also noted that ``E.R'' is greatly improving the channel's
performance among women viewers, especially in the
18-to-49-year-old group that the channel can sell best to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem TNT faces with ``E.R.'' is the 7 p.m. starting time.
On NBC the series runs at 10 p.m. as befits its status as a
heavyweight drama. TNT originally wanted to run ``E.R'' each
weeknight at 8 p.m. but was blocked from that plan when NBC
protested to Warner Brothers, fearing how the repeats of ``E.R.''
seven times a week at 8 p.m. might affect the new episodes once a
week at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   NBC contended that it had exclusive prime-time rights to
``E.R.,'' perhaps not much to ask when you are spending $286
million a year. Warner Brothers agreed and passed the word to its
sister company, TNT. TNT executives said they had a contract which
allowed them to run ``E.R.'' whenever they chose. They even floated
an idea to advertisers last spring that would have placed three
repeats of ``E.R.'' at 7, 8 and 9 p.m. on Thursday, leading into
the new episodes on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But after what one Warner executive described as ``pitched
battles'' in the company, TNT backed off all those plans and agreed
to limit exposure to 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said, ``We went into this with our eyes open.'' Without
citing any specific details of what rating TNT guaranteed
advertisers, he said: ``There were certain financial expectations,
which we are meeting. We're not doing a 5 rating, but we didn't
expect a 5 rating.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how much better the show could be doing if
it played in prime time clearly still intrigues TNT executives.
``We've looked at other options,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   So far those options are not available because of the
complications arising from the relationships between Time Warner
and NBC and Time Warner and TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said the one advantage to the 7 p.m. time period was that
``E.R'' could provide a better lead-in for TNT's prime-time
schedule every weeknight. TNT's results in prime time this season
are clouded because of its loss of National Football League games
this fall. Overall, the network's prime-time ratings are down more
than 25 percent, but Koch said that if football were excluded the
network would be even with where it was at this time last fall.

 &HT;    Computer does the calling to contact substitute teachers
 &HT;    By Malissa Kash
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ A $20,000 computer system is helping
Springfield City Schools alleviate a substitute teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Called Substitute Employee Management System, or SEMS, the
program has been in place since Sept. 21 and can call six
substitutes at one time.
</P>
<P>
   It works much like an automated banking line that gives out
checking and savings account information with a personal
identification number and a Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   When teachers, aides or secretaries call off, they enters the
date and a code for the reason, like personal business or illness.
The system then calls a list of qualified substitutes up to 60 days
in advance; the substitutes enter PIN numbers assigned by the
district and accept or decline the job.
</P>
<P>
   Before the system, Linda Paul, administrative secretary of
substitute services, had to call and find about 60 substitute
teachers a day. Now the computer does it for her, or substitutes
can call in and find jobs on days they are free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a problem with a shortage of subs,'' she
said. ``Now they can tailor this to their needs. If they are
proactive, they can work as much as they want. I'm finding a lot of
people are sitting down with calendar and calling in.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the district was in such need for subs that it
accepted anyone with a four-year college degree who was interested
in work as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's office is Mission Control for the system; so she has to
monitor it closely each day and work out any glitches. She says she
still makes the calls to find substitutes for principals or those
for long absences.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the system calls people as late as 10 p.m. or as early
as 6 a.m. for a job that day. The system now serves 900 employees
in the district. It will have all 1,200 employees on it by next
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Beard, building secretary at Hayward Middle School, was
responsible for training the building staff members on how to use
the system. She likes this system because she knows at 7:45 a.m. if
there are any unfilled positions in the buildings; teachers have to
cover classes that don't have substitutes, and she needs to notify
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be difficult, but it was easier than I
expected,'' she said. ``I can call in and know exactly who will be
in the building and if I have a sub or not. It's easier to plan the
day if you know who is going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The system has another advantage _ it can track ``unusual''
absences, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it improves the level of accountability,'' she said.
``Someone is going to abuse available leave regardless of whether
you're talking with a person or computer. There's a date and time
stamp. We may see emerging patterns for someone consistently off
Mondays and Fridays.

 TIME'S RISKY PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN EDITORS AND ADVERTISERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Whitaker, the new editor of Newsweek, brought up
the subject last week as one of his first acts as editor.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office, he said he was dismayed at recent
decisions at Time magazine that he said blur the line between
editorial and advertising priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty well known that they're doing things now
that seem tailored for specific advertisers,'' Whitaker said. He
was alluding to Time magazine's recent agreement with Ford Motor
Co., in which Ford will be the sole sponsor of new editorial
sections that focus on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine industry, ``Them's fighting words.'' In
response, Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, defended Time's
separation of powers as a ``great system of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of last week, however, magazine editors were
talking about Time's latest advertising coup. The first issue of
Time in the new year will be titled ``The Future of Medicine.''
There is only one advertiser: Pfizer Inc., the third-largest
pharmaceutical advertiser in the country, after Glaxo-Wellcome PLC
and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Pfizer spent $85.4 million last year
advertising in consumer magazines. The issue appears ``in cycle,''
as a regular weekly edition of the magazine. This is the first time
Time has had one advertiser in a regularly scheduled, not
additional, issue of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Single-advertiser special issues are not new, and they are
appearing with increasing frequency. Time did one with Sears, for a
special issue on women in 1990. In 1993, a special issue on
multiculturalism had one advertiser: Chrysler. The single
advertiser in a cyberspace issue in 1995 was AT&AMP;T. And
Glaxo-Wellcome was the advertiser both in the fall of 1996, for a
special issue on the frontiers of medicine, and in the fall of
1991, for one on the heroes of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   What has attracted attention is that not only is the issue a
regularly scheduled issue of Time magazine, but the
special-projects editor of Time, Barrett Seaman, who is overseeing
the issue on medicine, recently spent the day with Pfizer product
managers in their offices on East 42nd Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While both Isaacson and Seaman said in no way would Pfizer help
to shape the issue, Seaman nevertheless conceded that he was
disturbed by the trend toward having single advertisers featured in
an issue solely about the subject they address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled by the continuing movement toward having these
big advertisers on the subjects where the advertiser is in the same
business more or less,'' he said. ``But let's face it, those are
the kind of advertisers you're going to attract. If you do a
special issue on the future of the automobile industry, you're not
going to attract Eli Lilly.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaman said his visit yielded little for the editorial side of
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at the request of our ad sales people that I go spend a
little time and sort of as the editorial representative give them a
chance to talk a little bit about Pfizer,'' Seaman said in defense
of his visit. ``And I would also add that those conversations had
absolutely nothing to do with the editorial product that we're
working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Time reporter Christine Gorman paid a separate
visit to Pfizer's research department in Groton, Conn., to begin
reporting a story for the issue, Seaman said.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at several magazines said they were certain that Time
would not allow Pfizer to interfere with the contents of the issue,
but that the perception of the arrangement might be damaging in
readers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reader might ask questions,'' said Richard Smith,
chairman of Newsweek magazine. ``People who are writing, reporting
or editing _ line-editing _ should not be getting too close to
advertisers, even if that is just to head off the perception that
the advertiser has influence over the editorial copy.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek has produced its own single-advertiser issues: An
edition about children was sponsored by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the
eighth-largest advertiser in consumer magazines. According to a
former Newsweek staff member, who insisted on anonymity, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson executives and Newsweek editors attended planning meetings
for the special issue.
</P>
<P>
   E. Bruce Hallett, president of Time magazine, said Seaman
``certainly went over there and outlined the conception of the
editorial proposition, about which we are very enthusiastic, of
course. That's part of doing a good job for any advertising
customer. Conceptually, it's not different from putting Walter into
a roomful of advertisers to talk about the magazine. The editorial
is a core part of what we are selling to the advertising
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do a single-advertiser issue at all? Why not allow in a
multitude of advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the business of advertising,'' Hallett said, ``an
advertiser wants to draw attention to itself and I think that these
issues obviously telescope that kind of effect, so I think for an
advertiser, it's very attractive. It does what advertising is
supposed to do. It makes a statement on behalf of yourself about
who you are and what you stand for and what you do for your
customers. And I think this particular issue is a particularly good
statement of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaman added: ``I've been doing this for four and a half, five
years now, since we did multicultural American back in 1992, and
over the years I have finally learned the drill to walk the line
and still look at myself in the mirror every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacqueline Leo, president of the American Society of
Magazine Editors, which monitors practices by magazine editors,
said she was concerned by Seaman's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, on the outside, this doesn't look kosher,''
she said. ``It sends a signal to other advertisers in the field.
First, what happens to the other advertisers? You're eliminating a
lot of other people who may have wanted to be in that issue for
whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Siegal, an assistant managing editor at The New York
Times, said The Times has also published single-advertiser special
sections. ``We have on rare occasion in the past, published special
sections with single-advertiser sponsorship,'' Siegal said. ``The
news staff is not usually comfortable with it because it creates
the appearance of more influence than advertisers have in our news
columns.'' Asked whether an editor would ever participate in a
meeting or visit with an advertiser in a single-advertiser section,
he said, ``I can't imagine that we would allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leo of the magazine association said: ``I can't say that
they violated any specific guidelines of ASME, unless their editors
were urged to participate in something they didn't feel comfortable
with. But it doesn't bode well in the long run. Because it's a
perception problem. There's another guy down the street who will
say, `See, look what they did, that editor visited Pfizer, when's
my turn?' and there goes the whole ballgame.''

METEOR STORM POSES THREAT TO SATELLITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicken Little would love this one. The Earth is hurtling into
the path of a comet called Temple-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Earth will enter Temple-Tuttle's debris-strewn
backwash and will then, according to many scientists, witness the
most intense meteor shower in more than three decades. The
scientists who track Temple-Tuttle do not even call it a shower,
they call it a meteor storm. (While visible in Asia, the storm will
be obscured by the sun in North America during its peak hours.)
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of the storm, among millions of particles
moving at roughly 160,000 miles an hour, will be 600 or so man-made
satellites, which most people in the industrialized world have come
to rely on, wittingly or not, for entertainment, communication and
spying on one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the life of our
communications-oriented world that we have faced an environmental
threat of this scope,'' said Ian Rowe, chief executive of Crestech,
a nonprofit group based in Toronto that will track the storm for
the Canadian and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's being
disabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower about
one-3,000th the density of the storm predicted for Tuesday.
American consumers felt the impact of a single satellite's
malfunctioning in May, when the failure of Galaxy IV disrupted
pager service in much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effects
could be even more daunting. The spy satellites that are peering
down at Saddam Hussein could lose their ability to spot movements
of his troops. Television channels could become static. Those
relying on satellite navigation could become lost. Corporate
networks could shut down. Even the international telephone system,
which mostly relies on undersea cables, could be crippled. AT&AMP;T
Corp. says there are at least 14 countries, mostly in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, that can be reached by
telephone only by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite industry, however, and some of the companies that
rely on it, have a different reaction: no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this will be much of an issue,'' said Daniel
Marcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, the world's largest private
satellite company, which is controlled by the Hughes Electronics
unit of General Motors Corp. ``It should be a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen Stott, director for satellite engineering at
Intelsat, the international satellite consortium, said, ``Most of
the industry is of the opinion that we do not expect any major
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the odds say that the meteors _ known as the Leonids
because they seem to come from the direction of the constellation
Leo _ have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world's
satellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of the
sole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from inside
a Major League ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generally
smaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strong
electrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitive
components.
</P>
<P>
   So while the big satellite companies play down the threat, they
are still taking steps to protect their property. Deploying a
commercial communications satellite can cost around $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges face
the oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target. They plan to
shut down some systems, to keep operations simple.
</P>
<P>
   But Alastair Hamilton, who is responsible for distributing Cable
News Network as Turner Broadcasting System's senior vice president
for worldwide distribution technology, said some viewers still
might lose their signal for a few minutes Tuesday as satellites
recover from short circuits. He added, however, that he could not
get too agitated because there is so little he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the satellites are up there and there
is no way to hide them,'' he said. ``So we're going to really see
what happens. And the prevailing opinion is that this is not really
something that we should be losing a huge amount of sleep over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite how Col. Mike Kelly is handling the situation.
That is because he works for the owner of about a quarter of the
world's satellites: the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy commander of the 50th Operations Group at Schriever
Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Kelly helps run about
60 Air Force satellites worth about $40 billion. Kelly's charges
provide navigation services, communications for officials including
the president, and help in detecting missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   While Marcus of Panamsat and Gregory Clark, president of Loral
Space Communications, another big private satellite company, said
they expected no impact on their services, Kelly is more
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very unlikely that we'll lose a spacecraft on the
17th,'' he said. He added, however, ``I think it's probable that
we'll see some electrical problems that we'll have to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that could take anywhere from a few minutes to several
days. (Kelly's group does not manage any of the optical spy
satellites, he said. Those are generally handled by the
ultra-secretive National Reconnaissance Office, which refused to
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the private satellite companies, however, the Air
Force, according to Kelly, has decided not to change its normal
operating procedures substantially, except to be especially
watchful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be,'' Kelly
said. ``If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of the
happiest people in Colorado.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.
Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses
33 satellite-linked printing plants in the United States. Each
plant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is still
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crapshoot, you just don't know,'' he said. ``There's
nothing more you can do. There's not time. The only thing you could
do to put yourself in a risk-free situation is to put in a
terrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealt
with the phone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate with
eight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to use
terrestrial, or ground-based, communications. But rather than link
directly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem,
The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for the
printing plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis,
director for investor relations for New York Times Co. She added
that the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was one
of the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed by
the storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jones
spokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled by
Motorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federal
filing, though the company declined to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relevant experience we can use to base an
assessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause to
low-earth-orbit satellites,'' the Iridium filing said, referring to
the sort of satellites it uses. ``But such damage could be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit is
one in 5,000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, as
Rowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide true
peace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of the
night and get away with it,'' he said, by way of analogy. ``But you
might get K.O.'d by a truck.''

MARKET PLACE: WEBSTOCK `SPECULATING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In moonshots heard throughout cyberspace, the stocks of two
newly public companies soared last week as investors once again
rushed to buy up the promise of the Internet. Small investors,
especially those glued to their computer screens, pushed the prices
of many Internet stocks to levels that not only seemed to defy
gravity but also common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The two latest arrivals were among the biggest beneficiaries of
the general enthusiasm for anything Internet. The stock of
Theglobe.com Inc., a New York company that helps people design Web
pages, raced from its initial offering price of $9, to hit $97,
before closing on Friday at $63.50. Its astounding 606 percent gain
marked the best first-day performance for any initial public
offering, excluding the tiniest offerings, according to the
Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J. Its performance was more than
twice that of any other new stock.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe's spectacular debut followed an earlier display by
another fledgling Internet outfit, Earthweb Inc., which gained 247
percent on Wednesday, its first day of trading. Its stock closed on
Friday at $67, nearly five times its initial offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuations being ascribed to these very young companies
make almost no sense,'' said Lise Buyer, an analyst at Credit
Suisse First Boston, who likens the current frenzy over the
Internet to the mania for tulips in Holland during the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com, for example, now has a market value of $622
million, despite the fact that it had $11.5 million of losses on
$2.7 million of revenues for the first nine months of the year. The
company ``has a debatable business model, and it's a junior
Geocities,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, who is concerned by the ability of very small
companies to go public and find willing buyers for their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Helping propel these stocks upward is the limited number of
shares being sold in these offerings. Theglobe.com, for example,
offered only 3.1 million shares. Companies offer a small number of
shares if they believe a secondary offering, with a much higher
stock price, can be a source of future capital.
</P>
<P>
   With demand so great for these stocks, there appears to be a
shortage of supply. The performance of Theglobe.com ``would never
have happened if you did not have the Internet feeding frenzy,''
said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in
Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are are piling into Internet stocks may believe
they are actually reducing their risk because they think that these
companies will prosper, no matter what happens in Asia or Latin
America or where interest rates are headed. ``In almost a perverse
way, Internet stocks have become a safe haven for technology stock
investors,'' said Jonathan Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who
believes many Internet companies do ultimately have great
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for Internet stocks may also be reawakening
interest in the market for initial public offerings, which suffered
along with the rest of the stock market earlier this year when many
investors ran from risk. Theglobe.com, for example, had postponed
its offering last month. But when Earthweb was so eagerly received,
the underwriters ``ran it up the flagpole,'' said John Fitzgibbon,
editor of IPO Reporter, a New York newsletter on initial offerings,
who thinks other companies may also try now to go public.
</P>
<P>
   And many investors may simply be trying to go along for the
ride, even if they do not have the benefit of getting the stock at
its initial offering price. ``If you get in early and sell, you
will make money,'' said Ms. Buyer of Credit Suisse First Boston.
The danger is that some investors may not know when to make an
exit; instead, they may be caught up in a sudden change in market
sentiment _ and lose money _ while waiting unsuccessfully for a
greater fool to relieve them of their shares at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long does it go on?'' Ms. Buyer asked on the latest
Internet frenzy. ``It could go on for years. It could go on for
hours.'' But, she said, investors should realize that they really
are taking risks with their money, because the stocks of many of
these companies could tumble on the slightest dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not investing,'' she said. ``This is speculating.''

`WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED': PERSPECTIVE AT THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of John Maddox's arresting new book, ``What Remains to
Be Discovered,'' is in one sense self-contradictory, simply because
you can't foresee what must still be obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, for 23 years the editor of the journal Nature and now
its editor emeritus, is the first to concede this point. In his
introduction, he reviews the high points of all that has been
discovered in the last four centuries, and he emphasizes how little
of what was to come was discerned in the years 1700, 1800 and 1900.
``The record of previous centuries,'' he concludes, ``suggests that
the excitement in the years ahead will spring from the answers to
the questions we do not yet know enough to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he writes, if ``the nature of the discoveries that
will deepen understanding of the world cannot be perfectly
anticipated,'' those discoveries will tend to ``spring from current
understanding, and usually from contradictions that have become
apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   So he sets as his task in ``What Remains to Be Discovered'' a
review of the current understanding of and apparent contradictions
in the areas he identifies as ``Matter,'' ``Life'' and ``Our
World.'' He asks the big questions and reviews the current status
of answers that have been proposed. How did the universe begin? How
does it work? What came first, the galaxies or the stars? How did
life begin? When did sexual reproduction arise? What is
consciousness? Memory? Imagination?
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, great progress has been made in offering
some answers to these questions. Einstein's ``general relativity
(gravitational) theory'' and the theory of quantum mechanics are
``perhaps the two outstanding intellectual achievements of this
century,'' Maddox writes. ``As a direct consequence of the
structure of DNA,'' he continues, ``both the internal working of
the cell and the mechanism of inheritance in plants and animals
(including the development of embryos from fertilized eggs), has
become susceptible to laboratory investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he adds, ``the past century has marvelously described and
cataloged the properties of the cells in the working brain as well
as its several separate structures.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he concludes, the more we have come to understand in these
various fields, the deeper are some of the contradictions that have
arisen. And out of these contradictions must come future
discoveries. For instance, he argues, the fact that the amount of
matter estimated in the universe ``obdurately falls short of
expectation'' suggests that ``there is more to empty space than the
name suggests'' and that out of it may come ``what many physicists
refer to as a `new physics,' a physics regulated by principles not
yet imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   For another instance, he argues, the more that is understood
about genetics, the more complex appears the challenge of
``understanding how a particular sequence of DNA determines the
character of the organism to which it belongs.'' He concludes:
``Already it seems probable that the protein products of most genes
will turn out to have more than one function _ that for which they
are named and several others. Like the cell biologists, geneticists
will be driven to make computer models of the genome before they
will be able to make sense of all this complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he argues, for all that has been learned about brain
cells, ``how the brain functions both in the everyday world and as
the human attribute of mind is hardly clearer now than at the
beginning of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   For Maddox these gaps and contradictions suggest how science
will progress. To his limited predictions he adds practical
suggestions. ``Cosmology has a crying need of an accurate map of
the nearby universe,'' he writes. Progress must also be made on the
Human Genome Diversity Project, a debated plan to study
systematically the genetic structure of different populations. ``It
is potentially a way,'' he says, ``of uncovering in great detail
the cultural and even ethnic history of Homo sapiens.''
</P>
<P>
   And the human mind should be further modeled by means of
computers, the author's implication being that by this means such
mysteries as long-term memory and imagination will eventually be
cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   More practically still, Maddox concludes his book by envisioning
four potential calamities to humankind and by proposing what might
be done to avoid them. These are climatic change resulting from
``the accumulation of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere''; the
rise of ``novel and resurgent infections''; the possibility of
``meteoric impacts on the surface of the Earth,'' and the possible
unstableness of the human genome, meaning that people could simply
cease to exist, there being no guarantee that even the fittest of
species must survive indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality,'' the author concludes, ``there is no reason why
any of the potential calamities now foreseen, even the most scary
among them, cannot be avoided. But avoidance requires vigilance and
courage. Will we have enough?''
</P>
<P>
   A reader sizing up Maddox's book 100 years from now would no
doubt be struck by how little he was able to foretell. But ``What
Remains to Be Discovered'' is still useful as a summing up of
present knowledge. Future readers will gain perspective on the
latest millennial juncture in history. Present readers can learn
just how much we already know.

GET READY FOR E-BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIGICOM-COLUMN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepare for the next Internet feeding frenzy. Sharks from
several industries are already circling the nascent market for
products and services that will enable consumers to receive and pay
their monthly bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic billing systems are expected not only to save
merchants and banks billions of dollars in printing, paper and
postage costs, but also to save time and deliver a new level of
convenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And the customer base is already a captive audience. By some
reports, 60 percent of the 62 billion pieces of first-class mail
delivered annually by the U.S. Postal Service are bills.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating, verifying, creating, mailing, collecting and
processing those 37 billion statements have been estimated to cost
$370 billion _ an average of $10 a bill, according to the report
``On Bills, Banks and Bill (Gates),'' published by Diamond
Technology Partners (www.diamtech.com), a Chicago-based consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond estimates that presenting and paying bills
electronically could save 10 percent of that amount _ a huge
incentive for large companies, in particular, to embrace e-billing.
Merchants have already said they would be willing to pay as much as
40 cents a bill for such a service, instantly creating a market
with a $15 billion potential.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Netscape Communications Corp. announced plans to
offer Web-based e-billing software for online sellers. Transpoint,
a joint venture of Microsoft Corp., First Data Corp. and Citigroup,
plans to introduce its e-bill service this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Integrion Financial Network, a consortium of banks,
financial services and technology companies including Checkfree,
IBM, RSA Data Security and Visa USA, is preparing to start an
e-bill pilot with one of its owners, Bank One, in January.
</P>
<P>
   One version of an e-bill system would allow merchants to send
monthly bills in an e-mail format that could be forwarded directly
to a customer running bill-payment software like Quicken from
Intuit. Another would allow consumers to view all their bills from
one Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential impact of e-bills could be much more
significant than cost savings and simple convenience.
</P>
<P>
   William Fenimore, chief executive and managing director of
Integrion, says that although e-bills are inevitable, such sweeping
change comes slowly to big financial institutions. ``The biller
community is further ahead than the banking community in terms of
distributing these bills and getting them paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that disparity presents an opportunity for the law of
unintended consequences to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Internet has given many different kinds of
companies _ from Microsoft and Intuit, to brokerage firms and
insurance companies _ the ability to offer financial services more
cheaply and without the regulations, including those governing
consumer privacy, that banks and other financial institutions must
obey.
</P>
<P>
   Because merchants and financial institutions are unlikely to
build e-bill technology themselves, many will be forced to yield
their precious customer data to a technology or service provider _
Microsoft's Transpoint venture, for example _ to run the system for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, companies like Integrion, with owners that are almost
all banks, are a hedge against that. But that hedge may not hold.
Once companies start delivering digital bills, says Gordon Bell, a
senior researcher for Microsoft, other opportunities present
themselves rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bell says he has for years encouraged Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, to create a version of the Checkfree service. ``The other
thing is to give WebTV away to do just this kind of thing, with a
bank account or whatever,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that such opportunities will forever change
the balance of power between customers and merchants. Referring to
software applications, Chunka Mui, a partner in Diamond Technology,
said, ``The real reason this is a killer app is because the
technology provides a platform for doing other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mui predicts that e-bill systems will start a new ``aggregator''
business that enables people to pay all their bills online in one
place, rather than with individual merchants all over the Web _ as
well as allowing those merchants to deliver precisely aimed junk
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these folks are talking about how this becomes the
marketing machine from heaven,'' he said. ``What they don't
understand is that once these bills are in digital form, they are
infinitely controllable by the customer. It won't take 25 seconds
for someone to realize, `I could make a lot of money selling a
filter for this junk.'''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, he said, ``It would only take another 25 seconds
to say, `Hey, if I work for the customer and not for the merchants,
maybe I can create an alliance of consumers.'''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there are few consumer bill aggregators. One new
start-up, Cyberbills.com in Santa Clara, Calif., recently began a
consumer service that sends customers all their bills
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Mui says that such a service _ started as a cost-saver for
merchants _ is actually ``stealth technology,'' a first step in
returning the power over personal information to consumers who are
tired of being bombarded with e-mail spam and junk advertising in
all media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about aggregating power,'' says Mui. ``It's not about
selling information to merchants. It's about going to the people
and saying, `I know what you've bought _ let's do price comparisons
for shopping, let's provide a direct connection to the seller when
you have problems, things like that. This bill becomes the
interface for so much _ it's a tremendous window onto the
electronic world.''

`A WEDDING IN BASRA': A COUPLE IN LOVE AMID IRAQ'S HARDSHIPS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday night's return to Iraq of Arthur Kent, who covered the
Persian Gulf war, is largely given, as the program's title reveals,
to ``A Wedding in Basra.'' It's a colorful if not especially
revealing look at a young couple, Sahar and Ali, and their extended
family, celebrating a love match in a country where there is not
much to celebrate, particularly as American ships, planes and
missiles were once again being gathered for an attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a casual, scattershot sort of report: a hint that the
Iraqis are doing some oil smuggling to evade the U.N. embargo and
bring in hard currency, which, it is suggested, is going into an
arms buildup; comments by a couple of Iraqis in exile on the iron
controls over the country's people, including the threat of
execution for going public with any criticism of Saddam Hussein
(``the paranoia of politically motivated spying,'' as Kent
characterizes the state of things); a review of the tensions
between U.N. inspectors and Iraqi officials; views of the
nationwide suffering, as children go without food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, who notes that like all foreign visitors he is diligently
accompanied by a ``minder'' or two to keep him from discovering
anything surprising, advances the case that the Iraqi people do not
love their ruler as much as they hate the sanctions that make life
grim. What with dire shortages and rampant inflation, survival is a
sometime thing. One man, apparently speaking for many others as
well as for the state, says his people are ``victims of the
politics of the U.S.A.'' Only those connected with the ruling cadre
are prospering.
</P>
<P>
   And back Kent goes to the wedding festivities. Even while
enjoying the preparations (Ali bids a loving farewell to his
barber), Kent is gloomy about prospects of winning the hearts and
minds of many Iraqis. However the current crisis turns out, this
guest at the wedding says, ``Our role is a failure.''

READER'S DIGEST ART AUCTION EXPECTED TO BRING $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes two sidebars   at end)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. _ The eyes of the art world are trained on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan, 35 miles south of this leafy
Westchester suburb. That's where Sotheby's will conduct what's
likely to be one of the richest auctions of corporate art in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   Up for bid Monday will be 38 works of art_ among them, paintings
by Cezanne, Monet, Renoir, Modigliani, Matisse, and van Gogh _ that
are expected to bring close to $100 million to their owner, the
Reader's Digest Association. One other work of art will be sold
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say which comes as more of a surprise: that
America's favorite source of homespun wisdom and human interest,
Reader's Digest (located where else but in a town called
Pleasantville), should find itself the center of attention at
high-cultural ground zero; or that its parent company, owner of the
world's most popular publication, with 100 million readers of its
48 editions in 19 languages, needs to liquidate assets as part of a
major corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Digest had enjoyed almost constant
circulation increases and astonishing profitability during its 76
years of existence. The Wall Street Journal once called it ``the
top publishing success since the Bible.'' And, like the magazine
itself, such Digest features as ``Life in These United States'' and
``It Pays to Enrich Your Word Power'' long ago entered the common
currency of American culture, ``part of the air people breathe,''
in the words of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Christopher
Willcox.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this monument to steady-state publishing in the Big Bang
world of '90s media has had a rocky past few years. ``The recent
history has been rather painful,'' says John Mack Carter, director
of new magazine development for Hearst Corporation and a longtime
friend of DeWitt and Lila Acheson Wallace, the legendary couple who
founded the Digest and ran it for nearly 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company announced it would reduce its dividend
by 75 percent and lay off several hundred staffers from its
5,600-member work force. This followed such previous cost-cutting
measures as sale of its corporate jet. Reader's Digest Association
stock, an investor favorite when the company went public in 1990,
has gone from a high of $56.375 in December 1992 to a low earlier
this year of $16.25. On Friday, shares closed at $23.75. Writing in
this year's annual report, chairman and chief executive officer
Thomas O. Ryder describes the Digest as ``a world-class company
grappling with world-class challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which provides roughly a quarter of corporate
revenues, has fared better than some other parts of the company.
But it, too, is making changes. Next year its circulation rate base
will fall by 2.5 million copies, to 12.5 million. In May, the
magazine unveiled a new design most notable for putting a
photograph on the cover (a first for the Digest). Less visibly,
Willcox has been working to give the magazine a more contemporary
feel. A feature on computer humor, Virtual Hilarity, was introduced
last year. Laughter, the Best Medicine can offer a dose of David
Letterman's Top 10 list.
</P>
<P>
   Changing a magazine with such a long tradition and successful
formula is ``extremely tricky,'' admits Willcox. ``We have to
connect with the younger generation coming up. But we have to be
careful to keep the core audience who value us for the `reads.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a media world whose two most sacred words are ``Tina'' and
``Brown,'' the Digest _ resolutely unhip and cheerfully retrograde
_ can seem like the ultimate editorial throwback. ``Reader's Digest
stands for the good guys,'' Willcox says. ``We try not to do that
in a Pollyanna way or to avoid controversy. Still, our basic
purpose is to encourage people, inspire them, give them hope.''
</P>
<P>
   That same purpose motivated the Wallaces when they founded the
Digest in a basement under a Greenwich Village speakeasy in 1922.
Back then, the magazine didn't seem stolid and staid but almost
revolutionary, and the Wallaces played their part in the post-World
War I transformation of media culture. As much as Time (founded in
1923), H.L. Mencken's American Mercury (founded in 1924), or The
New Yorker (founded in 1925), the Digest marked a radical departure
for American magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a fast-paced world,'' DeWitt Wallace said in
1919, words that sound even more pertinent today than then,
perhaps. ``People are anxious to get at the nub of things. I intend
to search it out for them.'' And so he did, taking the bus each
morning to the periodicals room of the New York Public Library on
42d Street to copy out articles he thought suitable for his new
magazine, condensing them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue had a print run of 5,000 copies and promised
subscribers ``thirty-one articles each month from leading
magazines. Each article of enduring value and interest, in
condensed and compact form.'' What search engines are to the
Worldwide Web, a means of quickly navigating the information
landscape, and what USA Today is to daily journalism, a vigorously
upbeat and tightly edited distillation of the world around us,
Reader's Digest was three-quarters of a century ago. It proved an
immediate success, and allowed the Wallaces to move the Digest to
Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   The innovations did not stop there. The Digest, which
practically invented direct-mail marketing, was creating synergies
long before anyone knew what the word meant. ``Remember when you
look at Reader's Digest, the magazine is a relatively small part of
the whole thing,'' says Dennis McAlpine, a media analyst at the New
York investment firm of Josephthal, Lyon &AMP; Ross. ``The magazine is
really an entree, in many respects, to get people into the books
and home-entertainment, direct-marketing stuff.'' Though the
magazine remains the company flagship, almost two-thirds of
revenues now come from direct-mail offerings of books, music, and
videos.
</P>
<P>
   As important as innovation was to the Digest's success was an
almost 19th-century brand of idealism. ``The Digest always stood
above,'' says Carter. It strove to earn not just the loyalty of its
readers, but also their trust. The magazine didn't accept
advertising until 1955, for example, and didn't raise its original
cover price of 25 cents until 1957. The Digest was also a famously
generous employer. (Until a few years ago, all employees received a
complimentary turkey at Thanksgiving.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole different way of thinking about things,'' says
Peter Canning, author of ``American Dreamers: The Wallaces and
Reader's Digest'' and a former Digest managing editor. ``You really
did feel that the value of the magazine, of putting together the
best of popular media into a form that average people could read
and take value from, was an important function.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only comparable media enterprise is the Walt Disney
Company: another icon of American culture, committed to traditional
family values, and very much the product of a visionary founder.
Yet where Disney now stands as a model of media-empire success _ a
globally recognized brand name with holdings in television, film,
publishing, and theme parks _ the Digest struggles. Thirty years
ago, the situation was reversed, with Disney seemingly in decline
after the death of its namesake founder, and the Digest
flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Willcox, for one, finds the divergence in the two companies'
paths instructive. ``Disney has made some bets that have paid off
for them in a big way, and in areas where we have not made bets.
Probably, if you were to say the Reader's Digest needs to make some
bets, to move forward and grow the company, I'd say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes will they pay off? Can the company
come back? ``It is a very strong brand name, even among
non-readers,'' notes McAlpine. ``It's recognized. It has a high
degree of respectability and integrity behind the brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, though, whether that very strength of the
brand name is more blessing or curse. ``That special status is the
spine of the magazine,'' says John Mack Carter, ``and without that
strength, without that history of cultural impact, I'd hesitate to
say what (Reader's Digest) might be. On the other hand, the very
phrase `had a cultural impact' suggests something musty, something
that belongs in a frame.''
</P>

AN OFFICE FOR THE ART LOVER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. _ The 38 works of art that Sotheby's will
auction are the cream of an 8,000-work art collection that,
literally, covers much of the walls at Reader's Digest Global
Headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor walking down a corridor or into a conference room
might encounter a Roy Lichtenstein or Alex Katz lithograph, a
Fairfield Porter oil, or a photograph by Diane Arbus or Robert
Mapplethorpe (neither a name normally associated with the Digest).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every employee gets to choose two works for his or her
office,'' explains Marianne Brunson Frisch, curator of the Digest's
corporate art collection. ``The policy is a legacy of Mrs.
Wallace's concern for the staff and her feeling that art brightened
the work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lila Acheson Wallace's taste in art reflected the consistently
optimistic tone of the magazine she helped to found. Alexander
Apsis, cochairman of Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art
Department, describes the paintings at auction as ``happy, pleasing
pictures, full of joie de vivre,'' words that might apply to her
acquisitions generally.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine not only funded Wallace's purchases but also helped
to inspire them. ``All those fancy New Yorkers think of us as this
tacky little magazine in the stupid suburbs,'' she once told a
friend. ``That's why I buy these paintings _ to show these snobs
we're not so dumb.''

BY THE LIKES OF FALSTAFF, A BOOK ON SHAKESPEARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Harold Bloom was 15, he saw the Old Vic perform ``Henry IV,
Part 1'' on Broadway. Ralph Richardson played Falstaff and Laurence
Olivier was Hotspur (doubling in ``Henry IV, Part 2'' as Justice
Shallow). To this day, Bloom has no recollection of who played
Prince Hal (it was Michael Warre), but seeing Richardson was, for
him, a transcendent experience.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had already read many of the plays, that performance
began his lifelong love for Shakespeare and in particular for the
character of Falstaff. That love culminates 52 years later in
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is in a sense a tribute to what Richardson did to
me,'' Bloom said in a recent interview. This is his 23rd book and
the one, he said, on which his reputation ultimately will rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, Falstaff has become Bloom's alter ego.
A man of comparable girth and outrageousness _ intellectual and
linguistic as well as corporeal _ he looks like Falstaff, or,
rather, like the actor Charles Laughton might have looked in that
role. In antic moments, this polymathic professor and literary
critic refers to himself as Sir John Bloomstaff, enthusiastically
accepting any twinning of the two, even warming to a friend's
notion that the real author of ``The Invention of the Human'' is
Falstaff. One fully expects him to sprinkle his conversation with
``Zounds!''
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic Bloom fashion, the book is voluminous,
idiosyncratic and dutifully unscholarly, with no footnotes and not
even an index. He wants it ``to be useful to common readers and
common playgoers'' and not to those academics that he scathingly
criticizes. ``I don't want a single person, with a few honorable
exceptions, who ostensibly teach Shakespeare to even look at the
book. They're hideous ideologues, pseudo Marxists, pseudo
feminists, pseudo historicists and disciples of Foucault,'' ending
his list of enemies with the French philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bloom regards himself as a man without ideology, as
``a pure esthete.'' ``I care about Shakespeare,'' he said,
``because he not only meets the highest esthetic and cognitive
standards, he sets our esthetic and cognitive standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation as in the book, he is filled with highly
opinionated, often injudicious comments, like his suggestion that
``King John'' is a better play than ``Richard III.'' Comparing
Shakespeare to contemporary politics, he says that Newt Gingrich is
a parody of Gratiano in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' while Kenneth
Starr is ``Polonius on the outside, Iago on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   About Hamlet, he said: ``He is a coldblooded fellow who winds up
loving absolutely no one. He simply is the most intelligent
character in any work of literature I've ever read.'' About
Rosalind, the love of his Shakespearean life, he has no
reservations: ``She's wholly normative _ a miracle of healthiness,
good sense, lovability.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bloom, Falstaff is not the taproom roustabout who leads
Prince Hal astray, but a quintessential lover of life and a man of
great wit and acumen. ``I like him because he is alive beyond
belief,'' he said, quoting the character's line ``Give me life,''
and adding, ``How often have I said to a friend, `Before I knew
thee ... I knew nothing and now am I, if a man should speak truly,
little better than one of the wicked'?'' This was a case of
Falstaff's turning the tables on Prince Hal, suggesting that it was
Hal who had corrupted Falstaff.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bloom-scape, Hal is not a hero but a ``charming
villain.'' Bloom follows with a characteristically sweeping
statement, ``No king is a good guy, except for poor Lear.'' Among
the saddest lines in Shakespeare, of course, is Hal's regal snub of
Falstaff, ``I know thee not, old man.'' Mr. Bloom seems to take
that statement personally.
</P>
<P>
   Because the book deals in detail with his favorite Shakespearean
characters, in addition to Falstaff and Rosalind, Hamlet,
Cleopatra, Iago and Edmund the Bastard, as well as his favorite
plays (``Henry IV,'' ``Twelfth Night,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra''),
he thought about calling it ``The Characters of Shakespeare's
Plays,'' borrowing the title from a work by William Hazlitt. Then
he decided that ``The Invention of the Human'' was more specific
and more comprehensive, although to those unfamiliar with Bloom, it
might sound Frankensteinian rather than Bloomstaffian.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the title, he said that with writers before
Shakespeare _ with the exception of Chaucer _ characters did not
change inwardly: ``I think our kind of inwardness, which really
means our sense of personality, is a Shakespearean invention. He
more than prefigured our humanity, its quandaries and dilemmas.
Shakespeare so deeply pervades not just Western culture but by now,
so far as I can tell, all the world's culture.'' And wherever his
plays are done ``even people who are not overwhelmingly literate
recognize themselves and feel that Shakespeare has put them on the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   He is amazed not only at Shakespeare's productivity, ``39 plays
of which 24 or 25 are in every way masterworks,'' but also that no
one else ``has had so powerful, fecund and inventive a mind, such a
control of language and mastery of human psychology.'' He
continued: ``As Bottom says of his dreams, the plays are
bottomless. The miracle of Shakespeare is that he is all this and
he's also a popular entertainer. His plays sold out in his day, and
they will always sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadfastly, Bloom maintains that Shakespeare's characters are
capable of change, even a villain like Edmund in ``King Lear.''
This, he said, was revolutionary in drama, and altered the
perception of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he himself had changed over the years, Bloom spoke
about the shifts in his role as a scholar and writer: ``I began as
a fierce Romantic revivalist of Blake and Shelley, in particular,
pushing aside T.S. Eliot and the New Critics as they were then
called. They seemed to be a kind of neo-Christian cabal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``middle phase,'' starting with his 1973 book, ``The
Anxiety of Influence,'' he became preoccupied with the question of
literary influence. In 1990, with ``The Book of J,'' he began his
third, religious phase. With ``The Western Canon,'' his territory
was all of Western literature. At the end of that book was a
greatly disputed list of the most valuable works of literature. Now
he says: ``You don't need a list. All you need is Shakespeare.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's ``Shakespeare'' has been nominated for a National Book
Award, but as is often the case with his work it has received a
mixed critical reception. A review in The New Yorker said it made
more sense ``as an enraptured, incantatory epic than as a courteous
explication of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the interview, Bloom announced that he had
not read that entire review, but within minutes he was quoting from
it: ``He said that for those who like me, I was a Prospero of
criticism waving his wand; and for my detractors, I was nothing but
a baffled and superannuated old Lear.'' Tossed between ``The
Tempest'' and ``King Lear,'' naturally he would prefer Falstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was a performance that turned Bloom into a
Shakespearean, with rare exceptions (Brian Bedford, Ian McKellen)
actors are not high on his list as interpreters. Nor are directors.
He called Peter Brook's historic gymnastic production of ``A
Midsummer's Night Dream'' ``a disaster,'' a word he ecumenically
applies to Kenneth Branagh ``in general.'' And he said he walked
out on Ralph Fiennes' ``Hamlet'' because he thought that the actor
played it as if ``he were a poor, spoiled little rich boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom insists that he wants better productions, but his
theatrical visits have been sporadic and exclusionary. He added
with evident pride, ``I missed as many performances as I could,
after a certain point.''
</P>
<P>
   He is completely dismissive of several Shakespearean plays,
beginning with ``Titus Andronicus,'' saying he does not want to see
it again unless it is spoofed by Mel Brooks. One of many innovative
productions that he did not see was Deborah Warner's version at
Stratford-on-Avon. It stressed not the play's grotesquerie but its
heightened sense of reality, turning Titus into a peasant warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bloom see Sam Mendes' version of ``Troilus and
Cressida,'' or Peter Brook's ``Timon of Athens,'' which illuminated
the play through the prism of the modern liberal dilemma: Timon as
an easy mark. In each case, a director shed new light on a problem
play. Bloom also missed Robert Stephens' authoritative portrayal of
Falstaff in Adrian Noble's 1992 production at Stratford-on-Avon.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Bloom emphasizes the text. Growing up in the Bronx in
a Yiddish-speaking family, he taught himself to read English before
he was 5. An omnivorous speed reader, he could cover 500 pages in
an hour, he said, and also has a prodigious memory.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 34 years, he has been teaching at Yale (and
concurrently at New York University), and for the last 20 years he
has been teaching Shakespeare: ``I told the very amiable current
president of Yale that I intend to be carried out of my last Yale
class in a body bag, hopefully many years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In their home in New Haven, Conn., he and his wife, Jeanne,
``drown in books,'' some 60,000 with thousands more in his two Yale
offices. His next book, a change of pace, will be a slim volume
entitled ``How to Read and Why.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his affinity for Shakespeare, he was asked if he
would have preferred to have lived during the Elizabethan Age. He
answered in the negative: ``Obviously if one is Jewish, it is
better to be alive in either 19th- or 20th-century America than
anywhere else in human history. I will settle for having been born
in 1930 in the East Bronx. Transpose me back to some other period,
and I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But, were he to time-travel, he might find Falstaff in a pub
lifting a tankard. Was there, in fact, a real Falstaff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``William Shakespeare, himself. The fat man
was inside the skinny fellow. There was more of Shakespeare in
Falstaff than in Hamlet, or in Rosalind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's idea of Arcadia is the Forest of Arden in ``As You Like
It.'' His voice brimmed with emotion as he merged with his favorite
character and recounted Bloomstaff's Dream: ``To be Sir John
Falstaff, not rejected in dead of grief, but still boisterous and
sitting on a tree stump in the Forest of Arden, trying to outfox
Rosalind.''

PATENTS: STERILIZING FLOSS; KEEPING TRACK OF MEDICAL RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people dislike flossing their teeth, and would probably
have to admit that they do so irregularly. Flossing has such a bad
image that people tend to floss erratically even when they
understand that it is the only way to really clean below the gum
line. Recent research linking periodontal disease to heart attacks
probably will not change that.
</P>
<P>
   But Sean Dix is hoping that those people who do use dental floss
will prefer a sterile product. Dix is a former diamond cutter
turned inventor who won a patent a few years ago for inexpensive
plastic rings that aid flossing. He had trouble flossing himself
because of a skin condition: wrapping thin floss around his
fingertips further irritated them. So he designed the rings, won a
patent and got his product into drugstores across the country, quit
his diamond cutting job and became a full-time floss entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dix, who lives in New York, is expanding his business to
include his newly patented sterile dental floss. His latest
invention started when he was looking for a way to produce precut
segments of floss that would fit between his rings. That is when he
learned how floss is traditionally manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, floss is produced in spool form using machinery
slightly altered from the sewing thread industry,'' Dix explained.
``Thus, the spools are spun out into a bin six inches from the
floor.'' The spools are then assembled into individual packages by
hand, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with hand assembly is that even though workers
wear gloves they still have the probability of dropping the spool
on the floor or scratching their face and then handling the
spools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers also coat floss with beeswax, Dix said, which
``as an organic compound, naturally decays and promotes the growth
of mold.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting product, Dix said, meets the Food and Drug
Administration's requirements of what is known as a 10-3 sterility
assurance level. Dix said that meant floss manufacturers had to
practice ``good manufacturing procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An interesting comparison would be that Band-Aids are held by
FDA regulation to a 10-6, meaning zero microbes,'' he said. ``The
reason being that Band-Aids come into contact with the blood
through compromised tissue, much like floss comes into contact with
blood in the soft tissues beneath the gum line.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Dix said his market research had found that
``100 percent of those surveyed said they would choose a sterilized
floss over a nonsterilized floss if given the option.'' But he also
acknowledged that the National Institute of Dental Research had not
studied the possibility that floss can transmit bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dix's patent, floss assembly is automated. Parallel
strands of floss are stretched from master spools ``such that the
strands resemble a web coming off a loom,'' Dix writes in his
patent. The floss is laminated with two layers of a glassine
substrate that can be sterilized. Beads of melted adhesive are
dabbed on the floss at intervals, and then the web is cut at those
spots to create floss segments with sealed tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no human contact with the floss,'' so it stays clean,
he said. The master spool of floss and the paper used to package it
are loaded onto the machine at the same time, so that it can
produce packages containing 100 floss segments each. Dix received
patent 5,819,767.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Track Of Medical Data
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Stuart Bowie was visiting Laramie, Wyo., when a car hit
his vehicle broadside. The crash killed his two dogs, who were
riding in the back seat, but Bowie escaped with four broken ribs.
At the hospital emergency room, however, his blood pressure dropped
dangerously and a surgeon thought he might have internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from my Pennsylvania driver's license and Blue Cross
card, the physicians were treating me blind,'' Bowie, who lives in
Wallingford, Pa., remembered. ``I was in semishock, and they had no
way of knowing I have hypertension or any other factors which could
modify, preclude or obviate the need for a given procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the doctors had to order an array of tests that might not
have been necessary had they known his medical history. After
recovering, Bowie realized that in an emergency, time is often lost
to basic tests as doctors struggle to reach a diagnosis. Even
people who are familiar with their own medical history might end up
unconscious in an emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   That lead him to acquire a patent for a computer system that
uses a ``medical data smartcard'' bearing a person's entire medical
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S.A. has the finest medical technology, hospitals and
physicians, but an antique paper system of medical history
record-keeping,'' he said. ``Since the medical history is 90
percent of the diagnostic ball-game, the lack of a workable system
is dangerous, deprives indigent persons of care and adds
tremendously to the cost of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowie hopes an invention created by Sylvio Eberhardt, a
professor at Swarthmore College, will change that. Bowie financed
development of the research behind the patent, and then bought the
rights to the invention from Eberhardt.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a network of computers and a credit card-sized
data storage device. Information is loaded, updated and maintained
on the card via a magnetic strip or through the kind of laser
embossing used to make compact discs. The smartcard would carry
information about medical conditions like diabetes,
hospitalizations or other treatments, surgeries, prescription
drugs, allergies or any other part of a medical history.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, nurse or emergency technician would slip the card into
a computer terminal, and the data would be displayed on a monitor,
printed or transmitted to other computers. Information that
identified the patient could be encrypted to protect privacy in the
event that the data were downloaded to a hospital hard-drive or
transmitted via modem to another computer.
</P>
<P>
   The invention, which Bowie intends to market, received patent
5,832,488.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference Florida State (no. 1) and Tennessee (2), and almost no
difference between Texas A&AMP;M (4) and UCLA (5).

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the end of the Persian Gulf War, Russia has
resolutely opposed U.S. and British efforts to punish Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his failure to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that
have taken this position -- the others being China and France --
Russia has been among the most stalwart of Iraq's allies and a
diplomatic middleman between Washington and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Moscow is motivated global political stature and
domestic economics.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing Iraq's agenda, and opposing the United States, Russia
is able to flex its diplomatic muscle -- among the few strengths
the faded superpower has left.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also looks to the day when United Nations sanctions are
lifted. Its own economy in crisis, Russia sees urgently needed
economic potential in relations with Iraq as a partner in oil
production and a buyer of Russian arms.
</P>
<P>
   Before the economic crisis hit Russian in August, Russian oil
companies reportedly had signed an estimated $10 billion in
preliminary contracts with Iraq for the day when sanctions are
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Iraq owes Russia about $7 billion for arms
purchases dating back to the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s, when
the Soviet Union was a major arms supplier. Iraq cannot begin to
repay those debts until it can again export the bulk of its oil,
now forbidden under the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the current crisis, over the weekend Russia played an active
role in seeking to clarify Iraq's intentions to the five-member
Security Council after Saddam announced that U.N. weapons
inspectors could reenter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in Moscow said Iraq's letter to the Security
Council was unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baghdad's unequivocal reply provides the sound basis for a
political settlement over Iraq,'' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Viktor Posuvalyuk said on the Ekho Moskvy radio station Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grasping the meaning of the text that (Iraqi deputy prime
minister) Tariq Aziz turned over is like reading a legal, calm and
impartial document,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
warned that diplomacy must succeed. ``All other actions,
particularly unilateral, will only complicate the implementation of
the U.N. Security Council's resolution on Iraq,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright,
Ivanov said the U.S. and Russia have ``common final goals'' in
policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia agree that Iraq should abide by
U.N. sanctions -- put in place before and after the 1991 Gulf War
-- that require inspections to guarantee that Saddam Hussein is not
rebuilding a weapons stockpile that could threaten the oil-rich
region.
</P>
<P>
   But with a sympathetic tenor, Russia also has called for a
timetable to ease the sanctions and has played a prominent role in
defusing previous stand-offs.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar round of tension between Iraq and the U.N, last
February, Russian President Boris Yeltsin went so far as to warn
that U.S. strikes against Iraq could lead to another world war. And
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev warned that their differences over
Iraq could harm U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have toned down their talk this time.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin sent a letter to President Clinton on Saturday
expressing confidence that a diplomatic solution could be found to
ease the current stand-off, but placing wholly the blame for the
current tensions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus on Sunday for meetings with Syrian officials,
Sergeyev told Russian reporters that the use of force contemplated
by the United States and its allies ``will be counter-productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Russian diplomats negotiated an end to a previous
dispute over weapons inspections in Iraq. For Russia, the
achievement provided a measure of international regard it once
enjoyed as a superpower. Russia is eager to repeat the success, but
seems unwilling in the current stand-off to confront the United
States with the same confrontation tone.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently uncertain whether the United States would act
unilaterally, Russia evacuated the families of its Iraq-based
diplomats from Baghdad on Sunday, the emergencies ministry said.

ART FOR THE SAKE OF CHARITY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDWARD LEWINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the groups from Artwalk NY, a series of tours
through artists' studios, shuffled into Michael Brennan's little
work space on the Bowery. As the visitors settled in, Brennan, 33,
gamely tried to explain his paintings, rectangles of evenly applied
scarlet paint framing smaller rectangles of wild brush strokes and
dried ridges in blue and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't sign the painting, would you be offended if I
hung it vertically?'' asked Leny Struminger, a computer consultant
from East Brunswick, N.J. Brennan frowned. ``Yes, I would be,'' he
replied. ``I don't think there is any artist who doesn't think
about the top and the bottom of his paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   This lively collision of worlds on Saturday captured the spirit
of the fourth annual Artwalk NY, a three-part fund-raiser. Peter
Jennings, the ``ABC Nightly News'' anchor, and the actor Matt
Dillon presided over lectures and an auction. But the walking tours
were the centerpiece of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 60 artists _ from the famous, including Chuck Close,
Julian Schnabel and Jenny Holzer, to the not yet so famous, like
Brennan _ either donated works or opened their studios. The event
was run by the Coalition for the Homeless, which raised an
estimated $400,000 for its nine programs, including food
distribution and a summer camp. Last year's Artwalk raised
$370,000.
</P>
<P>
   The day began around 11 a.m. in the Puck Building at Lafayette
and Houston streets, where the critic Jerry Saltz entertained a
crowd of about 450 with an opinionated history of the art world in
the 1980s and '90s. ``Bodily fluids are extremely interesting,''
Saltz said, chiding certain artists for their use of unconventional
media. ``We just have to do more interesting things with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who was to interview Close onstage after Saltz's
speech, was sitting in the audience when he received an urgent
page. ``The White House is skeptical,'' he whispered, referring to
negotiations with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that morning.
``But it would be difficult for me to be pulled away from this for
too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he took the stage and spent the next 45 minutes questioning
Close, 58, who is celebrated for his large-scale portraits and
admired for his fortitude in facing an illness that left him partly
paralyzed in mid-career and forced him to invent new ways to make
his art. ``Are you surprised that you are still painting heads?''
Jennings asked at one point. Close replied in his typical deadpan:
``I never thought I would find it as satisfying as it has been. Of
all the variables that I could alter in my work, the one that was
the least interesting was the subject. Keeping the heads has kept
me engaged with everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, the crowd broke up into groups of about 15
and began to go on the art walks. These were 2{-hour walking tours
of the studios of 40 artists around the city, including Mark
Kostabi, Kate Shepherd, Alice Aycock, Pat Steir, Louis Mendez and
Vito Acconci. The walkers, some led by experts and some on their
own, visited three studios each. In many cases, the artists were
present to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The group that visited Brennan's studio was led by Lucas
Schoormans, an art dealer out of central casting, complete with a
German accent and a black turtleneck. In addition to Brennan's
Bowery studio, Schoormans took his group to the TriBeCa home of
Antonio Murado, a Spaniard who fills canvases with loops made
without lifting his brush off the canvas, and the SoHo studio of
Bing Wright, who makes collages of photographs of water and
flowers, as well as photos of wet windowpanes.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said it was an unusual experience for the artists
and for their guests. Ms. Aycock, whose studio loft is also her
home, said it had been a tiring but rewarding day. ``I don't know
how politicians do it,'' she said after being visited by three
different tours. ``You had to speak to people on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The long day ended on a sumptuous note as about 1,000 people
roamed the Puck Building, grazing on treats provided by 15
restaurants including Barocco, Alison on Dominick and Le Bernardin.
They also spent thousands of dollars at an auction conducted by
Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's. The most expensive
lot was ``Phil,'' a 1998 Polaroid portrait, mounted on aluminum, of
Philip Glass by Close which fetched $26,000. Close, who earlier in
the day had likened attending auctions of his work to watching cows
go to slaughter, had already gone home.

DON'T TAKE THAT $20 BILL TO THE LAUNDRY  
 BIOGRAPHICAL ENHANCEMENT  
 BONDING IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Treasury Department issued a redesigned $20 bill in
September, officials said the new notes would help thwart
counterfeiting by keeping ahead of digital printing technology. But
are they also thwarting digital automation?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no vending machines that accept twenties accept the
new bills. And it will be well into next year before they do, said
Thomas McMahon, vice president of Washington relations for the
National Automatic Machines Association, a trade group representing
vending-machine manufacturers and owners.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 merchandise vending machines accept $20 bills, as
do many change makers and digital vending machines, which dispense
so-called smart cards _ debit cards that can be used to do laundry,
pay highway tolls and use mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told by members they were not given samples early
enough,'' McMahon said. As a result, vending machine manufacturers
are scrambling to refit their machines, which can require fixes
from a simple software patch to an upgrade of the optical device
that reads the bills. Vending-machine manufacturers would have used
the samples to test their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Treasury Department invited vending-machine
manufacturers to bring sample machines to Washington to test the
new bills. About 100 companies participated in three sessions held
over the summer, said Edward Sheehan, a spokesman for the
Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given the bill-acceptor industry plenty of notice,''
Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury, he said, insists on maintaining control and would
never have agreed to send out samples of the new twenties before
Sept. 24, when the bills were released to the public. ``If we're
missing one note, there's an investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that it would take two to six months for
manufacturers to upgrade the machines. On average, the cost for
each machine is $50. He added that he hoped the industry and the
Treasury could work out a compromise before redesigned $1 and $5
bills come out in a few years. ``This is a major issue for us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, just be sure to carry plenty of change.

   The Name Was Doctored, and So Were the Credentials
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the name isn't the only thing made up about Robert
X. Cringely, the writer and television personality whose newest
series, ``Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet,'' begins on
PBS next week.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported last week that Mark
Stephens, who writes under the Cringely name, had not been a
professor at Stanford University and had not earned a doctorate
there, as he had claimed. He responded in a statement: ``The fact
is I never did finish those final touches on my dissertation and
therefore do not technically have a Ph.D. from Stanford. A new fact
has now become painfully clear to me: You don't say you have the
Ph.D. unless you really have the Ph.D.''
</P>
<P>
   Cringely is often identified as a former Stanford professor in
biographical materials and was described that way on the jacket of
his 1993 book, ``Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley
Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and Still Can't
Get a Date.''
</P>
<P>
   But a university spokeswoman said that Stephens had worked as a
teaching assistant and earned only a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for PBS, which runs a column by the writer and
promotes his television work, has now revised his online biography
(www.pbs.org/cringely).
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone knows, Cringely is a vital part of the Silicon
Valley scene,'' a spokesman for PBS said. ``We feel that the extent
to which he completed his doctoral requirements at Stanford and his
teaching status there do not affect the stature of his television
work.''
</P>
<P>
   A gossip column in the computer trade magazine InfoWorld gave
birth to the pseudonym Robert X. Cringely. Stephens inherited the
job as writer of the column in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cringely name was originally added to the magazine's
masthead as a joke earlier in the decade, ``to see how much mail we
got,'' said Sandy Reed, the editor-in-chief. It then became a
byline for the column.
</P>
<P>
   After Stephens was dismissed from the job in 1995, the magazine
sued him for trademark infringement for continuing to use the
Cringely name. He countersued, and in a settlement agreement he was
allowed to continue using the name as long as it was not used in a
competing publication.
</P>
<P>
   The column continues under the Cringely name, but with a
different author. Ms. Reed said the column would spoof the
revelations about Stephens in the upcoming issue.
</P>

   Reporters Get the Story on Silicon Real Estate
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the start of a new trend among
computer-industry chiefs, both Cisco's John Chambers and Oracle's
Larry Ellison have invited reporters to their homes for private
tete-a-tetes in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, held on Nov. 6 for some California-style bonding
at Chambers' rambling mansion in the foothills overlooking the
Silicon Valley, the high point was a series of contests.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen reporters were divided into a half-dozen teams,
and each was joined by an executive from Cisco. One task was for
each team to design an egg package that would allow the egg to
withstand being dropped from the roof of Chambers' garage. Two of
the teams flunked this engineering test.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, for his part, invited some 15 reporters to gather last
Wednesday at one of his two houses. (A third home, a palatial
estate in Woodside, Calif., is still under construction.) For this
event, the venue was Ellison's high-tech four-story pied-a-terre in
San Francisco's posh Pacific Heights neighborhood, overlooking the
Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ellison, known for an almost obsessive rivalry with
Bill Gates of Microsoft, conceded that he could not match the
38-car-garage expansiveness of Gates' legendary digital manse on
Lake Washington outside Seattle, the Ellison house does have
noteworthy electronic features.
</P>
<P>
   For example, visitors are greeted at a glass front door that is
made opaque by liquid crystal display technology. At a command from
inside, however, the opacity gives way to a clear pane that reveals
an interior courtyard that has been designed in the style of a
Japanese rock garden.

ABC'S NEWSCAST MAKES INROADS ON NBC'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most weeks in the past year, the competition among the
network evening newscasts has been a one-sided three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, NBC's ``Nightly News'' has been winning
consistently enough for the network to brand itself on the air with
impunity: ``America's News Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Today'' dominant in the morning, ``Meet the Press'' the
regular champion among the Sunday-morning talk shows, and
``Dateline NBC'' filling prime-time hours with solid ratings, that
claim has had ample justification.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in terms of the evening newscasts, some doubt is
beginning to creep in.
</P>
<P>
   While not a definitive trend, ABC's newscast, ``World News
Tonight,'' has interrupted the weekly march to the top by the
``Nightly News.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five weeks, ABC has been first in some category of
measurement in the newscast competition. It does not exactly
qualify as a winning streak because some weeks were unsettled by
NBC's coverage of the baseball playoffs and because NBC still eked
out a win in some categories, such as the 25-to-54-year-old age
group.
</P>
<P>
   For the last reported week, from Nov. 2 to Nov. 6, for example,
ABC had more overall viewers than NBC, with slightly more than 11
million to about 10.7 million for NBC. But NBC still had more
viewers in that 25-to-54 group, 4.32 million to 4.23 million for
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movement does seem to be toward ABC and away from
NBC. Compared to the same week last year, NBC was down 10 percent
and ABC was up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Has either broadcast undergone significant changes? Not really.
But NBC is not dominating the other networks with its prime-time
programs the way it has in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the NBC News department, the fall-off in prime time is
being blamed for at least some declines. ``Of course we're looking
at it,'' said one NBC executive, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   No other NBC show seems to have been affected by the network's
slide in prime time. Both the ``Tonight'' show and the ``Today''
show continue to win their time periods.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's margin in the news competition has been much thinner; both
CBS and ABC won an occasional week in the last year. That may have
made the newscast more vulnerable to NBC's downturn in prime time.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Eight people found themselves at a crossroads
in history Saturday, visibly uncomfortable with their task of
creating the first real government for an online world and
intimidated by the level of distrust _ sometimes outright animosity
_ they encountered when facing their constituents for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception on Friday evening, the members of the ad hoc
board that will establish a private system of Internet governance
huddled with one another, unsure how to reach out to the many
factions that have been battling for years over who will rule
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   They had reason to be intimidated. Many of these factions have
been quarreling for years. As the panel's chairwoman, Esther Dyson,
pointed out, a key goal of this first public meeting was to earn
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nearly 200 people who traveled from as far away as
Malaysia lined up at microphones to introduce themselves Saturday
morning, a single message to the new board came across loud and
clear: We don't trust you.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue did turn much more constructive as the day wore on,
and most of the group, despite their criticism, expressed a
willingness to work with the board and offer specific suggestions
for insuring that the new nonprofit group _ the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers _ is not taken over by
corporate and other special interests. Still, many said the new
board members had done little to put their minds at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no feedback from the board,'' said Tony Rutkowski, an
Internet consultant from California. ``Esther is the only one who
has asked any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson, chairwoman of Edventure Holding, an information
technology company in New York, acknowledged that the board seemed
intimidated by its first meeting with its public _ which included
critics of the process that led to their selection. Indeed, Hans
Kraaijenbrink, a board member from the Netherlands, indicated he
had never seen such passion at a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But the purpose of the meeting, Ms. Dyson said, was to listen
and get input, to begin the process of building a consensus with
the wary factions that have yet to endorse the corporation plan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Commerce has tentatively selected the
corporation to take over the administrative functions of the
Internet, which are currently handled under government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial issues the new corporation will decide include how to
introduce competition into the lucrative business of registering
Web site names in the popular top-level domains of ``.com,''
``.net'' and ``.org.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions Inc., the government's contractor, currently
has a monopoly on the business.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism about the corporation stems, in part, from
continuing questions about how its interim board was picked.
Critics contend the nonprofit corporation was created secretly and
not in the open consensus-building fashion that the Clinton
administration called for when it proposed getting the government
out of the Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   One person in the audience referred to the creation of the board
as a ``virgin birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 board members made it to the first meeting, and
they tried to explain how they got there. Kraaijenbrink, the
chairman of the executive board of the European Telecommunications
Network Operators, said he was called by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I know nothing about the Internet.' They said,
`That's good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I know nothing about the discussions that are going
on.' They said, `That's good,''' he told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Others explained how they were approached, directly or
indirectly, by Joe Sims, the lawyer for Jonathan B. Postel, an
Internet founder who drafted the corporation plan just before he
died last month. But the explanations seemed too simple for much of
the audience, who seemed convinced the board was selected to carry
out a secret agenda for unknown special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that the audience was not satisfied with the
explanations, Sims jumped to the microphone and explained that
Postel chose the interim board himself, with input from around the
world. The goal, he said, was to find people who had no history or
stake in the years-long international debates over how to move
Internet governance from the public to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said Postel made the selections only after ruling out an
election because there was no clear electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The interim board now faces the same problem as it tries to
finalize the process for establishing a membership and supporting
organization. Gregory Crew, a board member and the chairman of the
Australian Communications Industry Forum Ltd., said the corporation
would appoint an advisory panel to make recommendations on how a
board-electing membership should be structured to insure sufficient
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a mechanism where people who come up with an
idea in their garage can be heard,'' one participant said.

PUSHING HARDER FOR ACCESS TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Ill., Ga.)  (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the volume of foreign news is dwindling, networks
are eliminating foreign news bureaus and newspapers are downplaying
reports from overseas, a dozen news organizations are making
considerable effort to open news bureaus in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Even with some increased access in recent years, the press has
been allowed, at best, irregular glimpses into the Western
Hemisphere's only communist society. With the news Friday that the
Cuban government will permit the Associated Press to station a
permanent correspondent in Havana _ for the first time since the AP
was expelled in 1969 _ other news organizations have some renewed
hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had reporters designated as Cuban correspondents, going
down as often as we can,'' said Ann Marie Lipinski, managing editor
of The Chicago Tribune. ``It's been an ongoing part of our foreign
report. We'd like to make it a permanent dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to The Tribune, three Florida newspapers, three
national broadcast television networks and the Univision
Spanish-language network, along with The Wall Street Journal, The
New York Times and Cox newspapers have all sought permission to
open bureaus in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Because of federal prohibitions against U.S. firms' doing
business with the communist regime of Fidel Castro, the news
organizations have sought, and obtained, waivers from the
government allowing them to open Cuban offices.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is getting the Cuban government to agree. While it
has granted temporary visas to American correspondents for
individual reporting trips, the only American news organization to
win permission for a permanent correspondent has been CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Other news organizations, like The Miami Herald, have provided
coverage offensive enough to the Cuban government that they are
seldom granted even temporary visas. During a two-year visa
drought, The Herald has made do by sending correspondents in on
tourist visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover Cuba without physically going there officially _ we
go in surreptitiously,'' Herald Executive Editor Douglas Clifton
said. ``We don't like to, but it's one of the things we do.'' He
pointed out that Miami has ``a massive Cuban population hungry for
news from Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   That population of first-, second- and third-generation Cubans,
which numbers upwards of 1 million people in Dade, Broward and Palm
Beach counties on Florida's southeast coast, is a rich source of
potential readers for newspapers in the area. The Herald, owned by
Knight Ridder, is vying with the Tribune Co.'s Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale for readers north of Miami. Both newspapers are among
those that have received U.S. _ but not Cuban _ permission to open
bureaus in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton was part of a delegation of American newspaper editors
who last month traveled to Cuba, met Fidel Castro and raised the
issue of new bureaus. ``The answer he gave suggested strongly that
he had no interest,'' Clifton said. ``That it didn't serve their
purposes. That sometimes journalists were not really what they
cracked up to be. Sometimes they were more spies than reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we walked away from it feeling it was a bleak outcome,'' he
said.

RECAPTURING PAST DELIGHTS WHILE MAKING THEM NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.)  
(lb) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy enough to preserve art that has been designated
classic in the old high sense: the kind meant to reside in museums,
concert halls and august theatrical spaces. Age cannot wither nor
custom stale its infinite variety, we feel (or are told to feel).
This art has history and eternity on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The question of preserving art that began as entertainment and
made its way from the bottom or the middle up rather than from the
top down is trickier. Without this kind of stuff, from movies to
all that popular music and dance, the United States would be a
shriveled little cultural husk.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub when it comes to the popular performing arts.
The best preservations shouldn't just reveal their aesthetic
timelessness or new-found historical value. They need to recreate
the excitement _ that's too vague a word _ the delight, titillation
and pure adrenalin these works sent coursing through the culture's
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the danger, too. For whether it was ragtime, blues,
jazz, the tunes of Tin Pan Alley, swing, or hillbilly music, it was
denounced once upon a time as a mindless fad, a vulgar craze, the
sign of a nation's basic triviality or a near-obscene eruption of
its once well-regulated musical id.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the century that birthed all this music ends, we are
reviving or renovating it, even trying with great fervor to make it
new. And it's very interesting to try to separate the bogus from
the genuine as we look backward, hoping to learn something about
how to move into a new century when everything we are was shaped by
the old one.
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost exactly 100 years since the first piano rags
were published, loosing a music that would be heard round the world
from the 1890s through World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Ragtime had it all: minstrel and vaudeville songs, dances from
the cakewalk to the fox trot; sheet music, piano rolls, banjos,
marching bands, bordellos, ballrooms and clubs; urban chic
(``Harlem Rag''), pastoral longings (``Heliotrope Bouquet'') and
Orientalist cravings (``The Cleopatra Rag'').
</P>
<P>
   Ragtime is the musical and dramatic frame for the Broadway show
of the same name. It is treated as a body of classic piano music
and a genre that can still inspire vigorous new pieces in Reginald
R. Robinson's current CD, ``Euphonic Sounds'' (Delmark).
</P>
<P>
   And it is claimed for the jazz repertory in Marcus Roberts' CD
``The Joy of Joplin'' (Sony Classical), at last joining a body of
work that, like the songs of Cole Porter or Harold Arlen, can be
improvised on or made the raw material of new compositions.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that it's hard to believe this music, with
its firm marching bass and its fluid asymmetrical melodies, was so
shocking that playful syncopation could shatter a nation's peace of
mind. ``Like a criminal novel, it is full of bangs and
explosions,'' one critic complained.
</P>
<P>
   But a writer for Opera Magazine in 1916 chose to both exalt and
pontificate: ``If any musician does not feel in his heart the
rhythmic complexities of the `Robert E. Lee,' I should not trust
him to feel in his heart ((those)) of Brahms.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. And when the ragtime revival began in 1970 with the
Nonesuch recordings of Scott Joplin rags, the pianist, Joshua
Rifkin, went out of his way to stress Joplin's links to such
composers as Chopin and Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   The Nonesuch label and the Rifkin approach did what a Chanel or
a Ralph Lauren logo would have done: They created a certain aura
for the music and guaranteed a certain quality. But the
interpretations came to sound wan (pretty, but wan) and
monorhythmic, as though drawing-room hyper-refinement had met up
with the rhythmic stolidness of a player piano.
</P>
<P>
   The balance was better as the decade went on. There was Joplin's
``Entertainer,'' a 1902 rag that became the hit theme song for
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the irrepressible Eubie Blake, who had been
writing and performing ragtime for more than 50 years, reappeared,
while young musicians like William Bolcolm started playing with
more imaginative energy. (And writing. Bolcolm's ``Ghost Rags'' are
lovely pieces.)
</P>
<P>
   But basically the revival of the 1970s was about expanding and
revising the canon of American music. The 1990s revival wants to
explore ragtime's role in our past, and make it part of a musical
canon that has a future.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway show, with a book by Terrence McNally, a score by
Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, is the biggest,
costliest artifact, an effective but diluted version of E.L.
Doctorow's novel, which used language to ``score'' social, racial
and political changes in the United States as they burst through
the unyielding beat of late Victorian life. Flaherty's score has a
number of rag and rag-inflected songs, all competent, but with
melodies that tend to be anthemlike, or pretty but unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   The musical approaches of Robinson and Roberts are more
exciting. They combine the historical with the contemporary in
quite different ways and succeed equally well.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson (seen on the cover of ``Euphonic Sounds'' with bowler
hat and cane in true ragtime gent-style) plays rags by Joplin and
his contemporaries, who included James Scott, Louis Chauvin and
Joseph Lamb. (There is also a very good CD of Lamb's opulent rags,
by the Dutch pianist Guido Nielson on the Basta label).
</P>
<P>
   He plays with force and ease. You savor the grace and languor of
the Joplin-Chauvin ``Heliotrope Bouquet'' and the mood swings _
stately to brilliant to feverish _ of Joplin's ``Euphonic Sounds.''
You feel the tension and the collaboration between the right and
the left hands. And seven of the 19 pieces are his own, written in
all kinds of moods: eccentric and romantic rags, a charmer of a
tango, even a rambunctious little gallop.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Joy of Joplin'' Roberts is out to harness the forces of
ragtime for the jazz tradition. (It was the 1920s craze for blues
and jazz that dethroned ragtime.) Best known for his work with
Wynton Marsalis, Roberts is a beautifully trained jazz modernist
whose favorite period extends from the early 1920s (Jelly Roll
Morton and James P. Johnson) into the 1940s and 1950s (Thelonious
Monk and Erroll Garner).
</P>
<P>
   He fractures ragtime's meters, complicates its melodies, expands
its harmonies and composes new themes over its chords. And it's
bracing and jolting _ the closest we've yet come to the shock of
the new, our new, which takes in rhythms and sounds unheard by the
old masters.
</P>
<P>
   His own eight compositions show his musical passions and his
formidable technique. Here's Bach; here's Debussy; here are
Beethoven and Gottschalk. They bristle and take unexpected turns,
then linger (too long at times) in fields of lavish chords.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Robinson and Roberts show us that hearing ragtime
should be like holding two contradictory ideas in your head at the
same time and continuing to function, which was F. Scott
Fitzgerald's prescription for a first-rate intelligence. He didn't
add ``with pleasure and excitement,'' but we can.

A&AMP;E TO CREATE 2 DIGITAL-READY SPINOFF CHANNELS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the small cadre of cable networks sticking their toes
into the unclear waters of digital television, the A&AMP;E Network
plans to announce two spinoff channels Monday, the Biography
Channel and History Channel International, which will become widely
available only when digital television does.
</P>
<P>
   The network's one-hour series ``Biography'' is one of the most
successful series in cable television, so it made sense to start a
Biography channel, said Nickolas Davatzes, president and chief
executive of A&AMP;E Television Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Davatzes had originally planned a drama channel or a documentary
channel. But research found that A&AMP;E's viewers thought the History
Channel's perspective was too strictly American and wanted other
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is we're a reflection of our culture,'' he said.
``We would see an event differently than the Brits would see it or
the Japanese or the Brazilians would see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both new channels will be linked to World Wide Web sites, whose
addresses will be featured on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday, the channels will be available on a
Tele-Communications Inc. service that reaches about a million
homes. Davatzes said he hoped to make other distribution deals, but
that real growth would depend on how quickly consumers bought
digital television sets or set-top boxes and what networks cable
operators made available.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, Nickelodeon, Fox Family Channel, Discovery Networks and a
few others have also started spinoff channels geared for a time
when today's 70 or 80 channels may multiply as much as fivefold.

DISAPPOINTING `JOE BLACK' PUTS UNIVERSAL CHIEF ON SHAKIER GROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ ``Meet Joe Black,'' the lavish three-hour film made
by Universal Studios, opened over the weekend to poor reviews and a
disappointing box office, increasing the expectations in the movie
industry that the studio's owner, the Seagram Co., planned to oust
Frank Biondi Jr., Universal's chairman and chief executive, and
overhaul Universal's corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry executives close to Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
the chairman of Seagram, predicted Sunday that he would dismiss
Biondi within the next few weeks, possibly earlier. At the same
time, these executives said, Bronfman planned to revamp the
corporate set-up so that various divisions like movies and music
report directly to him. Previously, Biondi, who has had a troubled
two-year reign at Universal, ran the entertainment divisions and
was in charge of corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the company has to bring clarity to the
situation,'' said one top Universal executive.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive close to Bronfman said Bronfman was deeply
angry at the lackluster performance of the film division, and may
remove its top executive there, Casey Silver, as well as Biondi, a
well-liked figure on Wall Street and in the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie division is embarrassing to Edgar; he has to
apologize at board meetings for it,'' said the executive, who also
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A Universal spokesman said that the company would not comment on
``rumors and speculation.'' Biondi declined to comment. More than
two years ago, Bronfman wanted Biondi enough to offer him a
five-year deal valued at as much as $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi himself was not directly involved in the day-to-day
operations of the movie side, leaving those responsibilities to Ron
Meyer, his No. 2, and to Silver, who reported to Meyer. But
Biondi's power in Universal was seriously diminished last fall when
Bronfman unexpectedly sold most of Universal's television assets
and its cable programming services to Barry Diller, chairman of USA
Networks Inc., in exchange for stock in Diller's television
company. Biondi's career was built on his television and cable
expertise, first at Home Box Office and then at Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Biondi's responsibilities are being further
limited by Seagram's planned acquisition of Polygram, the huge
record company. That deal, which is expected be completed by the
end of the year, will result in the consolidation of the Universal
and Polygram music groups. By all accounts, Biondi's role in the
deal was limited. ``What Frank oversaw changed in a dramatic way,''
one executive close to Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives within Universal said Bronfman planned to alter the
structure of the company so that he, essentially, would not only
run the wine and spirits divisions but take over many of the
responsibilities in entertainment now held by Biondi. Among the
divisions set to report directly to Bronfman is the revived and
successful music company, run by Doug Morris, former head of Warner
Music, as well as the movie and amusement park divisions that will
be placed in the hands of Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   The recent opening of ``Meet Joe Black'' has left a chill at
Universal. The film cost at least $90 million _ and the studio has
probably spent $30 million more to promote it. The reviews for the
romantic drama, starring Brad Pitt and directed by Martin Brest,
have been mostly devastating because of its three-hour length.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, The Wall Street Journal called it ``a folly of epic
proportions.'' The film came in third at the box office this
weekend, earning about $15.6 million, lagging far behind ``The
Waterboy,'' the Adam Sandler hit comedy, which took in $25.4
million in its second week, as well as ``I Still Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' a new teen-age horror movie whose box office reached
about $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Silver, who runs Universal Pictures, virtually
every other studio in town would probably have approved ``Meet Joe
Black'' because of the clout of its star, Pitt, as well as the
track record of its director, Brest, whose films include ``Beverly
Hills Cop,'' and ``Scent of a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Universal seems to be facing additional difficulties with a
second film, ``Babe, Pig in the City,'' which also cost at least
$90 million. Although the family film is set to open over
Thanksgiving, its Los Angeles premiere, set for Monday, was
canceled because the movie is still unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to entertainment giants like Time Warner and Disney,
Universal, previously known as MCA, has been besieged by management
turmoil and an uncertain strategy in the three and a half years
since the giant liquor company bought 80 percent of MCA from the
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. for $5.7 billion. Seagram's
stock has lagged, partly because of a downturn in its liquor
business in Asia and also by worries about Universal.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A band of snow will develop to the north of the track of low
pressure as it moves east from the central Great Lakes. The
steadiest snow Monday will be from northern Michigan to the
Adirondacks of northern New York.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy light snow will streak into northern New England on
Monday afternoon and become steadier overnight. Accumulations will
average a few inches across these regions; however, up to six
inches of snow will fall in some of the higher elevations. To the
south of the low, clouds and spotty rain will occur, spreading from
southern Michigan early Monday to southern New England by Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle Atlantic states will be partly to mostly sunny and
mild as breezes from the southwest increase. Farther south, a weak
disturbance will promote clouds and scattered light showers from
the eastern Gulf Coast to the Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine and comfortable warmth will prevail over a large
area from the southwestern states to the central and southern
Plains. Some patchy low clouds near the Texas coast will dissipate
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly cloudy and cold conditions will occur from the northern
Mississippi Valley to the eastern Dakotas. Meanwhile, breezes from
the west will deliver milder air and ample sunshine near the east
slopes of the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A strengthening disturbance will promote mostly cloudy skies
over northwestern states. Patchy showers will develop across
southern parts of Oregon and Idaho. Steadier rain will develop in
the onshore flow over the Olympic peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: STUDYING METEORS
</P>
<P>
   Major meteor showers like the Leonids that will reach a peak on
Wednesday always prompt telephone calls to meteorologists seeking
explanations of the event. However, despite their name,
meteorologists have no special expertise concerning the meteors
that illuminate the night sky. Astronomers are the scientists who
can lay claim to detailed knowledge of meteor showers. Long ago,
when science was in its infancy, the fields of meteorology and
astronomy were more closely allied. Indeed, the word meteorology
comes from the Greek meaning ``the study of things in the sky.''

A GORE'S FORAY INTO SECRET SERVICE  
 CONFESSION OF CANNIBALISM  
 STANDOFF IN CHARLOTTE  
 LUDLUM'S SWITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.C.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second child of Vice President Al Gore has written an essay
for The Harvard Lampoon in which she satirizes the type of person
who might be drawn to the life of a Secret Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   In the October issue of the humor magazine, a six-paragraph
essay is signed by K.C.G. The writer, Kristin C. Gore, a senior at
Harvard University, is listed on the masthead. Matt Murray,
president of The Harvard Lampoon, confirmed that Ms. Gore wrote the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   The essay is told from the perspective of someone so mentally
unbalanced that he pretends he is a Secret Service agent, chasing
people down streets and offering to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided early on that I had to either be a Secret Service
agent or live a life devoid of meaning,'' the article begins. It
goes on: ``My baby pictures depicted a gurgling young maverick clad
in dark sunglasses and an unwieldy earpiece. Strangers pitied me
for my debilitating cataracts and partial deafness, but you should
never talk to strangers. They usually don't understand cleft
tongues, and they also talk too softly and are blurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a Clint Eastwood movie about a secret agent, the
narrator says, ``On better days, I'd recite `In the Line of Fire'
in 25 minutes flat, augment my artillery arsenal with more shiny
objects and swear words, acquire extra-sensory perception, refuse
to testify, develop a clenched jawline, hit Taco Bell and choose my
protectee of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days,'' the narrator says, ``I spend my time driving
around the President of the United States in a camouflage golf-cart
with a bullet-proof attitude. I stop at every second light to run
background checks on foreign passersby, reload my paint-ball gun,
and make sure the Pres is strapped in tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would Ms. Gore write an essay in which an agent _ even
someone pretending to be one _ is portrayed as mentally defective
and dangerous? It was all in good fun, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I not only have the highest possible regard for the Secret
Service, I am extremely grateful to them for the work they do and
the professional way in which do it,'' she says. ``This piece was
intended as a spoof in a college humor magazine. I would never
express any disrespect for the Secret Service, and I regret if
anyone misinterpreted it that way.''

<P>
   Art Criticism Recycled in Time
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest-profile art critic confessing to ...
cannibalism?
</P>
<P>
   Well, kind of. In last week's issue of Time, Robert Hughes, the
magazine's star art critic and author of ``American Visions''
(Knopf, 1997), a top-selling survey of American art that grew out
of a popular TV series, apologized to readers for plagiarizing
material.
</P>
<P>
   Time's issue two weeks before had contained Hughes' review of a
show of American and Australian landscapes at the Wadsworth
Atheneum, the nation's oldest public art museum, in Hartford, Conn.
The opening sentences turned out to be embarrassingly close to
those of a review in July in the magazine ``Australian Art
Collector'' by a Boston art writer, Patricia Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   She started her piece: ``If you started digging on the banks of
the Hudson River _ birthplace of American landscape painting where
Thomas Cole, his most famous pupil Frederick Church and Albert
Bierstadt all lived and worked _ and kept going on through the
centre of the earth you would emerge a little to the northeast of
Tasmania right about where John Glover arrived in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' Time article began: ``Suppose you started digging a hole
on the bank of the Hudson River, the cradle of American 19th
century landscape as painted by Thomas Cole, Frederick Church, and
others. Suppose you kept digging straight down through the center
of the earth and came out on the other side. The hole would open up
just off Tasmania, the island state of Australia, painted in the
19th century by, among others, John Glover and W.C. Piguenit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Macdonald wrote Hughes and in Time's last issue he
apologized: ``To my embarrassment I seem to have cannibalized it,
but it was entirely unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Ms. Macdonald said, Hughes had recited her
same material earlier in a talk at the Atheneum on Oct. 23. She
arrived late and missed it. But she made light of it, praising
Hughes. ``The taller the poppy, the more people want to cut it
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes called the matter closed. ``If I made my career as a
cannibal I wouldn't have had a career,'' he said. Christopher
Porterfield, executive editor of Time, which is owned by
Time-Warner Inc., said he was satisfied the borrowing was
inadvertent. ``Bob is hardly in need of somebody else's words,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But with several other art scholars claiming their insights and
arguments have cropped up without credit in ``American Visions,''
the College Art Association, which represents 14,000 academics and
2,000 institutions, has scheduled a panel at its annual meeting in
February on ``American Revisions: Evaluating Robert Hughes' Media
Blitz.''

   An Endorsement That Wasn't
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer's publisher added one more
surprise to this fall's election season when he scuttled his
paper's endorsement of North Carolina's Democratic Senate candidate
just before the election. Then, more than 40 journalists in the
Observer's newsroom surprised him with passionate objections to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ridder had wanted his newspaper to endorse the Republican
incumbent, Lauch Faircloth, but found himself at odds with his two
top editors and all the editorial writers, who supported the
Democratic candidate and eventual victor, John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result of the standoff was an editorial that was
the newspaper's first nonendorsement in a Senate race in 20 years.
That, in turn, generated a strongly worded round-robin open letter
from the editors and reporters, most of whom argued that the
newspaper, which is owned by Knight Ridder, failed its readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one disputes that it is a publisher's prerogative to
overrule an editorial board, or that differences of opinion will _
and should _ surface,'' the authors wrote in the declaration
circulated around the newsroom. ``Yet when a publisher overturns
the judgment of skilled journalists, we wonder whether that has
implications for the journalistic integrity of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who added his comments was Taylor Batten, recently
promoted to an editing job, who wrote ``the paper, which should
love this community, abdicated its role by failing to take a stand
one way or the other.'' Batten's name has resonance beyond his own
newsroom; he is the son of Knight Ridder's longtime chief
executive, James Batten, who died in 1995. Ridder, the publisher,
is the brother of the company's current chief executive, Anthony
Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   Ridder, who came to Charlotte in September 1997, said: ``I think
you'll find that publishers and editorial boards will never agree
on every issue. Do they compromise? I would hope so.'' Of the
staff's reaction, he said, ``I want them to understand that I have
the same values as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Williams, editor of the editorial pages at The Observer, said
of the dispute: ``We compromised by not firing the publisher. And
he didn't fire us.''
</P>

   Robert Ludlum Signs With St. Martin's
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ludlum, master of international intrigue and weaver of
grand-scale conspiracy plots, is departing his paperback publisher
of more than two decades. But the reason seems rather dull for an
author whose spies are constantly foiling world takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Is he leaving because a vast, sprawling global conglomerate,
Bertelsmann AG, has merged his longtime publisher, Bantam Books,
with Random House?
</P>
<P>
   No. At age 70, Ludlum, author of novels like ``The Matarese
Circle'' and ``The Bourne Identity,'' said he moved to St. Martin's
Press because it would give him more time to work on his books. His
eight-figure contract _ which one publishing executive estimated at
about $4 million for each hardcover book _ calls for him to write
three hardcover books and four paperback originals that will have a
co-author.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlum's agent, Henry Morrison, said the move was also
precipitated by a need for a ``fresh'' publishing approach, a
desire that has taken hold with other authors like Stephen King who
speak of publishing relationships as if they are grading the
quality of stem roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that they were talking to us about that
seemed very fresh, very enthusiastic, and hopefully this will bring
us to a new plateau,'' Morrison said of the appeal of St. Martin's,
which is owned by Holtzbrinck GmbH. Ludlum's sales had settled to a
level of about 450,000 copies for the last few years, said one
publishing executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But
Morrison noted that ``even some of the biggest names have seen
erosion in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shear, publisher of St. Martin's mass-market division,
said he intended to publish Ludlum's books more regularly. ``What
happens is that the publication of these authors can often become
rote, but you need to have fresh ideas come out of it, fresh ideas
on how to package,'' he said.

<P>
   In moonshots heard throughout cyberspace, the stocks of two
newly public companies soared last week as investors once again
rushed to buy up the promise of the Internet. Small investors,
especially those glued to their computer screens, pushed the prices
of many Internet stocks to levels that not only seemed to defy
gravity but also common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The two latest arrivals were among the biggest beneficiaries of
the general enthusiasm for anything Internet. The stock of
Theglobe.com Inc., a New York company that helps people design Web
pages, raced from its initial offering price of $9, to hit $97,
before closing on Friday at $63.50. Its astounding 606 percent gain
marked the best first-day performance for any initial public
offering, excluding the tiniest offerings, according to the
Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J. Its performance was more than
twice that of any other new stock.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe's spectacular debut followed an earlier display by
another fledgling Internet outfit, Earthweb Inc., which gained 247
percent on Wednesday, its first day of trading. Its stock closed on
Friday at $67, nearly five times its initial offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuations being ascribed to these very young companies
make almost no sense,'' said Lise Buyer, an analyst at Credit
Suisse First Boston, who likens the current frenzy over the
Internet to the mania for tulips in Holland during the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com, for example, now has a market value of $622
million, despite the fact that it had $11.5 million of losses on
$2.7 million of revenues for the first nine months of the year. The
company ``has a debatable business model, and it's a junior
Geocities,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst with BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, who is concerned by the ability of very small
companies to go public and find willing buyers for their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Helping propel these stocks upward is the limited number of
shares being sold in these offerings. Theglobe.com, for example,
offered only 3.1 million shares. Companies offer a small number of
shares if they believe a secondary offering, with a much higher
stock price, can be a source of future capital.
</P>
<P>
   With demand so great for these stocks, there appears to be a
shortage of supply. The performance of Theglobe.com ``would never
have happened if you did not have the Internet feeding frenzy,''
said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in
Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are are piling into Internet stocks may believe
they are actually reducing their risk because they think that these
companies will prosper, no matter what happens in Asia or Latin
America or where interest rates are headed. ``In almost a perverse
way, Internet stocks have become a safe haven for technology stock
investors,'' said Jonathan Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, who
believes many Internet companies do ultimately have great
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm for Internet stocks may also be reawakening
interest in the market for initial public offerings, which suffered
along with the rest of the stock market earlier this year when many
investors ran from risk. Theglobe.com, for example, had postponed
its offering last month. But when Earthweb was so eagerly received,
the underwriters ``ran it up the flagpole,'' said John Fitzgibbon,
editor of IPO Reporter, a New York newsletter on initial offerings,
who thinks other companies may also try now to go public.
</P>
<P>
   And many investors may simply be trying to go along for the
ride, even if they do not have the benefit of getting the stock at
its initial offering price. ``If you get in early and sell, you
will make money,'' said Ms. Buyer of Credit Suisse First Boston.
The danger is that some investors may not know when to make an
exit; instead, they may be caught up in a sudden change in market
sentiment _ and lose money _ while waiting unsuccessfully for a
greater fool to relieve them of their shares at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long does it go on?'' Ms. Buyer asked on the latest
Internet frenzy. ``It could go on for years. It could go on for
hours.'' But, she said, investors should realize that they really
are taking risks with their money, because the stocks of many of
these companies could tumble on the slightest dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not investing,'' she said. ``This is speculating.''

<P>
   KUWAIT CITY _ It seems like the middle of nowhere, dunes dotted
with little more than herds of sheep and the occasional camel
carcass. But it is home to 1,500 American soldiers _ roving the
desert just 30 miles east of the Iraqi border _ and some of them
are getting sick of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should just go ahead and do it,'' Pfc. Carlos De La
Cruz, 22, of Newark, N.J., said Sunday as he stood guard on a sandy
berm at the camp there. ``No sense in us keep coming back every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not spoiling for a fight, but echoing what he and other
soldiers said was a common view the day after Saddam announced that
he would comply, after all, once again, at the last moment, with
conditions for United Nations weapons inspections. ``I think he's
playing games,'' De La Cruz said. And so, he added, the United
States should strike at Iraq despite its leader's promises.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans are closer to the dispute with Iraq than the
soldiers here. Several thousand of them rotate in and out for
training with the Kuwaiti military. And, along with other soldiers
stationed around the Persian Gulf, the last several days have been
tense ones, as the possibility of a military confrontation _
perhaps a fierce one _ neared, then apparently receded after Iraq
said it would comply with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the last time Saddam decided not to comply with the
weapons inspections, the military presence here in Kuwait ballooned
to some 10,000 men and women over five weeks. In all, there were
some 44,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   So far this time, only a handful of additional troops have
arrived in Kuwait. While military officials here have declined to
discuss numbers, military officials in Washington said that another
3,000 ground troops are eventually scheduled to reach Kuwait,
starting early this week, largely to serve as defense against any
possible Iraqi attack here. In addition, air power will be
increased.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday evening, military officials said they were not
aware that Saddam's offer of an agreement without conditions _ and
President Clinton's conditional acceptance of that offer _ would
halt that buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that has changed,'' said Col. Ron Williams,
the head Army spokesman in Kuwait. ``The question is how much will
that change. The military is continuing to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States went to war with Iraq in 1991, in part
to free Kuwait from an Iraqi invasion, the American and Kuwaiti
militaries have worked together closely. They conduct joint desert
training on the Udairi range _ where De La Cruz has been living in
a tent for three months now _ and at two air bases, Ahmad Al Jaber,
about 25 miles south of Kuwait City, and at Ali Al Salem, about the
same distance to the northwest. In addition, there is a permanent
U.S. military base on the Kuwait Bay, Camp Doha.
</P>
<P>
   Although the information is not normally secret, military
officials were reluctant to give out even basic details about the
bases, and the soldiers themselves have been kept largely behind
base walls.
</P>
<P>
   But in a handful of interviews Sunday, soldiers expressed
frustration at what they said they saw as a problem with Iraq that
would not go away. Saddam, several said, should have been a
casualty of the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a couple of times for me,'' said Pvt. Erik
Tackett, 27, of Newport Beach, Calif., who has served in the region
before and was standing guard with De La Cruz. ``I'm getting real
sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Michael Bucci, 23, of Chambersburg, Pa., said he felt the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion,'' he said, his head poked out of a Humvee and his
machine gun swinging out into the desert, ``we should just bomb the
hell out of him _ get it over with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But like soldiers everywhere, he said, he was also not sad if he
did not have to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go in, we go,'' he said. ``If not, even better. We'll be
home by Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   But his partner in guarding the range, Sgt. James Rundberg, from
New Baltimore, N.Y., outside of Albany, said that going to war was
something the nation should approach with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for us to rush into it, as long as he's going
to comply and he's going to comply fully,'' Rundberg said. ``If
not, I guess we're going to have to do whatever the higher-ups
think we ought to do.''

   On Tuesday, the Earth will enter Temple-Tuttle's debris-strewn
backwash and will then, according to many scientists, witness the
most intense meteor shower in more than three decades. The
scientists who track Temple-Tuttle do not even call it a shower,
they call it a meteor storm. (While visible in Asia, the storm will
be obscured by the sun in North America during its peak hours.)
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of the storm, among millions of particles
moving at roughly 160,000 miles an hour, will be 600 or so man-made
satellites, which most people in the industrialized world have come
to rely on, wittingly or not, for entertainment, communication and
spying on one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the life of our
communications-oriented world that we have faced an environmental
threat of this scope,'' said Ian Rowe, chief executive of Crestech,
a nonprofit group based in Toronto that will track the storm for
the Canadian and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's being
disabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower about
one-3,000th the density of the storm predicted for Tuesday.
American consumers felt the impact of a single satellite's
malfunctioning in May, when the failure of Galaxy IV disrupted
pager service in much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effects
could be even more daunting. The spy satellites that are peering
down at Saddam Hussein could lose their ability to spot movements
of his troops. Television channels could become static. Those
relying on satellite navigation could become lost. Corporate
networks could shut down. Even the international telephone system,
which mostly relies on undersea cables, could be crippled. AT&AMP;T
Corp. says there are at least 14 countries, mostly in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, that can be reached by
telephone only by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite industry, however, and some of the companies that
rely on it, have a different reaction: no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this will be much of an issue,'' said Daniel
Marcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, the world's largest private
satellite company, which is controlled by the Hughes Electronics
unit of General Motors Corp. ``It should be a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen Stott, director for satellite engineering at
Intelsat, the international satellite consortium, said, ``Most of
the industry is of the opinion that we do not expect any major
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the odds say that the meteors _ known as the Leonids
because they seem to come from the direction of the constellation
Leo _ have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world's
satellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of the
sole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from inside
a Major League ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generally
smaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strong
electrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitive
components.
</P>
<P>
   So while the big satellite companies play down the threat, they
are still taking steps to protect their property. Deploying a
commercial communications satellite can cost around $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges face
the oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target. They plan to
shut down some systems, to keep operations simple.
</P>
<P>
   But Alastair Hamilton, who is responsible for distributing Cable
News Network as Turner Broadcasting System's senior vice president
for worldwide distribution technology, said some viewers still
might lose their signal for a few minutes Tuesday as satellites
recover from short circuits. He added, however, that he could not
get too agitated because there is so little he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the satellites are up there and there
is no way to hide them,'' he said. ``So we're going to really see
what happens. And the prevailing opinion is that this is not really
something that we should be losing a huge amount of sleep over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite how Col. Mike Kelly is handling the situation.
That is because he works for the owner of about a quarter of the
world's satellites: the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy commander of the 50th Operations Group at Schriever
Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Kelly helps run about
60 Air Force satellites worth about $40 billion. Kelly's charges
provide navigation services, communications for officials including
the president, and help in detecting missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   While Marcus of Panamsat and Gregory Clark, president of Loral
Space Communications, another big private satellite company, said
they expected no impact on their services, Kelly is more
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very unlikely that we'll lose a spacecraft on the
17th,'' he said. He added, however, ``I think it's probable that
we'll see some electrical problems that we'll have to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that could take anywhere from a few minutes to several
days. (Kelly's group does not manage any of the optical spy
satellites, he said. Those are generally handled by the
ultra-secretive National Reconnaissance Office, which refused to
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the private satellite companies, however, the Air
Force, according to Kelly, has decided not to change its normal
operating procedures substantially, except to be especially
watchful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be,'' Kelly
said. ``If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of the
happiest people in Colorado.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.
Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses
33 satellite-linked printing plants in the United States. Each
plant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is still
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crapshoot, you just don't know,'' he said. ``There's
nothing more you can do. There's not time. The only thing you could
do to put yourself in a risk-free situation is to put in a
terrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealt
with the phone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate with
eight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to use
terrestrial, or ground-based, communications. But rather than link
directly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem,
The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for the
printing plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis,
director for investor relations for New York Times Co. She added
that the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was one
of the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed by
the storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jones
spokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled by
Motorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federal
filing, though the company declined to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relevant experience we can use to base an
assessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause to
low-earth-orbit satellites,'' the Iridium filing said, referring to
the sort of satellites it uses. ``But such damage could be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit is
one in 5,000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, as
Rowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide true
peace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of the
night and get away with it,'' he said, by way of analogy. ``But you
might get K.O.'d by a truck.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Texas woman on a Caribbean cruise with her husband accused a
waiter of drugging their dinner drinks and later raping her in
their cabin.
</P>
<P>
   An Oregon family on a cruise said their daughter was raped by a
ship's bartender after she celebrated her 16th birthday in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   A California woman said that a crewman forced his way into her
cabin and beat and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   As with many rape cases, none of these was clear-cut. Some
involved alcohol and counterclaims of consensual sex. One wasn't
reported until after the cruise. Yet in every case, the accusers
say, the cruise line's main concern was to protect its reputation
by buying or coercing their silence and shielding the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Once the exclusive playground of the very wealthy, the cruise
business has expanded over the last decade by appealing to the vast
middle class, especially families and young adults. The polished
mahogany decks and formal dinners of a bygone era have been
replaced by glittering floating cities dedicated to carefree
partying, gambling and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   But as the industry has boomed to more than 5 million passengers
a year, it has presented new concerns for its ports of call, its
passengers and the environment, in part because of the size of its
giant liners, in part because the cruise lines operate largely
outside the laws of any one country. A particular problem is the
allegations of sexual assaults committed by crew members.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that crime is rampant aboard cruise ships.
And the FBI does not break out statistics on the number of rapes on
the high seas. But FBI agents in Miami, the United States' busiest
cruise port, said they are called out to investigate a shipboard
sexual assault about every other week.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of sexual assault cases on ships operated by the
largest cruise lines, based on court records and interviews with
current and former employees, law-enforcement officials, passengers
who reported assaults, and those passengers' lawyers, found a
pattern of cover-ups that often began as soon as the crime was
reported at sea, in international waters where the only police are
the ship's security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Accused crew members are sometimes put ashore at the next port,
with air fare to their home country. Industry lawyers are flown to
the ship to question the accusers; and aboard ships flowing with
liquor, counterclaims of consensual sex are common. The cruise
lines aggressively contest lawsuits and insist on secrecy as a
condition of settling.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas couple sued, the cruise line settled with a
confidential agreement. Cruise-line lawyers subpoenaed the Oregon
girl's school records to question her character, but eventually
settled a suit. Officers aboard the California woman's ship did
notify the FBI, at her insistence, but she said the arrival of the
agents was delayed until her room had been cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a federal grand jury is investigating whether
Carnival Cruise Lines, the world's largest, helped a ship's officer
accused of rape get out of the country. And in 1995, a Florida
appeals court found that Carnival dismissed a crew member for
refusing to lie to protect the company in a civil suit brought by
another seaman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't notify the FBI,'' said Charles Harris, a former
chief of security for Carnival. ``You don't notify anybody. You
start giving the victims bribes, upgrading their cabins, giving
them champagne and trying to ease them off the ship until the legal
department can take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I knew there was a crime,'' he said, ``I was
supposed to go in there and do everything in the world to get
Carnival to look innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The cruise lines say that crimes are uncommon and that they do a
good job of investigating when one does occur. But three years ago
their lobbyists tried in Congress to win protection from most
damages in sexual-assault suits and from all suits by foreign crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways these ships, as long as three football fields, are
not so much floating cities as sovereign islands, operating beyond
the police and regulatory jurisdiction of the nations they cruise
among.
</P>
<P>
   Every major cruise ship sailing out of U.S. ports is registered
with a foreign country, usually Panama or Liberia. The corporations
that own them are foreign, too. The foreign registry means the
ships and their owners avoid U.S. corporate income taxes and many
U.S. laws, though more than 80 percent of their passengers are
American.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Corp., the parent of Carnival Cruise Lines, has its
headquarters in Miami but is a publicly held corporation registered
in Panama. Controlling interest is held by the family of its
founder, Ted Arison, a billionaire who renounced his U.S.
citizenship in 1993, in part to avoid estate taxes. His son, Micky,
an American citizen, is chairman. Most of Carnival's executives are
American.
</P>
<P>
   The other leading line, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., also has
its headquarters in Miami, but the corporation is registered in
Liberia. Controlling interests are owned by a Bahamian partnership
associated with the wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago and by a
shipping company owned by a Norwegian family, the Wilhelmsens.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Martenstein, vice president for communications at Royal
Caribbean, said the company would not comment on cruise-ship crime
or respond to any specific questions, because of legal
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   A vice president of Carnival, Tim Gallagher, said his company
reacts promptly and thoroughly any time there is an allegation of
sexual misconduct involving passengers or crew members. He said
only a handful of assaults occur each year, though he would not
provide numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 1.5 million guests a year, and it is
impossible that there would not be a huge public outcry if there
were any kind of serious crime problem,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has jurisdiction to investigate crimes in international
waters on foreign ships if the vessel departed from or is headed to
a U.S. port and the crime involves an American citizen. But
investigating a crime scene at sea is difficult, agents routinely
wait until a ship returns to port, and jurisdictional questions
often arise, according to law-enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   And not all crimes are reported. Cruise ships are required to
report only crimes and other incidents that result in serious
physical injury, which does not necessarily include rape. ``Unless
otherwise required to do so, Carnival leaves it to the individual
to decide whether to report to authorities,'' said Curtis Mase, a
lawyer for Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints are frequent enough, however, that Lloyd Lipkey, the
agent in charge of the FBI's Miami squad that deals with crimes on
the high seas, offered a warning to passengers: ``Go on a cruise
just like you go anywhere else, with your eyes open.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Culture Aboard Ship
</P>
<P>
   Rules Bar Fraternizing
</P>
<P>
   Today's huge cruise ships carry 1,800 to 2,200 passengers and
700 to 800 crew members drawn from 50 or more countries, many of
them poor nations. While some crew members are highly trained,
particularly the officers, many are unskilled young men who work
long hours seven days a week. Pay can be as little as $500 a month;
many send their wages home to support families.
</P>
<P>
   Ships have rules barring fraternizing with passengers. Carnival,
Gallagher said, prohibits crew members from fraternizing but
encourages officers to be friendly. ``The guests like it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And romance, of course, has long been one of the attractions of
cruises. ``Sex between crew and passengers happens all the time,''
said Dennis Hypolite, a musician who worked for Carnival and Royal
Caribbean for three years until he quit on Nov. 1. ``Every cruise,
every day. Crew go into guest cabins and guests go to crew cabins.
Both seek it out, passengers and crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the former Carnival security chief, who now investigates
shipboard crimes for lawyers of victims and insurance companies,
said crew members and officers often pursue sex with female
passengers. ``That's the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers said Harris was a disgruntled former employee
who now earns his living testifying against cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eriksen, a lawyer in Lake Worth, Fla., has handled more
than a dozen cases of sexual assault on ships in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically it starts out with an opportunity for a crew member
to observe and sometimes interact with a passenger,'' he said. ``A
lot of times it will be a waiter or someone who works in room
service or behind a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon girl struck up a conversation with a bartender in the
Ain't Misbehavin' Lounge on the Monarch of the Seas, a Royal
Caribbean ship. It was her 16th birthday, and after some drinks she
went with the bartender to his cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's parents said she was raped, and they sued the cruise
line last year.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean contended that the bartender did not threaten
the girl and that the sex was consensual. Even so, because of the
girl's age, the incident would have been a felony had it occurred
in Florida. But state law was not applicable. The line also accused
the girl's parents of failing to exercise reasonable care in
protecting their daughter, and subpoenaed the girl's school records
in an attempt to discover previous problems.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was settled this summer, the company insisted on a
confidentiality agreement that prohibited the family or their
lawyer from discussing the case, according to the lawyer, David
Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just want to get on with their lives, and when the
cruise lines wave money under their noses if they promise not to
talk, they always accept it,'' Bianchi said.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition in the case, the bartender, Cleve Ellis,
testified that crew members make a sport of having sex with
passengers, Bianchi said. Because of the confidentiality order, the
deposition was not available to The Times. Attempts to find Ellis
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   People who deal with assault victims say teen-age girls are
often targets on cruise ships. In 1996, Bianchi represented the
family of a 14-year-old who said she had been raped by a crew
member aboard the Fascination, a Carnival ship.
</P>
<P>
   After an article about the case appeared in a legal publication,
Bianchi said, he was contacted by the father of a 16-year-old girl
who said she had been raped by the same crew member a few weeks
after the first incident. Both cases were settled and the crewman
was dismissed after the second report, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Texas couple were on a seven-day Carnival cruise
in the Caribbean to celebrate their 10th anniversary. The woman
claimed the waiter drugged their drinks at dinner and later went to
their cabin and raped her while her husband was unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The couple complained to cruise officials, who responded in part
by moving them to a better cabin for the remainder of the voyage.
When the ship docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico, they tried to report
the incident to the police but were told they would have to contact
the FBI. They never did.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Shinkle, a Carnival lawyer, said the ship's officers
assisted the couple in contacting the San Juan police and provided
them with the phone number for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The couple did file a civil suit against Carnival. At the trial
the waiter, Ashton Sylvester, a 12-year employee of Carnival,
denied having sex with the woman, and witnesses said she and her
husband had been drinking heavily that day. But the company settled
the case just before it went to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Shinkle declined to disclose the terms of the settlement, citing
a confidentiality agreement. He said Carnival's decision to settle
was ``just a matter of good business sense'' after the couple
reduced their financial demand.
</P>
<P>
   Rape experts say delays often occur in reporting rapes,
particularly in a situation like a cruise, where the passenger
could fear reprisal and there is no independent investigator or
rape-treatment center. But the time lag makes criminal prosecutions
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cases reported within 72 hours offer the best forensic
evidence,'' said Dr. Karen Simmons, director of the rape-treatment
center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. ``But we see a lot of
people after that because they may be afraid of reporting it or
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Simmons said the center does not keep statistics on victims
from cruise ships, but she said passengers are treated with some
frequency. Court files in Miami, where most suits must be filed
against the big cruise lines, indicate that rapes often are not
reported until it is too late for criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvers
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Deflect Victims' Lawsuits
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone delays reporting. On June 19, 1997, a 35-year-old
California woman aboard a Royal Caribbean ship with her parents
sought help immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had spent some time in the ship's nightclub before
returning to her cabin about 4 a.m. In contrast to many cases
aboard ships, where alcohol is plentiful, records show that she
consumed only a non-alcoholic drink in the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my key into the slot to open the door,'' she later
testified in court. ``I put one foot in and was pushed from
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she fell onto her hands and knees but ``fought to save
my life, wrestling, kicking, biting, yelling.'' People in the cabin
next door heard the commotion, but did not summon help. Her
injuries were so severe that she was on crutches for two weeks,
according to court records and her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   When her attacker left, she called her father and he alerted the
ship's security. Within hours, the woman had identified her
attacker in a line-up conducted by the ship's security officers as
Jorge Virtucio, a member of the cleaning crew.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned that day by a ship's security officer and a company
lawyer who had been flown in, Virtucio denied being anywhere near a
passenger, saying he had been washing decks at 4 in the morning.
When asked about scratches on his body, he said they were from
minor work accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Virtucio was indicted and, as his trial approached last May, DNA
evidence linked him to the assault. He switched his story and his
lawyers argued that the woman had consented to sex. A jury found
him innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was that the case was a false claim and that the
motive was ultimately to sue Royal Caribbean,'' said Fletcher
Peacock, the public defender appointed to represent Virtucio at
trial in U.S. District Court in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The woman did sue Royal Caribbean. Her lawyer, Johnna Hansen,
said the cruise line had appeared to cooperate with her client and
had notified the FBI at the woman's request. But she said the
cruise line tried to make sure that no one else on the ship heard
about the incident and that FBI agents were delayed for several
hours before boarding the ship. During that time, she said, her
client's room had been cleaned, making it harder to gather
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   She also said lawyers for the cruise line conferred with
Virtucio's lawyers in the courtroom during the criminal trial.
Peacock said Royal Caribbean maintained a neutral stance, but its
lawyers were pleased by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Royal Caribbean said it was not responsible for
a crew member's actions outside his official duties.
</P>
<P>
   To counter what it regards as frivolous lawsuits, the cruise
industry had its lawyers draft a measure in 1995 to restrict the
ability of sexual-assault victims to collect damages in court, and
to prohibit foreign crew members from suing in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, introduced the measure as an amendment
on the House floor and it passed without a hearing. Between 1993
and 1998, Young received at least $29,000 from political action
committees and individuals affiliated with the cruise industry,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was stopped by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., only after
lobbyists for the trial lawyers noticed the language and started a
campaign against it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest allegations of a cover-up involved an
alleged sexual attack on a crew member. A 26-year-old Carnival
employee was in her cabin last Aug. 13, nearing the end of a
weeklong Caribbean cruise on the Imagination, when one of the
ship's engineers, Yurij Senes, attacked and sodomized her,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Bianchi, said the woman reported the rape to ship's
security and identified her attacker. But Carnival's lawyers said
the woman initially did not want to report the episode to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, when the ship docked in Miami, Senes was
dismissed from his job and arrangements were made for him to be
taken to Miami International Airport for a flight to his native
Italy, because his visa automatically expired when he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the female crew member had filed a complaint with the
FBI and agents told Carnival security personnel that they wanted to
interview Senes. Mase, Carnival's lawyer, said a mix-up occurred
and the suspect was taken to his flight without being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi disclosed at a court hearing last month that his client
had testified before a federal grand jury investigating whether
Carnival helped the officer escape. John Schlesinger, special
counsel in the U.S. attorney's office, would not confirm or deny an
inquiry. But he expressed amazement at the suspect's escape.
``Carnival raised some eyebrows when they whisked him to the
airport moments ahead of the posse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Senes was indicted on federal charges of
aggravated sexual assault. He was arrested at his home in Italy and
faces extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who sue cruise lines said it is common for crew members
suspected of crimes to be sent home. Tracking them down for
depositions and subpoenas can be expensive and difficult,
particularly in undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general experience is that the cruise lines would rather be
horse-whipped than bring these perpetrators back to U.S. law
enforcement,'' said Eriksen, the Lake Worth lawyer, who has located
crew members as far away as Bombay, India.
</P>
<P>
   There also is evidence that employees are encouraged to lie or
remain silent. Charles Lipcon, a Miami lawyer who often represents
crew members, said they often keep quiet about crimes because those
who speak out are fired and sent home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Florida appeals court found that Carnival had fired a
crew member, Luis Baiton, for refusing to lie to protect the
company in a civil suit brought by another seaman. ``In our view,
allowing retaliation against an employee for truthful testimony, or
refusing to give false testimony, strikes at the heart of the
adjudicatory process,'' said the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case did not involve sexual assault, but rather a claim
filed by a crew member who was injured on a ship. Baiton said
Carnival tried to persuade him to lie in his testimony on behalf of
the other crewman and fired him in retaliation when he refused.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Royal Caribbean paid a $9 million fine after
pleading guilty to a fleet-wide conspiracy to dump oil into the
ocean. As part of the plea, Royal Caribbean acknowledged ordering
an engineer to lie to a federal grand jury and destroying evidence

NEW PROGRAM AIMS TO SEND YOUNG JEWS TO ISRAEL TO PROMOTE
JEWISHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to rebuild religious identity among young Jews,
who are marrying non-Jews and abandoning the faith in large
numbers, Jewish organizations plan to start a program that will pay
for any Jew in the world between age 15 and 26 to travel to Israel
for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Birthright Israel, is expected to cost $300 million
over five years and to be financed by the Israeli government, a
group of major Jewish donors from North America and the Council of
Jewish Federations.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to announce the
program in Jerusalem on Monday night in a speech to the General
Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations _ whose many American
participants had intentionally defied a State Department travel
advisory that warned American civilians to leave Israel because of
a possible Iraqi attack.
</P>
<P>
   The program's backers concede that they cannot estimate how many
will take part, whether enough funds will be raised, or how they
will determine who is eligible to travel _ a knotty question that
reopens the whole controversy over ``who is a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption behind Birthright Israel is that even a spring
break spent in Israel can form a connection to Jewishness for young
people who have little or no affiliation with synagogues or other
Jewish institutions. The program is also an effort to mend the
fraying ties among Jews, who find themselves increasingly divided
over both the Israeli peace negotiations with the Palestinians and
the theological conflicts between the Orthodox and more liberal
branches of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is the cement that can bind the Jewish community
together, say Michael H. Steinhardt, one of Wall Street's
wealthiest money managers, and Charles R. Bronfman, co-chairman of
the Seagram Co. in Montreal. The two men initiated the Birthright
Israel program, and each is contributing $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope that over time, 10 or 15 years perhaps, the
Birthright trip can develop into a tradition analogous to that of
the Bar or Bat Mitzvah,'' Steinhardt said last week in an interview
in his office. ``Our hope is that a trip to Israel will be another
rite of passage of Jewish life.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, American Jewish organizations have
agonized over ``Jewish continuity,'' or how to preserve Jewish
heritage among successive generations. Some leaders have concluded
that Jewish day schools, summer camps and youth groups are far more
effective than quick trips to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that six-week trips, 10-day trips are very nice _ no
harm is being done,'' said Steven Bayme, National Director for
Jewish Communal Affairs at the American Jewish Committee. ``But I
don't think the faith that is being placed in these kinds of
programs is justified. The Jewish community is looking for a silver
bullet when there are no magic solutions. Jewish continuity
requires a great deal of sustained effort over many years.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet trips to Israel receive broad backing while Jewish day
schools struggle for contributions, said Bayme. The reason, he
said, is that ``there is no consensus on how to insure Jewish
continuity, because we really are divided on what constitutes
Jewish life _ but Israel still has a certain consensual power among
American Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt, an atheist who said he grew up in a ``nominally
Orthodox'' home, agreed. He said that ``Israel has frankly _
through my life, for much of my life _ been a substitute for
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived an important part of my Jewishness through
association with Israel rather than through adherence to a
religious law and substantial observance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress has projected that the Jewish
population outside of Israel, which has about 8 million people,
will decline to about 4 million in the next 30 years, said
Steinhardt. In the United States, about half of all Jews marry
non-Jews, and the children of a large majority of those
intermarried couples do not remain Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Young people who have visited Israel are far more likely to
marry other Jews, according to a report by the American Jewish
Committee published in 1994. But the report said that a large
majority of American Jews _ 69 percent _ have never visited Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting trips to Israel is not a new strategy. ``Israel
Experience,'' an organization already financed by Bronfman, has
tried to increase youth travel to Israel in the last two years
through advertisements in magazines like ``Seventeen'' and ``Teen
People.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign resulted in a ``slight blip of an increase'' of
young American Jews visiting Israel, said Ivy B. Abrams, vice
president of marketing for Israel Experience. But for 10 years,
despite these and other efforts, the numbers of American youth
traveling to Israel has remained pretty flat _ at about 16,000 a
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt and Bronfman are now hoping that by essentially
giving away the trips, they will attract many more takers.
</P>
<P>
   Under their plan, beginning in the year 2000, Birthright would
cover the cost of air fare and first ten days of a trip to Israel
with any one of over 200 established Israeli travel programs. There
is a wide menu of choices _ kibbutz trips, archeological trips,
hiking treks, ecological journeys, and historical trips. The
expenses for the rest of trips lasting more than 10 days would have
to come from another source, Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews today,'' Bronfman said, ``particularly in the United
States and Canada, are free to be whatever they want to be, and
that's a pretty new situation for Jews. So now what we have to do
is undertake the selling of Jewishness to Jews.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The idea for Birthright originated with Yossi Beilin, a former
Cabinet minister and a member of the Israeli Parliament, who talked
about an initiative to send every Jewish boy or girl on an
all-expense-paid 13th birthday trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The idea appealed to Steinhardt, who pulled Bronfman aside
during a fund-raising ball at the Israel Museum over a year ago.
The two went outside and sat on a stone wall overlooking Jerusalem,
and Steinhardt suggested that they adopt Beilin's idea and
undertake something ``very big and very audacious,'' as Bronfman
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, for younger Jews, Bronfman said the program would
become at least partly ``self-financing.'' Under the plan, local
Jewish Federations would notify every Jewish couple who have a baby
that they have deposited a $180 check for every Jewish baby born in
a special account. The amount was determined by multiplying 10
times chai, the Hebrew characters that represent 18 and also form
the word ``life.'' That original investment could be augmented by
friends and relatives, bar mitzvah money, and community
organizations, eventually building up to enough for a trip to
Israel, Bronfman said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that many details are still dangling: how many
Jewish babies there are and how to find them, who will govern a
worldwide program, how to fund trips years from now for children
whose friends and relatives do not add to the basic sum and how to
determine _ perhaps the stickiest question of all _ who is eligible
for the program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most divisive issues among Jews today is the question
of who is a Jew. Orthodox and Conservative Judaism recognize only
the children of Jewish mothers, while Reform Judaism has opened the
door to patrilineal descent. The different streams are also divided
over what constitutes conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt said he would lean toward ``inclusiveness,'' and open
the program to any young person ``who chooses to voluntarily
associate his or her future with that of the Jewish people.''

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Gary M.
Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from Georgia to Maine to
Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview survivors of ASA
Flight 529, a small propeller-driven plane that crashed in a
hayfield in West Georgia killing 10 of the 29 people aboard. In a
seven-part series, Pomerantz vividly describes the 9 minutes and 20
seconds of horror aboard the doomed aircraft and how the tragedy
has reshaped lives. Photos and illustrations for the series and
layouts from Parts One, Two and Three will be posted in a folder
slugged ASA-CRASH in the National folder on the Cox server. Here is

   CRASH-THEFIRE _ The little propeller-driven plane with 29 people
aboard fell out of the sky at 140 miles per hour. It sliced through
treetops and bore down on a hayfield in Carrollton, Ga. The left
wing tip gouged the earth first. The wing ripped away from the body
of the plane as dirt clods and rocks flew. The plane's nose next
skidded on its underside. Then the one-winged plane went airborne
again, bouncing up a ridge about 100 feet, the first killing steps
in a macabre dance of physics. The plane was in pieces, connected
only by a common fate. (Pomerantz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   US-IRAQ _ WASHINGTON _ For the second time in nine months,
President Clinton has taken a massive strike force to the brink of
an attack against Iraq, only to draw back in the face of
last-minute concessions from Saddam Hussein. Both men dutifully
demonstrated their now familiar abilities to engage, then withdraw,
from a dangerous, and costly, contest pitting the will of the
world's mightiest military power against the wiles of its most
menacing dictator. Moving forward, Clinton and Saddam are in much
the same position as they were when the year began. The long-term
solution, a weary Clinton said Sunday, is for Saddam to step down _
willingly or not. Developing. LEDE-ALL. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   w/IRAQ-OPPOSITION _ AMMAN, Jordan _ Moauth Abdul Raheem used to

Though the United States did not strike Iraq in this latest round
of cat-and-mouse over weapons inspections, this avuncular
66-year-old thinks the time will come. ``I am not disappointed. If
this opportunity was missed, there will be lots of other
opportunities,'' said Raheem. Raheem's Iraqi National Accord is one
of the groups that could stand the most to gain from the latest
stand off with Saddam Hussein. As ``Saddam Fatigue'' _ as one Arab
diplomat calls it _ builds, Saddam faces less support from his
traditional allies and, possibly, more active opposition. (Kaplow,

   w/IRAQ-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Since the end of the Gulf War, Russia

Hussein for his failure to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
Of the three permanent members of the U.N. National Security
Council that have done so, Russia has been among the most stalwart

 STRUGGLING TO CONVINCE INDONESIANS THE ARMY IS THEIR FRIEND  (jw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``Please don't break through the
barriers,'' an army captain pleaded to a huge throng of student
demonstrators. ``We are soldiers. We are not the enemy of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned to his troops, massed shield-to-shield across a
roadway, stern-faced behind their plastic visors. ``No shooting at
all,'' he ordered. ``Hooray for the students! Hooray for the
military!''
</P>
<P>
   That was the early evening of the day now being called Black
Friday, before troops fired volley after volley of rounds in the
direction of the demonstrators, killing a half dozen and wounding
scores more.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Indonesians, diplomats and other analysts remain
perplexed Sunday as to why the military acted as harshly as it did
against demonstrators who had made no real effort to break through
its lines.
</P>
<P>
   At a moment when the military is desperate to show that it is
indeed ``not the enemy of society,'' it was one of the worst
tactical decisions it could have taken.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, which were reported vividly in the newly open
Indonesian press, have caused outrage here at the very moment when
the dominant role of the military in Indonesian society is hotly
debated. Some experts even see the success or failure of the
military's attempt to reform as the linchpin of Indonesia's efforts
to move peacefully toward greater democracy after more than three
decades of authoritarian rule by President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deaths spurred huge demonstrations of tens of thousands
of students and poor people and an opportunistic wave of rioting on
Saturday. The unrest subsided Sunday in the rain and the
exhaustion, but not before some military officers on duty to keep
order Saturday said they felt uncomfortable exerting their
authority, given the new level of public anger against them.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces are now at one of the most delicate moments in
their history, their public image at a low ebb because of their
close association with Suharto and because of past abuses now being
made public.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, took the
humbling step of visiting a hospital to apologize to students who
had been beaten by soldiers. Unimpressed, one of the students, a
young woman named Zulhamdi, told him, ``If you can't resolve this
incident, you'd better resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday's killings, calls for his resignation have
multiplied, despite the general's reputation as a moderate and
reform-minded leader.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not always been this way for Indonesia's proud and
powerful armed forces. Since the founding of the nation in 1945,
the military, known by its Indonesian acronym as ABRI, has played a
dominant political, administrative and social role. Under Suharto,
this role was skewed to make the military the instrument of the
repression with which he consolidated his power.
</P>
<P>
   The military permeates society under a home-grown philosophy
known as ``dwifungsi,'' or dual function. Serving officers hold
administrative posts from the highest to almost the lowest levels
of society. They are ambassadors, corporate directors, provincial
governors and Cabinet ministers. Fully two-thirds of the 300,000
members of the military are assigned to civilian duties.
</P>
<P>
   The current debate, and one of the issues that had brought the
demonstrators to the streets on Friday, is over a reduction in the
75 seats that are allocated to the military in the 500-seat
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The attempts to reduce the military's civilian functions have
become a major focus of the reforms of the post-Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction and pace of change in ABRI will be one of the
most important _ if not the most important _ determinants of
political change in Indonesia,'' said David Timberman, the
Indonesia representative of the National Democratic Institute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Wiranto and some of his senior officers have voiced their
support for a retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABRI must reduce its role in politics to a minimum and step
back to give civil society more leeway,'' said Lt. Gen. Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono, the military's chief theoretician of reform, who
headed its office of social-political affairs until the post was
abolished in a gesture of reform last week. ``ABRI will be part of
the process of empowering civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   But reformers like Yudhoyono face resistance from middle-level
officers who stand to lose opportunities for prestige and wealth,
and the fears of some officers who worry about the stability of a
society long dependent on the armed forces for much of its
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent experts agree that this time of transition
could be a dangerous moment to remove the traditional bulwarks of
stability, especially since civilian political and administrative
institutions withered under Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia's new, more open society, various blocs are
attempting to exercise authority, from separatist movements to
labor unions to Islamic groups, and the military has voiced its
concern about the effects of these unchecked forces. In addition, a
contracting economy, increased unemployment and possible food
shortages are creating an unstable situation. Rioting and attacks
on ethnic Chinese, along with a wave of apparently unchecked
killings of Indonesians deemed ``sorcerers,'' have increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some in ABRI quite genuinely want to reduce their
role, but they face a dilemma,'' said Harold Crouch, an expert on
the Indonesian military at the Australian National University in
Canberra. ``They fear that at this moment if they withdraw further,
there could be a danger of anarchy. On the other hand, if they stay
on, that may even provoke the anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at reform have begun painfully, and many Indonesian and
foreign experts remain skeptical that the powerful military can _
or truly will _ beat a unilateral retreat from civilian power.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto's first step was to purge the leadership of hard-liners,
particularly Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto who
was believed to have been behind many of the military's abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Next was an investigation of past military abuses, beginning
with the shootings of four students in May that helped spark the
riots that led to Suharto's downfall. Other investigations involved
abuses over the years in battles against separatists in the
provinces of Aceh and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations, which threatened to spread in embarrassing
directions, have made limited progress. But in an extraordinary
step for a dominant military, it admitted in July that one of its
elite units was involved in the abduction and torture of as many as
two dozen dissidents this year.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant step, the military has withdrawn combat
forces from disputed territories in East Timor and Aceh. Both
withdrawals have been surrounded by controversy, and there are
reports that fighting troops have been reintroduced into East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a perilous military operation: a withdrawal from the
heights of political influence at a time of national transition and
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many countries were able to start reform but unable to end the
process properly, as happened with the Soviet Union with its
glasnost and perestroika movement,'' Wiranto said not long ago.
``The armed forces will use the authority with which it is vested
to take part in safeguarding and controlling the reform movement.''

   KUWAIT CITY _ It seems like the middle of nowhere, dunes dotted
with little more than herds of sheep and the occasional camel
carcass. But it is home to 1,500 American soldiers _ roving the
desert just 30 miles east of the Iraqi border _ and some of them
are getting sick of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should just go ahead and do it,'' Pfc. Carlos De La
Cruz, 22, of Newark, N.J., said Sunday as he stood guard on a sandy
berm at the camp there. ``No sense in us keep coming back every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not spoiling for a fight, but echoing what he and other
soldiers said was a common view the day after Saddam announced that
he would comply, after all, once again, at the last moment, with
conditions for United Nations weapons inspections. ``I think he's
playing games,'' De La Cruz said. And so, he added, the United
States should strike at Iraq despite its leader's promises.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans are closer to the dispute with Iraq than the
soldiers here. Several thousand of them rotate in and out for
training with the Kuwaiti military. And, along with other soldiers
stationed around the Persian Gulf, the last several days have been
tense ones, as the possibility of a military confrontation _
perhaps a fierce one _ neared, then apparently receded after Iraq
said it would comply with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the last time Saddam decided not to comply with the
weapons inspections, the military presence here in Kuwait ballooned
to some 10,000 men and women over five weeks. In all, there were
some 44,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   So far this time, only a handful of additional troops have
arrived in Kuwait. While military officials here have declined to
discuss numbers, military officials in Washington said that another
3,000 ground troops are eventually scheduled to reach Kuwait,
starting early this week, largely to serve as defense against any
possible Iraqi attack here. In addition, air power will be
increased.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday evening, military officials said they were not
aware that Saddam's offer of an agreement without conditions _ and
President Clinton's conditional acceptance of that offer _ would
halt that buildup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that has changed,'' said Col. Ron Williams,
the head Army spokesman in Kuwait. ``The question is how much will
that change. The military is continuing to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States went to war with Iraq in 1991, in part
to free Kuwait from an Iraqi invasion, the American and Kuwaiti
militaries have worked together closely. They conduct joint desert
training on the Udairi range _ where De La Cruz has been living in
a tent for three months now _ and at two air bases, Ahmad Al Jaber,
about 25 miles south of Kuwait City, and at Ali Al Salem, about the
same distance to the northwest. In addition, there is a permanent
U.S. military base on the Kuwait Bay, Camp Doha.
</P>
<P>
   Although the information is not normally secret, military
officials were reluctant to give out even basic details about the
bases, and the soldiers themselves have been kept largely behind
base walls.
</P>
<P>
   But in a handful of interviews Sunday, soldiers expressed
frustration at what they said they saw as a problem with Iraq that
would not go away. Saddam, several said, should have been a
casualty of the 1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a couple of times for me,'' said Pvt. Erik
Tackett, 27, of Newport Beach, Calif., who has served in the region
before and was standing guard with De La Cruz. ``I'm getting real
sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Michael Bucci, 23, of Chambersburg, Pa., said he felt the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion,'' he said, his head poked out of a Humvee and his
machine gun swinging out into the desert, ``we should just bomb the
hell out of him _ get it over with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But like soldiers everywhere, he said, he was also not sad if he
did not have to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go in, we go,'' he said. ``If not, even better. We'll be
home by Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   But his partner in guarding the range, Sgt. James Rundberg, from
New Baltimore, N.Y., outside of Albany, said that going to war was
something the nation should approach with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need for us to rush into it, as long as he's going
to comply and he's going to comply fully,'' Rundberg said. ``If
not, I guess we're going to have to do whatever the higher-ups
think we ought to do.''

ALBRIGHT ANGERS MALAYSIANS BY MEETING WITH JAILED LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
met the wife of a jailed Malaysian political leader here Sunday in
a gesture of solidarity that angered her hosts and suggested that
politics could swamp economics at a meeting of Asian and Pacific
Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Albright talked briefly with Wan Azizah Ismail, whose husband,
former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, was imprisoned in
September and is on trial for corruption and sex-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the meeting, Albright had a caustic public
exchange with Malaysia's Minister of Trade, Rafidah Aziz, about
Anwar's treatment. ``The reporting on the trial of Anwar Ibrahim
has given us great concern,'' Albright said at a news conference
with other ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafidah responded that Anwar would get a fair trial, adding,
``Maybe when I go to the states, I would like to meet Ken Starr,''
referring to the independent prosecutor who is investigating
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not in jail,'' Albright replied brusquely, to the
surprise of hundreds of reporters who had turned up to hear an
announcement of a new trade agreement involving the 21 countries at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers did announce a trade deal, though it fell far
short of the sweeping agreement to lower tariffs that many
countries were seeking. Stymied by opposition from Japan, the
countries agreed to reconsider the proposals, which would lower
tariffs in nine major industries, at the World Trade Organization.
That basically puts off the drive for free trade in Asia until
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's compromise was a fitting conclusion to a chaotic
opening weekend at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
which ends Wednesday. With restive crowds outside, rancorous
exchanges inside and a conspicuously absent guest from the United
States, the gathering seemed anything but cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Saturday that he would skip the
meeting to monitor the Iraq crisis from Washington. While Albright
participated in the talks Sunday, she cut short her visit to return
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's political turmoil flared up on the streets, too, as
200 demonstrators marched at the base of the Petronas Towers, the
twin skyscrapers that are the world's tallest buildings. The crowd
chanted slogans against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until riot
police dispersed them with tear gas and a water cannon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mahathir criticized foreign visitors for using the
APEC meeting as an excuse to meddle in Malaysia's internal affairs.
His comments came after Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy,
met with Anwar's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were more diplomatic in their assessment of the trade
agreement. But it was clear that many were deflated by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the talks collapsed, but we're disappointed,''
said Sergio Marchi, Canada's Minister for International Trade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marchi said the agreement failed to build on a pact reached at
last year's APEC meeting in Vancouver to reduce trade barriers in
Asian markets by Jan. 1, 1999. By shifting the negotiations to the
WTO, the countries have delayed that process by as much as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan steadfastly refused to lower tariffs in its fishing and
forestry industries. Although Japan agreed to move the negotiations
to the WTO, it gave no indication that it would retreat from its
position.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with knowledge of the talks also said that Mexico and
Chile resisted the package because they did not want to weaken
their bargaining position in upcoming trade negotiations with
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. Trade Representative, said that
the agreement to move the entire package to the WTO constituted a
victory, since Japan had wanted to strip out the fishing and
forestry industries altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago, we thought the whole initiative would
collapse,'' Ms. Barshefsky said. ``From our point of view, moving
forward is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's trade and industry minister, Kaoru Yosano, said Japan
had not been able to mobilize domestic support for the cuts in
fishing and forestry tariffs. But he held open the chance of doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't confuse what is happening at APEC with what will happen
at the WTO,'' Yosano told reporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Haven't we seen this screen before?
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet initiative from Microsoft Corp. is an
all-in-one service that combines news, information, shopping,
bulletin boards and electronic mail. Even its name sounds familiar:
MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, MSN was originally the banner for one of Microsoft's
most embarrassing missteps, a subscription-based online service
meant to crush America Online. But that service, introduced three
years ago, was slow, full of bugs and hard to use, and it fell far
behind the competition _ on one side from America Online and on the
other from the emerging World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting its focus to the Internet, Microsoft then poured money
into elaborate entertainment offerings, but few people looked at
them. After canceling those, the company built a series of Internet
services meant to be useful, like the Sidewalk local-entertainment
guide and the Expedia travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, there's no page like home.
</P>
<P>
   The company has realized that on the Web, the power and the
money are going to search engines like Yahoo, which have added so
many features that they are beginning to look like just the sort of
online service MSN was three years ago. So Microsoft has reversed
itself again and is stitching its disparate Internet services back
into a unified network, which it reintroduced in September under
the name MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The service has hardly taken the world by storm, and it may face
additional questions. Last week, Pete Higgins, the top Microsoft
executive who looked after the company's online efforts, announced
that he would take a six-month leave of absence beginning in
January and would return in an unspecified capacity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the online business will report to Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft's president, who is widely seen as more hard charging and
confrontational than Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins says that his departure reflects no more than a desire
to take a break to spend time with his family and tend his salmon
farm. But in a sign that Microsoft may see the need for a more
significant change, Ballmer said the company was searching for an
outsider to replace Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete has us on a nice trajectory,'' Ballmer said. ``All we're
trying to do is pump up the volume as we move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's trouble in gaining traction for its Web effort
stands in sharp contrast to the speed with which its Internet
Explorer Web-browsing software has been able to surge past its main
competitor, the browsers offered by Netscape Communications Corp.
The Justice Department, of course, has been arguing that Microsoft
improperly used the market power of its Windows operating system to
extend its domination into the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But while the new MSN has the seeming advantage of being
reachable by a single mouse click from the Internet Explorer
browser that comes loaded on every new Windows PC, it remains
uncertain how many Web surfers will choose to make that click.
After all, the initial MSN online service also had the enviable
asset of a start button on the main screen of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's biggest advantage in its Web effort, however, may be
the popularity of some of its individual Web sites. Most notably,
the Hotmail e-mail service that Microsoft bought last year signs up
150,000 new users a day. Taken together, the Microsoft sites
constitute the third-most-popular network on the Internet after
America Online and Yahoo, according to Media Metrix, the rating
service based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all this was planned. Microsoft is the master of the
so-called ready-fire-aim business model. The company introduces a
hastily conceived product and then, through a war of attrition
affordable perhaps only to a company with a stock-market value of
$274 billion, methodically hunts down the bugs until a version of
the product finally wins the minds, if not the hearts, of the
computing masses.
</P>
<P>
   This trial-and-error approach has convinced Microsoft that Web
sites are in fact mainly another form of software. That is a sharp
contrast to the approach taken by Yahoo, Disney and most other
purveyors of what are called ``portals'' _ a media-network approach
to the business that is based on gathering and retaining as large
an audience as possible to sell to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it hired many media types but learned, for
example, that what brings people back to Sidewalk is not witty
reviews or flashy graphics but sophisticated programs that help
people find the events they are looking for and then display a map
of nearby restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The other sites that have worked well for the company allow
customers to use software to search for airplane tickets, cars,
home mortgages and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sees MSN as closer to an extension of its Office suite
of programs than as a magazine or an online television channel.
This plays into its current thinking about how it will turn MSN's
losses _ which it declines to quantify _ into profits. First, all
those programs that help people find things to buy, like Expedia
and so on, put Microsoft in a position to earn fees from each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   And second, it sees a host of new computerized services that can
be delivered over the Internet as part of what the chairman, Bill
Gates, calls the company's megaserver strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, customers could connect to MSN to automatically
back up the information stored on their hard drives. They may pay a
fee for this _ or, more likely, Ballmer says, they will have to
watch advertising as the service is performed.

</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake Microsoft made as its strategy evolved was
to miss the power of portals. But it has now focused its prodigious
product development organization on building a better portal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's research department regularly surveys hundreds of
Internet users. It has discovered that so far only one-third of the
users of the so-called ``portal'' sites exhibit what it defines as
``portal behavior'' _ using at least three services within the same
name-brand portal site. But that proportion is growing rapidly,
meaning that while the market remains open, it may not stay so as
consumers develop Web brand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   As the center of its portal strategy, Microsoft created a new
home page, called MSN.com, meant to be a jumping-off point for its
other services. This page is the first thing that many users of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer now see. So do users of the old MSN
online service, which has been transformed into what amounts to a
basic Internet-access service provider.
</P>
<P>
   As at other portals like Yahoo and Excite, the MSN.com home page
lets users select certain information _ like local weather, sports,
and news on certain topics _ that they want to see first thing
every day.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial planning earlier this year, this portal page
was going to be called ``Start,'' a name that echoes the button on
the Windows desktop. But upon further review, the name struck
Microsoft executives as too transient and too oriented toward
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it chose MSN to emphasize this network theme and
redesigned its other services to appear more consistent and to
feature the MSN logo. Thus Hotmail became MSN Hotmail, Expedia is
MSN Expedia, and so on. Each of these has a series of links that
direct users to other sites in the network.
</P>
<P>
   The result, since the September rollout, has been an immediate
jump in traffic. Before the new design, for example, only 13
percent of the visitors to Expedia came from other Microsoft sites,
the company says. Now it is 54 percent. Even Hotmail, which has
demonstrable momentum on its own, now gets about one-third of its
new-member referrals from other MSN sites.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult for Microsoft's evolving online strategy
to maintain credibility with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic direction changed so often that every time you
worked with them it didn't go anywhere,'' said Michael Golden, the
head of media at Organic Online, an interactive advertising agency.
Organic, he said, spent a lot of time with Avis Rent A Car on a
sponsorship of the Microsoft travel site, now defunct, called Mungo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he allows, several of his clients have been finding
vigorous sales on the MSN Shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, Microsoft has more than doubled its
ad-sales force to 40 people from 20. And it has discovered what
America Online realized about a year ago _ that there is a lot of
money available to offer online ``distribution'' to other Web
services as well as traditional marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for example, took in a total of $60 million from
four search engines _ Alta Vista, Infoseek, Lycos and Snap _ to be
featured on the MSN home page. It signed a $90 million advertising
deal with First USA, the credit-card unit of Bank One. And it has
sold $26 million worth of local advertisements on its redesigned
Sidewalk service, which is moving to be more of a national yellow
pages than an entertainment guide.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the strategic direction may have shifted, people who
deal with MSN say that its executives move with a hard nose in
whatever direction they are pointed.
</P>
<P>
   One marketing official of an online store that has a
multimillion-dollar contract for Microsoft to send shoppers to its
site was flabbergasted when MSN officials asked the advertiser to
put links on its site to send surfers back to MSN after shopping.
``They are much more hard driving and bottom-line oriented than
other Internet companies,'' said the marketer, who rebuffed the
demand.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, MSN's new consistent-brand approach glosses over
the many incompatibilities between the sites that resulted from the
various product groups that did not coordinate design of their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Because each of the originally separate services posted a
slightly different privacy policy, they cannot share data about
users with other parts of the network.
</P>
<P>
   Such exchanges, however, would be difficult anyway, because each
site has a separate user-registration database. One person can sign
up for the user code name Bsmith on Hotmail. A second Bsmith could
use that name on Expedia and a third person could sign up
separately on Investor. Or all three accounts could be the same
person, and Microsoft would have no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it is working on a way to have a single unified
registration account, of the sort that Yahoo and Excite have. But
it will be complicated to retroactively change customers' account
information.
</P>
<P>
   And even over the last year, as the strategy was changed to
merge the separate sites into the unified portal, it was up to the
separate teams to work out the details of the integration among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The process, especially to newcomers, was excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a start-up, I spent less than 1 percent of my time
communicating what we were doing,'' said Sabeer Bhatia, the chief
executive of Hotmail, who was with the company when Microsoft
bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Microsoft, the overhead of having meetings and building a
consensus among a group of people is so high, I had to hire people
just to manage the communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that is now in the past, Microsoft executives assert. Their
strategy is set and they are all working to flesh out this new
vision of a utilitarian portal.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft is working to improve MSN by expanding the
Internet search capability and adding instant messaging and other
features that let users communicate with one another and form
virtual communities.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be much more emphasis on shopping services, to
complement the new design of Sidewalk, and offerings for small
businesses and Web publishers provided by the Link Exchange
advertising network of 400,000 Web sites that Microsoft recently
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Of course with all the changes, many wonder how long Microsoft
will be willing to continue to lose money on its online efforts.
But Ballmer insists the company will not pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a company that makes long-term investments,'' he said
last week. ``MSN can be a great business. The largest unanswered
question is how quickly will this happen.''

TRUDEAU'S SON PRESUMED DROWNED IN LAKE AFTER AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau was swept into a mountain lake by an avalanche in British
Columbia on Friday and is presumed drowned, police officials said
Sunday. Heavy snow has forced rescue teams to suspend their search.
</P>
<P>
   The young man, Michel Trudeau, 23, was trying to make his way
out of the Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, about 100 miles north
of the Washington-Idaho border, when he and three friends were
caught in a snowslide that pushed them down the mountain and swept
two of them into the frigid waters of Kokanee Lake, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiers who witnessed the avalanche hiked to a nearby town and
called the police. A rescue helicopter arrived Saturday morning and
picked up three of the skiers but Trudeau was not found.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Russ Grabb, a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, said divers would be sent to search the lake once the
weather clears and the snow surrounding the lake can be stabilized
by dropping explosives from a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Grabb said Trudeau was considered ``missing and presumed
drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, a microbiologist, spent the last year in British
Columbia working as a ski instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Grabb said Trudeau and five friends had hiked to a back country
cabin in the park on Wednesday to ski. On Friday afternoon, Trudeau
and three others decided to hike down the mountain and return to
their car.
</P>
<P>
   As they hiked, the four men were hit by an avalanche. Trudeau
and a friend, Andrew Bednarz, 23, were swept into the lake, the
sergeant said. The other two were dragged to the edge of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers who came along the trail just after the accident said
Trudeau and his heavy backpack had been carried about 300 feet into
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   One hiker, Paul Williamson, told police that he could see
Trudeau ``shouting for help and groaning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see him,'' Williamson said. ``We knew it was going to
be a slow and painful death. But we couldn't reach him. He was in
the middle of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pierre Trudeau, who is now 79 and lives in
Montreal, issued a statement saying the former prime minister is
deeply saddened at the accident of the youngest of his three sons
but will be making no further public comment. Nor has his former
wife, Margaret, made any public comment.

   SEAGRAM EXPECTED TO OUST HEAD OF UNIVERSAL STUDIOS
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' the lavish three-hour film made by Universal
Studios, opened over the weekend to poor reviews and a
disappointing box office, increasing the expectations in the movie
industry that Seagram, the studio's owner, planned to oust Frank
Biondi Jr., Universal's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry executives close to Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
Seagram's chairman, predicted that he would dismiss Biondi within
the next few weeks, possibly earlier. At the same time, these
executives said, Bronfman plans to revamp the corporate set-up so
that various divisions like movies and music report directly to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ORACLE TAKES ON OPERATING SYSTEMS
</P>
<P>
   As the Comdex computer industry trade show opens in Las Vegas,
the chairman of Oracle plans to introduce a new version of his
company's database program that he hopes will do away almost
entirely with the operating system on computer servers.
</P>
<P>
   ANYBODY HAVE AN OLD $20?
</P>
<P>
   When the Treasury Department issued a redesigned $20 bill in
September, officials said that the new notes would help thwart
counterfeiting by keeping ahead of digital printing technology. But
virtually no vending machines that take twenties accept the new
bills. And it will be well into next year before they do. About
100,000 merchandise vending machines accept $20 bills, as do many
change makers and digital vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   DEAL FOR FIBER OPTIC LINES
</P>
<P>
   Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain has agreed to buy roughly $400
million worth of fiber optic lines from Global Crossing, a small
international communications carrier.
</P>
<P>
   UNFETTERED OPTIMISM FOR INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of two newly public companies _ Theglobe.com and
Earthweb _ soared last week as investors once again rushed to buy
up the promise of the Internet. Small investors pushed the prices
of many Internet stocks to levels that not only seemed to defy
gravity but also common sense.

   NEWS ORGANIZATIONS PUSH INTO CUBA
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the volume of foreign news is dwindling, networks
are eliminating foreign news bureaus and newspapers are playing
down reports from overseas, a dozen news organizations are making a
considerable effort to open news bureaus in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   BERKSHIRE ASSETS DROP 15 PERCENT

<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway, the investment and insurance company led by
the billionaire Warren Buffett, had a 15 percent drop in assets in
the third quarter.

<P>
   VALUE OF `ER' DEPRECIATES
</P>
<P>
   When NBC decided to pay $13 million for each new episode of
``ER,'' it made history: no one had ever paid more for a show. But
the show's high ratings are at least giving the network value for
price. The cable channel TNT paid a record $1 million an episode
for four years of repeats. Judging by the ratings so far, the
return is a bit more risky.

AMERICA ONLINE HAS NEW PORTAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When America Online bought the small Israeli start-up company
Mirabilis in June for $287 million, people in the industry
scratched their heads and wondered what the buyer was getting.
Mirabilis makes a software program called ICQ for chat and instant
messaging that has been distributed free to Internet users, who
give it a cultish dedication that one executive likened to fans'
devotion to the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts wondered how America Online would recoup its investment
in Mirabilis, which had yet to make a profit from its grass-roots
chatters, without offending them. Many ICQ members wrote notes of
protest on the company's Web site (www.icq.com) after the sale,
expressing fears of commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sale, America Online has publicly kept its distance
from ICQ, although it is managing the business closely and has
installed a senior America Online executive, Fred Singer, as chief
operating officer of the Mirabilis unit, now called ICQ.
</P>
<P>
   With ICQ's latest version a few weeks away from public release,
there are now some clues to a possible strategy. The new software
contains all the features of a Web gateway, or portal, built right
into its control panel, and to accommodate the large international
audience of the product, translates information it finds into any
language.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of search engines, like Alta Vista and Excite, as well
as news, financial and weather sites and a dictionary are among the
features provided _ though, at least initially, they are not paying
to be included.
</P>
<P>
   This means that an ICQ user need not open a separate Web-browser
program to find some information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a communication tool with a sophisticated search
integrated into it,'' said Anya Sacharow of Jupiter communications.
``It's redefining search and navigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Through ICQ, America Online appears to be seeking to go beyond
the so-called portals in keeping Web users within its own confines
_ all the better to present advertisers with a semicaptive
audience. But there may be limits to America Online's ability to
promote ICQ directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL can't really put its brand near ICQ, because ICQ users
will become totally alienated by that,'' Ms. Sacharow said.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said the ICQ user base had grown by 60 percent since the
acquisition, to 21 million users. That compares with America
Online's subscriber base of 13 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Is the new strategy the first step toward introducing
advertising into the ICQ community? Singer's answer to that
question was cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the community is so large and powerful, and usage is
so high, what we're trying to do is make it better, build an
audience,'' he said. ``The good news is if you have a community
like this one, and we can continue to provide for them and make
them happy, the other issues will solve themselves.''

<P>
   XCACEL, Mexico _ This pristine Caribbean beach is one of the
world's most important nesting areas for sea turtles, and Mexican
environmentalists view its ivory sands and emerald waters as sacred
terrain, on a smaller scale but a bit the way people in the United
States see Yosemite or the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   For years the environmentalists have been pleading with the
authorities to protect the beach, 67 miles south of Cancun, from
the bulldozers and chain saws that are devouring vast stretches of
palm-covered dunes and mangrove marshes as the government sells off
the coast of the state of Quintana Roo to commercial developers.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, after months of secret negotiations, the state
government announced that Xcacel (pronounced shkah-SELL) had been
sold for $2.2 million to a Spanish conglomerate that plans to build
a 450-room hotel. The sale has set off one of Mexico's most bitter
environmental battles.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and other international and Mexican
conservation groups are campaigning to reverse the deal. Government
officials and the developers are shrugging off the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere there are extremists who say development can't move
in concert with nature, but we disagree,'' said Jorge Polanco
Zapata, who represents Quintana Roo as a senator from Mexico's
governing party and supports the Xcacel hotel project. ``We think
the turtles will be a tourist attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale has become a symbol of what ecologists describe as
predatory development desecrating a wonderland of squawking parrots
and pre-Columbian ruins along 80 miles of coast stretching from
Cancun to the Mayan site of Tulum.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists complain that land use plans and environmental
impact statements have been ignored in the construction of a new
corridor of luxury hotels and ``eco-tourism'' resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Aracely Dominguez, the founder of the region's most important
conservation group and the owner of a small Cancun hotel, said
highways had been gouged through coastal rain forests, mangrove
swamps paved into parking lots and delicate coastal bays dredged
with hydraulic draglines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't permit them to plunder Xcacel as they have all these
other beaches,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Xcacel has become the focus for scientists because of research
showing that thousands of Atlantic green and loggerhead turtles
nest there, apparently attracted to the gentle slope of its sands,
so many that those species' genetic diversity is dependent on the
beach. As a result, scientists and conservationists have based
turtle protection and environmental education programs for the
entire Yucatan Peninsula here.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, thousands of children and their families have made
pilgrimages to Xcacel each year to experience the wonder of the
summer nesting season, when on any evening scores of 400-pound
loggerheads glide through the surf, lumber up the sloping beach and
burrow into the dune to lay eggs. Turtle rangers protect the nests
from the poachers who sack beaches elsewhere in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Xcacel was a federal reserve until 1992, when control passed to
Quintana Roo. Aides to Gov. Mario Villanueva secretly negotiated
the sale, and federal environmental officials have ignored
entreaties to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale has fed cynicism about the government's
environmental policies, because an entire generation of children
has learned that Xcacel is a protected area,'' said Julio Zurita, a
Quintana Roo biologist who helped identify its importance. ``Then
overnight they were told it's been sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the sale in February touched off an outcry
from scores of international environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the builder of a hotel should come in and
destroy the habitat of a creature that's been around for millions
of years,'' said Edgar Wayburn, honorary president of the Sierra
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva reacted by declaring a swath of dune 100 yards wide
the length of the beach to be a ``protected natural area'' and
prohibiting construction there. Conservationists said the move had
little practical consequence, since few hotels build on the dune
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish corporation that bought Xcacel, Sol Melia, which
operates hotels in 23 countries, has said it plans to build ``a
450-room Paradisus Tulum All-Inclusive Beach Resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Evagrio Sanchez, a senior executive of Sol Melia's real estate
division, said his company was awaiting an environmental study
before elaborating final designs. But the hotel will be built away
from the beach, with subdued illumination that will not confuse the
nesting turtles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want sustainable development, with scrupulous protection,
not just for the turtles but for all the fauna and flora,'' Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists were alarmed when, during a meeting in
May, Sol Melia executives outlined plans for a golf course at
Xcacel. A seaside hotel in Costa Rica that Sol Melia has touted as
an example of its commitment to build ``in concert with nature''
features an 18-hole golf course and a discotheque.
</P>
<P>
   Construction at Xcacel has not yet begun, but Sol Melia
employees who put up a barbed-wire fence around their newly
purchased property chopped down 1,200 rare palm trees, said Juan
Carlos Cantu, Greenpeace's Mexico director. Sanchez denied that.
``We're not going to do anything that will go against nature,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If most of the debate has been about ecology, Alfredo Cesar
Dachary, director of Quintana Roo's Caribbean Center for
Sustainable Development, has questioned the economics of the deal.
Why, he asks, did the government sell a coastal treasure like
Xcacel for a price fetched by some private homes in Cancun or the
nearby island of Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That $2.25 million price is completely laughable,'' Cesar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government sold several beaches in the same area last year.
Atop a mangrove marsh on the beach adjoining Xcacel, a developer is
building tracts of concrete bungalows. Builders describe the
sprawling resort as ``low-density'' development, but from the air
it looks like Levittown.
</P>
<P>
   All the construction has attracted thousands of workers to
Quintana Roo, and many live in coastal slums. One squatters'
settlement near Playa del Carmen, 42 miles south of Cancun, has
30,000 inhabitants. When Hurricane Mitch was threatening Quintana
Roo recently, there was an incident that was emblematic of
developers' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The owners at several seacoast hotel projects summarily fired
7,000 construction workers, shorting them a week's pay, and fled.
The panicked laborers, many of whom live in other states, blocked
the coastal highway for hours until authorities sent buses to take
them to Cancun. After sleeping in streets there for two nights,
mobs of hungry workers rioted, shattering windows and overturning
vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Artemio Santos Santos, president of the Coparmex, the state's
most important business group, said environmental and social
disputes were beginning to disrupt Quintana Roo's coastal
development because the government had failed to enforce clear
environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There need to be clear rules for investors about respecting
our fauna and flora, and that's where we've fallen short,'' Santos
said. ``And that could be what's happening with this Xcacel
project. They're developing an area that should be dedicated to the
turtles.''

A SEASON-LONG PLAYOFF IS NEARING A FINAL FOUR, OR FIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder is
uncomfortable enjoying a warm moment. Distant, precise and
calculatingly contrary, Snyder found something to be troubled about
in the afterglow of his program's greatest victory in the last
decade _ if not ever. In a low voice, he wondered aloud what would
have happened if Nebraska had beaten his team on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that have diminished what these young people have done _
what this program has accomplished over the last 10 years?'' Snyder
asked. He then shook his head gravely and murmured something about
the unfairness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   His Wildcats' 40-30 victory against the Cornhuskers kept that
musing in the rhetorical realm. In Knoxville, Tenn., however,
Arkansas Coach Houston Nutt was finding out what a momentary
stumble could mean to a team and its bid for respect. His
Razorbacks were predicted to finish at the bottom of the
Southeastern Conference and were considered an undefeated fluke
when they met the Tennessee Volunteers, who were top ranked in the
Bowl Championship Series rating.
</P>
<P>
   But the Razorbacks had a 24-20 lead with just under three
minutes left in the game when the unfairness of it all struck on a
rain-soaked field.
</P>
<P>
   First, deep snapper Benji Mahan sent the ball sailing over
punter Steadman Campbell's head. When he recovered the ball at his
15-yard line, Campbell wisely kicked it out of the end zone for a
safety and the Vols closed to 24-22. Still, Arkansas held the
Tennessee offense and all it had to do was run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 43 seconds remaining, quarterback Clint Stoerner
pulled from behind center and, without being touched, stumbled on
the wet sod. He tried to right himself with the hand that held the
ball. It was a mistake _ the ball squirted lose and Tennessee
recovered and drove 43 yards for the winning score. It was a
devastating moment for a young man who had thrown for three
touchdowns and 274 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't run out a minute and forty-three seconds,'' said
Nutt. ``I hate to lose one like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, Snyder's dreaded diminishing moment had visited
the Razorbacks. Despite the stumble, though, the shape of the new
Bowl Championship Series ranking may have shifted slightly, with
even less ground separating the contenders for the top two slots
that guarantee a date in the national championship game in the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the media poll, Tennessee (9-0) retained the No. 1 ranking
and Kansas State (10-0) the second spot. In the coaches' poll,
however, the Volunteers fell out of the tie for No. 1 that they had
been in last week with Kansas State. The Wildcats were granted sole
possession of No. 1 and the Vols dropped to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA won convincingly against Washington, 36-24, and is
usually rewarded by the three computer rankings, as well as the
Bowl Championship formula, because its schedule is considered among
the nation's strongest. So the Bruins (9-0) may reclaim the top
spot _ they were a close No. 2 last week _ when the latest bowl
ranking is released on Monday, despite being ranked No. 3 by both
the news media and the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be Kansas State. Or Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Until the numbers are crunched, it's fruitless to guess. But
what the Bowl Championship Series ranking has done, besides inject
a little mystified fun into bar-room arguments, is remind college
fans that there is no need for a college football playoff. There
already is one: It takes place every Saturday from late August to
early December.
</P>
<P>
   The best teams usually survive. Just ask Ohio State, which was
eliminated from the title tournament last week by Michigan State.
Or the Wisconsin Badgers, who suffered their first loss of the
season Saturday at Michigan, 27-10. Tulane, the fourth remaining
unbeaten team, learned how treacherous a season-long campaign can
be. Tulane struggled against Army (2-7) before notching its ninth
victory, 49-35.
</P>
<P>
   Buy into this way of thinking and it's easy to see the final two
weeks of the season as a sort of Final Four, plus maybe one, in the
competition for a place in the title game. In addition to
Tennessee, Kansas State and UCLA there are Florida State, which is
No. 1 in The New York Times computer ranking, and Florida, which is
No. 4 in both the news media and coaches' polls and which plays the
Seminoles on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies of Texas A&AMP;M have their nose pressed to the glass
looking for breaks. They leaped to No. 4 in the Times ranking after
beating Missouri, 17-14, on Saturday. The Aggies have won 10
consecutive games since an opening loss to Florida State, and can
win the Big 12 title if they beat rival Texas on Nov. 27 and then
defeat Kansas State in the league championship game on Dec. 5. They
are long-shot contenders because they need UCLA and Tennessee to
lose, too. Then, the Aggies could convincingly argue that as one of
the top two one-loss teams in the nation, they have earned the
title game.
</P>
<P>
   None of these scenarios are detrimental to college football. The
fact that the other bowl games exist insures that the kids on teams
that either have overachieved or recovered from early-season
setbacks are not sentenced to Snyder's ``diminished'' status.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane Coach Tommy Bowden has not argued that his Green Wave
deserves a shot at the national title by dominating Conference USA.
But Tulane deserves the recognition it will get either at the
Liberty Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, which had representatives at West
Point and might be able to choose the New Orleans school to play in
its hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Nutt's Razorbacks not only have a shot at redemption _ his team
will likely get a rematch with Tennessee in the Southeastern
Conference championship game on Dec. 5 _ but they should receive a
holiday bowl trip as a reward for a surprising season. The same
should be said for Air Force (9-1) and Notre Dame (8-1), both of
which have been barely noticed though each has exceeded
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be justice for Michigan and Ohio State.
Michigan, which shared the national championship with Nebraska last
season, opened this season with two losses, but has won eight
straight, including all of its Big 10 games. Like years past, the
Wolverines meet Ohio State on Saturday with the conference title
and a trip to the Rose Bowl at stake. Both have proved that they
are not national-title caliber teams, but they are fine ones and
the winner will have earned the Rose. That is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is correct to worry about the media and fans keeping
college football in perspective no matter how taciturn and dour his
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 years, what was once considered the worst program in the
nation has been built into a consistent winner. Kansas State is now
at the precipice of playing for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcat players say their coach has never congratulated them on
a nice victory. Instead, post-game remarks are confined to what
they did wrong. After Saturday's game, Snyder fretted about his
team's five turnovers and sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, Snyder followed his own advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was going to let them enjoy this,'' he said,
almost embarrassed. ``We'll talk about what we did wrong on
Monday.''

   DUNN-GOP (Washington) _ Late last summer, Rep. Jennifer Dunn,
R-Wash., took a quick trip to Southern California to help out one
of her most endangered colleagues, Rep. Brian Bilbray, a Republican
from La Jolla. Now, as Dunn wages an uphill campaign to become
House majority leader, Bilbray is returning the favor, supporting
Dunn as she takes on the incumbent, Dick Armey of Texas, and the
insurgent, former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent of Oklahoma. Dunn's
labors on behalf of her fellow Republicans are a major selling

deteriorated in the rain and Florida humidity at a junkyard near

   AMMAN, Jordan _ President Bill Clinton's pledge Sunday to
increase support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's opponents
involves a massive challenge in organizing rival groups and
reversing a history of American-backed failures.
</P>
<P>
   It also signals an important shift to a policy that Clinton's
own administration recently derided.
</P>
<P>
   But, it was good news to a former top official in the Iraqi
information ministry, who has gone from being Saddam Hussein's
mouthpiece to representing a group that aims to unseat his old
boss.
</P>
<P>
   In his sparsely-furnished home in exile in Jordan's capital,
Moath(CQ) Abdul Raheem said that, even though this crisis ended in
diplomacy, there will be others that could bring military strikes
against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not disappointed. If this opportunity was missed, there
will be lots of other opportunities,'' Raheem, spokesman for the
Iraqi National Accord opposition group, said.
</P>
<P>
   Raheem's group has received limited backing from the United
States for years. He said Clinton's pledge Sunday, ``moves us
faster toward a long term solution for the problem of the Iraqi
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But, even within the Clinton administration there has long been
doubt about whether Raheem's groups or others can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 31, Clinton reluctantly signed a Congressional plan
letting the administration give opposition groups access to $97
million in military training. The plan also includes $38 million to
start beaming Radio Free Iraq into Saddam's state.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before, the man who heads the military's central
command that oversees U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf
criticized the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this has been very well thought out,'' Gen.
Anthony Zinni said at the time. ``A Saddam in place and contained
is better than promoting something that causes Iraq to explode,
implode, fragment into pieces, cause turmoil in the region; which
could happen if he comes down in the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is divided into some 70 groups that are often
rivals. They include two Kurdish groups that have fiercely opposed
each other. Hussein opponents within the Shiite Muslim minority in
southern Iraq suffer severe repression. Then, there is Raheem's INA
and the most prominent group, the Iraqi National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Amatzia Baram, an Israeli specialist on Iraq, said the United
States would have to consolidate the 10 most prominent groups. That
will involve getting religious fundamentalists to cooperate with
secular groups, communists with elitists. He said the INA,
meanwhile, has a track record for being anti-American.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they would need a strategy and a place in Iraq to base the
movement. That may require protection from U.S. ground forces,
which could anger Arabs in the region and endanger troops. This
process could take five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the U.S. effort has been increasing already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year we have deepened our engagement with the
forces of change in Iraq, reconciling the two largest Kurdish
opposition groups, beginning broadcasts of a Radio Free Iraq
throughout the country,'' Clinton said. ``We will intensify that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, American policy has been scarcely better organized than the
opposition groups themselves. Former President George Bush
encouraged a rebellion shortly after the 1991 Gulf War. But, when
an uprising started, Saddam used helicopter gunships -- allowed to
fly by the American-brokered ceasfire -- to snuff out the
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other gory failures. The U.S. encouraged a
rebellion in 1995, then called it off. But, it was still attempted
and got crushed. In 1996, Saddam crushed the CIA-backed efforts of
the INA and INC when he executed about 100 people, reportedly army
officers, who he believed were planning a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress and the White House have fought about
whether the U.S. should back coups from within Saddam's government
or strengthen outside movements, whether the toppling of Saddam
would empower Iran next door, or whether the United States will
have to commit air power or ground forces to assist the opposition
-- who have no stronghold in Iraq from which to launch its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the 61-year-old Saddam Hussein has survived
several assassination attempts. Though his army has been weakened
by eight years of weapons inspections and sanctions, his security
apparatus is extensive and feared.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has held nearly absolute power in his country more than
20 years and used chemical weapons against the opposition.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Twice in nine months, President Clinton has ordered
a massive U.S. strike force to the brink of war against Iraq, only
to draw back in the face of last-minute concessions by Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   While he declared victory Sunday after the latest crisis eased,
Clinton also voiced frustration with an eight-year-old containment
policy and the costly and dangerous pattern of brinkmanship it has
engendered.
</P>
<P>
   While he vowed to continue that policy, Clinton stressed that it
was no substitute for a permanent solution to one of his greatest
foreign policy headaches. What's needed, he said, are stepped-up
U.S. efforts to help opposition groups that seek to oust Saddam and
replace his regime with a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saddam Hussein remains an impediment to the well-being of his
people and a threat to the peace of his region and the security of
the world,'' Clinton told reporters at a hastily-called White House
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to contain the threat he poses,'' Clinton
said. ''However, over the long term, the best way to address that
threat is through a government in Baghdad, a new government that is
committed to represent and respect its people, not repress them;
that is committed to peace in the region,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past year we have deepened our engagement with the
forces of change in Iraq,'' he said. ''We will intensify that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz criticized Clinton's vow that
the American government is committed to replacing Saddam's regime
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to condemn strongly the statement of Mr. Clinton, the
plans of his government to overthrow the government of Iraq,'''
Aziz said in an interview on CNN. ``This is a flagrant violation of
the Security Council resolutions as well as international law.''
</P>
<P>
   After ordering a massive attack of cruise missiles and smart
bombs against Iraq on Saturday, Clinton rescinded the command later
in the day to give his security team time to assess an 11th-hour
offer by Iraq to allow United Nations teams to inspect its alleged
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close Iraq came to being attacked on Saturday, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters ''very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, Clinton rejected Iraq's offer, claiming that it
was laden with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq denied the charge, but sent two letters to the United
Nations by early Sunday stating specifically that it intended to
permit the inspections, without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared victory for diplomacy backed by the threat of
force, just as he did last February when, after a massive military
build-up in the Persian Gulf, Saddam reversed an earlier decision
to end the U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our willingness to strike, together with the overwhelming
weight of world opinion, produced the outcome we preferred: Saddam
Hussein reversing course, letting the inspectors go back to work
without restrictions or conditions,'' said Clinton. ''They have
been, and they remain, the most effective tool to uncover, destroy
and prevent Iraq from rebuilding its weapons of mass destruction
and the missiles to deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, however, Iraq declared itself the victor in the
dispute, with Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan telling state-run
television that Iraq had been able ``to prove to the whole world
that our views are correct'' and that the Americans were misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the foundation and the basis of our victory,'' he
declared in the first official reaction to the weekend's tumultuous
events.
</P>
<P>
   And, as he did in February, Clinton said Saddam would be judged
by his actions, not his words, and that the United States would
remain vigilant and prepared to act should Iraq go back on its
word.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a question of faith, this is a question of
action,'' Clinton said, adding that ''Iraq must live up to its
obligations,'' by granting U.N. inspectors ''unfettered access to
inspect and to monitor all sites they choose with no restrictions
or qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear, however, that efforts to contain Iraq will
be unsatisfying, so long as Saddam remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of calling for Saddam's overthrow, and it
wasn't clear whether his comments reflected the start of an
aggressive campaign to unseat the Iraqi dictator, or merely a
calibrated increase in what have been acknowledged as anemic
efforts to date to counter Saddam's regime by backing his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that efforts to replace Saddam must be
part of an overall U.S. strategy and suggested that, otherwise,
Saddam would continue to menace his oil-rich Persian Gulf neighbors
and harry the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not calling for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein,''
Cohen said. ''What he was saying is that we are prepared, and we
will work with opposition forces or groups to try to bring about in
some future time a more democratic type of regime that is more
responsive to its people, and not to engage in the harsh and brutal
repression of them.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Without endorsing any specific initiative, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., agreed with Clinton that Saddam is the problem, and air
strikes, much less the threat of them, won't resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Again, we have allowed Saddam Hussein to set the agenda and
put us on this roller coaster, which doesn't seem to end,'' McCain
told the ABC television network. ''We have to change this
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of trying to oust Saddam, 61, raises chilling memories of
the weeks following the end of the Gulf War, when, after President
Bush suggested that Iraqis might overthrow Saddam, he launched a
ruthless crackdown on his Kurdish opponents in northern Iraq and
other opposition groups in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Saddam routed Kurdish opposition groups that had
been backed by the United States, killing hundreds and backing
others into remote mountains before a core of some 2,000 could be
evacuated by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States operates Radio Free Iraq, an Arabic-language
radio broadcast beamed across most of the country, and has worked
on a modest level with expatriate Iraqis opposed to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   After roughly two decades in office, though, Saddam has built a
potent security apparatus that has either murdered, imprisoned, run
out of the country or otherwise stifled any meaningful, open
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped Saddam retain his grip on power in a country
that has been ravaged by his rule.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the time had come for more aggressive U.S. support
for building opposition groups within Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a growing consensus, not only in the United States,
but around the world, that Saddam Hussein poses an unacceptable
threat and he should be removed,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very difficult operation. It's fraught with difficulty.
But we have to set up a resistance organization within Iraq.''

JONES' LESSON MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON A TEACHER 
DELAY FOR TYSON
</HEADLINE>

   JONES' LESSON MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON A TEACHER
</P>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ Everyone thought Roy Jones Jr. was the
superior fighter when his light-heavyweight title bout against Otis
Grant, a middleweight moving up in weight, was announced.
</P>
<P>
   That fact became evident Saturday night in the bout's sixth
round when Jones landed a right uppercut that sent Grant crashing
to the canvas, flat on his back with his heels going over his head.
After that, Jones, clearly aware of his vast superiority and not
wishing to punish Grant further, pulled back. His inactivity in the
seventh round was so great that Referee Arthur Mercante Jr. had to
admonish him to fight.
</P>
<P>
   That he did. A straight right that landed flush on Grant's face
in the 10th round sat him on the seat of his pants. That prompted
Grant's manager, Russ Anber, to throw in the towel and follow it
into the ring to save his battered fighter. Jones (38-1) won on a
knockout when Mercante agreed to stop the fight at 1 minute 18
seconds of the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to punish a guy if I don't have to,'' Jones
said. ``I'll try to hit him every now and then to knock him out.
But to go out and brutalize a guy, why do it?''
</P>
<P>
   So, Jones sought to land a knockout punch, but could not. So,
instead, the courageous Grant took a battering.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has created his boxing conundrum. He only selects
opponents whom he likes and respects. He respects them because they
have heart and courage and they are good boxers. Once he gets them
into the ring, he finds it difficult to administer the types of
beatings required to take out a highly trained boxer with heart and
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Grant (31-2-1), whose corner had warned
him after the first knockdown that if he took another shot like
that they would stop the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he needed to put on a Rocky Balboa showing to
show how great and tough he is and go out of the ring with his face
all mangled,'' Anber said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a special-education teacher in Montreal, said he had
nothing to be embarrassed about. ``I gave it my best shot,'' said
Grant, who earned $450,000 and will return to his teaching job on
Monday morning. ``I came up short. Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones, who knows? He selects his own opponents. He has
some mandatory bouts to defend the World Boxing Association and
World Boxing Council light-heavyweight titles, but no one is
holding his breath waiting for him to fight any of them. Jones said
he had no interest in going to Germany to defend against Graciano
Rocchigiani.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-feature Saturday night, Sugar Shane Mosley also
benefited from a compassionate corner. Mosley scored a knockout
against Jesse James Leija when Referee Eddie Cotton stopped the
fight at the end of the ninth round. As in Grant's case, Leija's
corner did not want him to continue to take a beating from the
speedy Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley (30-0) kept his International Boxing Federation
lightweight title and walked away with sore hands. It was a product
of bouncing his fists off the top of Leija's hard head. Mosley said
Leija would come in with his head lowered, and it provided Mosley
with an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fifth round I noticed that my left hand was hurting, so
I quit throwing the jab so much and started working the body,''
Mosley said. ``In the sixth round my right hand started to hurt.
But I kept working the body. I think that's what did it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leija (37-4-2) is a tough former two-time world champion who
previously had only been stopped by Oscar De La Hoya and Azumah
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fought on HBO three times, and I've lost three times,
because every time they put me in with someone like Godzilla,''
Leija said.
</P>
<P>
   HBO announced it had signed Mosley to a long-term contract that
would allow him to eventually move up to the 140-pound class, where
there are some intriguing matchups for a boxer who is beginning to
display matchless skills. Mosley's next fight will be in February
or March and there are many good opponents. Among those in the
lightweight division are Cesar Bazan and Ivan Robinson. When Mosley
moves up to the 140-pound division, he could face Miguel Angel
Gonzalez, Kostya Tszyu and Vince Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   DELAY FOR TYSON
</P>
<P>
   A news conference scheduled for Tuesday in New York City to
announce Mike Tyson's return to boxing has been postponed by
Showtime, which will broadcast the bout, because contracts with
Francois Botha, Tyson's opponent, and with the MGM Grand hotel in
Las Vegas, Nev., the site of the Jan. 16 fight, have not been
signed. No new date for the news conference has been set, but the
fight itself is not in jeopardy.

DUNN'S FUND-RAISING COULD PRODUCE VOTES IN LEADERSHIP CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late last summer, Rep. Jennifer Dunn took a quick
trip to Southern California to help out one of her most endangered
colleagues, Rep. Brian Bilbray, a Republican from La Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Dunn, R-Wash., wages an uphill campaign to become House
majority leader, Bilbray is returning the favor, supporting Dunn as
she takes on the incumbent, Dick Armey of Texas, and the insurgent,
former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's labors on behalf of her fellow Republicans, which began
more than two decades ago when Dunn was a foot soldier in the 1976
Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, are a major selling point as
she campaigns to become the first woman to hold a top job in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Dunn's party-building work, combined
with her gender and her communications skills, will be enough to
overcome GOP reservations about her support for abortion rights and
a voting record that is a hair less conservative than that of her
two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But if she does eke out a surprise victory, the sometime
gardener will owe her victory in no small part to her
oft-demonstrated willingness to do the spade work of politics:
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch opponent of campaign finance reform, Dunn raised money
at a furious pace over the past two years. According to the most
recent documents on file with the Federal Election Commission, Dunn
raised $1.3 million for her personal campaign treasury, and another
$100,000 for a so-called ``leadership'' political action committee
used as a legal means of circumventing campaign finance limits. She
also raised $54,000 for a second leadership PAC she uses to help
GOP candidates for the Washington state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, whose congressional district is considered safely
Republican and who faced an articulate but underfunded challenger
this year, gave generously to other Republican candidates. From her
personal campaign treasury she doled out $57,500 to the National
Republican Congressional Committee, the main campaign arm of House
Republicans, and $31,000 directly to the campaigns of 28 Republican
House candidates. And from her leadership PAC she gave $67,500 to
35 Republican candidates for the House.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's efforts this year cap a long career of activity on behalf
of other Republicans. She claims to have raised $13 million while
chairwoman of the state Republican Party. As a freshman in
Congress, she was one of the top four fund-raisers for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, bringing in $270,000. In
Washington state, she used her own mailing list to raise money for
other Republican candidates for Congress, and she hosted a
reception at the state GOP convention at which the price of
admission was a donation to any Republican running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   She often walks the half block from her office to the National
Republican Congressional Committee, where she can use special
telephones to make fund-raising calls. In 1996, she was the
co-chairwoman of the House-Senate Republican dinner, an annual
fund-raiser to which she sold tickets worth $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1996, she gave $75,000 from her own campaign treasury to
82 Republicans and $47,000 from her Washington Fund to 28
Republican candidates, and in 1997 she was elected vice-chairwoman
of the House Republican Conference, the highest post ever held by a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's efforts pale in comparison to those of the established
top party leadership _ outgoing House Speaker Newt Gingrich raised
$7.5 million through his personal campaign and his leadership PAC,
while Armey raised $2.9 million. But Dunn's efforts were impressive
for a junior member of leadership. She was just behind Majority
Whip Tom Delay's $1.6 million effort, and slightly ahead of House
Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner's $1.2 million pace.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts this year to help Republicans around the country may
be partly to blame for a price paid back home. Voters in Dunn's
district re-elected her with 59 percent of the vote. That's a
result that would be enviable in many districts around the country,
but one that raised eyebrows in Washington state, even among Dunn
partisans, because it was the congresswoman's worst performance
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will never have an easy ride again if I have anything to
say about it,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman Paul Berendt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party also suffered some of its worst losses this
year in Dunn's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state the Republicans lost two of the six
congressional seats they had held, lost control of the state
Senate, and, depending on the final count of absentee ballots, will
likely be forced to share control of a state House evenly divided
between Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Among the GOP's likely
losses were three state House seats located in Dunn's congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent all this time running around the country,
campaigning for these Republicans, gathering chits for this
leadership battle, and what happens but we're the only state in the
Union that had more than one seat (in Congress) turn over,''
Berendt said. ``If she had wanted to make a contribution to her
caucus, she probably should have just stayed home and helped
Republicans here, instead of gallivanting around the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and her loyalists reject that assertion, blaming this
year's loss on a national tide, on a weak Republican candidate atop
the state ballot, and on an unusually artful get-out-the-vote and
absentee voter program by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer has done more for Republican candidates in Washington
state than nearly any other officeholder, has consistently aided
state, federal and local Republicans, and will continue to do so,''
said Rob Nichols, a former Dunn spokesman who has returned to help
with her majority leader campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her travels, which brought her to 30 congressional districts
around the country this year, are clearly a boon to her current
campaign. She claims the support of more than half of the 17 new
Republicans elected to the House, and many of the people she has
helped are backing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, who can really grow our base and grow our
majority,'' said Bilbray, who was narrowly re-elected earlier this
month. ``Jennifer comes with a lot of experience leading the party
in her state. And frankly, I think the Democrats would hate to see
her elected, because it would destroy the big lie that Democrats
tell about Republicans.''

A HAM LOAF FOR ALL SEASONS AND HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not suggesting that Santa Claus is a witch, a goblin or Newt
Gingrich in disguise. All I know is that the Jolly Old Elf was
campaigning in our neighborhood at least two weeks before Halloween
and Election Day. His premature appearance in store windows
suggests that by Dec. 26 he will have worn out his welcome and
probably couldn't get elected chief sweeper in a reindeer corral.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Gnome from Nome generates a lot of retail sales.
But the Christmas celebration is already running longer than the
baseball season and St. Nick has almost as many commercials as
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   If our national holidays are essential in keeping our economy
boiling, then admit it. But we shouldn't dump the entire
responsibility on the back of S. Claus, Esq.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need a three-month Christmas season. What we need are
more holidays, promoting unbridled feasting and lavish giving of
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we honor our late presidents but so far have done
nothing for CEOs. How about celebrating Bill Gates' birthday, for
starters?
</P>
<P>
   We've got an unofficial holiday on May 1, but it doesn't work.
How much revenue are we going to generate from May baskets? We need
a Soviet-style May Day parade, which means the military gets to buy
a whole lot more new tanks. We can always use them to keep out the
Canadians. The U.S. Customs agents at Blaine are doing a pretty
good job, but every once in a while a grandmother from Moose Jaw
slips through the dragnet with a six-pack of Molson.
</P>
<P>
   Use your imagination! We have Mother's Day, Father's Day,
Secretary's Day and Valentine's Day. How about recognizing the most
important members of our households with holidays honoring dogs,
cats, goldfish and pet whales?
</P>
<P>
   We could celebrate Mark McGwire's birthday and add on
celebrations honoring Sammy Sosa, Roger Maris and Babe Ruth. What
gifts would be appropriate on the days devoted to baseball's
greatest stars? Obviously, Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   I just happen to have a ham loaf recipe appropriate for all
holidays. It could easily be baked in the shape of a heart
(Valentine's Day), a tank (May Day) or a Mariner Moose (Ken Griffey
Day.)
</P>
<P>
   I bake it in an oblong shape to annually commemorate Jerome
Kern's birthday. With cherries and pineapple on top, the ham loaf
looks sort of like a showboat.
</P>
<P>
   Showboat Loaf
</P>
<P>
   1 pound ground ham
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-quarter pounds ground turkey
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cracker crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 slices pineapple
</P>
<P>
   7 maraschino cherries
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup vinegar
</P>
<P>
   It's best to buy lean ham and put it through a grinder or food
processor. Use a lean grind of turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl moosh together the ham, turkey, eggs, cracker
crumbs, milk, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl combine the brown sugar, mustard and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Grease well the bottom and sides of a loaf pan. Lay three slices
of pineapple on the bottom of the pan. Cut the fourth slice in half
and arrange halves between the whole slices. Fill in the gaps with
the cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon half the brown sugar mixture over the fruit, then pack in
the meat. Smooth out the top, then cover with the remainder of the
sugar mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 400 degrees for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with this side dish commemorating the anniversary of
Idaho's admission to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Famous Potatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half (or low-fat evaporated milk)
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup freshly grated Parmesan, divided
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup grated Swiss cheese, divided
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-one-half pounds baking potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan combine the half-and-half with the garlic,
one-half cup of Parmesan and one-quarter cup of Swiss cheese and
stir-cook until the cheese begins to melt. Do not boil.
</P>
<P>
   Peel the potatoes and thinly slice. Toss the spud slices with
nutmeg, plus salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the potato slices in an oven-proof dish. Slop the milk
mixture over the top and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. Bake
in a 400-degree oven until tender and brown on top, probably one
hour.
</P>
<P>
   This serves four but if you have leftover ham and potatoes, lay
them out in an oven-proof skillet for breakfast and top with beaten
and seasoned eggs (or egg substitute.)
</P>
<P>
   Cook this omelet on top of the stove for 3 minutes, then shove
under an oven broiler, a couple of inches from the heat, until the
top is set. Serve for breakfast in wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, why doesn't Congress establish a national
Leftover Day in the United States? It may conflict with Dog Day,
but politicians are paid to make these hard choices.
</P>

ADVERTISING: THE HEADY WORLD OF AUTO CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big news is being made with big changes involving three big
automakers: Nissan Motor Corp. USA, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of
America and DaimlerChrysler AG, the behemoth formed by the merger
of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are indicative of the continual shifts that make
automotive advertising one of the most fascinating, closely
followed categories in consumer marketing. They include an agency
spinoff, an account consolidation and a multinational,
multimillion-dollar ad blitz that was the result of an unusual
collaboration among several shops.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff affects Nissan, which has been struggling to reverse
a serious sales slump. Nissan and its longtime agency,
TBWA/Chiat/Day, are discussing a spinoff of the retail dealer
advertising portion of the Nissan American account to form a
stand-alone shop that would be named Blacktop Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Blacktop would handle duties that compose about half of the
estimated $400 million Nissan American account at TBWA/Chiat/Day,
part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. The spinoff is
being considered five months after TBWA/Chiat/Day shook up
management of the Nissan worldwide account.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Miller, a spokesman for TBWA/Chiat/Day in Venice, Calif.,
declined to comment on Friday and referred questions to Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Sanchez Fair, a spokeswoman for Nissan in Carson, Calif.,
said, ``We're always looking for ways to maximize our advertising
communications.'' She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have complained that recent Nissan campaigns from
TBWA/Chiat/Day emphasized entertainment at the expense of
hard-selling product pitches. The grumbling grew louder with ads
carrying the theme ``Life is a journey. Enjoy the ride,'' that
featured an avuncular character, Mr. K, and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mr. K and the pooch have disappeared, replaced by more
traditional ads meant to stimulate showroom traffic. But for the
first 10 months of 1998, Nissan's American vehicle sales fell 16.9
percent from the corresponding period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Blacktop would join a lengthy list of free-standing shops that
handle automotive assignments. Others include Team One Advertising
in El Segundo, Calif., a unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC that works
for the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Sales USA, and Pentacom,
part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, which handles media
services for DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, spinoffs can spin out of control. In May,
Grey Advertising closed G2, a stand-alone shop in Huntington Beach,
Calif., that had handled national brand advertising for Mitsubishi
after G2 lost assignments to Deutsch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Mitsubishi, the company consolidated its national
advertising at the Marina del Rey, Calif., and New York offices of
Deutsch, which in May was named agency of record for the 41
Mitsubishi regional dealer advertising associations and was awarded
the task of introducing the 1999 Galant sedan. Those assignments
had billings estimated at $115 million to $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation, which increases Deutsch's total Mitsubishi
billings to an estimated $250 million, includes national consumer
brand advertising, interactive campaigns, direct marketing and ads
in Spanish. Those tasks had been handled by agencies including the
CKS Partners unit of CKS Group in Cupertino, Calif., and Direct
Partners in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that in Deutsch we've found a strong marketing
communications partner,'' said Peg Dilworth-Hunt, marketing
director at Mitsubishi in Cypress, Calif. She praised Deutsch's
campaign for the Galant, which introduced the theme ``Wake up and
drive'' for Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Galant sales in October rose 62 percent from October 1997, Ms.
Dilworth-Hunt said, and the share of car shoppers considering the
Mitsubishi brand increased 29 percent. An 11.9 percent sales gain
last month from October 1997 enabled Mitsubishi sales for the year
to date to pass sales for the first 10 months of last year, by
four-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   As for DaimlerChrysler, the multinational ad blitz will herald
the formation of the company, ranked fifth in sales volume among
vehicle makers worldwide. The elaborate campaign, carrying the
theme ``Expect the extraordinary,'' is scheduled to begin appearing
on Wednesday, the day after what DaimlerChrysler executives are
declaring ``Day One,'' when DaimlerChrysler stock will begin
trading. (The merger actually became official on Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build on the strengths that the two companies
bring to this merger,'' said A.C. ``Bud'' Liebler, vice president
for marketing in Auburn Hills, Mich. ``Our thought was `Let's do
something, let's do it big and let's do it as soon as we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were concerns about promising ``extraordinary''
results from a merger that is rife with uncertainties about meshing
two distinctly disparate operations, Liebler replied: ``Is it easy
to live up to? No. But nothing worthwhile ever is.''
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative process by which the ads were created may be
seen as a trial run for what will be required from executives of
Chrysler, Daimler and their agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our charges from the Chrysler and Daimler marketing
clients was, `Hey, guys, you've got to work together,''' said Scott
Thornton, managing partner on the Chrysler corporate account at
Bozell Worldwide in Southfield, Mich., a unit of True North
Communications. ``And we embraced that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the creative front, Bozell collaborated with Springer &AMP;
Jacoby in Hamburg, Germany, the Daimler corporate agency, and
another Chrysler agency, Ross Roy Communications in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., a unit of Omnicom. The media planning and buying for
the three-week campaign, which is to appear in more than 100
countries, is being jointly handled by Bozell, Springer &AMP; Jacoby,
Pentacom and a Daimler European agency, GFMO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Whenever someone asks you to work with another agency, it's
strange,'' said Bela Ziemann, account director on the Daimler
corporate account at Springer &AMP; Jacoby, which also creates
campaigns for Mercedes-Benz in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we put away the strangeness,'' he added. ``It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign includes two-page newspaper ads, a 12-page magazine
ad insert and 130,000 brochures to be sent to so-called opinion
leaders like investment bankers, union leaders, suppliers and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The ads and brochures feature striking black-and-white
portraits, shot by the photographer Richard Avedon; each pairs a
Chrysler employee with a Daimler employee.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an ad in English, with the headline ``Vision meets
vision,'' shows Juergen Schrempp, Daimler's chairman, with Robert
Eaton, Chrysler's chairman. An ad in German, with the headline
``Neugier begegnet neugier'' (``Curiosity meets curiosity'' in the
English version), matches Irina Motzek, a consultant with the Debis
Automotive Lease Finance subsidiary of Daimler, with Ralph Gilles,
a senior designer with Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   There is even an ad teaming up two crash-test mannequins,
``Mercedes-Benz Dummy Series No. 433'' and ``Dodge Dummy Series No.
516,'' which embrace under the headline ``Passion meets passion.''
The captions describe 433 as a dummy that ``loves to feel the wind
in his, umm, hair,'' and his counterpart as a dummy that ``requests
country music on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks as if DaimlerChrysler may favor its American side, at
least in terms of sense of humor.

 (ATTN: Va.)   (See related: CRUISE-SHIP-CRIME)  
(lb) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few dream cruises have turned into the nightmare experienced by
Iva and Ron Bradley of Richmond, Va., on a cruise last March
through the southern Caribbean with their son, Brad, and daughter,
Amy. Midway through the cruise, 23-year-old Amy, a recent college
graduate about to start her first full-time job, disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   While what happened to Amy is not known, her case illustrates
the difficulties that can arise when a possible crime occurs
outside the immediate reach of law-enforcement authorities, and how
cruise lines struggle to balance investigations with protection of
their reputations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradleys were on Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas, a
year-old luxury ship. In the early hours of March 24, the parents
retired to the family's suite, leaving Brad and Amy dancing in a
disco.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's computerized door-lock system recorded Brad's return
to the suite at 3:35 a.m. and Amy's arrival five minutes later.
Brad said he and his sister sat on the suite's balcony and chatted.
He then went to sleep inside while Amy stretched out on a lounge
chair on the balcony because she felt slightly seasick. Her parents
said her cigarettes and lighter were gone from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bradley said he awoke about 6 a.m. and saw that Amy was not
in the room or on the balcony. He went to search for her, and at
about 7 a.m., he said, he ran into the ship's security chief, Lou
Costello, and alerted him. He then returned to the cabin and woke
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the ship was docking in Curacao. The Bradleys said
they pleaded with ship's officers not to lower the gangway for
disembarkation until their daughter was found, but the gangway was
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   At about lunchtime, Mrs. Bradley said, she asked the ship's
captain, Kjetil Gjerstad, to distribute a picture of Amy to all
passengers. ``I cannot do that,'' she said he replied. ``I will not
alarm the passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's spokeswoman, Lynn Martenstein, would say only
that the company had cooperated with investigators and did not
believe foul play was involved. But an internal Royal Caribbean
report provided to The New York Times by the Bradleys said that
Bradley did not notify Costello of the disappearance until 7:35
a.m., by which time the ship had docked and passengers were going
off for a day of shore excursions. It also said a cabin-by-cabin
search was conducted almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Rhapsody departed that evening, the Bradleys
left the ship in hopes of finding Amy in Curacao. They said they
had also grown frustrated and angry dealing with the ship's
officers and with a company lawyer flown in that afternoon from
Miami. It took two days before FBI agents boarded the ship to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the harbor at Curacao and the surrounding water that
first day and the next did not turn up a body, leaving the Bradleys
convinced that Amy had been abducted by a crew member and was
either held aboard the ship or had been smuggled off in Curacao.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, the Bradleys hired private detectives to board the
ship undercover to search for evidence of their daughter. None was
found. They also consulted psychics, posted a $260,000 reward and
created a World Wide Web site (www.tggweb.com/amybradley/), all to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has not had any success, either. ``We've pursued every
angle, from whether there was foul play, a suicide or an accident,
and we have basically not gotten anywhere,'' said James Weber,
special agent in charge of the FBI office in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

 &HT;    SOUTH FACES JOB CHALLENGE WITH INFLUX OF HISPANIC, ASIAN GROUPS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Southerners meeting here to explore ways to
improve race relations in the South expressed concern Sunday that
the exploding Hispanic and Asian immigration to the region could
lead to ethnically-charged competition for unskilled jobs in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Although the once impoverished and racially segregated South has
been transformed economically and politically over the past
half-century, ``We haven't seen the worse,'' utility company
executive Chris Womack told delegates to the ``Unfinished
Business'' conference on Southern race relations being held here.
</P>
<P>
   Womack, vice president of human resources for the Southern Co.,
an Atlanta-based utility holding company, said the region's future
is ``a tremendous cause of concern'' because of various ethnic
groups ``struggling for that scarce pot of jobs'' for unskilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The South currently enjoys unprecedented prosperity. ``This is
our golden age in the South,'' said George Autry, president of MDC,
Inc., a North Carolina-based research group. ``By every economic
measure, we're better off than we've ever been in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   But since its job growth offers work at both the high end and
low end of the wage scale, the region now attracts more
under-educated as well as more well-educated workers. And most of
the new unskilled labor is Hispanic and Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historically black and white, mostly Protestant, and
native-born South is really technicolor today,'' added Autry.
``Demographically, we've been all shook up, in Elvis's words.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the presence of Hispanics had been a temporary
phenomenon: Spanish-speaking migrant workers following the calendar
of harvests. The one major exception was Florida, home to Cubans
who fled Fidel Castro's regime.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Hispanics are a permanent part of the South, and not
just in Texas, which has long been culturally linked to Mexico.
Between 1990 and 1996, the top six counties with the fastest
growing Hispanic populations have been in the South: two in
Georgia, two in North Carolina, one in Virginia and one in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 21 of the top 30 counties with the fastest growing
Asian populations have been in the South: 10 in Florida, four in
Texas, three in Georgia, three in North Carolina and one in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, the population mix of the South has
changed dramatically. Whites have declined from 76 percent to 68
percent. African Americans have increased from 18 percent to 19
percent. And Hispanics have jumped from 5 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the centuries-old racial conflict in the South
remains largely between whites and blacks. And the influx of
Hispanic and Asian immigrants to the region has triggered some
rethinking about the future of race relations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Among African Americans, there is ``a growing sense of threat''
from immigrants, that Hispanics and Asian Americans will lay claim
to affirmative action and other legal means originally designed as
redresses for the segregation of blacks, said Wendy Johnson,
executive director of the Southern Regional Council, the South's
oldest inter-racial organization.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the future of race relations in the South will
depend on whether such anti-bias programs as affirmative action can
include Hispanics and Asians ``without shifting attention away from
the age-old conflict'' of blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Unfinished Business'' conference, which has attracted
hundreds of white and black Southerners from across the region,
concludes Monday with an address by Bill Lann Lee, the first Asian
American to head the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department
of Justice.

 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of debate, hundreds of studies,
thousands of pages of blueprints and billions of dollars, the
United States and 15 other nations are ready to start building the
largest, most complex structure ever assembled in space, the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 15 years after the United States first made a commitment
to building a space station _ a period marked by shifting goals,
numerous revisions and false starts, and, most recently, serious
concerns about Russia's involvement _ the United States and its
partners are embarking on an ambitious five-year construction
project 220 miles above Earth. Planners say it will culminate in a
sprawling research complex that answers major questions about the
future of humans in space, while producing data and products with
more immediate applications down on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite severe money problems at its space agency, Russia is to
place the first piece of a giant puzzle on the board this week by
launching a 20-ton pressurized module that will serve as the core
of the orbital outpost by providing initial propulsion and power.
This unit, named Zarya after the Russian word for sunrise, is to
lift off Friday atop a Proton rocket launched from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is to follow on Dec. 3 when the space shuttle
Endeavour takes off with a large hub unit, named Unity. This node
attaches to the Russian part and serves as a main connector for
future pieces of the station, designed to eventually house up to
seven astronauts at a time from countries around the world. Three
astronauts are expected to occupy the station beginning early in
2000, well before it is fully completed.
</P>
<P>
   The space station is one of the largest peacetime international
engineering projects in history, and one of the costliest too, with
a construction price of at least $40 billion, more than half of
which will be paid by the United States. Various estimates suggest
that participating nations together will spend a similar amount to
operate it during its lifetime, a minimum of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a risky and difficult project as well, experts said,
noting that the odds of a major accident during the station's
construction or operation are high.
</P>
<P>
   Construction will require at least 43 space flights, including
34 by space shuttles and the rest by Russian rockets, to haul
almost 900,000 pounds of building materials and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   These materials, including pressurized modules, connecting
nodes, expandable metal trusses for holding solar panels and heat
radiators, and miles of electrical cables, are to be assembled by
American and Russian astronauts making 144 spacewalks. The
spacewalks, in which two-man teams will have to connect hundreds of
station components and cables, are expected to total at least 1,800
hours, double the time that American astronauts have spent outside
their ships since the beginning of piloted space flight almost four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   When all of the pieces finally come together in 2004, as
scheduled, they are to form a complex that covers an area equal to
two football fields when the massive solar power arrays are
unfurled. Almost a dozen interlocking modules, housing research
laboratories, living quarters and support equipment, are planned to
provide 46,000 cubic feet of pressurized space, equal to the
interior volume of two 747 jet planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space station is being built to see how people can live
and work safely and productively in space for long periods,'' said
Daniel Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. ``It will be a world-class laboratory for science
that could lead to discoveries and technical advances that affect
all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction is to begin, however, while several uncertainties
remain about costs and schedules. Assembly already has been delayed
more than a year because the third major component, a Russian-built
unit called the service module, has not been completed because the
Russian Space Agency is out of money. This critical unit is to
provide living quarters and laboratory space in the early stages of
station construction.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the collapse of the Russian economy is a threat to
the space station, NASA last month announced a bailout plan to
funnel money to the Russians to complete the service module and
have it ready for launching in July 1999. The American agency said
it would initially pay Russia $60 million for equipment and
services related to the station project. And NASA told Congress
that the United States would have to channel $600 million more to
Russia over the next four years to help that nation meet its space
station obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this aid, questions remain whether Russia will
eventually find the money to complete what it has promised for the
station, including two science laboratories, a power station and
cargo spacecraft to take up supplies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, at the Kennedy Space Center on Oct. 29 for
the space shuttle flight of Sen. John Glenn, said he favored
covering Russia's financial shortfalls for the station because of
the importance of the international project. ``I think we're doing
the right thing with this space station, and we need to stay with
it,'' Clinton said during a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has had a vested interest in the
space station since 1993, when it restructured the program, on the
verge of cancellation by Congress, and brought in the Russians as
full partners in a foreign policy initiative after the breakup of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   John Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space
Policy Institute, said including Russia in the program saved the
space station, both by giving the project an added political
purpose and by offering the hope that Russian participation would
move the program along.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a dramatic shift in the debate when Russia was
brought in,'' Logsdon said. ``Political support for a space station
is now very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the flight hardware for the station has either been
built or is nearing completion since the new start five years ago,
he said, and the project has a good chance of being completed once
construction in space begins, even if Russia ends up with a lesser
role. ``I don't think there is much of a possibility of canceling
the program now,'' Logsdon said.
</P>
<P>
   The new outpost will not be the first space station in history,
but it will be the biggest and most versatile and well-equipped. In
the early days of the space race, President Kennedy considered
having the United States try to build the first space station to
assert American dominance. But when advised that the Soviets' more
powerful rockets would allow them to win that race, Kennedy set the
more difficult goal of landing men on the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   After the Moon landings, NASA officials believed that the next
step should include a large space station supplied by a reusable
shuttle. Public support for the space program declined markedly
after the Moon landing, however, and the Nixon administration cut
the agency's budget, making it clear it would not support two major
new programs.
</P>
<P>
   NASA chose to pursue the space shuttle. Only after the shuttle
began flying successfully did NASA resurrect the idea of a space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets launched the first space station, Salyut 1, in 1971.
They followed it with a series of larger and more sophisticated
Salyuts, culminating in the launching of Mir in 1986. Mir, the
first permanent station, grew to a complex of seven modules
weighing more than 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. space station was Skylab, made from the third
stage of a Saturn rocket and flown into orbit in 1973. The 84-ton
station was in use for only nine months, during which crews visited
for 28, 56 and 84 days.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan first proposed building an international
station, led by the United States, in 1984 and within two years got
the European Space Agency and other partners to agree to contribute
hardware to the project. NASA first estimated that the United
States could build its part of the station for $8.5 billion, but
the project almost immediately bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one agreed on what kind of a space station to build, and it
was constantly being redesigned,'' said Howard McCurdy, a professor
of public affairs at American University who studied the program.
``All we could agree on was that we wanted one.''
</P>
<P>
   As work on the station dragged on, with several NASA centers
proposing different designs, estimated costs rose, prompting
Congress to get involved in managing the program to hold down
expenses, McCurdy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1993, we had spent $11 billion on the space station and all
we had to show for it was piles of blueprints and no major flight
hardware,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration then asked NASA to redesign and
streamline the station again, this time including Russian
components, and capped U.S. spending at $17.4 billion through
assembly. Goldin, the NASA chief, said early this year. however,
that American costs would likely be about $21.3 billion, requiring
additional funding. And an independent study commissioned by the
agency suggested in April that U.S. costs could climb as high as
$24.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the United States in the project are Russia, Japan,
Canada, Brazil and 11 nations of the European Space Agency: Italy,
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The original Russian contribution to the program was expected to
be worth $8 billion to $10 billion before the current economic
crisis. The other partners' shares amount to about $3.1 billion
from Japan, $850 million from Canada, and $3.8 billion from the
European group, with a separate $550 million from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that the cost of the space station is likely to be
borne in more than mere dollars. ``Like any construction project,
this is going to be risky business,'' said John Pike, director of
space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that you are going to lose at least one
major component of the station, either because of a rocket blowing
up or an accident in orbit,'' Pike said. ``And it is likely that
someone will be killed, which is not uncommon on construction sites
even when they are not doing spacewalks, which are dangerous all by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many rocket launches required for the station, the odds
of a major accident involving a shuttle or Russian rocket are high,
according to Pike and others. A statistical analysis done last year
by the British journal New Scientist concluded that there was a
73.6 percent chance of at least one major failure during the
assembly sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a miracle if there wasn't a major failure,'' Pike
said. ``And depending on any loss of life, or what part of the
station is lost during an accident, it could severely cripple the
project or cause major construction delays.''
</P>
<P>
   The new space station, which will be five times larger than Mir
if completed as planned, is to be occupied and producing research
data long before its scheduled completion date. Plans call for
Russia to launch a Soyuz spacecraft in January 2000, carrying Capt.
Bill Shephard of the U.S. Navy, the station's first commander, and
Russian astronauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev. Their arrival
will mark the beginning of research and a permanent human presence
on the space station.

 AILING KING OF JORDAN GIVEN PARTY IN ABSENTIA  (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Jordan threw a 63rd birthday party during the
weekend for King Hussein, who could not attend but said that he is
completely cured of the cancer he has been battling for the last
four months at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the king, made in a television interview on
Friday night, was greeted with joy at celebrations around Jordan,
where the king's birthday is a two-day national holiday.
Information Minister Nasser Joudeh said that Hussein was likely to
return to Jordan at the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   A separate statement by the king's physicians, published in the
Jordan Times on Saturday, described the king as being ``in complete
remission from lymphoma,'' which was diagnosed in July.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctors said that as ``standard procedure'' they still
intended to carry out a marrow transplant later this month to
ensure that no traces of the cancer returned.
</P>
<P>
   Since he began his treatment, the king has undergone five
separate rounds of chemotherapy, which have caused him to lose
weight and most of his hair. When he appeared in public late last
month at a White House signing ceremony for the Wye peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians, his gaunt appearance shocked
people accustomed to a far more vital figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the king's absence, his younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan,
has acted as the country's leader, in what by most accounts has
been a reassuring preview of how the country might be governed if
the king's 45-year-reign comes to an end. Still, both the signs of
Hussein's ill health and his long absence have unnerved many
Jordanians, the majority of whom have never known any other king.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they adorned the capital, Amman, this week with flags
and banners expressing birthday wishes and hopes for the king's
safe return, some Jordanians said they feared that he might never
come back. For that reason, the king's announcement Friday night
that he expected to be ``amongst you in the near future'' was
greeted here Sunday with almost audible relief.

 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep.-elect Tom Tancredo flashed a good, long smile
for posterity on the steps of the Capitol as he huddled with his
freshmen cohorts, but the usual exhilaration was not altogether
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the dog who caught the car,'' joked Tancredo, a
Republican state legislator from Colorado, about his election to a
House of Representatives that is engulfed in all sorts of intrigue
and chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the past two weeks have brought changes that few
of the incoming 40 House freshmen, especially the 17 Republicans,
expected when they decided to make a run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of the House, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., is out, the
victim of Republican discontent. A politician they know next to
nothing about, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., is taking his place.
Meanwhile, the Republican caucus is warring over who will lead it
into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And, to top it all off, impeachment, a word most of them liken
to a guillotine, is still dangling over their heads in search of a
few unsuspecting victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see that dealt with swiftly,'' said Ken Lucas,
a Kentucky Democrat who represents a district where being a
Democrat is not necessarily an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Biggert, a moderate Chicago-area Republican, nodded her
head in agreement. ``I certainly would like it to be over,'' she
said, with mock exasperation, ``because of what we heard from the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   And because of something else, too. Long, long ago, before
Monica Lewinsky became a household word, Ms. Biggert made the error
of expressing interest in a seat on the House Judiciary Committee,
a panel that members appear to be shunning in droves since the
impeachment inquiry landed on its lap. Nobody, it seems, has
forgotten her words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let you have it,'' said Ms. Biggert, a state legislator,
relaying the chorus of ribbing her freshmen colleagues have been
giving her all day. ``I figured this was a great committee. I don't
know now.''
</P>
<P>
   Little, so far, has played out as she had pictured, Ms. Biggert
said, starting with the post-election rest and relaxation she
envisioned once the Champagne ran dry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she has been bombarded with telephone calls from House
members who are running in this week's leadership race, and their
allies. ``I got at least one call from each,'' Ms. Biggert said,
``and voice mails that went on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the revolutionary freshman class of 1994, with its
outside-the-Beltway novices and conservative bravado. In fact, the
voters have produced a crop of seasoned legislators, 23 Democrats
and 17 Republicans, in all. Fifteen of them come directly from
state legislatures, 27 have held elected office at some time and
three are former Capitol Hill aides.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions. One new member is a doctor; another
is a clinical psychologist. And Rush Holt, the Democrat who
unseated Rep. Mike Pappas, R-N.J., is a physicist and a five-time
champion on the television game show ``Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is seldom difficult to spot a new member of Congress, and
this class is no different: They are the ones who squint up at the
Capitol's white-washed beauty, their mouths slightly agape, or who
find themselves trapped at the end of a dead-end basement corridor
with a cluster of equally befuddled tourists.
</P>
<P>
   They are also refreshingly straightforward. ``I'm a
businessman,'' said Douglas Ose, the millionaire Republican real
estate developer from California who replaced a retiring Democrat,
Rep. Vic Fazio. ``I've never been in office. I don't know how to
count votes. Big majority, small majority. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   They also do not expect much, maybe an office ``with a roof on
it,'' Ose said. ``Give me something in the basement. That's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's first day of orientation was accompanied by a dose of
typical confusion. The future members learned that they, unlike
everyone else, do not have to walk through metal detectors. They
puzzled-out the fact that meetings tend to drone on and on, and
that lunch is usually as glamorous inside these staley rooms as a
chicken salad.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Simpson, a freshman from Idaho who served two terms as
speaker of the House in the state Legislature, caused a stir of his
own as he ambled about with a name tag that mistakenly labeled him
a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   When he thanked Gingrich Sunday for holding a fund-raiser for
him in Idaho, a shocked freshman Democrat who had noticed the word
Demcrat on his lapel, asked incredulously, ``He did a fund-raiser
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Yeah,''' Simpson said chuckling. ``These Democrats
want those six seats so badly,'' he said, referring to his name
tag, ``they are willing to do anything.''

 &HT;    No. 21 Jackets point to strong finish
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Wake Forest and Georgia left to complete the
regular season, Georgia Tech couldn't be much more satisfied with
what has taken place and what remains at stake. In their final home
game against Wake Forest on Saturday, the Yellow Jackets will play
for a share of the ACC championship and a likely invitation to the
Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets (7-2, 6-1), who moved up two spots to No. 21 in both
the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls after their 24-21 win
over Clemson on Thursday, would get their first ACC title since
1990 and second ever in 16 seasons of ACC football.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, which has reached seven wins for the fourth time in the
1990s, got there the quickest since the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Florida State, Georgia Tech needed wins over
Maryland, Clemson and Wake to keep pace with the Seminoles for a
share of the ACC title. With two of those three wins now in hand,
the Jackets have kept their focus and have two reasons not to look
past the Demon Deacons to rival Georgia, which it hasn't beat since
1990.

 &HT;    `Lucky' Vols didn't rate drop
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Random thoughts as we head down the regular-season
stretch:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some will call Tennessee lucky after its 28-24 win over
Arkansas on Saturday. Yes, Razorbacks quarterback Clint Stoerner
did give the Volunteers a last chance to win when he fumbled with
1:43 left. But Tennessee took advantage of the opportunity. Good
teams do.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's fortunate finish is probably why the coaches dropped
the Vols to No. 2 in their poll after being tied with Kansas State
at No. 1 last week. Tennessee is still No. 1 in the Associated
Press media poll and should hang on to the top spot in today's BCS
Standings.
</P>
<P>
   To those who voted Tennessee down after beating the No. 10 team,
we say this: Most national championship teams usually have some
luck along the way. Remember Nebraska and the tipped pass at
Missouri last year? Remember Colorado's fifth down in 1990?
Remember Georgia's Buck Belue-to-Lindsay Scott miracle in 1980?
</P>
<P>
   Championship teams usually make their luck by not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having said all those nice things about Tennessee, do you
think Kentucky's Tim Couch is licking his chops as he looks forward
to throwing against the Volunteers secondary Saturday? That group
made Stoerner-to-Anthony Lucas look like Montana-to-Rice. This a
dangerous game for Tennessee after Saturday's emotional win._ Poor
John Cooper. The Buckeyes could beat Michigan Saturday and still
not go to the Rose Bowl. If Wisconsin beats Penn State and Ohio
State beats Michigan, there would be a three-way tie atop Big Ten.
Wisconsin would go to the Rose because it hasn't been since 1995.
If Michigan beats Ohio State, the Wolverines go to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Fantastic finishes
</P>
<P>
   If you went to bed early Saturday night, you missed two of the
most dramatic finishes of the season:
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, N.Y., Donovan McNabb hit
tight end Stephen Brominski with a 13-yard touchdown pass on the
last play of the game as the Orangemen rallied to beat Virginia
Tech 28-26. The win keeps Syracuse alive for the Big East
championship. The Orangemen must win their last two games with
Temple and Miami to win the Big East and a trip to either the
Orange or the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Lubbock, Texas, Rob Peters scored on a 3-yard touchdown run
with 25 seconds left as Texas Tech upset Texas 42-35. Ricky
Williams of Texas ran for 141 yards and needs only 63 yards to
break Tony Dorsett's Division I career rushing record. He'll try to
get those final yards Nov. 27 against Texas A&AMP;M. Williams, however,
was outgained on Saturday by the ``other'' Ricky Williams. He plays
for Texas Tech and had 148 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   _ It is now official. The Jan. 2 Orange Bowl will move back to
the old Orange Bowl Stadium for one year. The game was scheduled
for Pro Player Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins, but the change
was made because of a potential scheduling conflict with the NFL
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl has finalized an agreement with the
ACC that will put an ACC team into the game for the next four
seasons. Earlier this year the SEC signed a similar agreement to
provide the other team. The Peach Bowl will be Dec. 31 at 5 p.m. at
the Georgia Dome.

 &HT;    49ers get theirs with a little help from ``bigtime'' plays
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Across the playing field of the Georga Dome, a red
banner had been hung on the gray wall with care, harking back to a
glorious moment. ``1980 NFC West Champions,'' it read, a single
sad, lonely pennant highlighting the one time the Atlanta Falcons
had won any kind of prize in the National Football League. It would
look a little sickly beside the Celtics and the Yankees, and all
those pennants that decorate their premises, but it seemed just the
time to break it out, as the Falcons played for one to match it.
</P>
<P>
   You had to giggle at the audacity of it. Here they were playing
the San Francisco 49ers, who have owned them over the years. No Dan
Reeves team had beaten them since he came here. In the last 15
seasons, the Falcons had beaten them only five times. What grounds
were there to expect any great reformation? The bookmakers favored
the 49ers by three points, even playing in their home parlor.
</P>
<P>
   If you caught the picture on the first page of the sports
section Sunday morning, you saw Chris Chandler sitting on the
ground, sacked, looking up at the taunting Roy Barker, a scene from
their first match of the season, when the 49ers had devoured the
Falcons. There was cold derision in Chandler's eyes, delivering a
quiet message to Barker: ``You turkey, you'll get yours down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was over. Barker and associates had indeed ``gotten
theirs.'' The Falcons were removing their sweat-sogged armor,
revealing red welts and angry bruises. They blurted the story of
their happiness into microphones thrust in their faces, glistening
in the strobe lights. Outside, wives waited, as they do, proudly
wearing their husbands' numbers on their backs. Of such happiness,
few Atlanta Falcons and Falcons followers have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had given the lofty 49ers a good old-fashioned
butt-kicking. They spent the dwindling time looking at a mirror
image of themselves in the downtrodden days of yore, except these
images wore red and white and bore the names of Young, Rice, Hearst
and Doleman, the vincible (cq)49ers. Here they were, in arrears,
fighting to come back, the Falcons in control. Rarely has it ever
been thus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigtime players make bigtime plays,'' Reeves would say later.
</P>
<P>
   It was not as easy as the simple score indicated, 31-19, and
that was what the coach spoke of. Just when it seemed the Falcons
had it put away, here came Steve Young, who had been buffeted about
like a losing heavyweight, and his cast of acrobatic catchers with
another bomb. First, to Terrell Owens from Tenn-Chattanooga, 54
yards over Randy Fuller. Then to the incredible Jerry Rice, who
suddenly shows up at the most distressful moment, 65 yards over
William White. From 24-6, the 49ers had closed the margin to 24-19.
Just as suddenly, a pall fell over the dome, like theater lights
going dim.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the big play. Terance Mathis had been the quiet one
all day, while Bob Christian and Tony Martin had been Chander's
favored catchers. (O.J. Santiago might have been, but he had a
serious case of ``board hands.'') Mathis slipped down the sideline
behind R.W. McQuarters, a rookie from Oklahoma State, and Chandler
nailed him. In one 78-yard touchdown strike, Mathis became the
Falcons' leading receiver of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge. Our backs were to the wall. We just had to score.
We couldn't let them have the ball again,'' Reeves said. ``Terance
is a bigtime player.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like a day at the circus outside. Traffic, pedestrians,
scalpers, groupies, hustlers of all kinds were drawn as if by a
some powerful magnet. The bandwagon had pulled up and everybody was
jumping on. The house was sold out. Now the Falcons lead the NFC
West, 8-2, best record any Falcon team has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the season was over,'' Reeves said, ``but we have six
more games to play. We could lose either one of them, but I'll go
to war with the men I have in that room there any time.''

<P>
   At a party in Washington last week,  &UR; Bill  &LR; and  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; 
were named godparents of 6-week-old  &UR; Melanne Rose Dozoretz &LR; , whose
parents are Democratic fund-raisers. Among the guests at &UR; Beth  &LR; and
 &UR; Ron Dozoretz &LR; 's house were  &UR; Glenn Close &LR; , &UR; Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend &LR; , Housing Secretary
 &UR; Andrew Cuomo &LR; , Agriculture Secretary  &UR; Dan Glickman &LR;  and
Representative  &UR; John &LR;   &UR; Dingell &LR; , D-Mich. Rabbi  &UR; Jeffrey Wohlberg &LR; 
officiated, joined by an Indian swami who said prayers in English
and Hindi, and a Japanese nun.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Wohlberg explained to a Washington Post reporter that the
concept of godparents is largely ceremonial in Jewish tradition.
``A person of such prestige,'' he said of the parents' regard for
President Clinton, ``they wanted to give him a feeling of being
honored significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether in the back of their minds is the idea
that, God forbid, anything happens to them he would take over the
moral education of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHOLE PERSONALS GIFT CATALOG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Several toilet-guitar items having encouraged a flood of
potty-related suggestions to the Personals holiday gift guide, it's
time to clean up the act with an item that refers to the sacred act
of the holiday season: buying.
</P>
<P>
   From the Flax catalog,  &UR; Kathleen Seaman  &LR; forwards notice of a
miniature shopping cart, ``with all the benefits of a real shopping
cart with none of the drawbacks. Even the wheels work poorly, just
like in the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``benefits of'' a real cart being mostly limited to its
ability to carry big loads, it takes imagination to see how this
71/2-inch tall item, which costs $25, fills the bill.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - Director &UR; Tony Kaye &LR; , who was so angry over the editing of
``American History X'' that he demanded his name be taken off the
film, is described in the latest issue of Premiere as a rookie
director ``testing the limits of Hollywood's patience.'' In the
course of conflict with New Line Cinema, the company financing his
movie, Kaye showed up for one meeting ``with a rabbi, a priest and
a Tibetan monk in tow.''
</P>
<P>
   - At Portland International Jetport,  &UR; Mark Hetts  &LR; heard the
intercom announcement: ``Ladies and gentlemen, if you have not done
so, would you please do so now? Thank you for your cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   - In Milan at the MTV European Musics Awards ceremony on
Thursday, the  &UR; Duchess of York &LR;  was brushed off by members of the
the British group Massive Attack, who refused to shake her hand
when she gave them an award for Best Video. ``P- off,' band member
3D told her backstage, explaining later to the London Evening
Standard, ``What the f- does she got to do with music?''
</P>
<P>
   - Tips for everyday life: &UR; Bill Williams &LR;  received a charming
phone bill from Pacific Bell, detailing minimal charges on one
side, and on the reverse, the simple printed declaration: ``Blank
Page.'' And the latest issue of Self magazine includes among its
``tips for dry-mouth sufferers'' the astonishing Item No.1: ``Take
frequent sips of water.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; HERO WORSHIP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Esquire magazine focuses on 10 famous men and the heroes they
worship. Among them is  &UR; Al Sharpton &LR; , who talks about the qualities
that make  &UR; James Brown &LR;  a hero to him: ``Unwavering inner strength,
unshakable equilibrium and perseverance. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been by James Brown's side at the highest highs and the
lowest lows,'' writes Sharpton. ``I have never seen him frightened
and I have never seen him panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him when he was in prison, and he walked into the
visitors' room like he was walking onstage at the Apollo. He asked
me how I was doing, and I said, `How do you think I'm doing? This
is a terrible situation.' And he said, `It's just business, Al,
just business.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I take my work seriously, but I don't take Eartha Kitt &LR; 
 &UR; seriously. I know the difference between Eartha Kitt the &LR; 
 &UR; character onstage and that which is me at home. I'm not walking &LR; 
 &UR; around all the time with high makeup on and eyelashes on and my &LR; 
 &UR; hair all done up and wearing the wigs. I go out as me, and I'm &LR; 
 &UR; not interested in looking like Vogue unless I go to an affair.'' &LR;

   STORRS, Conn. _ Taking a cue from Duke, which it is expected to
rival for supremacy in men's college basketball this season,
Connecticut on Sunday also posted an opening-game rout over a
school from the state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Duke, which was ranked first in the preseason
Associated Press poll, among others, dominated Fairfield, 98-66, in
Durham, N.C. Sunday afternoon, Connecticut, ranked second in the AP
poll but first in several others, trounced Quinnipiac, 102-60,
before a capacity crowd of 10,027 at the Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac _ a school of 3,500 undergraduate students in Hamden,
Conn., near New Haven _ was making its debut in Division I-A with
only two returning starters from a team that finished at 4-23 last
season in Division II.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the game was not a good gauge of a Connecticut
team that returns all five starters and a strong nucleus of
reserves, along with a heralded freshman, Edmund Saunders from
Waterbury, Conn. Led by forward Richard Hamilton, a preseason
all-American, and point guard Khalid El-Amin who scored 25 and 28
points respectively, the Huskies led by 25 points in the opening
half.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, recently recovered from a broken right foot that kept
him from playing with the U.S. National Team in the world
basketball championships this past summer, hit on 8 of 16 shots,
including 3 of 6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was 3 of 4 from 3-point range in 9-of-12 shooting. The
6-foot 8-inch Saunders, who sat out last year for academic reasons,
was impressive in his Connecticut debut. Playing only 17 minutes,
the smooth freshman connected on 6 of 8 shots, mostly from inside,
and had a game-high 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies outrebounded the visitors, 57-29, and outshot them
46.3 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac, which is coached by Joe DeSantis, a onetime star
player at Fairfield, hurt itself with 27 turnovers, many at the
outset, when Connecticut employed a full-court press.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun, beginning his 13th season as the Connecticut coach,
was generous in his praise of Quinnipiac, which was led by Nate
Pondexter's 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with Quinnipiac,'' Calhoun said. ``We had
the superior size and they were running up against a team that is
10-deep. But they handled the ball well and they attacked our
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his team, which went 32-5 last season and reached the
Final Eight of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, Calhoun had no complaints. ``We played in spurts,'' he
said. ``It was a choppy kind of performance. But I'm not
disappointed.''

FLUTIE IMPROVISES AGAIN IN FOUR-QUARTER TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie is
doing everything he can to make sure the magic does not run dry.
Not a game goes by without one of those improvisational Flutie
plays that causes jaws to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Against the New England Patriots Sunday, there were two Flutie
beauties. In the first quarter, on third down, Flutie scrambled for
10 yards and, just as he was about to get smacked by a Patriots
linebacker, he jumped and threw a lateral to a trailing Thurman
Thomas, who ran for 10 more yards. It was something that both Bills
and Patriots players said they have never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   On another crucial third down, Flutie ran for 22 yards, zigging
when defensive backs were zagging.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Flutie did have several bad throws, two of which were
intercepted in the New England end zone. But over all his
improvisation, as well as a solid Bills defense that limited New
England to only one touchdown, were keys to the Bills beating the
Patriots, 13-10, before a crowd of 72,020 at Rich Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Jets losing to last-place Indianapolis Colts,
the American Football Conference East, the most topsy-turvy
division in the National Football League, has a new leader in the
Miami Dolphins, winners over the Carolina Panthers. The Jets and
Bills are tied for second place with 6-4 records, and the Patriots
fell to fourth at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the Patriots' locker room before the game, there was a sense
of dread. The players know their team, which during the preseason
some in the NFL thought was a Super Bowl contender, is in danger of
not making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team isn't going into the tank,'' New England Coach Pete
Carroll said. ``We'll keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   They did throughout the game, although the Bills almost gave it
away on several occasions. Flutie's first interception came when
the Bills were at the Patriots' 13 in the third quarter and Flutie
threw behind his intended wide receiver Andre Reed, and the pass
was picked off by Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some bad throws today,'' Flutie said. ``There are no
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie would atone for that mistake later with a 10-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Jay Riemersma for a 13-3 lead. It was
only the Bills' first touchdown in their last seven quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it looked like the Patriots were dead. The day
had mirrored their season, with New England losing four of its last
five games. The team has also suffered a rash of injuries. Key
receivers Vincent Brisby (fractured finger), Terry Glenn
(hamstring) and Troy Brown (ankle sprain) are all hurt with only
Brisby playing against Buffalo. The team's lead blocker, fullback
Tony Carter, had knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive players have also paid a few visits to the doctor's
office. Willie McGinest (groin) and Brandon Mitchell (broken foot),
the team's best pass rushing linemen, were hurt with McGinest
missing the three weeks before this game and Mitchell out for the
season. Linebacker Chris Slade, another key pass rusher, did not
play because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe (12 of 31 for 180 yards) gave the Patriots some hope
early in the fourth quarter. The rookie wide receiver Tony Simmons,
pressed to play because of the injuries, ran a near-perfect deep
crossing pattern that caught the defense off-guard. By the time the
Bills realized that blur shooting across their line of sight was
Simmons, he caught the ball at the Buffalo 17 and ran into the end
zone, to help narrow the deficit to 13-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills dominated the time of possession, holding the ball for
37 minutes 17 seconds, as well the ground game, rushing for 213
yards to New England's 48. But Flutie blew two scoring
opportunities with bad throws. The second came with under 5 minutes
left with the Bills at the New England 4 when Flutie badly
underthrew wide receiver Kevin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots could not capitalize on the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   After the interception, two sacks by Bills defensive end Bruce
Smith on the ensuing series ended a chance at tying the game. Then
the Bills, because of swirling winds of nearly 25 miles anhour,
decided to try a fourth-and-4 at the New England 27 instead of
attempting a field goal. Flutie's pass to wide receiver Andre Reed
was incomplete, and the Patriots had the ball back with 2:57 left.
</P>
<P>
   But that drive ended with three consecutive Bledsoe
incompletions, the last coming when wide receiver Shawn Jefferson
was flipped like a pancake by defensive back Donovan Greer. ``I
should have made the play,'' Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie would not admit it publicly, but this victory was special
for him, because the Patriots, after the 1989 season, sent him
packing for Canada. Now, Flutie's victory Sunday might ultimately
knock the Patriots out of the playoffs.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOLZMAN HAD FIERCE PRIDE AND LOYALTY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was one Red Holzman who was barely mentioned
and certainly not eulogized in the newspapers this weekend, or
Sunday at the Parkside Memorial Chapel in Forest Hills, Queens.
This Holzman was not considered the architect of New York's most
sophisticated sports team, or, as Dave Checketts lovingly called
him, the ``patriarch of the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   This Holzman seldom inspired his troops to ``see the ball,'' or
the game of basketball as a means of joyful collective expression.
This Holzman won no championships, no playoff games. This Holzman,
the one I knew best, was still remarkably true to his core,
faithful to his employer, loyal to his players, even those who
deserved less.
</P>
<P>
   None of those whom Holzman coached during his so-called comeback
years, 1978 to 1982, were in the chapel on Sunday to hear
Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, deify Holzman in
a quivering voice. ``A great coach who forced his will on a group
of players,'' Checketts said, with a nod to those who lifted the
level of their sport and united once more to carry their old coach
in his coffin, to the hearse, on the way to his eternal rest.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to mention names. No one could confuse Ray
Williams with Earl Monroe, Sly Williams with Dick Barnett. Holzman,
who returned to the bench after an absence of one season plus 14
games, never publicly complained about what he had come back to.
Never compared a single player to those they couldn't measure up to
the championship past. Never distanced himself to protect the
luminous standing he had earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red played the game with the hand he was dealt, and never once
said, `Why me?''' said Norman Blass, his longtime friend. Blass was
talking about the leukemia that finally claimed Holzman last Friday
night at the age of 78. Same idea. Holzman jumped at the offer of
Sonny Werblin, the Checketts of his time, to replace Willis Reed.
He never worried if he could make himself look good.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 draft pick that year was a mercurial guard named
Michael Ray Richardson. Reed had put him right in the lineup, but
that wasn't Holzman's way. He harnessed the kid's mistake-ridden
game by sitting him down. One night in Cleveland, a furious
Richardson called a couple of reporters over to his locker
following another night on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This old man doesn't want to play me,'' Richardson stammered,
loudly. ``I'm calling my agent, tell him to get me out of here.
Print it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson didn't see Holzman a few feet behind him, shaking his
head. ``Know what the funny thing is?'' Holzman hissed, as I passed
him by. ``He thinks you're going to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things had started to change about then,'' Butch Beard said
Sunday out on Queens Boulevard, after serving as pall bearer with
Reed and the rest. ``But Red was so good at what he did, and he
truly believed the only way to win was to have the players learn to
motivate themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard played some point guard for Holzman in the mid-1970s, then
retired in a huff himself when he suspected Reed was about to cut
him, a few days before Reed was fired. Beard got home from the
barber shop in Louisville one afternoon and found a message from
Holzman. ``Come back and be my assistant,'' said Holzman.
</P>
<P>
   The returning coach was more accustomed to working by himself,
in the years before the invention of the clipboard. But, yes, the
changes in the average player had come, certainly to the Garden.
From the time Holzman's championship Knicks had ruled the town, New
York as a sports city had become perceptibly meaner, as well.
Steinbrenner had risen. Murdoch had a newspaper. The big-money era
in which athletes, as Checketts said, were seen as ``assets and
pawns'' was born. It wasn't as easy for a company man to hold the
line. Players, reporters and even some owners didn't want to hear
it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that he was the fairest guy I've ever seen,
always honest, and you just don't see that anymore,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980-81, Holzman took an athletically gifted team out of
training camp. It happened to be an all-black team, an
organizational first. ``I said, `Red, do you know what you're doing
here?''' Beard said. ``He said, `I don't care if they're red, black
or green. They're the best we have.''' That team won 50 games and
along the way, Werblin gave Holzman a 10-year contract, with the
right to become general manager _ at Eddie Donovan's expense _
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   One day when the team was in Denver, Werblin slipped me the
details of this deal by phone. At dinner that night, I sidled up to
Holzman, after we had both had a couple of drinks, and said, in a
singsong, ``I know something you don't want me to.'' He snorted and
said, ``Yeah, what?''
</P>
<P>
   Though his lips were always sealed, this was one company secret
he didn't mind getting out. Holzman had resented Donovan's
conspiring to replace him with Reed two years before. When it was
said Sunday that this was a man without ego, no one would deny he
had fierce pride.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Holzman never got to be general manager; he
didn't last long as coach. A trade or two didn't work out. The
following season, the Knicks lost 49. Those troubled young players
never did learn to motivate themselves. And on the last day that
season, knowing he was as good as gone, Holzman was asked if he
wished to say something about a team that had, essentially, given
up. Had cost him the life style he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not now, it's too close,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll say something
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman looked away, then back with his trademark sly grin.
``Probably not,'' he said, softly.
</P>
<P>
   He never lowered his standard, never did knock a player. Never
will.

JETS HUMBLED BY COLTS, 24-23 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.Y.)  (Eds: See also FBN-BERKOW-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The New York Jets produced a spectacular play
Sunday _ Aaron Glenn's 104-yard score on the longest return of a
field-goal attempt in National Football League history _ but they
couldn't overcome dropped balls and missed tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Jets are not at the stage where they win games
they're supposed to win. But in recent weeks, they certainly had
overcome blown plays and poor execution. There were too many
Sunday, though, as the Colts produced a 24-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the Colts came in as a 1-8 team, led by a
rookie quarterback, or that the Jets had brought in a four-game
winning streak, had flexed their muscles repeatedly week after
week, had been making big plays when it mattered.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, it was the lowly Colts who launched an 80-yard
drive, who kept it alive on a fourth-and-15 pass from Peyton
Manning to Marshall Faulk, and who got the winning score as Marcus
Pollard hauled down a Manning pass and dragged Otis Smith into the
end zone for the winning score with 24 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Jets out of their first-place tie with
Miami in the American Conference East, lowering their record to 6-4
and giving them a share of second place with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes me sick,'' moaned coach Bill Parcells. Repeatedly
in his postgame news conference, Parcells used the words
``terrible'' and ``horrible'' and said he was ``the most
disappointed since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame him? Glenn's cinematic runback, which
consumed 17 seconds and looked like one of those old college-hero
movies as he dashed to and fro and ultimately down the left
sideline, had started with 1 second left on the clock at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vanjerjagt was attempting a record-equaling 63-yard field
goal. The football went wide right to Glenn, whose run put the Jets
ahead by 23-10.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells, and the Jets, sensed this wasn't going to be a
rout. In fact, the coach even warned his players that when they
went out for the second half they could blow this thing.
</P>
<P>
   The offense had been seriously flawed at times despite the
reemergence of Curtis Martin's running game and quarterback Vinny
Testaverde making some big plays.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 10 in the second quarter, Testaverde
found tight end Fred Baxter alone near the back line of the end
zone. The pass spiraled to Baxter who caught it, looked down,
realized his feet were touching the line, and tried to get them
inbounds. It was too late. The play was negated and the Jets merely
wound up with a field goal from John Hall, one of three he kicked.
He missed a 47-yarder in the third period that could have put the
Jets ahead by 9.
</P>
<P>
   Jets' drives were erratic. Their first barely had time to start
moving. For the second straight week, Testaverde tossed an
interception on his first pass of the game. It was converted into a
field goal by Vanderjagt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a tough time the first play of the game,''
Testaverde conceded later. But he also said, ``A couple of dropped
balls would have been big plays for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Testaverde was the losing quarterback for the first
time as a Jet after leading the team to six victories. His
second-half problems were compounded by missed opportunities as he
wound up completing 12 of 28 passes for 249 yards. He was
intercepted once, threw one touchdown, but was sacked four times
and lost one of his three fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, meanwhile, generated 276 yards in completing 26 of 44
passes. He tossed three touchdowns while being intercepted twice.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the battle of the running backs, at least in rushing
yardage _ 134 yards to Faulk's 69.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did produce a 63-yard touchdown from Testaverde to
Wayne Chrebet, and Hall's three field goals _ all in the first
half. Chrebet and Keyshawn Johnson also had missed catches, though.
Then there was also a key drop by Baxter on a third-and-8 in the
final period, with the Jets hanging on to a 23-17 lead. That
stalled the drive, and though the Colts failed to do anything on
their next possession, they got the ball back with 3:04 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was the Jets' defenders turn to miss. Manning is a much
more poised performer since facing the Jets in the third game of
the season, when the Jets routed the Colts, 44-6. He had good
protection and he also moved well out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   On this winning drive he recovered from a third-and-20, and then
a fourth-and-15. The Colts were backed up on their 33 on that
fourth down when he sought out Faulk. The slithery running back
snared the pass short of a first down, but put on a move past a
flailing Corwin Brown and got 18 yards on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Manning methodically moved toward the Jets' goal line,
converting twice on third-and-1 by running himself, passing every
other time. Finally, the Colts got to the Jets' 14. Manning drilled
the ball to Pollard on the 3. That was where Smith wrapped him up.
Or tried to. Smith is 5 inches shorter and 65 pounds lighter than
Pollard, a 6-4, 257-pound tight end. Smith bear-hugged him and
Pollard began to inch his way to the goal line while Smith's feet
were churning. As Pollard was falling he extended one hand, holding
the ball, over the goalline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard getting around him,'' said Smith. ``He's not one
of those little receivers, and I couldn't get my arms around him to
bring him down. I've got to get back in the weight room.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' last gasp was drowned out by the crowd noise in the
RCA Dome, a rare occurrence in recent years. The Jets' final drive
began on their 29, but a Testaverde-to-Johnson 19-yard pass got the
Jets to the 48 with 11 seconds remaining. From there, anything was
possible, especially in this season of the Jets' excellent passing
game. The crowd wouldn't let up, though. Testaverde couldn't hear
very well and neither could his center, Kevin Mawae.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pulling away as Kevin was snapping,'' explained
Testaverde. ``My bottom hand hit the ball.'' It bounced to the
Colts with only six seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   There are, as Testaverde knows, many a slip in a game and in the
season. For Parcells, it was ``a big step back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we had to do was make that one tackle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Testaverde put it, ``This hurts us quite a bit.''

ANALYSIS: SHADES OF THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who blinked? Both of them, Bill Clinton every bit as much as
Saddam Hussein, in the weekend showdown over Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in his administration had decided that United
Nations weapons inspections were highly unlikely to work, that they
would always be hamstrung in one way or another by the Iraqis,
Clinton has given them yet another chance. Having ordered air
attacks, he has called them off.
</P>
<P>
   The president acted a bit as his hero, John F. Kennedy, did
during the Cuban missile crisis: Confronted with mixed signals, he
chose the more favorable interpretation, acted upon it and will now
wait to see if that works.
</P>
<P>
   As for Saddam, he felt obliged by the threat of American and
British military action to reverse his decision last month to
suspend all cooperation with the United Nations. But few doubt that
it was a ploy, like so many of his past moves, to buy time. His
goal remains what it has always been: the development of weapons to
help him dominate his region.
</P>
<P>
   So not a great deal has been resolved in the last 48 hours, and
the administration provided no clear blueprint of its future
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had changed his mind overnight. After reading
the first Iraqi letter on Saturday, the president's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, termed it ``unacceptable'' and said
it had ``more holes than a Swiss cheese.'' Clinton said subsequent
letters _ the president mentioned three, but Berger said there had
been only two _ had closed the most gaping holes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the texts of the supplementary letters offered only
very modest assurances that the inspectors could ``resume all their
activities.'' A reasonable person could conclude that they made
matters clearer, or that the first letter was the definitive text
and the others merely tactical wiggles.
</P>
<P>
   Something else changed overnight. It became clear that only the
United States and Britain were dissatisfied with the original Iraqi
letter; a number of other countries that 24 hours earlier had
backed American threats of air attacks suddenly started calling for
further diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to resume full-scale purchases of oil from Iraq, several
European and other countries had backed military action only
reluctantly, and the letter gave them an out. That changed the
political if not the military reality facing Clinton. With much of
the world now willing to give Saddam the benefit of the doubt, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan describing the initial letter as a
positive development, the president was backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   He had no real choice but to test the Iraqi leader's intentions
once more. To have sent the bombers and missiles in under those
circumstances would have been to invite widespread criticism abroad
and perhaps even at home. In that sense at least, he had waited 24
hours too long to order the attack.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton put the best face on the matter. He attributed his
change of course to the clarifications, accepting for the moment
the Iraqi assurances that they attached no conditions to the
inspectors' freedom to operate in an unfettered way. The best
long-term solution, Clinton said, was to keep inspectors ``in there
working'' to block weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1962, with an American invasion of Cuba imminent,
Kennedy received two letters from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev
about the missile crisis. One was bellicose, one conciliatory. It
was, of course, a moment of far greater national peril than this
one, because enemy missiles were being installed less than 100
miles from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the suggestion of his brother Robert, Kennedy replied
to the conciliatory letter, and nothing more was heard about the
other. An agreement was quickly reached on the removal of the
missiles from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases are not, of course, directly parallel. Clinton
faced one ambiguous letter and two clarifications, Kennedy two
separate letters whose relationship was not clear. But each
president decided to put the best face on an unclear situation and
wait to see whether his adversary would go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to take yes for an answer,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the president said, ``Iraq must live up to its
obligations.'' Otherwise it would have to pay the price. But that,
as Clinton well knows, is what the United States said nine months
ago, to no effect. Then as now, it is up to Saddam to decide when
and how the next crisis comes.
</P>
<P>
   And when it does, what will the United States do? Presumably,
launch the attack that was aborted Saturday. But neither Berger nor
Defense Secretary William Cohen was willing, at a briefing Sunday,
to discuss whether that would happen immediately after the next
infraction by Saddam, without warning or pause for diplomacy, or
whether another long buildup would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any indication that the administration is ready to
set a firm timetable, with deadlines for specific actions by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle can repeat itself _ violation, buildup, threats of
attack, retreat from the brink _ as long as the United States
chooses to let Saddam play that game. There is no easy remedy to a
very complex situation, as administration officials constantly
emphasize. But eventually there will be a loss of credibility
unless Saddam is restrained or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed that point, calling for change in Baghdad, ``a
new government that is committed to represent and respect its
people, not repress them.'' That seemed to suggest a policy
departure. But Cohen cautioned that the president ``was not calling
for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein,'' but rather promising to work
with opposition groups to try to bring a more democratic government
to power in Baghdad ``in some future time.''

LOOKING TO NEW CENTURY, SOUTH REFOCUSES EYES ON THE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Painful memories from a generation ago
collided this weekend with calls for action in the coming century,
to complete the South's ``Unfinished Business'' at a conference on
race, poverty, and inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meeting took place in a city that bears little
resemblance to the segregated stronghold of 1960s, most of the
participants advocated further steps against discrimination, rather
than rest on the accomplishments of the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the regional conference hope to hammer out by
Monday's closing session an agenda for the 21st century that
emphasizes the importance of public schools, decent housing, and
respectable jobs in a racially-diverse society.
</P>
<P>
   It is an opportunity, said John Egerton, a civil rights
historian from Nashville who was the conference director, to issue
a new ``Southern Manifesto'' that flies in the face of the original
1956 document, signed by almost every Southerner then in Congress,
defying a Supreme Court decision to strike down segregated schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a program to identify ourselves,'' Egerton
said in an interview Sunday, ``we leave it to the neo-Confederates
and the Christian right, who speak with a Southern accent, to say
they are what the South stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference was held less than two weeks after voters
rejected far-right candidates in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina,
and South Carolina, while Jeb Bush and George W. Bush, espousing
``conservatism with compassion,'' won in Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political results, which were viewed as progress by
the delegates here, the meeting took place in the long shadows of
Birmingham's troubled history. Sixty years ago, a racially mixed
Southern Conference for Human Welfare, convened to consider the
region's social and economic problems, was interrupted by a police
commissioner named Eugene ``Bull'' Connor, who demanded that the
group hold segregated sessions or face arrest. A quarter-century
later, in a more memorable outburst, Connor unleashed police dogs
and fire hoses on black demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   To acknowledge the city's past, the ``Unfinished Business''
conference held its first session at the 16th Street Baptist
Church, where the peace of a Sunday morning in 1963 was shattered
by a bomb that killed four schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remembrances _ there are so many,'' said Alpha Robertson,
whose daughter died in the bombing. ``I remember the signs: Colored
Only. White Only.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative John Lewis of Georgia recalled the segregated
strife, too. As a youthful demonstrator, he was beaten by Alabama
troopers during the ``Bloody Sunday'' attack on the Edmund Pettus
Bridge at Selma in 1965. But speaking to younger blacks who
complain that little has changed in the South, Lewis preferred to
accentuate the positive developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in a tremendous amount of fear. People couldn't
register to vote. The fear is gone. The signs are gone. That's
changed,'' Lewis said. ``We're on our way toward laying down the
burden of race.''
</P>
<P>
   William F. Winter, a member of President Clinton's advisory
board on race and an exponent of public education when he was
governor of Mississippi, said it is essential ``to have our
children go to school together.'' Addressing another thorny
subject, Winter said: ``There is still room for affirmative action
because there is still a network that rotates people to
opportunity. Blacks have got to have access to that network.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the South has enjoyed explosive economic growth in
recent years, statistics were cited from a new report by MDC Inc.,
a North Carolina research organization, finding that the median
family income for Southern blacks stood at 55 percent of the median
for whites. More than 7 million Southerners who worked full-time
last year made less than a poverty-level income of $12,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough jobs for the uneducated, and they are not
getting themselves educated,'' said George Autry, MDC's president.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited debate Sunday afternoon, questions were raised
about the region's old public policies of tax incentives to attract
industry, and a growing Hispanic population that may be perceived
as a threat by blacks still fighting for equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership positions continue to be dominated by white
males,'' said Wendy Jones, executive director of the Southern
Regional Council, an Atlanta-based civil rights organization. She
recommended a ``systematic campaign'' for the South to adapt to ``a
Technicolor community.''

KWAME TURE, 57, ONCE KNOWN AS STOKELY CARMICHAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Va., Guinea)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwame Ture, the flamboyant civil rights leader known to most
Americans as Stokely Carmichael, died Sunday in Conakry, Guinea. He
was 57 and is best remembered for his use of the phrase ``black
power,'' which in 1967 ignited a white backlash and alarmed an
older generation of civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was prostate cancer, for which Ture had been
treated at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York in the
last two years. He once said his cancer ``was given to me by forces
of American imperialism and others who conspired with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ture, who changed his name in 1978 to honor Kwame Nkrumah and
Ahmed Sekou Toure, two African socialist leaders who had befriended
him, spent most of the last 30 years in Guinea, calling himself a
revolutionary and advocating a Pan-African ideology that evoked
little resonance in the United States, or, for that matter, Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ture's advocacy of Pan-Africanism was the last phase in a
political evolution that passed from indifference to the civil
rights movement, when he was a high school student, to emergence as
an effective nonviolent volunteer risking his life in the battle
against segregation, to honorary prime minister of the Black
Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   Though his active participation in the struggle for civil rights
lasted barely a decade, he was a charismatic figure in a turbulent
time, when real violence and rhetoric escalated on both sides of
the color line.
</P>
<P>
   Stokely Carmichael was inspired to participate in the civil
rights movement by the bravery of those blacks and whites who
protested segregated service with sit-ins at lunch counters in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the Negroes sitting in at lunch
counters down South,'' he told Gordon Parks in Life magazine, ``I
thought they were just a bunch of publicity hounds. But one night
when I saw those young kids on TV, getting back up on the
lunch-counter stools after being knocked off them, sugar in their
eyes, ketchup in their hair _ well, something happened to me.
Suddenly I was burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting scholarships from several white universities, he
entered Howard University in Washington in 1960. By the end of his
freshman year, he had joined the Freedom Rides of the Congress of
Racial Equality, hazardous bus trips of blacks and whites that
challenged segregated interstate travel in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Riders often met with violence, and at their
destinations Carmichael and the others were arrested and jailed,
the first incarcerations he experienced. One early arrest brought
him a particularly harsh 49-day sentence in Parchman Penitentiary
in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Howard in
1964, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It
was the ``Freedom Summer,'' the year that SNCC (popularly
pronounced ``snick'') was sending hundreds of black and white
volunteers to the South to teach, set up clinics and register
disenfranchised black Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, slim, handsome and a dynamic speaker, Carmichael soon
emerged as a leader, cocky enough to be described as someone who
could look as if he was strutting when he was standing still. Parks
wrote that watching Carmichael made him believe that the young man
could ``stroll through Dixie in broad daylight using the
Confederate flag for a handkerchief.''
</P>
<P>
   As a SNCC field organizer in Lowndes County in Alabama, where
blacks were in the majority but were politically powerless, he
helped raise the number of registered black voters to 2,600 from a
mere 70 _ 300 more than the number of whites registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Displeased by the response of the established parties to the
success of the registration drive, he organized the all-black
Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which, to fulfill a state
requirement that all parties have a logo, took a black panther as
its symbol. The panther was later adopted by the Black Panther
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The young Carmichael was radicalized by his experiences working
in the segregated South, where peaceful protesters were beaten,
brutalized and sometimes killed for seeking the ordinary rights of
citizens. He once recalled watching from his hotel room in a little
Alabama town while nonviolent black demonstrators were beaten and
shocked with cattle prods by the police. Horrified, he said that he
screamed and could not stop.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael was arrested so many times as a nonviolent volunteer
that he lost count after 32. His growing impatience with the
tactics of passive resistance was gaining support, and in 1966 he
was chosen as chairman of the SNCC, replacing John Lewis, a
hardworking integrationist who is now a congressman from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after his selection, Carmichael, then just 25,
raised the call for black power, thereby signaling a crossroads in
the civil rights struggle. Increasingly uncomfortable with King's
resolute nonviolence, he sensed a shift among some younger blacks
in the direction of black separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Many were listening sympathetically to the urgings of Malcolm X,
who had been assassinated a year and a half earlier, that the
struggle should be carried out by any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It was June 16, 1966, and Carmichael, a spellbinding orator, was
addressing a crowd of 3,000 in a park in Greenwood, Miss. James
Meredith, who had integrated the University of Mississippi, had
been wounded on his solitary ``Walk Against Fear'' from Memphis,
Tenn., to Jackson, Miss., and civil rights volunteers were marching
in his place. When they paused to set up camp in Greenwood,
Carmichael was arrested and his frustration was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the 27th time,'' he said with disgust. ``We been
saying `Freedom' for six years,'' he continued, referring to the
chant that movement protesters used as they stood up to racist
politicians and hostile policemen pointing water hoses and
unleashing snarling dogs. ``What we are going to start saying now
is `Black Power!'''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd quickly took up the phrase. ``Black Power!'' it
repeated in a cry that would soon be echoed in communities from
Oakland, Calif., to Newark, N.J. But if Carmichael's call for
``black power'' galvanized many disenfranchised young blacks, it
troubled others, who thought it sounded anti-white, provocative and
violent. And it struck fear into many whites.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse reaction was powerful and immediate. After the
integrationist, nonviolent speeches and sermons of King and others,
few Americans, white or black, were prepared for the uncompromising
demands of black militants who rallied to Carmichael's cry.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers deplored the term and editorials warned of ``reverse
racism.'' Contributions to civil rights groups from sympathetic
whites fell. Voting results that November in many state and local
elections reflected a white backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Many black leaders of the civil rights movement, though eager to
avoid a split in the movement, were clearly upset by the use of the
phrase and the separatism it seemed to connote.
</P>
<P>
   King called it ``an unfortunate choice of words.'' Roy Wilkins
of the NAACP scorned it as an example of ``the raging of race
against race.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most indignant response came from Whitney Young Jr,
the director of the National Urban League, who said: ``Anyone can
arouse the poor, the despairing, the helpless. That's no trick.
Sure they'll shout `black power,' but why doesn't the mass media
find out how many of those people will follow those leaders to a
separate state or back to Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   Young said mockingly that as he rode the train from his suburban
home to his office in New York City, Carmichael's words had forced
him to consider whether he should get off in Harlem. ``Should I get
off this morning and go over to the bars and pool halls on Lenox
Avenue and cuss out Whitey to show I'm tough? That will get me a
lot of publicity. Or should I go downtown to the office and call up
officials at Ford or General Motors and work on getting 10,000 jobs
for unemployed Negroes?''
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Black Power,'' which Carmichael wrote in 1967 with
Charles Hamilton, now a professor of political science at Columbia
University, the authors tried to explain the term. ``It is a call
for black people in this country to unite,'' they wrote, ``to
recognize their heritage, to build a sense of community. It is a
call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the book, which is still in print, appeared,
Carmichael's speeches became more provocative. ``When you talk of
black power, you talk of building a movement that will smash
everything Western civilization has created,'' he told black
audiences. And as civil unrest flared in Detroit and Newark,
Carmichael's call became associated, as Hamilton put it, ``with
riots and guns and `burn, baby, burn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of young people singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' new
images of militant black men and women were being shown on
television _ black berets, raised fists, men with guns. And along
with goals of social justice and integration came ideas of black
separatism and power harking back to the black nationalism that had
been preached in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 and 1967 Carmichael lectured at campuses around the
United States and traveled to countries including North Vietnam,
China and Cuba. He made perhaps his most provocative statement in
Havana. ``We are preparing groups of urban guerrillas for our
defense in the cities,'' he said. ``It is going to be a fight to
the death.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, a declining SNCC severed all ties with him. Soon
afterward he became honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers,
the ultramilitant urban organization begun by Huey Newton and Bobby
Seale.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon found himself embroiled with the other Panther
leaders for opposing their decision to seek support among whites.
He moved to Guinea, in West Africa, in 1969, saying, ``America does
not belong to the blacks,'' and calling on all black Americans to
follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1969, three months after he had moved to Africa, he made
public a letter announcing his resignation from the Black Panther
Party because of what he called ``its dogmatic party line favoring
alliances with white radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter signaled Carmichael's break from the main currents of
American life. He lived in Conakry as the guest of Sekou Toure, the
Marxist head of a one-party state, who had replaced French
technical assistance with Russian aid. His next-door neighbor was
Kwame Nkrumah, the Pan-Africanist first leader of independent
Ghana, who after being deposed in a coup in 1966 was offered
sanctuary in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 _ by now, calling himself Kwame Ture _ he married Miriam
Makeba, the South African singer. They lived in a seaside villa
where he sometimes greeted visitors wearing the green uniform of a
Guinean soldier, a pistol at his side. After they divorced, he
married Marlyatou Barry, a Guinean doctor who now lives in
Arlington, Va., and from whom he was also divorced. He is survived
by a son, Bokar, from his second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   He became a globe-trotting exponent of the All African Peoples
Revolutionary Party, returning to American campuses to recruit. He
maintained that continued progress for black Americans could be
made only through ``mass political organization on a Pan-African
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black power,'' he said, ``can only be realized when there
exists a unified socialist Africa.'' He sounded the idea that
blacks must work with blacks for their cultural, economic and
political liberation.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1971, he was already on the margins. Julius Lester,
who had once helped Carmichael draft a radical speech in Havana,
compared the speeches of Malcolm X with the speeches and essays
that Carmichael collected in a book called ``Stokely Speaks.''
Lester wrote in The New York Times Book Review: ``Though dead,
Malcolm is terrifyingly alive in his speeches; Carmichael is alive
but his speeches are depressingly dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokely Carmichael was born on June 29, 1941, in Port-of-Spain,
Trinidad, and he spent his first 11 years there. His father,
Adophus, was a carpenter who moonlighted as a taxi driver, and his
mother, Mabel, was a stewardess for a steamship line. They had
emigrated to the United States when he was a toddler, leaving him
in the care of his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he joined his parents in Harlem. By the time he was in
the seventh grade, his family had moved to an old Jewish and
Italian neighborhood in New York's East Bronx. He said in a 1967
interview that he was the only black member of the Morris Park
Dukes, a neighborhood gang, and described himself as ``a wild,
aggressive boy, boozing it up and getting a kick out of petty
theft.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he passed the admissions test for the elite Bronx High
School of Science, he broke with the Dukes. ``They were all reading
the funnies while I was trying to dig Darwin and Marx,'' he told
Gordon Parks.
</P>
<P>
   He was popular in high school, he said, and remembered dating
white classmates and visiting luxury apartments. ``Now that I
realize how phony they all were, how I hate myself for it,'' he
said in the 1967 interview. ``Being liberal was an intellectual
game with these cats. They were still white, and I was black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ture never publicly criticized Toure, who was known to jail and
torture his opponents. The Guinean leader died in 1984, and two
years later Ture's alignment with him led to his arrest by the
military government that had taken over. He spent three days in
jail accused of trying to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ture continued to live in Guinea. To the end he answered his
telephone with the greeting he had used for more than 20 years,
``Ready for the Revolution!''

   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ For days after Hurricane Mitch
struck, the Martinez brothers of Kansas City, Mo., heard nothing
from their family in Honduras. So they packed up a truck and drove
south.
</P>
<P>
   They could wait no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Castellanos of Lenexa couldn't wait either. He flew to
Honduras, trying to get supplies in time to save the lives of his
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is on life support, and the next few weeks will
determine how many in the country will survive.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Honduras said Hurricane Mitch wiped out 50
years of progress in 72 hours, knocking out three-fourths of the
country's bridges and roads. One in four residents is homeless. The
entire banana crop is gone. More than 6,500 people have died.
Almost twice as many are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some say disease could double the death toll. Malaria and
cholera are spreading, and there is little medicine. The water is
contaminated with waste and pesticides. Entire regions are cut off
from help.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday brought a familiar sight: three children in San Pedro
Sula squatting by a pool of water. They splashed in the stagnant
water, using it to wash mud from their legs and arms. Social
workers fear the water is full of parasites.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City and all over the world, people with ties to
Honduras have no idea whether their loved ones are even alive. Many
are rushing to Honduras by air, sea and car. They travel with hope
and with dread.
</P>
<P>
   Along with them are Kansas City area relief organizations, such
as Heart to Heart International, Children International and La
Buena Fe, which have answered a worldwide 911 call. They are
sending food, medicine and water as fast as their cargo planes can
get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the hope that the worst is already gone,'' Castellanos
said Friday night from the capital, Tegucigalpa, where he is
helping Heart to Heart distribute aid. ``But the hardest part is
still to come. We think there are still some major complications in
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real urgency here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Castellanos moved to Lenexa, Kan., this year, the memories
he kept of Tegucigalpa were of a 400-year-old colonial city with
narrow streets. Modern skyscrapers shared the landscape with small
shanties on the hills.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned this month, he found buildings collapsed and
those narrow streets blocked with debris. The military patrolled
the streets at night. There was a 9 p.m. curfew, a far cry from the
bustling nightlife he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew the worst was outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   One thought cheered him up, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God it's still the same people,'' he said. ``People who
are friendly, patient and have been enduring as much as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountains that surround Tegucigalpa and the industrial city
of San Pedro Sula played a big part in the destruction. The steep
terrain caused rainwater to flow downhill with fury, leaving little
hope for the villages in the valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, Francisco Sagastume Pereira had a banana
plantation. It was a lush piece of property beside the Chamelecon
River. The river is muddy and fast-moving, much like the Missouri
River, but narrower.
</P>
<P>
   It has receded to its original size now. But it is easy to see
how the rains widened the river to three times its normal width.
The waters deposited a sandy beach of sediment on what used to be
land abundantly covered with trees, grass and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Pereira shoveled the sandy sediment that covered
his land. The banana trees and their fruit are gone, washed away in
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 28, Mitch pounded Honduras with winds of up to
180 mph. The storm brought an inch of rain an hour for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch was one of the four most-powerful hurricanes in history
and the deadliest storm to hit the Caribbean in 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries felt the storm's wrath. More than 2,000 died in
Nicaragua, and hundreds more perished in El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   But Honduras was squarely in the storm's crosshairs from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane wiped entire communities off the map. Eight-foot
bushmaster snakes, among the deadliest in the world, shared high
ground with survivors. Children now drink water contaminated by
corpses or pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   For many there is no alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Driving rains collapsed buildings and buried hundreds of people
under debris and mud. Others drowned as rains turned villages into
lakes. The rain cut off thousands from the world _ no phones, no
roads and no food.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira dug to uncover a tree for firewood. Like many people
here, Pereira precedes his comments with ``By the grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``It is by the grace of God'' that his six children and
his wife are safe. God also kept his home solidly planted in the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is also lucky because he does not rely on the bananas
as his sole source of income. He has another job, as a tax
collector for the government. But like the plantation land, that
job is now obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bring debts to people who have nothing?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm, Honduran natives all over the world tried to
find out whether loved ones had survived. It was almost impossible
to get through.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone lines are down in many parts of the country. Some
people have worn Honduran telephone books ragged, searching for a
number that will connect to a voice from home. One man reached a
message last week that said all telephone numbers in Honduras had
been changed.
</P>
<P>
   Some pleaded with relief workers to check on their family.
Others withstood days of torturous waiting.
</P>
<P>
   With no hope of contact, some in Kansas City have chosen
dangerous, desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   To drive to Honduras, Kansas City residents must travel more
than 2,000 miles through the United States, Mexico and Guatemala.
The journey is on dangerous roads through uncertain political
terrain. MORE

   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ uncertain political terrain.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 persons left Kansas City earlier in the week. Eliazar
Martinez said he thought the trip would take eight days.
</P>
<P>
   He left Kansas City on Thursday morning with his brother,
Aristides.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Martinez brothers and other friends struggled to
hitch together two Toyota trucks for the trip. The brothers are
driving one truck, towing the second. If the first truck breaks
down, they will switch to the second truck, making repairs at a
stop later down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have money only for the gas and some food for ourselves,''
Eliazar Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   A month has passed since they last spoke to their mother, Bertha
Martinez. She is 72 years old and lives alone in Sonaguera, Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges are out near the town. The men plan to link up with
other Hondurans from Kansas City in the town of El Progreso. From
there they will travel by bus as far as the roads will take them.
</P>
<P>
   They think they will end up having to reach the town by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Rodriguez Banegas of Independence, Mo., hasn't heard
from his mother, two sisters, six brothers and two daughters living
in the El Progreso area.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports say the hurricane wiped out El Progreso.
</P>
<P>
   So Banegas is driving, too.
</P>
<P>
   Banegas was a concrete worker in Honduras. He wonders what
happened to the structures he helped build, including a hospital in
San Pedro Sula.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Banegas wonders what happened to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these travelers do not have the money for vaccinations
to guard them against feared epidemics of malaria, dengue and
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Diaz Rodriguez, the Honduran ambassador to the United
States, was stunned when he heard of the driving trips from Kansas
City to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell them not to go. Stay here and let us help them
get information,'' Rodriguez said Friday while on a visit to St.
Joseph. ``The risk is too great. They won't be able to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Florence of Claycomo, Mo., understands what is pulling
them home. He plans to drive to Texas, put his truck on a boat to
Honduras and try to make contact with his wife's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God can stop these people,'' Florence explained. ``They
have no choice. They have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hour, cargo planes land at Tegucigalpa's airport.
Inside are donations of food, medicine, water and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   These aircraft, which Castellanos helps unload, are a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch is yet another chapter in Honduras' uneasy
relationship with the United States. This time Americans are
welcome angels of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 20th century, American gunboats patrolled the
waters to protect corporate interests. In the 1980s, Honduras was a
staging ground for the U.S.-backed contras fighting in neighboring
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Ambassador Rodriguez complains that aid from the
American government was ``very, very slow'' at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed somewhat. Honduras has received about $80
million in aid from the American government. American soldiers are
rebuilding bridges, administering medical clinics and delivering
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, especially Mexico, Japan and Spain, have
helped, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can do the best we can do in response to this show
of human solidarity,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodriguez and others say ordinary people _ from Honduras
and all over the world _ will be most important to the country's
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's strong links to Honduras started in 1958, when a
Sugar Creek doctor sold his practice and took his family there.
John Blumenschein set up a clinic and school that has grown into La
Buena Fe, an association that works throughout Central America. La
Buena Fe translates to ``the Good Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Today at least three major Kansas City-based relief
organizations are in Honduras to help the country rebuild. La Buena
Fe has sent doctors. Heart to Heart is loading cargo planes.
Children International is helping Honduran children who have been
matched with American and Canadian sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, dozens of other groups are soliciting aid: from
students at Winnetonka High School to local Starbucks Coffee shops
to the Girl Scouts at Holy Trinity School in Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the global relief, however, the Honduran ambassador
says the country's recovery ultimately will depend on his own
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to stand together as a country in a spirit of unity,''
Rodriguez said. ``We need to work together because the major
burden, in the end, will be on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have to rebuild deserted villages in the countryside
that hearken back to the eighth century, when some Mayan cities
were inexplicably abandoned. The buildings stood untouched, but
their inhabitants had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Many theories abound, but some speculate that a natural threat _
perhaps heavy rains _ drove the Mayans away.
</P>
<P>
   The cruelty of nature often appeared in the mythology of the
Mayans, the ancestors to many in Honduras and the rest of Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayans believed that the world ended and was reborn over and
over. One story said the world would end in a deluge. The Milky
Way, in the form of a serpentlike creature, would open its jaws and
release water onto the earth. The waters would come for days and
days until they swept away humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Mayans believed, the land that washed away would be
replaced by a new and better world.

SOME EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT Y2K NOW SAY CHILL OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Some experts who have been warning about a
technological Armageddon caused by year 2000 computer problems now
are telling Americans to chill out.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not necessary to stockpile months' worth of food and
water, convert bank accounts into cash, squirrel away guns and
ammunition or buy generators to weather power outages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our perspective right now is that the basic infrastructure of
the country will hold,'' John Koskinen, chairman of the President's
Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said in an interview Thursday.
``The banking system is in very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts are not suggesting that Americans forget about
the year 2000 computer problem. As a precaution, they're advising
people to put aside enough food, water, fuel, medical supplies and
cash to last a few days. And they're suggesting they make sure the
companies they work for are prepared for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time they saw a growing Y2K paranoia in the
country, four experts interviewed last week softened statements
they made earlier in the year. Some had predicted that year 2000
problems would shut down banks and bring the American
infrastructure tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more positive than I was six months ago.'' said Sen.
Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett said he still believed that there would be a
``fairly major disruption that will come of this. But I'm now
beginning to think the overseas problem will affect us more than I
thought and that the U.S. is in better shape than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's comments were backed by Jim Cassell, author of a
recent GartnerGroup research study that advises Americans not to go
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   Even Canadian computer programmer Peter de Jager, who is
generally recognized as the first to bring the year 2000 problem
into the public arena and has been an alarmist on the issue, said
that now there might be too much alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who say buy a cabin in the woods and take your
money out of the banks and the markets, they're not only silly,
these are self-fulfilling prophesies,'' de Jager said. ``If
everyone takes their money out of the banks, the banks will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem is a programming glitch that could cause
some computers and computer-controlled equipment to quit working or
provide bad information at the turn of the century. The problem
stems from computer systems and billions of computer chips that
might read the ``00'' in a computer program as ``1900'' rather than
``2000.''
</P>
<P>
   With just 59 weeks remaining before that date, the strongest
moderating comments are coming from GartnerGroup, a
Connecticut-based technology consulting firm that is considered to
be the nation's leading researcher on the year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 problem is analogous to a major storm,''
researchers at GartnerGroup said in its report. ``In this case it
will be, at worst, similar to a hurricane, cyclone or bad
snowstorm. For individuals, the year 2000 will not be a catastrophe
such as a severe earthquake, a huge asteroid crashing into the
earth, or a nuclear war.''
</P>
<P>
   Although GartnerGroup analysts are advising Americans to take
some precautions _ including keeping a limited amount of cash,
food, water, fuel and medical supplies on hand on Dec. 31, 1999 _
the firm said doomsday predictions for Jan. 1, 2000 were all hype.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious year 2000-related computer problems that result in
power-plant shutdowns or interrupt critical services after midnight
Dec. 31, 1999, should be repaired within days or even hours of the
problem, said Cassell, GartnerGroup vice president and director of
research.
</P>
<P>
   Because New Year's Eve 1999 falls on a Friday, businesses and
governments will have Saturday and Sunday to fix any problems.
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup analysts based their projections on data gathered
from 15,000 companies in 87 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The GartnerGroup report is an unusual departure for the firm,
which aims most of its work toward large businesses or industry
groups. This report, a compilation of comments from 18 GartnerGroup
analysts, is aimed at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell said the myths and fallacies circulating around the year
2000 problem led to the 15-page document.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been reading an awful lot of what we think are
irresponsible statements that could lead people to do some
unnatural acts,'' Cassell said. ``People suggesting that everyone
take money out of banks and convert it into gold or liquidate
stocks. We've heard people say, `You'd better get a gun, because if
you don't people are going to break into your house and steal your
food.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for people to be even thinking about that kind
of hype,'' Cassell said. ``So, for the first time, we decided to
write something for the general public rather than our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   De Jager, a year 2000 author and publisher of the Internet's
most popular Web site on the issue, said fear of the unknown was
driving a year 2000 paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, de Jager, Cassell and Bennett, the senator, said
short-term spot failures of some critical services were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup's year 2000 team is suggesting that families have
about two weeks of salary in cash and up to five days of food,
water, fuel and medical supplies on hand Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But GartnerGroup said the greatest risk to Americans was to be
working for companies that weren't prepared for the year 2000,
because companies might end up going out of business _ leaving
individuals unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that those who relied on Social
Security, Veterans Affairs or other government benefits or
subsidies save enough money to live on for a month, if possible. It
recommended that any mail that needed to arrive early in 2000 be
mailed before Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   GartnerGroup's strongest warning involved travel. It suggested
that travel could be disrupted because of uncertainties about
air-traffic control and insurance coverage of airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen took that caution further. The president's point man on
year 2000 said he was concerned about ``some communities, some
cities, some counties, even a couple of states that are not paying
enough attention, or maybe no attention'' to the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a risk for people where public officials say this
isn't their problem, or say it's being handled someplace,''
Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases those government agencies operate or regulate
small airports, power plants and water-treatment plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who say you don't have to worry about it that
you have to worry about,'' Koskinen said.

<P>
   RAWLINS, Wyo. _ The image of a howling coyote is a romantic
symbol of the still untamed wild West to some, but to many hunters
and ranchers it represents a destructive predator. And so in
another Western tradition, hunters from several states gathered
during the weekend to compete in the annual National Coyote Calling
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters, who came from as far away as South Africa and as
near as Colorado, paid an entrance fee of about $150 each to
compete for a purse of several thousand dollars, won by a man who
killed nine coyotes. The hunt was legal and included about 150
hunters who worked in pairs over a day and a half in the mountains
here in south-central Wyoming that are home to sheep and cattle as
well as antelope and deer. Using only a specialized ``call'' to
lure the coyotes, the hunters killed 200 of the 545 coyotes they
said they had spotted.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting contests across the nation, primarily in Western states,
have had environmentalists facing off against farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While acceptable at one point in the past, there is no
biological or ecological justification for these types of
activities anymore,'' said Andrea Lococo, Rocky Mountain
coordinator of the Fund for Animals, which is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditions in the West are sometimes hard to break,'' Ms.
Lococo added, ``but we find this to be particularly egregious _
killing for kicks, for fun and money, bloodsport.''
</P>
<P>
   Such opposition has led to the cancellation of two contests in
Arizona earlier this year, a review of the regulations on hunting
contests in that state and new restrictions on small game hunting
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In both Arizona and Colorado, hunters and animal-rights
activists have found themselves in an awkward alignment over the
issue. ``Those contests give a black eye to hunting,'' said Diane
Gansauer, executive director of the Colorado Wildlife Federation.
``It's as much hunting as shooting fish in a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the hunters, Jeff Barnes, a 36-year old electrical
contractor from Utah, said: ``We would hunt for no money. And we
probably only kill 2 percent of what the state kills.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, and most of the hunters here, said this hunt would not
make a dent in the local coyote population, and that they kill far
fewer than the government agencies, like state Animal Damage
Control agencies, which kill thousands of coyotes annually with
poisons and in aerial hunts.
</P>
<P>
   The attitudes of many state officials about the hunting contests
were summed up by Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer in a recent letter to
an opponent of the contest: ``Briefly, these species are
unregulated and are allowed to be taken by any legal method,
anytime during the year. The number of coyotes taken is relatively
small compared to the statewide coyote population and the economic
impacts of the losses of livestock and wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she oppose the weekend coyote hunt, Ms. Gansauer, who is
a hunter, herself said: ``It's our strong opinion this is not an
animal rights issue. The hunters need to police their own so the
reputation of hunting is not in serious jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   The contests have historically involved prairie dogs and coyotes
because of their abundance and damage they can do to livestock,
grazing areas and household pets. In Arizona, home of the Phoenix
Coyotes hockey team, there are an estimated 200,000 to 300,000
coyotes, and there are unofficial estimates in Wyoming of about
100,000 coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, the second largest wool-producing state in the
nation, ranchers and hunters say the contests are a cost-effective
way to manage the coyote population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man is supposed to be a manager of the land and animals,''
said Dan Thompson, a sheep rancher and founder of the contest here.
``We want to live with them, not in spite of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Department of Agriculture recorded 59,000 sheep and
lambs lost to coyote predation in 1997, which accounted for 69
percent of the total loss of sheep and lambs. There are no
statistics to show how many sheep were killed by other predators
such as bobcats, eagles and dogs. Wool production in Wyoming is a
$55-million-a-year industry and losses from predators in 1997 was
$7.73 million _ $3.56 million of that from coyotes. Another 15,000
sheep and lambs were lost to disease, severe weather and old age in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over-population of coyotes also can increase diseases such as
distemper, rabies and mange among their packs, as well as decrease
big-game populations of antelope, deer and elk, the Geringer
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   However, this reasoning is no consolation to David Gaillard of
Predator Project, a nonprofit conservation group in Bozeman, Mont.
``It's rooted in the culture to make the West safe for people and
livestock,'' Gaillard said. ``But simply shooting the coyotes
doesn't solve predation. The coyotes respond by producing larger
litters and dispersing adults.''

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey in 1996, 13
percent of men and 1 percent of women in the United States go
hunting; 14 million hunting licenses were sold last year.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunters face opposition, including that from sometimes
violent animal rights groups such as the Animal Liberation Front,
they shy away from discussing their hunts. Many will go from here
to the World Coyote Calling Contest in Elko, Nev., next weekend or
to another local hunt in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not barbarians,'' said Allen York, the winner of this
year's hunt here. ``But the `anti's' spread so much negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a photograph in the local paper showed the carcasses
of 242 coyotes side by side in a dirt parking lot sparked outrage
over the hunt. This year, each animal was hastily loaded into a
horse trailer as hunters in camouflage stood around sipping light
beer and diet soft drinks, discussing sightings of wild horses and
the bone-chilling wind. The pelts are used for trim on the collars
and cuffs of leather and other winter coats. The proceeds from
sales of the white to gray and fawn-colored pelts, at about $12 to
$14 a piece, will go to a domestic violence project in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the worst thing to happen to hunting was Walt Disney,''
said Thompson. ``The animated voice doesn't make them human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coyote is smart, elusive. I respect him,'' he said. ``I
don't hunt him because I hate him, but we have to have checks and
balances.''

FINANCIAL ANALYSTS, ON THE WHOLE, OFFER ASSURANCES FOR MARKETS IN
'99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: How do the experts feel the economy and stock market
will fare between now and 2000?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question posed Tuesday during a get-together with
members of the Kansas City Society of Financial Analysts. My
feeling was that if you're holding that much informed brainpower
hostage in one place, why not do some serious brain-picking?
</P>
<P>
   The range of responses from those who earn their livings
pondering the economic future reflected the uncertainty of the
present. When asked to characterize their outlook through next
year, 43 percent were pessimistic, 38 were optimistic and 19
percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stock market, the estimates of where the Dow Jones
industrial average will end this year ranged from 9,500 to 7,500.
When asked to predict where the Dow will be at the end of 1999, the
forecast range widened, from 11,500 to 7,500. On balance, however,
the predictions for the Dow industrials a year down the road were
fairly upbeat. Fully one-third of the analysts expected the Dow to
be at 10,000 or higher at 2000's dawning.
</P>
<P>
   The average prognostication for the blue-chip indicator's 1999
close was 9,450, for a gain of about 7 percent between now and
then. While this average appears conservative compared with the
gains of the major stock indexes over the past few years, it
apparently factors in the analysts' outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to estimate earnings for Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, most
predicted year-over-year growth in the range of 3 percent to 6
percent. The good news is, only a couple of respondents forecast a
decline. The bad news is, they believe the double-digit
profit-growth party is over.
</P>
<P>
   Given the prospects for domestic economic growth and the
multitude of world trouble spots, though, the slowing earnings
momentum is likely to get even slower. The most optimistic of the
analysts' forecasts for gross domestic product was an annual rate
of growth of 3 percent through 1999. The most pessimistic was zero
growth. The average of all forecasts called for the economy to
expand by 1.9 percent during this period.
</P>
<P>
   If the forecast is on target, it wouldn't constitute an economic
downturn, but it would be what some economists characterize as a
growth recession. This occurs when the economy isn't expanding fast
enough to create enough jobs to keep the jobless rate from rising.
Given the tightness of the labor markets at this point in the
cycle, some observers probably would see this as a good thing for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City's market mavens were asked to predict the most
significant market development of 1999, the answers were all over
the place. They included the market's anticipation of Y2K computer
problems, Social Security privatization initiatives, Middle East
terrorism and problems with Iraq, improvement in the Japan-Asia
situation, the emergence of cyclical companies as the stock
market's leaders, the crash of the ``nifty 50'' stock group, the
resurgence of small-cap stocks, the continuing integration of the
European economies, and the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, their outlook could be interpreted as reasonably
reassuring, given the maturity of the economic expansion at home
and potential for geopolitical instability abroad.

SPORTS COLUMN: DESTINY LASTS ONLY ONE HALF FOR THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They were, surely, the lads of destiny. Yes, it
was only halftime of the 10th game of the season, but, hey, let's
start making reservations for when we check into Miami for the
Super Bowl in two months. The Jets, at 6-3 and tied for the East
lead in the American Football Conference, and winners of four
consecutive games, had on the last play of the first half in the
RCA Dome Sunday gone ahead of the Colts, 23-10. And this was no
ordinary play.
</P>
<P>
   It had demonstrated conclusively that they had suddenly become
the darling of the dieties, no? Aaron Glenn, the Jets' kick-return
specialist, had executed a 104-yard, 17-second run from not only
one end zone to the other, but virtually from one sideline to the
other. With a second to go in the half, he had grabbed a 63-yard
field-goal attempt by Mike Vanderjagt which fell short of the
yellow uprights.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts chased and fell and stumbled and missed tackle after
tackle as Glenn, at 5 feet 9 inches and with the moves of a New
York taxi driver, swept into the end zone. But the coach of the
Jets, Bill Parcells, is no dummy. He was obviously aware that his
personnel might have been believing that this game was in the bag,
that the lowly Colts, at 1-8 for the season, understood that they
were no match for the big, bad, bodacious Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he caught a few players admiring their triumphant visages
in the locker-room mirrors. Maybe even in the back of the helmeted
minds of those Jets with a sense of history, they remembered that
30 years ago this season _ before many of them were even born _ the
Jets with Joe Namath stunned the football world by upsetting the
heavily favored Colts to win Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Parcells went over adjustments as is conventional.
And since Parcells is far from stupid, he said to the team just
before it went through the door to the field: ``How would you guys
feel if they came back to beat you?'' This was not question and
answer, of course. It was a warning: Be overconfident at your
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out to be more than a warning. It was an omen. It was,
well, Domesday. The Jets never scored again in the game. But, oh,
how fickle may be the index finger of fate. For the Colts scored 14
points in the second half and beat the Jets, 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the Colts made an excruciating 80-yard
touchdown drive in the last three minutes of the game _ scoring on
a 14-yard pass with 30 seconds left _ to reverse their fortunes
which had looked so bleak only slightly earlier in the afternoon.
Perhaps the Jets had, like Talmudic scholars, spent so much time
studying their glowing press clippings of late that they forgot
certain fundamentals, like blocking and tackling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff in the papers fattened us up for this loss,''
said Bryan Cox, the linebacker. ``It showed the immaturity of our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't tackle and we couldn't catch the ball,'' Parcells
said. ``It makes me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have known,'' said Ernie Logan, the Jets' right
tackle, ``that a two-touchdown lead in this league is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about Parcells' admonition? ``I didn't think about
it,'' Glenn said. ``I mean, I didn't think they'd come back.''
</P>
<P>
   So here were the rookie Colts quarterback Peyton Manning showing
the poise of Namath in the crunch, Marshall Faulk running the way
Matt Snell once had, and Marcus Pollard and Marvin Harrison snaring
passes like Don Maynard and George Sauer _ wait a minute, but those
guys Sunday were wearing blue and white, not the green and white of
those hallowed Jets of yesteryear. And try as they might, nothing
the current crop of Jets did could recreate once-upon-a-time _ not
the previous 30 years, nor the previous 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The sad capper came when, with 30 seconds to go in the fourth
quarter, tight end Pollard caught Manning's pass on about the
3-yard line. Otis Smith, the cornerback, threw his arms around
Pollard, like a long-lost brother come home from the sea. But
Pollard pulled Smith into the end zone for the killer touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I thought at that moment?'' Smith said. ``I thought, `I
gotta get stronger. I gotta get back into the weight room.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was symbolic of the second-half tackling futility. Someone,
seemingly trying to ease his anguish, suggested to Smith that some
of those Colts were very good at breaking tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we gotta know how to break the tackle-breakers,'' he said,
irrefutably. Parcells was smart enough to take two teams to three
Super Bowls and win a pair of them. He took over the forlorn Jets
after a 1-15 season two years ago and now has made contenders of
them _ despite Sunday's second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big loss,'' he said. ``I'm very disappointed. It's a
step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We have to go forward and get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   If history is judge of a Parcells team, the chances of that
happening are good. For starters, though, he may have to hide them
from any future rave notices. Maybe remove the mirrors in the
locker room, too. &QL;

NFL QUESTIONS PARCELLS ABOUT CALLING BLEDSOE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ New York Jets Coach Bill Parcells is being
investigated for possible tampering by the National Football League
over a telephone call he made to quarterback Drew Bledsoe of the
New England Patriots, whom Parcells once coached. But Parcells said
after Sunday's game that he had made the call merely ``to thank
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells denied Sunday's CBS-TV report that suggested he had
telephoned Miami Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson to provide him with
information about the Patriots that Bledsoe had given him.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL spokesman, Greg Aiello, said, ``We have made an inquiry
into the reported telephone conversation with Drew Bledsoe and Bill
Parcells.'' Aiello added that the league had written to the Jets
early last week and asked Parcells about the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who is believed to have already replied to the
league's questions, said Sunday, ``Let's take the depositions and
see who did what.''
</P>
<P>
   League rules describe as potential tampering ``any contact
between members of one organization and another that could
potentially interfere with employer-employee relationships. Clubs
that do so do so at their own risk and could risk forfeiture of a
draft choice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Parcells described the talk as an innocent outgrowth of
an emotional reunion. Bledsoe had a problematic run under Parcells,
who left New England after the 1996 season. Bledsoe was quoted
several times since as denigrating Parcells. But after the Jets
defeated the Patriots, 24-14, last month at Foxboro, Mass., Bledsoe
sought out Parcells to shake his hand. Parcells said Bledsoe's
action led him to call Bledsoe the next day.
</P>
<P>
   CBS reported Sunday that Bledsoe told Parcells that wide
receiver Terry Glenn was injured and unlikely to play against the
Dolphins, and that Parcells then passed on that information to
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't called Jimmy Johnson,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the league conducted a similar review when Bill
Belichick, the Jets' assistant head coach, spoke with one or two
players for the Baltimore Ravens days before a game between the
teams. No disciplinary action was taken against the Jets, but they
were warned by the league not to repeat the action.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It was just a matter of time before Ken Caminiti became an Astro
again, but no one knew that time would come in the wee hours of
Sunday morning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just hours after Caminiti and his wife, Nancy, celebrated their
wedding anniversary, Astros fans received the gift they had been
anticipating for days when the club reached an agreement with the
free-agent third baseman at approximately 1:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti agreed to a deal that could be worth $15 million over
the next three years. The 35-year-old switch hitter is guaranteed
$4.5 million in 1999 and the same amount in 2000, and he could make
$5.5 million if the Astros exercise their club option in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti also could make an extra $500,000 in incentives based
on plate appearances in 2001. If the club chooses not to pick up
the option, Caminiti will be paid $500,000 in the form of a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is contingent on Caminiti's passing a physical
examination, which could take place as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like his most serious injuries are behind him,''
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``If we keep him
healthy, this adds another All-Star-caliber player to our lineup.
Ken is right out of the Craig Biggio/Jeff Bagwell/Moises Alou/Derek
Bell mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leads by example. He's the ultimate gamer. One of the
things our club seemed to be missing was that spark, and maybe
Caminiti is the guy who can ignite this club. I think it would be
hard not to get fired up with Ken Caminiti as your teammate. When
he's healthy, he's among the elite in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Caminiti provides the Astros with a run
producer who can swing from the left side of the plate, something
the club had hoped to add over the offseason. The former National
League Most Valuable Player (1996) has averaged 30 homers and 99
RBIs over the past four seasons. Caminiti likely will bat cleanup
behind Bagwell in a lineup that already was the most feared in the
NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to be here that I don't care where Dierk (Astros
manager Larry Dierker) hits me,'' said Caminiti, who on Sunday
departed for a hunting trip to South Texas. ``I'm going to be happy
wherever he puts me. The main thing for me is just getting a chance
to play at home and be an Astro again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come back in a bad way. I wasn't going to take no
for an answer. I'm just fortunate everything worked out and I
didn't have to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   It became a foregone conclusion that Caminiti would choose the
Astros after he turned down a three-year, $21.5 million offer from
the Detroit Tigers last week. From that point, it was obvious money
wasn't as important to Caminiti as being close to his wife and
three daughters and their home in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure a lot of the big-time ballplayers are going to be
laughing at me and saying I messed up the market,'' Caminiti said.
``But you can take a look at the market; I didn't mess it up. I'm
not going to worry about what anyone else has to say. I only worry
about my own happiness and what's best for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, the Astros' third-round draft pick in 1984, made his
major-league debut in Houston in 1987. He played with the Astros
through the 1994 season before being traded to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros dealt Caminiti, Steve Finley, Andujar Cedeo, Roberto
Petagine and Brian Williams to the Padres for Derek Bell, Ricky
Gutierrez, Doug Brocail, Phil Plantier, Craig Shipley and Pedro
Martinez, not to be confused with the current Red Sox pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're elated to begin our offseason this way,'' Hunsicker
said. ``This is a homecoming of sorts. It's special when a player
who develops and grows up in your system can finish his career
where it started.''

KWAME TURE, 57, ONCE KNOWN AS STOKELY CARMICHAEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this is a shortened version of OBIT-CARMICHAEL, which has
moved.)  
(lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwame Ture, the flamboyant civil rights leader known to most
Americans as Stokely Carmichael, died Sunday in Conakry, Guinea. He
was 57 and is best remembered for his use of the phrase ``black
power,'' which in 1967 ignited a white backlash and alarmed an
older generation of civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was prostate cancer, for which Ture had been
treated at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York in the
last two years. He once said his cancer ``was given to me by forces
of American imperialism and others who conspired with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ture, who changed his name in 1978 to honor Kwame Nkrumah and
Ahmed Sekou Toure, two African socialist leaders who had befriended
him, spent most of the last 30 years in Guinea, calling himself a
revolutionary and advocating a Pan-African ideology that evoked
little resonance in the United States, or, for that matter, Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Though his active participation in the struggle for civil rights
in the United States lasted barely a decade, he was a charismatic
figure in a turbulent time, when real violence and rhetoric
escalated on both sides of the color line.
</P>
<P>
   Stokely Carmichael was inspired to participate in the civil
rights movement by the bravery of those blacks and whites who
protested segregated service with sit-ins at lunch counters in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the Negroes sitting in at lunch
counters down South,'' he told Gordon Parks in Life magazine, ``I
thought they were just a bunch of publicity hounds. But one night
when I saw those young kids on TV, getting back up on the
lunch-counter stools after being knocked off them, sugar in their
eyes, ketchup in their hair _ well, something happened to me.
Suddenly I was burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting scholarships from several white universities, he
entered Howard University in Washington in 1960. By the end of his
freshman year, he had joined the Freedom Rides of the Congress of
Racial Equality, hazardous bus trips of blacks and whites that
challenged segregated interstate travel in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Riders often met with violence, and at their
destinations Carmichael and the others were arrested and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Howard in
1964, he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It
was the ``Freedom Summer,'' the year that SNCC (popularly
pronounced ``snick'') was sending hundreds of black and white
volunteers to the South to teach, set up clinics and register
disenfranchised black Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   As a SNCC field organizer in Lowndes County in Alabama, where
blacks were in the majority but were politically powerless, he
helped raise the number of registered black voters to 2,600 from a
mere 70 _ 300 more than the number of whites registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Displeased by the response of the established parties to the
success of the registration drive, he organized the all-black
Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which, to fulfill a state
requirement that all parties have a logo, took a black panther as
its symbol. The panther was later adopted by the Black Panther
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The young Carmichael was radicalized by his experiences working
in the segregated South, where peaceful protesters were beaten,
brutalized and sometimes killed for seeking the ordinary rights of
citizens. He once recalled watching from his hotel room in a little
Alabama town while nonviolent black demonstrators were beaten and
shocked with cattle prods by the police. Horrified, he said that he
screamed and could not stop.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael was arrested so many times as a nonviolent volunteer
that he lost count after 32. His growing impatience with the
tactics of passive resistance was gaining support, and in 1966 he
was chosen as chairman of SNCC, replacing John Lewis, a hardworking
integrationist who is now a congressman from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after his selection, Carmichael, then just 25,
raised the call for black power, thereby signaling a crossroads in
the civil rights struggle. Increasingly uncomfortable with King's
resolute nonviolence, he sensed a shift among some younger blacks
in the direction of black separatism.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``Black Power,'' which Carmichael wrote in 1967 with
Charles Hamilton, now a professor of political science at Columbia
University, the authors tried to explain the term. ``It is a call

   In 1966 and 1967 Carmichael lectured at campuses around the
United States and traveled to countries including North Vietnam,

afterward he became honorary prime minister of the Black Panthers,
the ultramilitant urban organization begun by Huey Newton and Bobby
Seale.

<P>
   But he soon found himself embroiled with the other Panther
leaders for opposing their decision to seek support among whites.
He moved to Guinea, in West Africa, in 1969, saying, ``America does
not belong to the blacks,'' and calling on all black Americans to
follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   He became a globe-trotting exponent of the All African Peoples
Revolutionary Party, returning to American campuses to recruit. He
maintained that continued progress for black Americans could be
made only through ``mass political organization on a Pan-African
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black power,'' he said, ``can only be realized when there
exists a unified socialist Africa.'' He sounded the idea that
blacks must work with blacks for their cultural, economic and
political liberation.

RESEARCHERS `FLUSH OUT' AIDS VIRUS, ATTACK WITH DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers have virtually eradicated the AIDS virus from the
immune cells of several patients by flushing the virus out of
hiding and then cutting it down with antiviral drugs, they
announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether ``virtually'' means ``totally,''
and also whether the elusive virus could emerge from other hiding
places in the body, such as the brain, when the researchers
discontinue the patients' antiviral drugs entirely, as they plan to
do soon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this marks the first time any experimental maneuver has
come so close to eliminating the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
from its favorite lair _ the genetic inner sanctum of so-called
``resting'' CD4 immune cells.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the experiment did not work in all the participants,
the researchers hope they have opened a new front in the effort to
vanquish HIV. They announced the results at a meeting of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, which Dr. Anthony S. Fauci of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases put forward last
February, is worthy of an action-movie script. The ``bad guy''
virus, holed up in a remote mountain cabin, is lured out of hiding,
only to be massacred by the big guns of antiviral drugs that hit it
from several different angles.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the agent that smokes HIV out of its hiding places
is interleukin-2, or IL-2, an immune system chemical that sounds
the alarm to awaken resting CD4 cells. Antiviral drugs, while
remarkably successful in eradicating HIV from the bloodstream,
cannot kill HIV within resting CD4s.
</P>
<P>
   Even patients on antiviral drugs who have no detectable HIV
circulating in their bloodstream for months and years invariably
have viral genes secreted in the DNA of their resting CD4 cells.
The quiescent virus can spring forth when the immune cells it
infects are awakened to battle an ordinary infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the virus is present in basically everybody on
antiviral therapy,'' said Dr. Robert Siliciano of Johns Hopkins
University, a leading HIV researcher. ``So this sanctuary is going
to have to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be necessary to flush out every HIV particle, or
every set of HIV genes lurking in any of the body's billions of
cells. One current hypothesis is that some patients' immune systems
can keep the virus in check once it is reduced to a low-enough
level; some individuals are known to have survived for years
despite some HIV in their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci cautioned against declaring premature victory. Until
patients show no evidence of HIV's reemergence for a considerable
time off antiviral therapy, ``we shouldn't even use the word
`cure,''' said Fauci.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say, ``Aha, we've gotten rid of all the virus,''
Fauci said in an interview. ``We can't make the statement that
there's no virus in the body, just that there is no virus in the
`compartment' we've looked at,'' referring to the CD4 immune cells.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers' inability to find HIV in some
patients' CD4 cells is important, because Fauci said his group has
``never run across anybody on antiviral therapy alone'' who didn't
have HIV lurking in resting immune cells. ``We've cultured scores
and scores of them,'' Fauci added, referring to the practice of
growing millions of patients' activated CD4 cells in laboratory
dishes to see if they produce virus.
</P>
<P>
   Normally researchers grow 10 million to 20 million CD4 cells
from each patient to determine if HIV still resides in any, and
Siliciano sometimes cultures up to 100 million cells.
</P>
<P>
   To be as sure as they could in the new experiment that no HIV
was still present, Tae-Wook Chun, a researcher in Fauci's lab, took
330 million CD4 cells from each of the six patients who had no
evidence of remaining HIV at lower levels of detection.
</P>
<P>
   Three patients who had undergone the ``flushing'' strategy had
no detectable virus at the 330 million-cell level. Tissue taken
from the lymph node of one patient likewise showed no evidence of
remaining HIV, also suggesting that the virus may have been
eliminated from every last resting CD4 cell.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Chun found HIV in three other subjects who had
appeared virus-free when he cultured 10 million to 20 million of
their CD4 cells. Another eight patients who participated in the
``flushing'' experiment for an average of 39 months still had
traces of HIV in their CD4 cells at the 20 million-cell level _
although not as much as a dozen other patients who had only
conventional combination antiviral therapy for the same length of
time.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently no way to distinguish patients whose HIV was
apparently cleared by the new strategy from others in whom the
approach did not work, Fauci said in an interview. For instance,
successful patients were not HIV-infected for shorter periods of
time before treatment, nor did they have notably different types of
prior drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite only partial success, Fauci is encouraged by the results
because they strongly suggest it is possible to clear HIV from a
major, highly persistent ``reservoir'' within the body, something
not shown before now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been assuming that the pool of latently infected CD4
cells is the reservoir from which the virus reignites when you take
people off therapy,'' Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal researchers are planning to extend the experiment to
additional patients and to withdraw antiviral therapy from patients
with undetectable CD4-cell infections to see if HIV reemerges.
</P>
<P>
   Until that experiment is done and patients are followed for a
considerable length of time without resurgence of the virus, AIDS
researchers will not conclude it is possible to eliminate the virus
from anyone's system once it is established.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly these patients have very little virus,'' Siliciano
said of the three patients reported Sunday. ``But you won't know
for sure if the strategy works until you stop therapy and see what
happens.''

ASIAN MARKETS ARE CALMER, BUT DANGERS REMAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: APEC-TARIFFS) 
(jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Stock markets are up, currencies are
stable and bankers no longer live in dread of panicky runs on their
branches. Even CNBC Asia, the cable news channel that offers
minute-by-minute coverage of the region's malaise, has stopped
using its pulse-quickening logo, ``Asia in Crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis has not passed. But 16 months after the
devaluation of the Thai baht sent currencies tumbling, capital
fleeing, and governments toppling throughout the region, a
semblance of calm has returned. From Thailand to Korea, the crisis
feels more like a chronic condition.
</P>
<P>
   As representatives of the United States and 20 other countries
gather here this week for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, economists and analysts warn, though,
that Asia's surface stability presents its own set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is pressing Asian countries to undertake
wholesale and painful economic reforms. But without the threat of a
collapsing currency or dwindling foreign reserves, their
governments may lose their resolve. Already, experts say, efforts
to overhaul banks and corporations are flagging in Korea, Malaysia
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very dangerous to assume that the crisis is
over,'' said Brian Lippey, the managing director of Tokai Asia
Ltd., an investment firm in Hong Kong. ``There is a big risk of
complacency and a return to protectionism. We have seen how quickly
things can unravel in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, over the weekend, Indonesia was struck by a fresh spasm
of violence between protesting students and soldiers. And in the
streets of this normally staid city, protesters howled against the
ouster and imprisonment of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rebound in Asian sentiment masks a continuing
deterioration in the underlying economies. Analysts estimate that
Indonesia's economy will contract by more than 15 percent this year
and another 5 percent next year. Malaysia's is expected to shrink
about 5 percent, both this year and next. And Singapore, one of
Asia's most resilient performers, announced last week that its
economy had slipped into negative territory for the first time
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vastly premature to expect a turnaround in the real
economies,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for
International Economics, a research organization in Washington.
``The countries in Southeast Asia are in what I would call a
depression. It looks to me like they're continuing to go
downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why have stock markets in Jakarta, Hong Kong, and Tokyo
risen anywhere from 10 percent to 60 percent since early October?
Two outside factors are responsible: the Federal Reserve Bank's
decision to lower interest rates and the strengthening of the
Japanese yen relative to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rate cuts have emboldened Asian banks to cut their
rates as well, which has rekindled confidence in places where
commercial activity had virtually ground to a halt. The stronger
yen has taken the pressure off other Asian currencies, notably
China's yuan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We returned to a point where, instead of raw panic, people are
doing calculations again,'' said William Overholt, director of Asia
strategy at the Japanese financial services firm Nomura
International in Hong Kong. But while lower interest rates and
stable currencies can make for a more tranquil atmosphere, ``cuts
in interest rates don't make a difference in an economy where the
banks are insolvent,'' said Simon Ogus, head of Asian economics at
the investment bank Warburg Dillon Read in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   There are big variations between countries, of course. Experts
said Thailand and South Korea were on the road to recovery, having
already borne much of the pain of the currency collapse. But
healthier economies like Hong Kong and Singapore, which did not
suffer steep currency devaluations, could take longer to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia remains in a treacherous downward spiral. Although its
currency, the rupiah, has risen from 12,000 rupiah to the dollar to
just under 8,000 since last summer, inflation is running at an
annual rate of 80 percent and one-fifth of its 92 million workers
are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a very dire situation on the political front,'' said
Mari Pangetsu, executive director of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a research group in Jakarta. ``For almost
every single economic reform we've tried to do, the process gets
politicized.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even in the more stable countries, the restructuring of banks
and debt-burdened companies has been stop and go. In Thailand, for
example, the government has moved aggressively to auction off bad
loans. But experts there said the government had been slow to
introduce a promised new bankruptcy code.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are intense vested interests fighting against it,'' said
James Stent, a senior executive vice president of Bank of Asia,
Thailand's 11th-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has devised its own solution to the crisis by imposing
strict controls on its currency and stock markets. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad says he is shielding his economy from the vagaries
of international capital flows. But critics say Malaysia is
following a potentially ruinous policy that could cut it off from
the global economy and snuff out its much-needed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger concern among the leaders who will gather at the
regional summit meeting is that other countries may follow the
example. Although officials in Thailand and Indonesia have said
they would not impose capital controls, experts said the specter of
several more years of recession could test their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That is why most experts here were relieved that the Federal
Reserve cut interest rates, even if they doubt the long-term
effect. The Fed's action, they said, signaled that the United
States finally recognized the depth of Asia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not clear they can offer much of a remedy. The
Treasury Department is drafting a proposal to be presented at the
meeting to restructure the huge debts hobbling Asian corporations.
But the United States wants Japan, whose banks are the biggest
lenders in Asia, to bear much of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten, an economist who heads an informal group of advisers
to APEC, the regional economic group, said Asian countries should
adopt a policy of aggressive fiscal stimulation. If the governments
acted in concert, he said, they could revive domestic demand, which
would reduce their export dependence on the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers said, though, that it is futile to divorce the
future of Asia from the economic vitality of the West. Many
analysts say the recovery of Asia hinges on whether foreign
investors pour money back into the region. ``If conditions in the
United States and Europe remain normal, Asia will probably be OK,''
said Marc Faber, an investment adviser in Hong Kong. ``But if the
U.S. economy weakens, all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, then, Asia's recovery depends as much on
averting a new crisis abroad as confronting the one at home.

OFF THE WALL: WHAT ARE GARV'S PRIMARY COLORS?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The guys at Porky's baseball card shop in the North Hollywood
section of L.A. had a constant stream of customers Saturday to see
the irrepressible Steve Garvey sign his name on whatever stuff they
put in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Garv was also astute enough to offer a handshake and smile with
every hello. Ever the politician.
</P>
<P>
   And what of his latest political aspirations? Could Porky's be
headquarters for Garv's revenge?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe former pro wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura blazed a
new trail, winning the governorship of Minnesota, but Garvey has a
boxer in mind. The Republican candidate said he thought recently
re-elected Senator Barbara Boxer ``could have been had.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said he (and his people) ``are keeping an eye'' on the
state's other senator, Dianne Feinstein. Her six-year term comes up
in 2000 and she's a potential running mate for Democratic prez
hopeful Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Garvey does _ and the U.S. Senate is definitely his
target _ he won't wait too much longer.

 &HT;    49ers get new view from on 2nd floor
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having trailed by double digits in three of their
previous four games entering Sunday's NFC West showdown at the
Georgia Dome, the haughty San Francisco 49ers already have
demonstrated in 1998 that they can play from behind on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with next Sunday's game with New Orleans, however, the
Niners face a rare and much more daunting challenge _ proving they
can play from behind in the division. Now one game behind the
Atlanta Falcons following a 31-19 defeat, even some veteran Niners
conceded they are anxious to see how the club reacts to its latest
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a team that isn't accustomed to being in this
position,'' linebacker Ken Norton Jr. said. ``Second place, right?
It doesn't even sound good. Some guys were saying this is a wake-up
call. Well, we're going to find out if we all heard the alarm go
off. We have to answer the challenge we're facing.''
</P>
<P>
   To overtake a Falcons team playing with palpable confidence, the
49ers will need more gumption than they showed on Sunday. For
years, the Niners were miscast as an outfit that could only play a
finesse game, and typically they responded by quietly bludgeoning
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the Falcons enjoyed the physical advantage
throughout, so much so that Atlanta linebacker Cornelius Bennett
even hinted the great Jerry Rice might have been a bit intimidated.
Bennett referred to Rice having ``alligator arms,'' an allusion to
a pair of dropped passes, including one in the end zone near the
end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk a lot every time we play them, and this time they
went out and backed it up,'' strong safety Tim McDonald said. Added
cornerback Darnell Walker: ``There was a kind of swagger to (the
Falcons), and we're the ones supposed to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first meeting on Sept. 27, when several Atlanta
players were critical of a game plan long on gimmicks and with too
much respect for the suspect San Francisco secondary, coach Dan
Reeves constructed a model around his team's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Falcons were too conservative at times, and
didn't test rookie cornerback R.W. McQuarters nearly enough. But
one thing Atlanta never lacked was the feeling it was the better
team, and that it could claim the division lead simply playing
things straight. The bully-boys of the division for nearly two
decades, the 49ers exited the Dome on Sunday evening with their
noses bloodied.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the hemorrhaging might require more than a tourniquet.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers listed eight players as injured in the game, and four
of them were starting offensive linemen. Against a Saints defense
that has a blitz ratioamong the league's highest, San Francisco
could have problems in protecting already-battered quarterback
Steve Young next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly pressing to make some plays, Young appeared to be
suffering far more than club officials have conceded. Although
recovering from an abdominal strain, there still are rumors Young
is also nursing a rib injury, and some of his passes looked like
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game,'' Young said, ``is like a train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell if this was the one that derailed the 49ers for
good in 1998.

 &HT;    Birds rule roost

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves is not by nature a
happy-go-lucky man, but when he walked into a small room in the
Georgia Dome after Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers,
he couldn't wipe the silly grin off his face.
</P>
<P>
   These are high times for the local NFL team, and after the
Falcons pounded San Francisco 31-19 Sunday in front of a sellout
crowd of 69,828 to take possession of first place in the NFC West,
there was much to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is 8-2 for the first time, and has won 14 of its last
18. This is the latest in the season the Falcons have been in first
place since Week 15 of the 1991 season. And they reached these
heights by beating the dreaded 49ers (7-3) handily to gain a
franchise-record seventh straight victory at home.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, San Francisco had owned the Falcons, winning five
straight and 11 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta used a big-play defense, which created two touchdowns in
a span of 56 seconds in the final quarter, to take a 24-6 lead,
then needed a 78-yard touchdown pass in the final three minutes to
seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta settled the matter with 2:51 remaining, when Chris
Chandler (21-of-21, 198 yards) hit wide receiver Terance Mathis
with a perfect pass on a 78-yard scoring play. The play erased all
doubts that had been created on two previous 49ers possessions,
when Steve Young completed long touchdown passes to Terrell Owens
and Jerry Rice to close the gap to 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   When Mathis scored, the Dome went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope everybody got their money's worth because that was an
exciting game,'' Reeves said. ``What can you say about the pass
Chris threw to Terance? That's what happens in these games.
Big-time players make big-time plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were shockingly physical while winning the battle on
both lines of scrimmage. They held San Francisco to 76 rushing
yards, and Jamal Anderson rushed 31 times for 100 yards (his
seventh 100-yard game in the last eight).
</P>
<P>
   ``They played very hard,'' San Francisco linebacker Ken Norton
Jr. said. ``They outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's 10-yard run off left tackle with 2:56 left in the
first half gave Atlanta a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco countered by driving 75 yards in 13 plays in just
2:37. But the 49ers, which led the NFL in red-zone touchdown
percentage (20 of 29) were forced by the Atlanta defense to settle
for a 24-yard field goal from Wade Richey.
</P>
<P>
   Each team had added field goals in the third quarter, which set
the stage for Atlanta's defensive heroics. Atlanta cornerback Ray
Buchanan intercepted a fluttering pass by Steve Young and returned
it to the 1 to set up the Falcons' second touchdown. Jamal Anderson
scored from the 2 two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Falcons defensive tackle Shane Dronett
forced Young to fumble, and middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle
recovered at the 2 and rolled into the end zone for a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons premature celebration ended moments later, when the
49ers countered with a 54-yard touchdown pass to Owens, who beat
nickel back Randy Fuller, and a 65-yard pass to Rice, who beat
strong safety William White with 3:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   The late scores made Reeves make a critical call.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The 49ers) have got a rookie corner,'' Reeves said. ``I just
felt like we had to score; we couldn't give them the ball back.''
</P>
<P>
   So on second-and-8, he had Chandler look for Mathis, who beat
rookie cornerback R.W. McQuarters. The end result -- a 78-yard
clincher -- has Atlanta thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   Only Minnesota (9-1) has a better record in the NFC, and Atlanta
has only one game remaining against a team with a winning record, a
home game on Dec. 27 against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, every game is extremely important,'' White said.
``It's not just about getting in the playoffs; it's about getting
homefield advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves likes his team's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gotten us into a position to where it's in our
control, but if we don't do the same things that we've done to this
point, we're setting ourselves up,'' he said. ``I'll go to war with
the men I've got . . . any time because they're going to give you
everything they've got.''

 &HT;    Stunting 49ers rush yards gives Falcons edge
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WHAT WENT RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were dominant on both lines of scrimmage, running
for 114 yards and limiting the 49ers to 76 yards rushing. Although
Atlanta averaged just 3.2 yards per rush, Jamal Anderson had enough
plus-yardage plays to provide first downs. Atlanta had the edge in
time of possession (34:30 to 25:30) for the eighth time this year _
and has won all eight. The defense gave up three big pass plays (42
yards in the third quarter, and touchdown receptions of 54 and 65
yards in the fourth quarter), but made more than enough big plays
to win. Atlanta sacked 49ers quarterback Steve Young four times,
once causing a fumble that linebacker Jessie Tuggle recovered for a
touchdown _ tying the franchise record (1991) for five defensive
scores in a season. Also, cornerback Ray Buchanan's third-quarter
interception set up a touchdown. The secondary did a better job
than in the first matchup by not giving San Francisco receivers
room over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT WENT WRONG
</P>
<P>
   The three big pass plays made it scary in a game that shouldn't
have been. ... Atlanta finally took advantage of 49ers rookie
corner R.W. McQuarters when Terance Mathis scored on a 78-yard pass
with 2:51 left. Why not pick on the guy sooner?
</P>
<P>
   FLYING HIGH
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan spent more than half the game covering Jerry Rice,
especially in the first half when Atlanta played mostly man-to-man.
Although Rice finished with 10 catches for 169 yards and a
touchdown (his 29th against Atlanta), few of the big plays came
when Buchanan was covering him. ... Anderson had 100 yards and two
touchdowns on 31 carries, the seventh time in eight games he's had
100 or more. Anderson has a career-high 11 touchdowns, 10 rushing.
... Tight ends O.J. Santiago and Brian Kozlowski and fullback Bob
Christian did an outstanding job blocking on running plays. All
three were involved in both Anderson's scoring plays. ... Christian
was excellent as a receiver, too, catching four passes for 48
yards. Sometimes, he and Anderson were split wide. ... Punter Dan
Stryzinski (five punts, 42.4 yards) averaged better than 40 yards a
kick for the fifth straight game. Four of his punts were returned,
but for minus-3 yards. ... Linebacker Craig Sauer was a demon on
special teams, with four tackles. ... Defensive tackle Shane
Dronett tied Tuggle for the team lead with six tackles. He also had
1.5 sacks and forced the Young fumble that Tuggle recovered for a
score. ... Tuggle has five fumble recoveries for TDs in his 12-year
career, an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING LOW
</P>
<P>
   Rookie corner Elijah Williams, who earlier this season gave up
touchdown catches of 39 and 82 yards, got beat while in the
``dime'' defense by wide receiver Mark Harris for a 42-yard pass in
the third quarter. ... SS William White bit on a Rice fake in the
fourth quarter, and the Niners ended up with a 65-yard TD play.
</P>
<P>
   BEST HIT
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Dronett dropped into pass coverage on
a zone blitz, and when Young threw, Dronett drilled Rice as the
ball arrived, knocking it loose and sending Rice to the turf in a
heap.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's interception and 34-yard return to the 49ers' 1 in
the third quarter was special, but the 78-yard touchdown pass from
Chandler to Mathis with 2:51 left in the game was the biggest play
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   WORST PLAY
</P>
<P>
   Rice's 65-yard scoring reception with 3:09 caught Atlanta
flat-footed. The Falcons were in base defense (a decision defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks said was dictated by the 49ers' personnel
of two backs, one tight end and two wide receivers). Rice was
released by the cornerback, and White ran straight to the sideline
as Rice streaked right past him. ``I blew it,'' White said. ``I was
supposed to roll over the top, and I saw (Rice) slow down. I looked
back to see if there was a sack or something, and he took off. In
11 years (in the NFL), that was probably the worst play I've ever
had. That was bone-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   GOOD CALL
</P>
<P>
   The play to Mathis. Instead of trying to eat clock, the Falcons
went for the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   BAD CALL
</P>
<P>
   Facing third-and-6 from the Atlanta 43 in the middle of the
third quarter, Young threw down the left sideline for Rice, who
caught the ball for a apparent 38-yard gain to the Atlanta 5. But
after a lengthy conference, officials ruled pass interference on
both Rice and Buchanan, negating the play. It looked like the pass
play should have stood because contact was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF THE TIMES
</P>
<P>
   For a change, there were multiple signs and banners in the
Georgia Dome. They weren't very imaginative, though. One said ``90
No play in this Chucky's House,'' a reference to Falcons defensive
end Chuck Smith. ... Another: ``We be Jamin ... We hope you be
Jamin, too. Go Jamal (Anderson) 32.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco defensive end Chris Doleman, a former Falcons
('95-96) whose family still lives in Atlanta, left the Dome upon
learning that his mother, Mary, was taken from the stands to
Piedmont Hospital after experiencing chest pains and high blood
pressure. She was listed in stable condition, and will stay
overnight for observation. ... The Falcons deactivated running back
Harold Green, defensive tackle Shawn Swayda and cornerback Darren
Anderson before the game. Cornerback Ronnie Bradford (knee) dressed
out for the first time in three games, but didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons came out of Sunday's game healthier than any game in
recent memory; ankle sprains to RB Jamal Anderson, DE Lester
Archambeau and LB Craig Sauer were the only reported injuries. None
appear to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will try to hold on to sole possession of first in
the NFC West on Sunday, when the Chicago Bears visit Atlanta for
the first time since 1990. The series is tied 9-9, but the Bears
have won five straight, including a 6-0 victory in Chicago in 1993
in the teams' last meeting.

 &HT;    Crowd catches victory fever from Falcons' unexpected win
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That noise coming from the Georgia Dome Sunday was the
Falcons bandwagon fully packed and careening out of control.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three minutes left in the NFC West showdown and
with the 49ers closing, 24-19, Atlanta receiver Terence Mathis
raced past a falling San Francisco cornerback R.W. McQuarters for a
78-yard touchdown catch and a 31-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time all day, the believers may have outnumbered
the cynics. The sellout crowd nearly stretched the teflon roof with
its noisy appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this game, I was skeptical,'' Brince Woods said. ``I
thought they'd play well, but not like this. They may make the
Super Bowl now.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was sounding like a long-suffering Falcons follower.
``Actually, I just jumped on the bandwagon,'' said Woods, who was
wearing a Falcons cap. ``Nobody wants to root for a losing team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this,'' Reginald Carter said. ``San Francisco
hadn't been playing well, and this was a fantastic opportunity for
the Falcons. I think they've got a chance to go all the way. But to
be honest with you, I'm a Cowboys fan. This is my second-best
team.''
</P>
<P>
   A big crowd for the Falcons-Niners game is nothing new. Four
times this decade, Atlanta's division nemesis from the West Coast
has helped produce the biggest gate of the season for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's sellout was the home team's first since 1995, and a
city looking for something to cheer about, since the Braves' bust
in the National League championship series, was happy to learn it
had an NFL franchise, after all. This game was for first place, an
8-2 record and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Terry Gantt was among those getting his ticket
punched for the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Atlanta does,'' Gantt said. ``We get a winner and
we get interested. It's what happened with the Braves. Now, they're
an old story. This is the next new bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantt was happy to be one of the new passengers. ``It's my first
game this year,'' he admitted. He did it up right, tailgating
before the game on a metal bench outside the Dome with a number of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Some Falcons diehards got a fresh coat of paint for the
occasion. Craig Keith and Jim Ross each sported a silver face with
red goatee and black painted mask. ``Takes 20 minutes to create;
we're getting good at it,'' Keith said. ``And when you wash it off,
it takes the blackheads right off your face,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   They carried a hand-painted sign: ``Super Bowl Is For The
Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge crowds walked through the fan pavilion known as the Falcons
Nest outside the Dome, where children played games and adults
listened to music.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Karla Ward brought their banner to a contest that
was judged by a radio station giving away two trips to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers were getting $100 for end zone seats. One person, who,
who identified himself as Stan Ticket from Kansas City, stood near
Gate C and called out, ``need an end zone or a nosebleed single.''
He had sold $750 worth of tickets at the Georgia-Auburn game
Saturday night. ``But this place is too hot (with police),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want one ticket to see a little of the game; I've got
to catch a plane at 3:30,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hein, a 49ers fan living in Marietta, wasn't having the
time of her life celebrating a birthday at the game. ``I can't
believe,'' she said, ``how quickly the Falcons have gotten a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It only took 32 years.

 &HT;    Anderson meets challenge, giving Falcons breathing room
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hundred-yard games are becoming commonplace; franchise
records are starting to tumble, and he has been a centerpiece of
NFL coverage for the national media in the past week. So what was
Jamal Anderson's biggest concern as he prepared for Sunday's
showcase game against San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure my curls looked good,'' the Falcons'
running back joked as he patted his quaff. ``I couldn't let anybody
see me if my hair didn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for withering in the spotlight. On stage Sunday in the
Georgia Dome, Anderson failed to disappoint himself, teammates,
fans or the blur of family members who flew in from California to
attend the game. He rushed for 100 yards _ the seventh time in the
last eight weeks he has reached or achieved that mark _ and scored
two touchdowns for the third straight week in the Falcons' 31-19
victory against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation now where I expect this,'' said Anderson.
``You want to be one of the best players. You want to get
recognized. It was kind of a challenge for me this week (because of
the attention), but I just had to go out and do what I know Jamal
Anderson can do. Everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has rushed for 1,066 yards. His seven 100-yard games
are two short of the franchise record. He tied Gerald Riggs' club
record for the fastest to 1,000 yards, hitting it in the second
quarter of the 10th game. He also joined Riggs (1984-86) and
William Andrews (1979-81) as the only Falcons to rush for more than
1,000 yards in three straight seasons. He is on a pace to finish
with 1,706 yards, which would fall just short of Riggs' mark of
1,719.
</P>
<P>
   Success was not immediate against the 49ers. Anderson's
first-quarter fumble ended a scoring threat on the Falcons' second
possession, and after one quarter he had netted only 23 yards on
nine carries (2.3 average). But midway through the second, the
Falcons' offensive line started opening some holes, and Anderson
ran seven times in an 11-play drive, eventually scoring from 10
yards out to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got through the line and I saw (49ers free safety)
Merton Hanks standing there at the goal line waiting for me, I was
thinking, 'TD. TD. TD.' I mean, he didn't have a chance. I was
coming at full speed, 235 pounds. I had to score,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's 2-yard plunge early in the fourth quarter gave the
Falcons some breathing room at 17-6.

 &HT;    Mathis slays monster with one big blow
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 49er killer _ ``You mean the 40-Monster killer,''
he corrects _ had been laying in the weeds all day. This is
especially difficult on artificial turf, but Terance Mathis is
nothing if not wiley.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-minute receiver had nary a catch for the first 56:57 of
Sunday's engagement with San Francisco. And the monster was
stirring. Jerry Rice had outflanked the Atlanta secondary again,
running free for a 65-yard touchdown reception that brought the
49ers back to within five.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis will do the grunt work required in Dan Reeves's
Protestant gameplan. And his teammates were being nicely
supportive. ``Just keep blocking, keep blocking,'' linebacker and
foreshadower Cornelius Bennett had told Mathis at the half.
``You'll catch one pass and it will be for a touchdown, and it will
be the winning touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was getting a little ridiculous for a leading
receiver such as himself. ``I was saying that I can't get shutout
in this game. That was on my mind,'' Mathis admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, because under the new rules of Falcons football,
all concerns are met, all prayers are answered.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was hatched to let Mathis do something with San Fran
rookie cornerback R.W. McQuarters. Better get him while he's still
green. As soon as McQuarters came up for some intensely personal
bump-and-run, the big-play machinery went into motion. Mathis would
take his route down the left sideline, and the Falcons would go for
it all. ``Why not take a shot? He was pressed with a rookie. I felt
pretty good about it,'' said quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis streaked, Chander delivered and 78 yards later the
Falcons had themselves a touchdown and a victory worth display in
their very small Hall of Precious Memories. Actually, it's more an
efficiency apartment, but the team may be outgrowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was the final stake driven into the heart of the team known
to Mathis as the 40-Monsters.
</P>
<P>
   Other images came to mind. That of a tired, aging king swept out
by an ambitious heir. Or of the long-time bully getting his
backside booted by the kid with skinny arms and bad skin.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare afternoon when Atlanta resembled a true NFL town, one
of its truest NFL players made a difference. Maybe the Falcons
haven't beaten San Francisco enough to have an official 49er
killer. But Mathis is close enough for our purposes. The two
longest receptions of his career (81 yards and Sunday's 78), and
three of his five longest, have come off the 'Niners. Three years
ago, Mathis willed himself into the end zone to beat San Francisco
at season's end to qualify the Falcons for the playoffs. That one
allowed a flighty team one more game. This one hinted at a more
permanent shift in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I had been saying all along, it (the 49ers dominance) has
to stop. Today, it stopped,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling that the Falcons won the day with the big play
instead of with caution. Not enough to bleed the clock against the
49ers. Got to make them bleed as well. It's a message that plays
well with the long-suffering. Said Jessie Tuggle, the longest
sufferer, ``That play set the tempo. It said we're not going to try
to sit on leads. We're going to try to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsters are not timidly slain.

 &HT;    It's `Dirty Bird' dancing at 1st &AMP; 10 bar
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Edward Smith and Morris Wyatt drink beer and eat wings
at 1st &AMP; 10 Sports &AMP; Wings on Old National Highway almost every
Sunday they're not in the Georgia Dome to see the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in three seasons, neither paid to see the
Falcons at home. They watched the Falcons-49ers on the big screen
at their favorite pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it's hard to sell out 70,000,'' Wyatt said.
``Some stadiums have a capacity of 52,000. If we have 52,000 we
can't see it. We're penalized 'cause we have a big stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Sunday. The NFL's local blackout rule was lifted because the
Georgia Dome was filled to capacity for the first time since a
28-13 loss to Dallas on Oct. 29, 1995. Bobby Ruff had a simple
answer to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Dan) Reeves said we don't support them. Now he's got to
put up or shut up,'' Ruff said. ``People don't show up till you
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Falcons are winning, and it was evident that this was
no ordinary afternoon at 1st &AMP; 10.
</P>
<P>
   While people in Pittsburgh Steelers jerseys and Dallas Cowboys
sweatshirts were in large numbers, as usual, there arguably were
more Falcons fans at the small sports bar, owned by former NFL and
Georgia Tech cornerback Najee Mustafaa.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening kickoff, 1st &AMP; 10 waitress Karen Tann blew her
whistle and yelled, ``Crank it up. Time for the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   After every big play, her whistle triggered Falcons fans to
their feet. Some did weak renditions of ``The Dirty Bird'' dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they're bandwagon or closet fans. This feels
good,'' Smith said after Ray Buchanan's third-quarter interception.
``It's 72,000 fans in the Georgia Dome, and we're probably making
more noise right now. It's been like this before, but not from
Atlanta fans.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jamal Anderson gave Atlanta a 17-6 lead, the attention fell
on regular Kecia Lyman. Fans surrounding the bar began yelling,
``Take it off! Take it off!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it wasn't that kind of party. She was one of handful of
people with audacity to wear a 49ers T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sports fanatic. I love a challenge,'' said Lyman, who
attended Mississippi Valley State with 49ers receiver Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   One customer got in a heated argument with an adamant Falcons
detractor. ``Big man,'' he yelled. ``Big man! We're used to losing.
We're for real this year.''
</P>
<P>
   A round of high-fives followed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Falcons grasping a huge fourth-quarter lead, Smith
paced and grinned. ``The next best thing to being there is being
here,'' he said.

 &HT;    Buchanan's big play gives him, fellow Falcons reason to crow
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although he was tackled on his interception return 1
yard from the end zone, Ray Buchanan felt the ``biggest play of the
game'' (he won the vote, 1-0) was worthy of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That right there _ that was the bird,'' said Buchanan, the
Falcons' cornerback, of his post-interception rumba. ``Everybody
has their own bird. We saw a crow out there today. I even saw a
drunk ostrich.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' defense surrendered 307 net passing yards Sunday
against San Francisco, but it had reason to, well, crow. A San
Francisco offense that typically has shredded Atlanta coverage was
limited to two field goals until two busted coverages in the fourth
quarter provided some momentary suspense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that happens every game,'' said safety Eugene
Robinson. ``We have those lapses that lets the other team get one
or two plays. That's something you can't let happen when you get
into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's a switch: the Falcons showing concern about
defects before the postseason. But with an 8-2 record, the focus
should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I was going to be around here for this,''
linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ``But I'm here and I'm enjoying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the Falcons' defense was to pressure quarterback
Steve Young, who is still ailing from a strained muscle near his
groin, be physical with San Francisco receivers, and if at all
possible, not let Jerry Rice turn 5-yard slants into a 55-yard
gains. With the exception of two fourth-quarter scores by Terrell
Owens (54 yards, blown coverage by Randy Fuller) and Rice (65
yards, the fault of safety William White), the Niners' appeared to
be a frustrated lot.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said, ``I don't think
we saw a healthy Steve Young today,'' but he wasn't weeping.
Several Atlanta defenders remarked that Young seemed to shy away
from throwing back across his body because of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Young looked anemic on Buchanan's interception, which came late
in the third quarter. With the Falcons leading 10-6, Young blooped
a pass intended for tight end Greg Clark, but Buchanan leaped it
front for the interception and headed back up field. Just before
being tackled at the 1-yard-line, he turned to look for a teammate
to lateral to, then thought better of it. (Brooks: ``I damned near
jumped out of the pressbox.'') Buchanan then broke into his dance,
leaving Jamal Anderson to score _ and dance _ seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   On San Francisco's ensuing drive, the defense struck again when
Young was sacked by Shane Dronett and fumbled, and linebacker
Jessie Tuggle fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown and
a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he's certain Young, Rice and other 49ers came into
the Georgia Dome thinking they would be able to roll up points with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course _ they've been doing it,'' he said. ``History has
shown they've beaten down the Falcons. That's how they get their
stats. That's how they get in the Pro Bowl a lot of the times,
because of how they play against the Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.

 &HT;    Calling Falcons defense? It's busy
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the past, the Falcons defense served as a mere prop
in San Francisco's offensive onslaughts. Big plays by the 49ers
usually left the Falcons' heads spinning and shaking in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reversal of sorts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two minutes spanning the third and fourth quarters,
the Falcons defense turned a four-point game into a 24-6 cushion
that proved significant in a benchmark victory over the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you score some touchdowns by the defense,'' coach Dan
Reeves said, ``you usually don't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you win.
</P>
<P>
   And the Falcons catapulted to the top of the NFC West when the
defense got busy. First, cornerback Ray Buchanan, whose nickname is
``Big Play,'' intercepted a Steve Young pass and made an exciting
34-yard return to the San Francisco 1-yard line with 28 seconds
left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge play,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, at the start of the fourth quarter, Jamal
Anderson plunged in for a touchdown and a 17-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, defensive tackle Shane Dronett sacked
Young and forced a fumble that was recovered by Jessie Tuggle, who
rolled into the end zone for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them know they were going to be in for a dogfight,''
Dronett said. ``I came out of a double team, and Young rolled my
way. He squared to throw, and I got a pretty good lick on him.
Jessie did the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle's score established an NFL record of five career
touchdowns on fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have come at a better time,'' he said. ``I'm
pretty proud of myself and the whole unit. We mixed up defenses and
we rallied to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And most important _ against a team that usually makes big
plays on us _ we made big plays on them. And it feels great.

CLINTON SAYS IRAQ BACKED DOWN AND MUST KEEP ITS WORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Sunday that President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq had unconditionally retreated and once again had
vowed complete cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. That vow
will be tested quickly, Clinton said, and U.S. and British forces
that nearly struck Iraq on Saturday will remain poised to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough,'' Clinton said
in a brief White House appearance before reporters on Sunday. ``Now
Iraq must live up to its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called more directly than ever before for the
overthrow of Saddam, calling him ``an impediment to the well-being
of his people and a threat to the peace of his region and the
security of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of seven years of confrontation with Iraq
over weapons inspections, senior U.S. officials struggled to
explain why Clinton found acceptable on Sunday what his national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, said was unacceptable on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Iraqis had clarified their position overnight in
two letters that eliminated all unacceptable conditions. The
administration regards those letters as binding on Baghdad,
officials said, despite comments on Sunday by Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz that seemed to cast doubt on their authority.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the officials said, Iraq had now agreed to hand
over to the weapons inspectors two sensitive documents on its
chemical and biological weapons programs and promised the
inspectors full and unfettered access to all sites _ including
those the Americans deemed too controversial to risk last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. weapons inspection regime, called UNSCOM, has been
stymied for the last year, the officials said. But they insisted
that Saddam's retreat now had ``opened a window of effectiveness
for UNSCOM that we want to use as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected U.N. inspectors to return to Iraq in
about two days with a specific list of documents they want to see
and sensitive sites they want to inspect, together with the
personnel and the equipment to do it. At least some of those sites
were at the center of a dispute with Saddam this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the those documents, dealing with Iraq's chemical-weapons
program, was found at the Iraqi air force headquarters but was
seized from UNSCOM by Iraqi authorities; the other document,
dealing with Iraq's biological weapons program, the U.N. inspectors
know about but have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Iraqis resist inspection efforts now, the officials said,
the U.S. and British military are prepared to attack. But the
officials acknowledged that military action would be impossible so
long as officials of the inspection team and the other nations on
the Security Council believe they are getting adequate cooperation
from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to contain Iraq, economic sanctions are only
helped by a functioning inspection program, one senior official of
a NATO country said. ``For nearly two years, UNSCOM has been pushed
backward and for the last year, its performance has been next to
useless,'' the official said. ``But we now have an opportunity to
get UNSCOM back to a satisfactory level of performance, and UNSCOM
has the greatest possible leverage just now to inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said: ``UNSCOM should feel pretty good,
because they're now in a stronger position than they've been in a
long time. It's much harder for Saddam to wriggle around now about
what compliance means. The spotlight is on Saddam, where it
belongs, and not on UNSCOM. And Iraqi obstruction will be clear and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true for only a limited time, another official
conceded. ``Sure, there's a window for UNSCOM to be effective
now,'' the official said. ``But Saddam will shut that window as
soon as he thinks he can, and then we're back just about where we
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official said, ``Saddam can be in no doubt that we
intended to use force, because it was on its way. That makes the
threat of force pretty credible again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Washington also vowed that force would be used
against Iraq if Saddam broke his promises to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that he would guarantee complete access for UNSCOM. But
that threat proved hollow, paving the way for this latest chapter
in the ongoing effort to get Iraq to disarm against its will.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton called the return of the weapons inspectors
``the best outcome, because they have been and they remain the most
effective tool to uncover, destroy and prevent Iraq from rebuilding
its weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listed five benchmarks to judge Saddam's compliance:
Iraq must allow inspectors ``unfettered access'' to all sites they
choose to see, ``with no restrictions or qualifications''; it must
turn over all relevant documents on the production of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them;
it must not interfere with the inspectors themselves or question
their independence or professional expertise _ for example, by
dictating the composition of UNSCOM teams; it must ``resolve all
outstanding issues raised'' by the weapons inspectors; and it must
accept all the relevant U.N. resolutions regarding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and the British had authorized the use of force
against Iraq to break out of the cycle of Iraqi defiance and
retreat, the officials acknowledged. But they also said Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain decided it would be immoral to
continue with an attack once there were serious signs of an Iraqi
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's diplomatic initiative came as B-52 bombers loaded with
cruise missiles were airborne. There was no indication that the
specific decision to use force on Saturday _ made by Clinton on
Friday night and by Blair on Saturday morning _ was leaked to Iraq,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision at about 8 a.m. on Saturday to call off the
air strikes actually postponed them for 24 hours, officials said
Sunday. At 3:30 a.m. Sunday, after clarifications from Iraq,
Clinton decided that Washington ``would take `yes' for an answer''
and called off the bombing again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair spoke eight times on Saturday, officials said;
British pilots were to be responsible for 20 percent of the targets
to be hit by manned airplanes, as opposed to cruise missiles, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance
is guaranteed and delivered,'' Blair said Sunday morning in London.
If Iraq violates its new pledges, he said, there will be air
strikes, and ``there will be no warning whatsoever.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said in an interview that
if Saddam interferes again with UNSCOM, ``our forces are there and
we've shown we're ready to use them.'' What has been gained now,
Bacon said, ``is the chance to have a more effective inspections
regime'' and a clear ``capitulation'' from Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's two goals are to end the sanctions and the inspections,
in order to keep his weapons of mass destruction, Bacon said.
``What he's left with this time is an international community more
united behind his need to meet U.N. resolutions before sanctions
are lifted, and a commitment to hand over documents he's been
refusing to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort to keep the spotlight on Saddam's defiance and
not on the inspection team's methods led to decisions last summer
that proved extremely controversial and led to the resignation of a
highly regarded U.S. inspector, Scott Ritter. Ritter charged that
Washington had discouraged the commission's chairman, Richard
Butler, from confrontational surprise inspections, because it did
not want a new crisis with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials say the charge is unfair, because the
policy was designed to avoid the expulsion of UNSCOM and a military
confrontation on Saddam's timing and terms, when there was no unity
in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Security Council is firmly behind the
inspectors' right to complete access to all sites, the officials
argue, those very inspections should be carried out as soon as
possible, to test Saddam's compliance while military force remains
on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law of the land was to avoid unnecessary confrontation
last summer, it's to press ahead right now,'' one official said.
``The point is to put Saddam on the spot, not UNSCOM, and I'm sorry
Ritter didn't understand that, because we could use him now. We
always preferred to have sanctions plus UNSCOM, so long as UNSCOM
is useful, and UNSCOM has a chance to be more useful than before.''

J.C. WATTS, RISING GOP STAR, HAS HAD HIS DIFFICULTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (Eds: spelling and grammar in conversations are CQ, as per FBI
transcripts.) 
(mk) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ In Washington political circles, Rep. J.C. Watts
Jr., R-Okla., is considered one of the Republican Party's brightest
stars, a leading voice for conservative principles and, more
recently, a candidate for congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But a broader picture emerges from a look at Watts' career back
home, where despite his popularity, the former star college
quarterback has had to defend himself over the years against
accusations arising from bad debts, unpaid state and federal taxes,
and his actions during a federal bribery investigation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Watts was heard on a federal wiretap arranging to
pick up $1,500 from a lobbyist for telephone companies that stood
to lose $16 million a year in a case before a state regulatory
agency of which Watts was a member.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was never charged with a crime, but portions of the
transcript of this conversation have been used by his political
opponents in an effort to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   While the details of Watts' troubles have not become widely
known nationally, they have been explored by newspapers, and radio
and television stations in Oklahoma. This year, Watts' Democratic
opponent, Bruce Ober, put the transcript of the FBI tapes on his
Internet campaign site.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who is challenging Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, for his
post as Republican Conference Chairman, says that he has made no
secret of his financial problems, which arose when the oil and gas
business in Oklahoma went bust in the mid-1980s. And while he has
acknowledged that his name came up in the FBI investigation, he has
often noted that he was fully exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   The voters in the 4th Congressional District have continued to
support him. Watts was easily re-elected earlier this month,
winning a majority of votes in each of the 11 counties in the
conservative and traditionally Democratic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extraordinarily gifted,'' Tom Cole, the Oklahoma
secretary of state and the state's leading Republican strategist,
said of Watts, who became a hero to football fans when, as a
quarterback, he led the Sooners of the University of Oklahoma to an
Orange Bowl victory in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best pure communicator I've ever seen,'' said Cole,
who helped Watts get started in politics. ``He not only gives a
great speech, he's got charisma. He lights up a room. He has a star
quality that transcends having been a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, 40, was first elected to Congress, where he is the only
black Republican, in 1994 and quickly became a darling of
conservative members of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my wildest imagination,'' he said in a keynote speech to
the Republican National Convention in 1996 that cemented his
reputation as a rising star, ``I never thought that the fifth of
six children born to Helen and Buddy Watts _ in a poor black
neighborhood, in the rural community of Eufaula, Okla. _ would
someday be called congressman.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of Watts' finances emerged from an examination of
public records, interviews with public officials and a lengthy
interview on Friday with Watts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, two properties owned by Watts were foreclosed on
and sold at sheriff's sales, and he was pursued for debts ranging
from a doctor's bill to a $25,000 loan for oil and gas investments.
Asked about these debts, all of which have been paid, Watts said:
``Guilty as charged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early to mid-'80s the oil business went bust,'' he
said. ``I don't think that there was anybody in the oil and gas
business that didn't get bloodied up. When I ran for office in
1990, I never claimed to have no financial problems. I thought I
was doing the honorable thing, working through things, not
declaring bankruptcy. Now, 10 years later, it's an issue.'' In
November 1990, Watts was elected to the Corporation Commission,
which regulates Oklahoma's utilities and oil and gas industries,
unaware that a federal bribery investigation was under way at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after he took office, Watts was named as one of 10
possible defendants in the Justice Department's request for a
wiretap in connection with the investigation, federal court records
show. Others named in the request included William Anderson, a
lobbyist and lawyer for utility companies who was later sent to
prison for bribery, and Robert Hopkins, a commissioner later
convicted of accepting a $10,000 bribe from Anderson in a $30
million telephone rate case involving Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   It is legal in Oklahoma for commissioners to seek campaign
contributions from lawyers or officials of utilities they regulate
in a period from 120 days before the election to 120 days after.
All contributions over $200 must be reported, and they cannot be
linked to cases the commissioners are deciding.
</P>
<P>
   Watts told federal investigators that he asked Anderson to help
him raise money for his campaign and that Anderson gave him
contributions of $200 or less from some of the small, independent
telephone companies Anderson represented. Watts told the
investigators that Anderson never tried to influence him on behalf
of his clients in return for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But two FBI wiretaps appear to tell a different story. On Feb.
24, 1991, Watts, who was in Washington, called Anderson at home.
Watts reminded the lobbyist several times that the deadline for
campaign contributions was March 6.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the independent telephone companies represented by
Anderson stood to lose $16 million a year in a case before the
commission. Southwestern Bell was challenging a requirement that
income from in-state toll calls be pooled and divided among all the
telephone companies operating in the state. The small companies
received far more from the pool than they contributed.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript of the conversation shows Watts pushed for a
contribution, and Anderson asked for his help. Anderson asked Watts
if he could delay action on the pooled tolls, while the small
companies tried to work things out, ``'cause if you don't, it's
gonna hurt ever' damn one of us. J.C.?''
</P>
<P>
   Watts replied: ``Yeah. That's true.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said: ``Well ... hey, I've worked, I'm, I've had some, uh,
a couple of folks that said they were gonna try to, try to help us,
uh, for that March 6th date, so, uh, whatever you could do for me
before then I sure appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: ``OK I'll get, I'll get back on it there, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts: ``Yeah, 'cause after March 6th I'm gonna close the door
and ...'' Later in the conversation, Anderson said: ``And if you
could think about not forcing them out of that toll pool. It'd
break ever' damned inde, every little, every little telephone
company and little towns in the state right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Watts said: ``I'm not promising one way or the other ...
I'll be fair and open.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also recorded a conversation on March 1, a day after
Watts returned from Washington. Watts called Anderson, who told him
he had $500 from each of three independent telephone companies,
explaining, ``I got ahold of Chickasaw and Alltel over at, uh,
Poteau and old boy at Oklahoma Communications out here at Choctaw
service I know, and they got the five piece for.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts: ``Yeah, OK. All right.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: ``And it's just in cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts suggested they meet that day and Anderson started to give
Watts directions to his house. When Watts hesitated, explaining
that state Rep. Kevin Cox was with him and he planned to drive Cox
home, Anderson said: ``And hell, I'll just, uh, if he's with you,
you just come to the door and I'll just hand you the thing and
Kevin needn't know what you came for.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson continued: ``I'll be the third house on the left, and
I'll have the front door open and, and uh, I'll just hand you the
cash. Kevin needn't know. You, just tell him you need to come by
and get a message from me or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents later told Watts they saw him come to Anderson's
house that day. Watts told the FBI he could not remember either the
conversation or picking up $1,500. He said Cox had reminded him
they once stopped at Anderson's house so Watts could pick up a
regulatory manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the umpteenth time,'' Watts said on Friday: ``Every dime I
received, thousands of dollars in contributions, went into the
campaign. I cannot identify any single contribution. The FBI looked
at everything and found nothing illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson and Hopkins were indicted, Watts said, he
complained to the prosecutors because his name kept appearing in
news reports. ``I said, `I feel like I'm being hung out to dry
here,''' he recalled. ``I felt I needed something to clear my
name.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 7, 1994, Gary Richardson, a former federal prosecutor in
Tulsa and a friend of Watts, asked the federal prosecutors to issue
a news release on Watts' status.
</P>
<P>
   A reply came in a letter written by John Green, the first
assistant U.S. attorney, on official stationery from the U.S.
attorney, Vicki Miles-LaGrange. Green wrote: ``Commissioner Watts
has been a friend of both Vicki Miles-LaGrange and myself for a
number of years, my friendship going back to his days as a freshman
quarterback at the University of Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter continued: ``We consider him our friend and would do
anything within possible bounds (we have told him how to handle the
situation), to relieve whatever cast of doubt, suspicion and morale
problems that might exist at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission
over any alleged investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Green wrote that his office could not assure anyone that no
federal agency was investigating Watts, but ``at this point we do
not know of any type of investigation concerning any present or
former Corporation Commissioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts read the letter to reporters at a February 1994 news
conference, saying the cloud of controversy was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not involved in any wrongdoing, nor had I ever been a
target of their investigation,'' he said at the time. ``The fact
they had me under observation in early March 1991 was a result of
the institution, the Corporation Commission, being investigated,
not me.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, at the request of Ms. Miles-LaGrange, the
entire U.S. attorney's office in Oklahoma City was removed from the
case by the Justice Department. Carl Stern, the Justice Department
spokesman, said: ``There was a concern that the public would not
have confidence in the U.S. attorney's office's impartiality.''
</P>
<P>
   The bribery investigation was not the only time Watts had to
deal with unfavorable publicity. Earlier financial problems, which
dated back to his days as a player in the Canadian Football League,
also made their way into the news.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a newspaper, the Tulsa World, reported that Watts had a
history of bad debts and said the state had filed three tax liens
against him, for income taxes in 1983, 1984 and 1986. Watts said at
the time that he was working to pay those taxes and attributed them
his delay to misunderstandings and a downturn in the oil business
in Oklahoma. Watts was also late in paying his 1992, 1993 and 1994
real estate taxes, records show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he did not declare the $14,320 his wife earned as an
in-home nurse and $2,511 from an annuity on his federal income tax
return, tax records shows. ``It is simply an oversight,'' Rick
Buchanan, Watts' press secretary, said when the Watts campaign
released his tax returns in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters had seen everything they could possibly see,''
Watts said on Friday. His opponents, he said, have ``tried to put
oxygen on a dead issue.''

IRAQ'S MOVE FROM BRINK IS GREETED WITH RELIEF IN ARAB WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related: IRAQ-RDP, IRAQ-ASSESS, IRAQ-U.N., IRAQ-SADDAM,
IRAQ-U.S.-SOLDIERS) 
(sw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Iraq had found few Arab friends in its latest
showdown with the United Nations, but its shift away from
confrontation was greeted in the Arab world on Sunday with swift
statements of relief that could complicate American efforts to
maintain military pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of Arab support had shown just how isolated the Iraqi
leader, Saddam Hussein, had become among his neighbors. Just three
days earlier, Egypt, Syria and six Arab Persian Gulf countries
declared that he alone would bear the blame for whatever his
defiance provoked.
</P>
<P>
   But by Sunday morning, despite the Clinton administration's
initial rejection of Iraq's promise to resume cooperation with the
United Nations, some of those same countries had proclaimed the
standoff essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi decision is good news for the Arab nation and all
the gulf states, the United Arab Emirates foreign minister, Rashed
Abdullah al-Nuaimi, said at a meeting of Persian Gulf leaders in
Abu Dhabi, the capital. ``Now the region can once again live in
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said: ``Now we are
not talking about military strikes. We are talking about an
exchange of views and letters and commitments. So we must give this
process a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Saudi defense minister, Prince Sultan, was quoted as
saying that his country would not permit American warplanes based
in the kingdom to be used to attack Iraq _ a resurrection of a
stance that has limited American military options in the past.
</P>
<P>
   One dominant view was typified by an editorial on Sunday morning
in Asharq, a Qatari newspaper. It said the Iraqi initiative would
``spare the children of Iraq more disasters, and at the same time
preserve the stability and security of the region and eliminate the
pretext for the foreign military presence.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous crises, it has been notable in the last
week that Iraq's defiance of U.N. resolutions did not draw
mediation by any Arab leader. That angered Iraq, which had appealed
for Arab solidarity. In the letter on Saturday that spelled out the
Iraqi initiative, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz thanked Russia,
China and France for their support, but he pointedly did not
mention a single Arab country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sunday's statements hint that the United States could be
back in the situation it faced last November, and again in
February, when it could muster little Arab support for threats of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days ago, I think it was safe to say that if the Arab
states were not fully on board with an attack against Iraq, they
were not going to stand in the way,'' a Western diplomat in the
region, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on Sunday.
``Now it would take a lot of new convincing to get them back where
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the diplomats said, the danger of an Arab
popular backlash against American military moves would almost
certainly increase if the United States was seen as using force
against a country that had promised to cooperate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Egypt's top cleric, Sheik Mohammed Seyyed Tantawi, provided a
hint of that mood in a sermon Friday in Al Azhar Mosque in Cairo,
He called on Muslims around the world to ``support our Iraqi
brothers against American aggression with all our ability _ by arms
if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, few Arab political leaders
have issued that kind of call. The invasion prompted Egypt, Syria
and other Arab countries to take the extraordinary step of joining
in the American-led coalition against a fellow Arab country. In the
years since, though, there has been mounting popular resentment
toward what has been widely seen as American callousness about
Iraqi lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the current crisis, the opposition to using force appeared to
have been diminished by two factors. Saddam was widely seen as
having overreached, angering Arab leaders who had put their
credibility on the line only nine months earlier by endorsing his
pledge of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   And Iraq's latest defiance came as Arab leaders had begun to
look more favorably on American policy as a whole because of
President Clinton's success in hammering out last month's agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, some Arab commentators resorted to
undisguised sarcasm last week in mocking Iraq's pleas for Arab
support. But by Sunday morning, most newspapers in region were
adopting a more familiar tone.

SURVIVORS MAKE THE CASE AGAINST DEATH ROW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla., N.Y., Ala.)   (jw) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the 22 years since the nation resumed executions,
the anti-death penalty movement has been battered, bloodied and
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show strong support for capital punishment.
Democratic and Republican candidates from the city council to the
White House argue about who supports it more, and the march to the
death chamber continues to pick up speed.
</P>
<P>
   But on the edge of Lake Michigan during the weekend, death
penalty opponents mounted a public relations counterattack,
bringing together for the first time 28 of the 73 men and two women
released from death rows across the country since 1972, usually
after many years, for crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilling flesh and blood reminder of the greatest fear
of opponents and supporters of the death penalty _ the execution of
the innocent.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the black artist and the white yoga teacher and the
Hispanic man who wants to be a lawyer marched across a stage at the
Northwestern University School of Law here on Saturday and
introduced themselves as death row survivors. Then they sat
together in what one of them called ``a living graveyard'' and one
of their lawyers, fighting back tears, called ``a stage of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Dennis Williams,'' the artist said. ``Had the state
of Illinois gotten its way, I'd be dead today.''
</P>
<P>
   For about every seven executions in the United States since
1976, one condemned inmate has been freed, like Williams, who
served 17 years on Illinois' death row; and like Walter McMillian,
who served six years in Alabama, and like Sonia Jacobs, who served
five years in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Each was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. And each
was eventually freed, largely based on the grounds of outright
evidence of innocence or other overwhelming doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are free today and not dead, supporters of the
death penalty say that they are living proof that the system works.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women released from death row say that they bear
living witness that the system can make dozens of deadly mistakes.
``Had the state gotten its way, I'd be dead today,'' floated
through the hall 28 times.
</P>
<P>
   The march of survivors was the emotional highlight of a
three-day national conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death
Penalty held at Northwestern and attended by more than 1,000
lawyers, law students, professors and death penalty opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to start a dialogue with the rest of the country,''
said Lawrence Marshall, the Northwestern University law professor
who organized the conference and helped get two of the men on the
stage off death row. ``We want to bring the faces of these
wrongfully convicted men and women who could be dead right now into
every village and hamlet in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference was part reunion, part strategy session and part
pep rally to energize a movement that silenced the nation's death
chambers for years in the late 1960s and much of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The death penalty has been abolished once before in this
country,'' said Robert Meeropol, executive director of the
Rosenberg Fund for Children, which is named after his parents,
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, executed in the 1950s on charges of
spying. ``The next time, we have to make sure that it stays
abolished for good.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also panel discussions about flawed forensics,
investigative techniques and DNA evidence. Barry Scheck, a
professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York and
co-director of the Innocence Project, which has used DNA evidence
to help free more than two dozen wrongfully convicted people, said
that after the conference he expected to see similar projects in
every state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get more people on the ground looking for
evidence,'' Scheck said, ``we can free a lot of innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panel focused on the effects of incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being wrongfully convicted and incarcerated is a huge
trauma,'' said John Wilson, a psychologist. and a pioneer in the
treatment of post traumatic shock in war veterans. ``Such
experiences rip these people forever. How do you give someone back
what they've lost after 5, 10, 15 years of wrongful imprisonment?''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Walter McMillian would like to know. After six
years on death row, he lost his logging business and his marriage.
Sonia Jacobs went to prison as a wife and a mother. When she got
out, she was a widow and a grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs served five years on death row in Florida after being
convicted of killing two policemen and 12 more years in the general
prison population before her conviction was overturned in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some people at the conference talked about changing the death
penalty to ensure that innocent people are not condemned to die.
But the overwhelming thrust of the weekend was the ultimate
abolition of the death penalty, and the wrongfully condemned people
_ the ``75 reasons to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Burrows, 45, is one of the reasons, but do not tell him
that he is alive today because the system worked.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reality is that the system almost killed him. The
reality is, the nightmares still come to get him like executioners
in the middle of the night. The reality is, he has trouble holding
a job and his three teen-age children refuse to listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they? he asks himself. He was not around when they
were growing up and needed him most. He was on death row in
Illinois, awaiting execution for a crime he did not commit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He says he will never be the same, that a big piece of Joe
Burrows, a house painter from small town Illinois, will always be a
dead man walking and ``that ain't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times while he was on the row, the state set a date to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   In his head, he knew he had plenty of appeals left and sooner or
later someone would just have to wake up and let him go home. In
his soul, each death date ate him up a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' he said, ``it affects you so bad that you're
not the same person no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lawson, 33, a self-professed former ``hustler'' from East
St. Louis, Ill., and Burrows were on the row together, with Rolando
Cruz from the Chicago suburbs. The three men, one white, one black
and one Hispanic, used to talk about their innocence and that
magical land called ``freedom,'' a place that Lawson said he had
despaired of ever seeing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time, I thought I was going to be executed,'' he
said. ``I thought about hanging myself. I thought about escaping.
But a lot of the time, I just wanted to get in a corner and get to
screaming and hollering.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, all three men sat on ``the stage of honor,'' alive
and free, death row far, far away _ and right around the corner.

COMMENTARY: DIDDLED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton left the White House briefing
room to escape questions, his national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, stepped up, fiddled with electric lectern switches and
muttered into a live microphone: ``How do we lower this damn
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, that summed up the Clinton administration's
half-measured approach to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. Its
limited aim is to lower temporarily Iraq's ability to make weapons
with which to blackmail the world.
</P>
<P>
   That desire for delay is why Clinton hesitated for months after
Iraq shut down inspections that were getting too close to finding
weapons. It's why he sought a last-minute negotiation, and why he
aborted air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   When Saddam's semiannual promise to permit ``unfettered''
inspections finally came, the U.S. president eagerly took yes for
an answer. His acceptance of the dictator's delaying tactic may
mean peace for his remaining time, though hardly peace for our
time.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to abort _ an unprecedented display of presidential
irresolution _ was consistent with what Clinton says is ``the best
outcome'': a new round of searches starting from scratch, now that
the Iraqis have had plenty of time to conceal anew their weapons
development.
</P>
<P>
   The central question remains: Is off-and-on inspecting the best
outcome? Consider what is likely to happen, based on what has gone
before. Saddam, having ``backed down'' yet again, will let the
inspectors go wherever they want for the next three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   That costs him nothing: Saddam has reshuffled the deck, as our
Scott Ritter puts it, and it will take at least that long for the
CIA's sources to suggest the new hiding places in a large country.
Meanwhile, Iraq's anthrax and nerve-gas stockpiling will proceed
apace, as replacement Russians and others on the U.N. inspection
team tip off the ex-spymaster Yevgeny Primakov to its plans,
thereby ensuring that no ``surprise'' inspections actually
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   American forces stay on alert and stick around the area until we
get tired and bored. When somebody suggests we charge the billions
this costs us against our U.N. arrears, home will come our sailors,
home from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Then, sometime next summer, under heat from Primakov &AMP; Co., the
United Nations' complaisant Kofi Annan will say: ``See? Nothing
really sensational has been found. Time to lift sanctions.'' Little
by little, in Saddam's inimitable style, the fetters of
inconvenience and slowly rising defiance will go back on the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we offend Moscow and Paris, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will again support Annan in resisting what he deplores as
``confrontational inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   What then? The Clinton White House would have us believe that as
soon as Saddam claps one little fetter on inspections, boom! _
without warning _ missiles will fly, Stealth aircraft will pose for
cameras and B-52s will smart-bomb until it's over over there.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't do that without withdrawing the inspectors and
evacuating diplomatic missions. Figure on plenty of warning _ time
for new non-negotiations at the last minute _ and another story of
Saddam ``backing down'' followed by the triumphant announcement of
the success of our resolve. One more such diplomatic victory, as
King Pyrrhus said, and we are undone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, next time, Saddam will take the week's bombing. The
loss of innocent life would not harm his regime, and what Clinton
calls the ``degrading'' of Iraqi weapon-making is in the eye of the
degrader. Contrary to Clinton's belief, the ``best outcome'' is not
the status quo; it is the removal of the growing threat.
</P>
<P>
   In pulling our bombing punch, the president offered the hope
that the Kurds under our protection may hook up with Iraqis we slip
money to and, listening avidly to our radio broadcasts, overthrow
Saddam. Worth trying, but quite a covert burden on a CIA otherwise
focused on diplomatic monitoring of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Come the unraveling of the latest agreement next year, we will
see if candidate George W. Bush shares the containment-only purpose
of his father and Clinton, or if Sens. McCain and Lugar can make
the case for dislodging Saddam before he can develop the terror
weapons he would surely use. The next president will have to
``lower this damn thing'' before it razes an American city.

ASIAN NATIONS ENDORSE LIMITED MEASURES TO OPEN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ After days of bitter negotiations that
degenerated into public name-calling, the United States and other
Asian and Pacific economies Sunday salvaged a compromise trade
liberalization deal that squelched Japanese efforts to protect
markets at a time of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit bemoaned the accord as a half-measure that
failed to live up to APEC's goals _ raising questions about the
ability of key nations to scuttle deals, and doubts about the
effectiveness of the self-styled free trade club.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, domestic political discord here in Malaysia
distracted from the economic agenda of the 21 governments. Police
Sunday arrested and fired tear gas at a few hundred demonstrators
demanding that their prime minister step down, and US Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright defied her hosts by meeting the wife of
a jailed government critic and engaging in a war of words over it
with a Malaysian Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   Officials tried, however, to keep the spotlight on an accord
worth $1.5 trillion in trade that may prove to be the key agreement
at this year's APEC summit. The hangup in the deal came when Japan,
Asia's largest economy, said it could not approve proposed tariff
cuts in forest and fish products, two industries that are key
supporters of Japan's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, 16 of APEC's 21 nations, including Japan, agreed to
keep the commitment to voluntary liberalization intact, but to
submit the plan to the World Trade Organization for negotiation and
approval by other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal covers fish, medical equipment, environmental goods and
services and energy sector goods and services, as well as
chemicals, forest products, gems and jewelry, toys and
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is eager to open markets to help halt the nose
dive in US exports to Asia, which have taken a beating since the
regional crisis began 17 months ago. The US trade deficit with Asia
is expected to balloon to $177 billion this year, up 30 percent
from last year. The downturn has cost America thousands of
manufacturing jobs, but resisting domestic pressure to protect
affected industries, the Clinton administration has tried to force
other countries to open markets and import more US goods.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the United States put the best possible face on the deal,
saying the free trade consensus among members, despite the
financial crisis that has slashed growth in several nations,
prevented Japan from reverting to protectionism or persuading its
neighbors to do the same. In that alone, US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said, APEC had achieved a victory and could now
be the catalyst for a broader effort to reduce tariffs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we had nothing, zero. Two days ago we thought there
was a very high degree of likelihood the whole thing would
collapse. Particularly given the financial situation of these
countries, it's remarkable this initiative has held together,'' she
said last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries could have used Japan's intransigence on
forests and fish to retreat. ... Instead, exactly the reverse
occurred,'' she said, praising Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines
and South Korea for expanding, rather than reducing, their offers
to cut trade barriers, despite Japanese pressure.
</P>
<P>
   APEC members ``decided that market opening is not the cause of
the crisis and was not going to become a victim of the crisis. It
was going to be used'' as a way out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Barshefsky had angrily accused Japan of offering
financial aid to countries willing to scrap the trade deal, and
Japan retorted that the United States was ``mean'' and saw the
world in ``an evil way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview last night, Japanese Trade and Industry
Minister Kaoru Yosano said domestic pressures had made it
impossible for him to secure tariff cuts in sensitive sectors, but
insisted Japan was trying its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government had been trying for a pretty long time
... to enable Japan to participate. ... However, our effort was not
quite in time for this meeting,'' he said, asserting that Japan
would support, not obstruct the deal at the trade organization.
``Don't confuse what's happening in APEC with what will happen in
WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky also acknowledged that with or without Japan's
cooperation, under US law, Washington could not implement tariff
cuts until a ``critical mass'' of countries worldwide have signed
on under the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the process to an information technology agreement
that APEC negotiated a few years ago, Barshefsky noted that only
eight APEC members initially signed onto that deal. But within
eight months of its being taken to the trade organization, 23
countries signed, and another 22 signed a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that positive spin, others expressed disappointment the
deal was not fully adopted Sunday by APEC nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada certainly would have preferred a quicker pace,'' said
Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi. ``Instead of plan A, we
opted for plan B _ to move the package entirely to WTO. ... Plan B
is not as good as plan A, but it's better than no plan at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lees, secretary general of the Pacific Basin Economic
Council, which represents 1,100 Pacific Rim corporations, last
night questioned APEC's credibility, given that it could not make
good on a pledge made a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose we should be happy. ... At least the process is
alive,'' he said. But ``it's an opportunity lost to APEC. ... Is it
a family of 21 economies? It's a shame we can't get an initiative
through that really delivers tangible results that APEC needs to
deliver to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics was also a point of conflict Sunday, when Albright was
forced to defend her decision to meet the wife of Anwar Ibrahim,
the Malaysian deputy prime minister who was fired and arrested on
charges of sodomy and abuse of power after clashing with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has made clear a number of times that Anwar
Ibrahim is a highly respected leader. We believe he is entitled to
due process and a fair trial,'' Albright said at a forum of Cabinet
ministers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure the international community that anybody in this
country will get a fair trial,'' Malaysian Trade Minister Rafidah
Aziz snapped back. ``Perhaps when I go to the US, I would like to
meet Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not in prison,'' a visibly angered Albright responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to find out what is happening _ curious,'' retorted
Rafidah.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin called the comparison
between Anwar and Starr ``pathetic. ... It says more about the
difference between them and us than anything else I've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir expressed dismay at President Clinton's decision not to
attend APEC because of the Iraqi crisis. ``If the US is not
represented at the highest level'' at APEC ``other countries will
have a bigger say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, sporadic protests that began after Anwar's ouster
continued, with about 200 demonstrators calling for Mahathir to
step down. Police sprayed them with water, tear gas, and dye, and
according to the Bloomberg news service made seven arrests.

TRIAL WILL TEST CHINA'S GRIP ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The trial of a 30-year-old computer executive, soon to
begin in Shanghai, heralds a new electronic battleground for
China's political dissidents and security forces determined to
preserve Communist Party control.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Hai, the defendant, is charged with ``inciting subversion of
state power.'' Prosecutors say that from September 1997 until his
arrest in March, Lin gave tens of thousands of Chinese e-mail
addresses to ``hostile foreign publications.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they say, he provided addresses to an electronic
newsletter called VIP Reference, which is compiled by Chinese
democracy advocates in Washington and sent to hundreds of thousands
of computer-users inside China. According to the indictment, Lin
helped the newsletter ``carry out propaganda and incitement by
distributing essays inciting subversion of state power and
overthrow of the socialist system.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin appears to be the first legal casualty of a building
struggle, as Internet users here and abroad make shreds of the
government's efforts to censor political debate and filter foreign
news. VIP Reference _ which sends out reports on dissident
activities, essays and reprinted articles on human rights and other
issues _ is the most prominent of several electronic forums that
are breaching China's information defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're promoting freedom of speech on the Internet,'' said Feng
Donghai, a software engineer at Columbia University who moved to
the United States three years ago and helped start VIP Reference
last fall. ``They are putting Lin Hai on trial to set an example.''
</P>
<P>
   The main VIP Reference, sent out every 10 days, mostly includes
essays and debates on democratic topics. A subsidiary Daily News
edition, sent daily, includes detailed accounts of dissident
initiatives and arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The main newsletter is now sent to more than 250,000 addresses
in China, said its publisher, Lian Shengde, who spoke from
Washington. The Daily News edition goes to about 25,000, and the
numbers are steadily climbing as sympathizers send in lists of
Chinese addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter accepts addresses indiscriminately _ many are
from commercially traded lists _ then mails to everyone. The theory
is that when so many are automatic recipients, individuals cannot
be accused of deliberately subscribing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're posing a new problem for the Communists,'' said Lian, a
software engineer in his 30s who moved from China after the 1989
military crackdown on student-led demonstrators in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square. ``I don't think there's any way they can stop
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, similar publication is Tunnel, a self-described
``webzine'' of commentary written in China and sent electronically
to the United States from where it is wired back to thousands of
accounts inside China.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, which require Chinese-script software, are at
www.ifcss.org/ftp-pub/org/dck for VIP Reference and
www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/5598 for Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   A third newsletter, Public Opinion, is edited and distributed
electronically from inside China. It includes commentaries and
reprints of items taken off the Internet and is produced by a group
of young computer company workers who call themselves ``political
netters.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, these newsletters, plus assorted online
discussion groups, have become important means of communication
among political activists, said Xiao Qiang, executive director of
Human Rights in China in New York.
</P>
<P>
   China now has some 1.2 million Internet accounts, many shared by
several users, with the numbers zooming. The government has
encouraged hookups in the interest of promoting national
development, but is fighting a losing battle to control political
uses.
</P>
<P>
   China uses an electronic ``firewall'' to block access to Web
sites it deems objectionable, including those of human rights
groups and some considered pornographic. But it cannot keep up with
new sites, and clever users can sidestep the firewall. E-mail is
virtually uncontrollable, although agents can identify a particular
individual and read that person's mail.
</P>
<P>
   China's security agencies have formed special units to fight not
only conventional computer crimes like illegal break-ins and fraud,
but also the spread of dissident information. To evade government
filters and electronic disruptions, VIP Reference is mailed from a
different American address every day.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the authorities zeroed in on Lin. Last week, Lin's
wife, Xu Hong, learned that his trial will begin on Nov. 26 but
will be a closed proceeding so that she cannot attend. The lawyers
she hired will be present but, Ms. Xu said by telephone, ``I'm
afraid the lawyers won't have much influence on the results.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as charged, Lin may face a prison sentence of five
years or more. He and his wife have a 20-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu, who says her husband is innocent, said that e-mail
addresses are ``public information, like telephone books, which can
be exchanged or purchased.'' He has never been involved in
politics, she said.

EDITORIAL: BACK FROM THE BRINK WITH IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   The latest confrontation with Iraq has ended with another
promise from Saddam Hussein to allow unfettered access to U.N.
weapons inspectors. The apparent peaceful resolution is welcome,
and can be credited to President Clinton's renewed willingness to
back diplomacy with the threat of force. But this must be the last
time that Iraq tries to manipulate the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times before, Iraq has tried to slip free of its
commitments to cooperate in the elimination of its stocks of
biological and chemical weapons and the missiles that can deliver
them. Iraq's interference with the inspectors has repeatedly forced
the United States to build up military forces in the Persian Gulf
region at great expense. Faced with a credible threat of force,
Iraq has backed down, only to resume its defiance at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its latest promise, Iraq is still far from fulfilling
its responsibilities. Thousands of chemical weapons and tons of
deadly germ-warfare agents remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to bring the inspections process to a timely
conclusion and prepare for an eventual end of the international
economic sanctions is to give the inspectors the access they
require to laboratories, factories, desert hiding places and
computer records.
</P>
<P>
   The process will go considerably faster if Iraq not only
refrains from interfering, but freely provides information about
what has been done with the deadly ingredients it purchased before
the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of full cooperation and compliance must now become the
principal goal of the Security Council with regard to Iraq. Saddam
must be made to understand that no further toying with the
inspections process will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   If Baghdad again attempts to restrict inspections, Washington,
with support from Britain and other allies, need not wait for weeks
or even days to respond. The Clinton administration, which reacted
too passively last August, when Iraq first began barring surprise
inspections, did an effective job of coordinating diplomacy and
military force this time around. If there is a next time,
Washington has rightly made it clear that the American reaction
will be prompt and certain, with no further warnings necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq is truly prepared to cooperate, the day may come when
the chief U.N. inspector, Richard Butler, can report that all
prohibited weapons have been located and destroyed and a reliable
long-term monitoring system, including continued surprise
inspections, is in place.
</P>
<P>
   At such a time, the United States must be prepared for an easing
of sanctions, as spelled out under the relevant Security Council
resolutions. But for as long as Saddam remains in power, an
airtight and intrusive verification system to monitor his weapons
activities will have to be maintained, under threat of force if
necessary.

WIDE RECEIVER'S BLOCKS LIFT FALCONS ATOP THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Football is blocking and tackling. Simple. But tell
that to a wide receiver. Try convincing him.
</P>
<P>
   All day long here in the Georgia Dome, where the Atlanta Falcons
and the San Francisco 49ers tangled for first place in their
division, the Falcons asked receiver Terance Mathis to block. All
day long. Block, block, block.
</P>
<P>
   Asking a receiver to block all day long is like asking a cowboy
to grab a bow and shoot nothing but arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect so much of me, I do my job, but I wanted the
opportunity to contribute at what I do best _ catch passes,''
Mathis said. ``We were winning at halftime and it was sort of a bad
reflection on my part the way I was sitting in the locker room. I
wasn't down, but I was a little frustrated. It's a team game _ but
I wanted to do something more than block.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons led the 49ers, 7-3, at halftime. Mathis had not
caught a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Falcons returned to the field, linebacker Cornelius
Bennett saw the dejected look on Mathis' face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to cheer up,'' Bennett said. ``I told him he would
catch one ball today and it would be for a touchdown. I told him it
might even win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, Atlanta led, 24-19. The 49ers had scored on
two long, fourth-quarter touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   And then Mathis caught one ball. That was it for his entire day.
</P>
<P>
   It went for 78 yards, and it made all of his blocking
worthwhile. That pass with 3 minutes 9 seconds remaining from Chris
Chandler insured the victory, 31-19, for the Falcons, the new
Falcons. The team that after each of its scores offers a new dance
_ the dirty bird _ and that sent the 49ers home repeating, for
them, dirty words: second place.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is 8-2 and stands alone atop the National Football
Conference West. San Francisco, the longtime king of the West, fell
to 7-3 and found itself before a sellout crowd of 69,828 fans in a
strange position. The 49ers were forced to bow to the Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very tough loss,'' 49er linebacker Ken Norton said. ``They
played very hard. They outplayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco cornerback Darnell Walker said: ``The 49ers have
been beating the Falcons for so long, I can imagine how excited
they are in the other locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited? Thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   Because in this showdown for the West lead with six
regular-season games remaining, the Falcons played for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   They took a game that was scoreless after a quarter and produced
an 11-play, 80-yard drive that took nearly eight minutes of the
second quarter. The drive was exacting and punishing with Jamal
Anderson runs inside and outside. It showed patience and resolve
and gave the Falcons a 7-0 lead 2:56 before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers gained field goals just before and quickly after
halftime. But with an acrobatic Ray Buchanan interception and
return to the San Francisco 1 and more Anderson running, Atlanta
built a 17-6 lead with 14:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Only 56 seconds later, the Falcons gained another touchdown when
Falcons tackle Shane Dronett sacked Steve Young, forcing a fumble,
and linebacker Jessie Tuggle recovered at the 49er 1 and rolled
into the end zone. It was the fifth fumble recovery for a touchdown
in his career, a National Football League record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the game we knew we had to close quarters on Steve
Young and keep him from scrambling like crazy,'' Dronett said. ``I
got hold of him, and the ball popped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who was 21 of 40 for 342 yards, said: ``Atlanta defended
us very well, almost to the point of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young zipped touchdown passes of 54 yards to Terrell Owens
and 65 yards to Jerry Rice over the next 11 minutes of the fourth
quarter, and the game was set for Mathis. One catch. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options on the play were the tight end; he was in traffic,
and I was waiting for him to clear,'' said Chandler, who completed
12 of 21 passes for 198 yards with a touchdown and no
interceptions. ``I had Tony Martin on a corner route, but he looked
double-covered. Terance was running free down the sideline. He got
a great release off the line. I thought, `Why not throw it deep
instead of trying to run out the clock?' Terance is always a great
option.''
</P>
<P>
   One catch. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the kind of person Terance is,'' Bennett said. ``He
looked way down at halftime. But I just had a feeling. You know,
all receivers are hungry for the ball. But blocking in this offense
is a priority. And if you love the game, you love your team, you do
your job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons did. They blocked so much because they ran so much.
Anderson finished with 31 carries for 100 yards. Atlanta ran the
ball 36 times, San Francisco only 20.
</P>
<P>
   That helped the Falcons gain 11 rushing first downs to the
49ers' 3. That helped the Falcons lead in possession time by 34:30
to 25:30. That limited the number of chances the 49er offense could
damage the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta gained the lead, making its own breaks. The 49ers made
the mistakes. In this series, in which the 49ers had won 10 of the
last 12 games, it was novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big-time players make big-time plays,'' said Dan Reeves, the
Falcons' coach. ``This puts us in position to have control. We've
worked hard. They make it fun. They've done everything we've
asked.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Stinchcomb won't play vs. Ole Miss
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's 28-17 win over Auburn on Saturday proved
costly as the Bulldogs may have lost All-America offensive tackle
Matt Stinchcomb for the remaining two regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, a 6-foot-6, 291-pound senior from Lilburn's Parkview
High, separated his left shoulder in the third quarter. Coach Jim
Donnan said the left tackle will miss Saturday's game against
Mississippi, but could return for the Nov. 28 game against Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, who underwent an MRI exam Sunday, would likely play
in a postseason bowl game for Georgia (7-2, 5-2), which moved up
three spots to No. 14 in the Associated Press poll and No. 15 in
the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll.

   ``Stinchcomb will be out this week,'' Donnan said. ``We think he
has got a chance to play against Georgia Tech, but we'll be very
careful because of his pending NFL career.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Tony Small (knee) and linebacker Adrian Hollingshed
(ankle), who both missed the second half against Auburn, are
probable for the Mississippi game.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, a finalist for the Outland Trophy, has been
Georgia's most durable player, starting 32 consecutive games. His
blocking grade has been 90 percent or better in every game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has a few options in replacing Stinchcomb. Right tackle
Chris Terry could move to the left side to protect quarterback
Quincy Carter's blind side, with backup Kelvin Williams starting at
right tackle. Sophomore Jonas Jennings, the starting right guard,
could move to tackle, with sophomore Reggie Stargill of LaGrange
starting at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a 6-5, 290-pound transfer from Georgia Military
College, played the final quarter against the Tigers.

RAPID EVENTS LEAVE A HAZY OUTCOME

   WASHINGTON _ Three days after declaring that the world was
united against Saddam Hussein, the Clinton administration found
that the truth was not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of Arab and European governments that had tacitly
supported the US buildup in the Persian Gulf had crumbled by
Sunday. A day after rejecting Hussein's ambiguous offer to
capitulate, President Clinton accepted it. And even as he made a
deal with Hussein, Clinton took the unorthodox step of calling for
the Iraqi leader's overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hussein avoided a full-bore military assault,
apparently at the last minute. But it is far from clear that he
will achieve one of his most important goals: ending UN economic
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional definitions of winner and loser do not apply
this time. The United States has paid a heavy price in diplomatic
capital as it has undergone a billion-dollar military buildup, but
it has avoided a war that could have cost far more.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein won his fifth attempt to thwart Clinton, but he has
tried the patience of his halfhearted defenders, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   And as the rhetoric dies down, UNSCOM, the beleaguered UN arms
monitoring agency, probably will return to Iraq with agents who are
demoralized and a mission that is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of good choices,'' said Jeswold Salacuse,
an international law specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``Could we go in and attack when
Iraq showed flexibility? Even if we did, could we have driven him
from power? That would have taken an invasion, and I can't see the
American people going for that once they learned the costs in
manpower and possible casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, this hazy outcome seemed improbable. Eight
Arab countries issued a statement saying Hussein had only himself
to blame for his conflicts with the UN and the United States. No
other country stepped forward to support Hussein _ not even Russia,
a traditional defender. The State Department said that absence of
criticism amounted to international support for a US military
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia wrote to Hussein, telling him to step
down. Hussein remained defiant, saying that he would consider any
initiative but that it must take into account Iraq's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, the alliance started to splinter,
diplomats say. As they tell it, the UN representatives of France,
Russia, and China made the first concerted effort to foil a US
attack and find a diplomatic solution, urging UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan to write a letter asking Hussein to admit weapons
inspectors back to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   According to the diplomats, Annan showed interest but said he
needed ``airtight'' assurance that Iraq would allow in the nearly
100 inspectors without conditions. He also wanted US support for
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, senior aides said Annan did not want to repeat
negotiations he had held with Hussein but would consider going to
Baghdad if asked by the Security Council, which is made up of the
most powerful countries. ``It would probably make him sick,'' said
a senior UN aide.
</P>
<P>
   The United States squelched the initiative and demanded that
Annan send a letter to the Iraqi leadership repeating Annan's
previous demands that the Iraqis back down.
</P>
<P>
   During the diplomatic back-and-forth, Annan's advisers said they
had been tipped off that a massive US airstrike on Iraq was likely.
Several Arab reporters, after chatting with Iraq's ambassador to
the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, in the Security Council lounge,
spread rumors about an upcoming airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Annan sent a last-ditch appeal to Baghdad, but told
reporters that prospects for a diplomatic solution were fading. A
day later, as US officials tell it, the Pentagon was about to
strike when Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, pledged to
let the inspectors back but confused matters by demanding an end to
inspections and a relaxing of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and his senior envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said that
the letter meets the Security Council demands. Annan's spokesman
Fred Eckhard said UN humanitarian workers would return to the
country, infuriating American officials. According to Annan's
aides, Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
called the UN chief on Saturday morning to say that bombers were
already in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Annan dropped his plan to send the humanitarian workers back,
but by that time the United States had to reckon with divided
allies and friends. Russia and China immediately hailed Iraq's
promises as a breakthrough. The president of France, Jacques
Chirac, urged the UN to ``test'' the offer by sending inspectors
back, a move that would make a US strike impossible.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Russia's deputy ambassador, Yuri Fedotov,
emerged from a Security Council meeting to say that the United
States was being ``unpleasant.'' Other members, even Britain,
argued against a military strike.
</P>
<P>
   In an address Sunday, Clinton proclaimed that ``the world spoke
with one voice'' against Iraq. And that was so, if only for a brief
moment before the harmony was lost.

JAPAN RAISES TO $190 BILLION THE VALUE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS
PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government has racheted up to a monumental
$190 billion the size of a new economic stimulus package that it
announced on Monday morning, making this the largest package Japan
has drawn up in eight years of economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the government was suggesting that it would
spend $148 billion. So, in barely four days, the government has
increased the amount of the plan by about $42 billion _ more than
the entire amount of the bailout fund for Brazil that was arranged
last week by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the plan's size, while boosting the impact that
it will have on the world's second-largest economy, underscores the
anxieties in Tokyo and around the world about Japan's recession and
the risk that it will drag down the rest of the world's economic
growth as well. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said on Monday only
that the package would be ``substantially bigger'' than 20 trillion
yen, or $164 billion, but details leaked to leading Japanese
newspapers and agencies suggested it could go as high as $195
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step to put the Japanese economy on a
recovery orbit within a couple of years,'' said Obuchi, announcing
the measures on Monday morning. ``I will make every effort to
achieve these targets.''
</P>
<P>
   A catch-all of tax cuts, spending and lending measures, Monday's
stimulus package is in many ways a last-ditch attempt by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to demonstrate his resolve to pull Japan out
of its worst recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Japan's government adopted a stimulus and
spending plan worth $137 billion, and the money from that package
is slowly beginning to roll into the economy. Still, the government
has suffered repeated criticism that it is not doing enough to
boost consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Japan has been shackled by a fiscal
austerity law that called for stiff reduction in government
deficits over the next few years and essentially a balanced budget
by fiscal year 2005. This package, however, includes a freeze on
that law, a move that will allow Obuchi to make good on a promise
he made soon after he took office this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confusion surrounding the actual spending amounts of
the package, some critics fear that the package may be less than
what is being presented.
</P>
<P>
   At about five percent of total economic output, the new package
is the largest Japan has ever recorded, and in some ways, the most
ambitious. Government estimates suggest that the package could
boost real gross domestic product by 2.3 percentage points over the
next year, which would pull Japan out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, however, exactly how much of the money the
government pours in will lead directly to economic growth. The
package contains special financing measures that are not direct
government investment in bricks and mortar, but instead are meant
to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government has earmarked about $66 billion for
developing infrastructure in areas such as information technology,
telecommunications and the environment, and it aims to create one
million jobs through training assistance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of the major appeals of American officials, it is
trying to lift spending by individual consumers and corporate
spenders over the next year and a half through long-term tax cuts
that will slash individual and corporate income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure that will cost the government a total of $50
billion in tax revenue, Obuchi plans to lower the maximum
individual income tax rate to 50 percent, from 65 percent, where it
is now. The government will also lower the corporate tax rate to
about 40 percent, from 46 percent at the moment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The package also includes measures that arose from political
bargaining. Since the Liberal Democratic Party is short of a
majority in the Upper House of Parliament, it has had to curry
favor with other opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in response to a demand from the New Komei Party, the
latest plan will distribute about $5.7 billion in shopping coupons,
each worth nearly $165, to the elderly and to families with young
children, to encourage people to spend. Many economists are
skeptical about whether this measure will lead to a surge in
consumption, for while consumers may spend the shopping vouchers,
they may then save that much more from their salaries, leaving the
money in the banks.
</P>
<P>
   While banks usually would take their customer deposits and lend
it out to corporate and individual customers, the biggest challenge
the government is facing now is that the nation's banks _ wracked
by bad loans and weak capital bases _ simply are not lending their
money.
</P>
<P>
   So another pillar of this package is the government's desperate
attempt to assume a greater role as the nation's banker. Indeed, it
is revising the law to allow the Japan Development Bank to lend
directly to corporations that need money to redeem bonds or pay off
their debt, or that of their affiliates. It will also expand the
scope of guarantees the government issues to enable medium-size
companies to get loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a complement to this package, the Bank of Japan, the nation's
central bank, on Friday adopted three measures to help bring money
to cash-strapped corporations. Under the measures, the Bank of
Japan will ease the rules under which it buys commercial paper
issued by companies and conducts open-market operations. The
central bank will also set up an emergency loan program in which
banks can borrow a certain amount of money from the central bank if
they increase their lending to corporations from September levels.

WITHOUT BANNED ARMS, IRAQ IS A 4TH-RATE POWER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his latest act of brinkmanship, some analysts
and officials say President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is closer to
what he wants most: keeping a secret cache of biological and
chemical weapons while gaining support for an end to the economic
sanctions crippling his country.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's tactics, which American officials label ``cheat and
retreat,'' have long frustrated many in the White House and State
Department, and widened divisions within the U.N. Security Council
over how to handle Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Many American officials predict that he will once again rebuff
U.N. weapons inspectors in a few months, again risking an attack,
to protect his secret weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he do it? His goals are simple _ far simpler than those
facing U.S. officials trying to thwart his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein has vast megalomaniacal ambitions of being the
leader of the Arab world and the hegemon of the gulf, and he sees
that his political survival depends on his keeping these weapons,''
said Jonathan Tucker, a leading expert on biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``His political survival is his primary objective,'' Tucker
said, ``which is why he has accepted such a price to retain them.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat that he might someday unleash biological and chemical
weaponry makes him a world figure. Without them, he is just another
tyrant presiding over a starveling Third World country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without weapons of mass destruction, Saddam is not Saddam,''
said Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations. ``With them
he's a regional and an international factor.''
</P>
<P>
   His secret weapons are his ace in the hole as he fights to keep
his status as a leader in the Arab world and to preserve his
ability to fight and deter his enemies, who include the Iranians,
the Saudis, the Israelis and the Americans, say American officials
and international analysts.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain his chemical and biological weapons _ and the
ability to build more _ Saddam has sacrificed more than $120
billion in oil revenues and endured a harsh seven-year economic
embargo. He has devoted his intelligence service to an endless game
of cat and mouse to hide his suspected weapons caches from U.N.
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last year, when it appeared that the inspectors
were getting close to the heart of his biological and chemical
weapons secrets, he cut off cooperation with them, setting off
another round of threats and defiance and risking a devastating
attack by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by agreeing to readmit the U.N. weapons inspectors, Saddam
took a step that members of the Security Council have said is
required before they can consider lifting economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the inspectors back in is a gamble the Iraqi leader may
well feel is worth taking. He and his intelligence services have
managed to keep Iraq's biological weapons programs largely hidden
from them despite nearly seven years of intense, intrusive
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 101 days since the last full-fledged inspection. The
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which conducts the
inspections, may well have lost track of developments at 120
suspected chemical weapons sites and 90 sites suspected of
biological weapons activities.
</P>
<P>
   The previous seven years of inspections have destroyed some
38,500 chemical weapons and a secret biological weapons site, far
beyond what seven weeks of bombing did in the Persian Gulf war of
1991.
</P>
<P>
   But much about the Iraqi biological programs is unknown, and
they remain ``a black hole,'' in the words of Richard Butler, chief
of the special commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the inspections had reduced Iraq ``to a core of
military resources that Saddam Hussein will never give up,'' and
biological weapons are the heart of that arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they have produced tons of anthrax and botulism,''
Tucker said. ``It's possible they retain a significant stockpile of
these agents. The Iraqis seem to retain some kind of missile
capability, and they were determined to retain some kind of VX
capability.'' VX is a deadly nerve agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leader, say government officials and private analysts,
doubts that the United States and its allies have the will to
remove him from power by any means necessary, as they lacked the
will at the close of the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He survives and thrives by acting and provoking,'' said Chibli
Mallat, a Beirut lawyer and political analyst of Iraq. ``If Saddam
agrees to have UNSCOM back and review his compliance, he'll be in a
stronger position _ having held back the wave'' of the threatened
American attack.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged from the latest crisis Sunday in control of his
secret weapons sites, his soldiers, his spies, his palaces and his
secret police _ the pillars of his power, which were in the cross
hairs of the cruise missiles almost launched by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He may now be confident that he can weather any political storm,
protect his secret weapons and his personal power and emerge
unscathed, just as he did during and after the Gulf war.

EDITORIAL: THE READING ROOM REOPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   When you request a book in the Main Reading Room of the New York
Public Library, the call slip disappears down a pneumatic tube into
regions unimaginable and you are given a number. You take a seat at
one of the long desks in the north or south hall and wait for your
number to appear on a board at the front of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone spends the time gazing at the room itself,
listening to the audible rumble of intellection, and wondering how
to collect one's prize without stumbling or making too much noise
or betraying a fit of self-consciousness during that long,
deliberate walk.
</P>
<P>
   This was before the Main Reading Room was restored, when the
atmospheric scenes in the ceiling panels were still blighted, by
what appeared to be dense smog, when the ornamental woodwork seemed
almost gouty with wax buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it was a room that redefined the act of reading. The
act of opening a book within the dome of light thrown off by the
desk lamps had something ceremonial about it every time. To look
around at a roomful of readers, each bent over a book, was to
realize that this posture is among the most beautiful of human
transfigurations.
</P>
<P>
   Now every inch of this remarkable room has been restored to
immaculate condition, thanks to a $15 million gift from Frederick
Phineas Rose and Sandra Priest Rose, a library trustee. It reopens
to the public on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A reader who comes in haste will find himself stilled by the
beauty of what he sees. The ceiling seems to open overhead onto a
heaven that Rubens might have imagined. The woodwork and brass have
been burnished, the original chairs restored or replaced, and the
windows modernized.
</P>
<P>
   With great restraint, the room has been made ready for laptop
computers, and space has been reserved for those who find the
clatter of keyboards distracting. The only drawback is that readers
who were intimidated before the restoration by the walk to the
book-delivery window may find themselves unable to move at all amid
this new splendor.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a conceit to call what this building houses
``information.'' Perhaps when the library is closed at night that
is the right word for its contents. But when it is open and the
room is filled with readers transfigured by light pouring in from
the great arched windows, it is no longer information. It is
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   One test of a democracy is whether it grants equal access to the
tools that make knowledge possible. No credentials are required to
use the Rose Main Reading Room, no tests of income or IQ. There
were always a few readers who seemed destitute or worn. With luck,
they will be among the first to return. Their presence is a
reminder of the ideal of intellectual equity embodied in that
place.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   When Congress debates taxes and spending decisions, it is the
Congressional Budget Office that sets the terms of the debate, with
its estimates of just how much each provision will cost or bring in
to the Treasury. That office has developed a reputation for
impartial professionalism that must be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   With June O'Neill, the director of the office, stepping down at
the end of the year, the appointment of her successor will provide
an early indication of whether the new Republican leadership in the
House will continue on the same disastrous course begun by Speaker
Newt Gingrich and his colleagues last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Ms. O'Neill's refusal to bend the numbers to make
huge tax cuts appear to cost little in the way of revenues, the
speaker and the rest of the outgoing House Republican leadership
sent a letter threatening to ``review the structure and funding''
of the office if it did not start making more congenial
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some Republicans are arguing that the new director should
be a Republican partisan who will run the office in a blatantly
political way. It is up to the chairmen of the Budget Committees,
Rep. John Kasich and Sen. Pete Domenici, to assure that does not
happen. The incoming speaker, Robert Livingston, should make it
clear that he wants professionalism, not rigged numbers.

   WASHINGTON _ Three days after declaring that the world was
united against Saddam Hussein, the Clinton administration found
that the truth was not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of Arab and European governments that had tacitly
supported the US buildup in the Persian Gulf had crumbled by
Sunday. A day after rejecting Hussein's ambiguous offer to
capitulate, President Clinton accepted it. And even as he made a
deal with Hussein, Clinton took the unorthodox step of calling for
the Iraqi leader's overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hussein avoided a full-bore military assault,
apparently at the last minute. But it is far from clear that he
will achieve one of his most important goals: ending UN economic
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional definitions of winner and loser do not apply
this time. The United States has paid a heavy price in diplomatic
capital as it has undergone a billion-dollar military buildup, but
it has avoided a war that could have cost far more.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein won his fifth attempt to thwart Clinton, but he has
tried the patience of his halfhearted defenders, Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   And as the rhetoric dies down, UNSCOM, the beleaguered UN arms
monitoring agency, probably will return to Iraq with agents who are
demoralized and a mission that is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of good choices,'' said Jeswold Salacuse,
an international law specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``Could we go in and attack when
Iraq showed flexibility? Even if we did, could we have driven him
from power? That would have taken an invasion, and I can't see the
American people going for that once they learned the costs in
manpower and possible casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, this hazy outcome seemed improbable. Eight
Arab countries issued a statement saying Hussein had only himself
to blame for his conflicts with the UN and the United States. No
other country stepped forward to support Hussein _ not even Russia,
a traditional defender. The State Department said that absence of
criticism amounted to international support for a US military
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia wrote to Hussein, telling him to step
down. Hussein remained defiant, saying that he would consider any
initiative but that it must take into account Iraq's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, the alliance started to splinter,
diplomats say. As they tell it, the UN representatives of France,
Russia, and China made the first concerted effort to foil a US
attack and find a diplomatic solution, urging UN Secretary General
Kofi Annan to write a letter asking Hussein to admit weapons
inspectors back to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   According to the diplomats, Annan showed interest but said he
needed ``airtight'' assurance that Iraq would allow in the nearly
100 inspectors without conditions. He also wanted US support for
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, senior aides said Annan did not want to repeat
negotiations he had held with Hussein but would consider going to
Baghdad if asked by the Security Council, which is made up of the
most powerful countries. ``It would probably make him sick,'' said
a senior UN aide.
</P>
<P>
   The United States squelched the initiative and demanded that
Annan send a letter to the Iraqi leadership repeating Annan's
previous demands that the Iraqis back down.
</P>
<P>
   During the diplomatic back-and-forth, Annan's advisers said they
had been tipped off that a massive US airstrike on Iraq was likely.
Several Arab reporters, after chatting with Iraq's ambassador to
the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, in the Security Council lounge,
spread rumors about an upcoming airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Annan sent a last-ditch appeal to Baghdad, but told
reporters that prospects for a diplomatic solution were fading. A
day later, as US officials tell it, the Pentagon was about to
strike when Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, pledged to
let the inspectors back but confused matters by demanding an end to
inspections and a relaxing of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and his senior envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, said that
the letter meets the Security Council demands. Annan's spokesman
Fred Eckhard said UN humanitarian workers would return to the
country, infuriating American officials. According to Annan's
aides, Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger,
called the UN chief on Saturday morning to say that bombers were
already in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Annan dropped his plan to send the humanitarian workers back,
but by that time the United States had to reckon with divided
allies and friends. Russia and China immediately hailed Iraq's
promises as a breakthrough. The president of France, Jacques
Chirac, urged the UN to ``test'' the offer by sending inspectors
back, a move that would make a US strike impossible.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Russia's deputy ambassador, Yuri Fedotov,
emerged from a Security Council meeting to say that the United
States was being ``unpleasant.'' Other members, even Britain,
argued against a military strike.
</P>
<P>
   In an address Sunday, Clinton proclaimed that ``the world spoke
with one voice'' against Iraq. And that was so, if only for a brief
moment before the harmony was lost.

THE FAITHFUL GET TOGETHER UNDER THE BANNER OF LABOR

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ If Anthony Mazzocchi's vision becomes reality, the
United States will someday have a Labor Party that rivals
Britain's.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzocchi said he hoped the new Labor Party would fill the void
that he and the 1,200 delegates gathered here for the party's
constitutional convention see in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzocchi, the driving force behind the fledgling party, said
Jesse Ventura's election as governor of Minnesota showed that
Americans were turned off by the two big political parties. And the
delegates _ miners, farm workers, nurses, social workers _ had a
explanation for why some have soured on the Democrats and the
Republicans: Those parties heed the interests of corporations far
more than those of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the Democrats or Republicans have passed any
pro-worker legislation in 25 years,'' said Mazzocchi, a longtime
official of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union. ``On issues
that working Americans care about, on trade, health care, welfare
reform, the two major parties have sided with corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   His hope, he said, is that millions of Americans will embrace a
party with a platform that supports a 32-hour work week, four-week
vacations and a minimum pension for all workers, and a
Canadian-style health care system in which the government pays the
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Many labor leaders warn that third parties generally fail.
Republicans deride the party as fringe leftist. Democrats worry
that it could siphon votes from their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, gesturing toward the crowded convention hall, festooned
with banners showing legendary labor leaders, Mazzocchi said:
``This is another example of people being turned off by the two
political parties. We're convinced there's going to be an
alternative political party _ it's either going to come from us or
from the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention was afire with speeches about how, in the richest
nation on earth, one in five children are in poverty and one in six
Americans lack health insurance. At the gathering, the most popular
T-shirt read: ``The Bosses Have Two Parties. Now We Have One of Our
Own.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward building public support, the party's faithful
plan to hold Tupperware parties and kaffeeklatsches across the
nation to rally support for universal health coverage. Members are
also working to collect 1 million signatures for a constitutional
amendment that would guarantee every American a job that pays a
living wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is to amass enough people so we will be able
to contest for real political power,'' said Gloria Mattera,
secretary of the party's New York City chapter.
</P>
<P>
   While Mazzocchi talks big, the membership and public awareness
of his fledgling party remain small, and it is unclear how fast the
party is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party's current convention has attracted fewer people
than the founding convention two years ago. As it did in 1996, the
party says it has been endorsed by unions whose membership totals
more than 1 million workers, including the United Mine Workers, the
California Nurses Association and the American Federation of
Government Employees.
</P>
<P>
   And the party is struggling over whether it has reached critical
mass big enough to field candidates, although it claims more than
10,000 members who pay $20 a year in dues.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the party hopes to take off at a difficult time.
In the last two decades, American politics has moved to the right,
unions have taken it on the chin and traditional liberals like Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., have been ridiculed as pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzocchi said his union's members _ workers in oilfields and
chemical plants _ are in many ways conservative, but they still
overwhelmingly support the party's worker-friendly platform. That
demonstrates, he said, that the party is not out on some leftist
fringe.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the labor movement writes off the 72-year-old
Mazzocchi. Now an assistant to the president of the chemical
workers union, he is widely considered the father of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act because of his pioneering work a
quarter-century ago as the union's safety director.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many labor leaders, noting that third parties
generally have a short life span, warn that the Labor Party is
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true unions have to get more involved in a political
process,'' said Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, ``but not in a vehicle that can't
ride very far.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans deride the Labor Party as socialists and
big-government enthusiasts, though Mazzocchi insists that the party
resembles social democrats in Western Europe. Democrats often
denounce it as an unwitting fifth column that will hurt the cause
of workers by siphoning off votes, helping ensure the election of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But many delegates here seemed unconcerned that the party might
propel some Republicans to victory. ``In many areas of the country,
you can't tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats,''
said Chris Townsend, a Labor Party member and legislative director
of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers. ``We're not
going to be spoiling anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At its 1996 convention, the party voted against entering
electoral politics, concluding that it was too small. But at this
year's convention, the delegates gave an ambivalent go-ahead to
fielding candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the convention hall boomed with ferocious debate.
Some delegates shouted that the party should field candidates
immediately, to keep members from drifting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't fill in the political gap, someone else is going
to,'' said Jan Campbell, director of the Rhode Island Labor Party.
``Our health care campaign is great, but our members want us to run
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Other delegates warned that the party would need several more
years to build its base. Their fear was that the party would
embarrass itself if it ran candidates now and that it would be the
party's death knell if candidates flopped miserably before it had a
solid base.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney questioned the timing of the
effort, saying labor's limited resources could best be used to
rebuild the union movement and elect pro-worker candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the labor federation worked hard to pull the
Democratic Party leftward by campaigning for hundreds of Democrats.
But Mazzocchi insists that strategy has failed for 50 years, adding
that the current Democratic president pushed through a free trade
agreement that hurt workers and welfare reform that shredded the
New Deal's safety net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the Labor Party, 10 years down the road, as a
formidable entity on the national political scene,'' he said.
``There's no guarantee that this will happen. We're not naive. We
don't expect lightning to strike overnight.''

OVERTHROWING SADDAM: A DAUNTING TASK

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Sunday all but called for a
coup against Saddam Hussein, vowing to work with Iraqi opposition
groups until ``a new government'' took power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush did much the same at the end of the 1991 Gulf
War, calling on the Iraqi people to rise up and ``force Saddam
Hussein the dictator to step aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Iraqis died trying to heed that call. And in the
seven years since the Gulf War, thousands more have faced prison
and death. The CIA has come up with at least six different plans to
undermine the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
   Coups against dictators are ``harder to do than to talk about,''
in the words of Gen. John Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs. In the case of Iraq, it may be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and representatives have been talking openly all year
about the need to topple Saddam. The CIA's overseers in Congress
have debated how best to carry out a coup. Two weeks ago, the
president signed an unusual $97 million bill that proposes to unify
the deeply divided Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has spent nearly that much money since the Gulf War
backing four different groups trying to subvert Saddam: Kurdish
dissidents in northern Iraq, Iraqi military defectors in Jordan,
Shiite Muslim groups in southern Iraq and a coalition of exiles
based in London.
</P>
<P>
   None proved effective. They were plagued by internal divisions
and, in some cases, infiltration by Iraqi intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their weakness was exposed in September 1996 when Saddam crushed
a cell of dissidents run by the CIA inside Iraq. The operation was
destroyed because a Kurdish opposition leader, Massoud Barzani,
betrayed it as part of a power struggle with a rival. This past
September, the State Department brokered a settlement between the
two factions, both of whom had been backed by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   This year, at the request of the White House, the agency has
twice drafted plans for covert action against the Iraqi government,
only to see them blocked by skeptics in the administration and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The more ambitious of these plans, drafted in February, would
have mounted a major campaign of sabotage inside Iraq, enlisting
Kurdish and Shiite agents to blow up government broadcast stations
and utility plants. The plan was leaked to The New York Times by a
senior government official who opposed it, effectively removing the
element of surprise. The plot was not finally approved by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Congress passed the $97 million Iraq Liberation Act,
which Clinton signed on Oct. 31. It authorizes the president, but
does not require him, to give guns, money and political support to
the fragmented Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, the American commander in the
Gulf, opposed the act. ``I think a weakened, fragmented, chaotic
Iraq, which could happen if this isn't done carefully, is more
dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now,'' he
said. ``I don't think these things have been thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, Sunday condemned
Clinton's statement, calling it ``a flagrant violation of the
Security Council resolutions as well as international law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Clinton said he would carry out the Iraq Liberation Act as
best he could. ``Over the past year we have deepened our engagement
with the forces of change in Iraq, reconciling the two largest
Kurdish opposition groups, beginning broadcasts of a Radio Free
Iraq,'' he said. ``We will intensify that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, correcting himself in mid-sentence and tacitly
acknowledging how difficult the job would be, the president said
Washington would work ``to make sure the opposition _ or to do what
we can to make the opposition a more effective voice.''

DEFUSING CRISIS, CLINTON ACCEPTS IRAQI RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH   AND DAVID MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton pulled back Sunday from the
brink of a bombing campaign in Iraq, while vowing to embark on a
long-term campaign to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from
power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He accepted Hussein's latest offer to reopen Iraq to UN arms
inspections, but said that US troops remain poised to strike if
Baghdad breaks its pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision followed by hours Baghdad's
capitulation in the face of US demands that it provide public and
written assurances that it will stop interfering with UN arms
inspectors seeking to rid Iraq of its chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic victory was tempered, however, by concerns among
US officials that the Iraqi leader will provoke another
confrontation down the road. The chief UN weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, said Sunday he would send the UN arms team back to
Iraq tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear that Saddam Hussein has backed down, but that
is not enough. Now Iraq must live up to its obligations,'' Clinton
said. ``Iraq isolated itself from world opinion ... more than at
any time since the Gulf War'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expanded the US commitment by outlining a mission to
undermine the leadership in Baghdad and install ``a government in
Iraq that represents and respects its people _ not represses
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which involves supporting Iraq's ineffectual exile
opposition movement and propaganda radio into Iraq, emerged last
October when the administration authorized $97 million to finance a
``democratic'' alternative to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year we have deepened our engagement with the
forces of change in Iraq,'' he said. ``We will intensify that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a UN Security Council debate Sunday night, the UN
humanitarian aid coordinator, Benon Sevan, announced that he would
send 151 relief workers back to Iraq as early as Monday. An
additional 92 UN weapons inspectors are expected to return to
Baghdad tomorrow to begin testing Iraq's pledge, according to Ewen
Buchanan, a spokesman for the UN Special Commission charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis has its roots in the 1991 cease-fire
agreement ending the Gulf War. Under the terms of the accord, Iraq
is required to prove to the United Nations that it has destroyed
all of its long-range missiles and obliterate its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Commission has obliterated more weapons than were
destroyed by the US-led Gulf War alliance, according to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission maintains that Iraq is still hiding evidence
of a secret weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Prevented by the Iraqi authorities from working, the UN
inspectors, along with UN relief workers, were pulled out of the
country last Wednesday amid expectations that the United States and
Britain were on the verge of striking Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials said Baghdad escaped a military strike
by hours.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered US warplanes into action Saturday only to recall
them when Washington learned of Baghdad's retreat. The president's
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said Sunday the
military would remain in the region to respond to potential acts of
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, three EC-130 planes with electronic
jammers, are set to leave from an Air Force base in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it had halted a major buildup of military
forces in the Gulf, a deployment that began last week in
expectation of strikes against Iraq, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already has a powerful force of more than 180
warplanes and 15 ships, including the aircraft carrier Eisenhower,
in the Gulf. Seven of those ships and a submarine are capable of
firing long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable anger in Washington that Hussein had once
again avoided punishing strikes after forcing the United States to
mount an expensive military build up in the Gulf. Former senator
Sam Nunn said on NBC Sunday morning that the United States would
have been far better off ``had we bombed before'' Baghdad had a
chance to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But many congressional figures said the plan to oust Hussein has
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easier said than done,'' Senator Arlen Specter,
Republican of Pennsylvania, told CNN Sunday. ``But I think that's,
candidly, the next objective and I'm glad to hear the president
talk about it openly and forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to suspend the threat of military force
was made as international acceptance that American military action
was inevitable began to dry up Saturday when Hussein sent a
conciliatory message to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with clear signs that Baghdad was looking to reverse
course, France, Russia and China, all members of the Security
Council, found it increasingly untenable to back US military
action.
</P>
<P>
   Arab countries that had earlier blamed Baghdad for provoking
Washington made it clear Sunday that they were satisfied that Iraq
no longer deserved to be targeted by US cruise missiles and
warplanes. ``Now we are not talking about military strikes,'' said
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. ``The problem we hope will be
defused.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain, the closest US ally, began looking for a
diplomatic exit from the crisis as early as Saturday night,
signaling that it was time to test Iraq's word. Senior UN sources
said that British Prime Minister Tony Blair phoned Clinton late
Saturday night and appealed to him to give the Iraqis another a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Sunday that British and American forces still
``remain on alert'' to bomb Hussein. ``Saddam is now trapped,'' he
told reporters outside his office at 10 Downing Street. ``One false
move and he can be hit legitimately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no further warning whatsoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said the Clinton administration should have
expected Hussein's last-minute diplomatic entreaty. Laurie Mylroie,
the publisher of the Iraq News bulletin and a critic of the Clinton
administration, said she listened in disbelief Sunday to the
president's announcement that the crisis was ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic,'' Mylroie said. ``The administration should
have been prepared for Saddam to back down. They should have had a
list of steps he had to take within 48 hours to show he really is
complying with his promises'' to let weapons inspectors back to
work. ``They should have had punishment for not complying.''
</P>
<P>
   But UN Secretary General Kofi Annan joined many other world
leaders in praising Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to President Clinton for the courageous and
difficult decisions, which he announced earlier today. ... This is
a victory for diplomacy,'' Annan said. ``Iraq must move swiftly to
insure complete and unconditional compliance.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Sunday that President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq had unconditionally retreated and once again had
vowed complete cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. That vow
will be tested quickly, Clinton said, and U.S. and British forces
that nearly struck Iraq on Saturday will remain poised to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough,'' Clinton said
in a brief White House appearance before reporters on Sunday. ``Now
Iraq must live up to its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called more directly than ever before for the
overthrow of Saddam, calling him ``an impediment to the well-being
of his people and a threat to the peace of his region and the
security of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of seven years of confrontation with Iraq
over weapons inspections, senior U.S. officials struggled to
explain why Clinton found acceptable on Sunday what his national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, said was unacceptable on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Iraqis had clarified their position overnight in
two letters that eliminated all unacceptable conditions. The
administration regards those letters as binding on Baghdad,
officials said, despite comments on Sunday by the Iraqi deputy
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, that seemed to cast doubt on their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the officials said, Iraq had now agreed to hand
over to the weapons inspectors two sensitive documents on its
chemical and biological weapons programs and promised the
inspectors full and unfettered access to all sites _ including
those the Americans deemed too controversial to risk last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. weapons inspection team called UNSCOM, has been stymied
for the last year, the officials said. But they insisted that
Saddam's retreat now had ``opened a window of effectiveness for
UNSCOM that we want to use as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected U.N. inspectors to return to Iraq in
about two days with a specific list of documents they want to see
and sensitive sites they want to inspect, together with the
personnel and the equipment to do it. At least some of those sites
were at the center of a dispute with Saddam this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the those documents, dealing with Iraq's chemical-weapons
program, was found at the Iraqi air force headquarters but was
seized from UNSCOM by Iraqi authorities; the other document,
dealing with Iraq's biological weapons program, the U.N. inspectors
know about but have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Iraqis resist inspection efforts now, the officials said,
the U.S. and British military are prepared to attack. But the
officials acknowledged that military action would be impossible so
long as officials of the inspection team and the other nations on
the Security Council believe they are getting adequate cooperation
from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to contain Iraq, economic sanctions are only
helped by a functioning inspection program, one senior official of
a NATO country said. ``For nearly two years, UNSCOM has been pushed
backward and for the last year, its performance has been next to
useless,'' the official said. ``But we now have an opportunity to
get UNSCOM back to a satisfactory level of performance, and UNSCOM
has the greatest possible leverage just now to inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said: ``UNSCOM should feel pretty good,
because they're now in a stronger position than they've been in a
long time. It's much harder for Saddam to wriggle around now about
what compliance means. The spotlight is on Saddam, where it
belongs, and not on UNSCOM. And Iraqi obstruction will be clear and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true for only a limited time, another official
conceded. ``Sure, there's a window for UNSCOM to be effective
now,'' the official said. ``But Saddam will shut that window as
soon as he thinks he can, and then we're back just about where we
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official said, ``Saddam can be in no doubt that we
intended to use force, because it was on its way. That makes the
threat of force pretty credible again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Washington also vowed that force would be used
against Iraq if Saddam broke his promises to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that he would guarantee complete access for UNSCOM. But
that threat proved hollow, paving the way for this latest chapter
in the ongoing effort to get Iraq to disarm against its will.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton called the return of the weapons inspectors
``the best outcome, because they have been and they remain the most
effective tool to uncover, destroy and prevent Iraq from rebuilding
its weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listed five benchmarks to judge Saddam's compliance:
Iraq must allow inspectors ``unfettered access'' to all sites they
choose to see, ``with no restrictions or qualifications''; it must
turn over all relevant documents on the production of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them;
it must not interfere with the inspectors themselves or question
their independence or professional expertise _ for example, by
dictating the composition of UNSCOM teams; it must ``resolve all
outstanding issues raised'' by the weapons inspectors; and it must
accept all the relevant U.N. resolutions regarding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and the British had authorized the use of force
against Iraq to break out of the cycle of Iraqi defiance and
retreat, the officials acknowledged. But they also said Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain decided it would be immoral to
continue with an attack once there were serious signs of an Iraqi
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's diplomatic initiative came as B-52 bombers loaded with
cruise missiles were airborne. There was no indication that the
specific decision to use force on Saturday _ made by Clinton on
Friday night and by Blair on Saturday morning _ was leaked to Iraq,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision at about 8 a.m. on Saturday to call off the
air strikes actually postponed them for 24 hours, officials said
Sunday. At 3:30 a.m. Sunday, after clarifications from Iraq,
Clinton decided that Washington ``would take `yes' for an answer''
and called off the bombing again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair spoke eight times on Saturday, officials said;
British pilots were to be responsible for 20 percent of the targets
to be hit by manned airplanes, as opposed to cruise missiles, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance
is guaranteed and delivered,'' Blair said Sunday morning in London.
If Iraq violates its new pledges, he said, there will be air
strikes, and ``there will be no warning whatsoever.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said in an interview that
if Saddam interferes again with UNSCOM, ``our forces are there and
we've shown we're ready to use them.'' What has been gained now,
Bacon said, ``is the chance to have a more effective inspections
regime'' and a clear ``capitulation'' from Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's two goals are to end the sanctions and the inspections,
in order to keep his weapons of mass destruction, Bacon said.
``What he's left with this time is an international community more
united behind his need to meet U.N. resolutions before sanctions
are lifted, and a commitment to hand over documents he's been
refusing to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also said Sunday that it would suspend the
deployment of dozens of additional aircraft and ground forces to
the region, where the United States already maintains some 23,000
troops as well as a dozen warships and 170 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Those aircraft that had already arrived in the Persian Gulf _
six B-52s, four B-1s, and several support aircraft _ will remain
there. Several squadrons of fighter planes got as far as U.S. bases
in Europe and will remain there. The rest of the 139 aircraft that
President Clinton ordered to the region last week will remain at
bases in the United States, as will roughly 4,000 ground troops who
had been readied to go.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort to keep the spotlight on Saddam's defiance and
not on the inspection team's methods led to decisions last summer
that proved extremely controversial and led to the resignation of a
highly regarded U.S. inspector, Scott Ritter. Ritter charged that
Washington had discouraged the commission's chairman, Richard
Butler, from confrontational surprise inspections, because it did
not want a new crisis with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials say the charge is unfair, because the
policy was designed to avoid the expulsion of UNSCOM and a military
confrontation on Saddam's timing and terms, when there was no unity
in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Security Council is firmly behind the
inspectors' right to complete access to all sites, the officials
argue, those very inspections should be carried out as soon as
possible, to test Saddam's compliance while military force remains
on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law of the land was to avoid unnecessary confrontation
last summer, it's to press ahead right now,'' one official said.
``The point is to put Saddam on the spot, not UNSCOM, and I'm sorry
Ritter didn't understand that, because we could use him now. We
always preferred to have sanctions plus UNSCOM, so long as UNSCOM
is useful, and UNSCOM has a chance to be more useful than before.''

DEFUSING CRISIS, CLINTON ACCEPTS IRAQI RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH   AND DAVID MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton pulled back Sunday from the
brink of a bombing campaign in Iraq, while vowing to embark on a
long-term campaign to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from
power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He accepted Hussein's latest offer to reopen Iraq to UN arms
inspections, but said that US troops remain poised to strike if
Baghdad breaks its pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision followed by hours Baghdad's
capitulation in the face of US demands that it provide public and
written assurances that it will stop interfering with UN arms
inspectors seeking to rid Iraq of its chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic victory was tempered, however, by concerns among
US officials that the Iraqi leader will provoke another
confrontation down the road. The chief UN weapons inspector,
Richard Butler, said Sunday he would send the UN arms team back to
Iraq on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear that Saddam Hussein has backed down, but that
is not enough. Now Iraq must live up to its obligations,'' Clinton
said. ``Iraq isolated itself from world opinion ... more than at
any time since the Gulf War'' in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expanded the US commitment by outlining a mission to
undermine the leadership in Baghdad and install ``a government in
Iraq that represents and respects its people _ not represses
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which involves supporting Iraq's ineffectual exile
opposition movement and propaganda radio into Iraq, emerged last
October when the administration authorized $97 million to finance a
``democratic'' alternative to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year we have deepened our engagement with the
forces of change in Iraq,'' he said. ``We will intensify that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a UN Security Council debate Sunday night, the UN
humanitarian aid coordinator, Benon Sevan, announced that he would
send 151 relief workers back to Iraq as early as Monday. An
additional 92 UN weapons inspectors are expected to return to
Baghdad Tuesday to begin testing Iraq's pledge, according to Ewen
Buchanan, a spokesman for the UN Special Commission charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis has its roots in the 1991 cease-fire
agreement ending the Gulf War. Under the terms of the accord, Iraq
is required to prove to the United Nations that it has destroyed
all of its long-range missiles and obliterate its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Commission has obliterated more weapons than were
destroyed by the US-led Gulf War alliance, according to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission maintains that Iraq is still hiding evidence
of a secret weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Prevented by the Iraqi authorities from working, the UN
inspectors, along with UN relief workers, were pulled out of the
country last Wednesday amid expectations that the United States and
Britain were on the verge of striking Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials said Baghdad escaped a military strike
by hours.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered US warplanes into action Saturday only to recall
them when Washington learned of Baghdad's retreat. The president's
national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said Sunday the
military would remain in the region to respond to potential acts of
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, three EC-130 planes with electronic
jammers, are set to leave from an Air Force base in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it had halted a major buildup of military
forces in the Gulf, a deployment that began last week in
expectation of strikes against Iraq, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already has a powerful force of more than 180
warplanes and 15 ships, including the aircraft carrier Eisenhower,
in the Gulf. Seven of those ships and a submarine are capable of
firing long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable anger in Washington that Hussein had once
again avoided punishing strikes after forcing the United States to
mount an expensive military build up in the Gulf. Former senator
Sam Nunn said on NBC Sunday morning that the United States would
have been far better off ``had we bombed before'' Baghdad had a
chance to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But many congressional figures said the plan to oust Hussein has
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's easier said than done,'' Senator Arlen Specter,
Republican of Pennsylvania, told CNN Sunday. ``But I think that's,
candidly, the next objective and I'm glad to hear the president
talk about it openly and forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to suspend the threat of military force
was made as international acceptance that American military action
was inevitable began to dry up Saturday when Hussein sent a
conciliatory message to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with clear signs that Baghdad was looking to reverse
course, France, Russia and China, all members of the Security
Council, found it increasingly untenable to back US military
action.
</P>
<P>
   Arab countries that had earlier blamed Baghdad for provoking
Washington made it clear Sunday that they were satisfied that Iraq
no longer deserved to be targeted by US cruise missiles and
warplanes. ``Now we are not talking about military strikes,'' said
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. ``The problem we hope will be
defused.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain, the closest US ally, began looking for a
diplomatic exit from the crisis as early as Saturday night,
signaling that it was time to test Iraq's word. Senior UN sources
said that British Prime Minister Tony Blair phoned Clinton late
Saturday night and appealed to him to give the Iraqis another a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Sunday that British and American forces still
``remain on alert'' to bomb Hussein. ``Saddam is now trapped,'' he
told reporters outside his office at 10 Downing Street. ``One false
move and he can be hit legitimately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no further warning whatsoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said the Clinton administration should have
expected Hussein's last-minute diplomatic entreaty. Laurie Mylroie,
the publisher of the Iraq News bulletin and a critic of the Clinton
administration, said she listened in disbelief Sunday to the
president's announcement that the crisis was ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic,'' Mylroie said. ``The administration should
have been prepared for Saddam to back down. They should have had a
list of steps he had to take within 48 hours to show he really is
complying with his promises'' to let weapons inspectors back to
work. ``They should have had punishment for not complying.''
</P>
<P>
   But UN Secretary General Kofi Annan joined many other world
leaders in praising Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful to President Clinton for the courageous and
difficult decisions, which he announced earlier today. ... This is
a victory for diplomacy,'' Annan said. ``Iraq must move swiftly to
insure complete and unconditional compliance.''

CLINTON SAYS US WILL WORK TO OUST SADDAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By GREG McDONALD &QL; 
 &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton upped the ante Sunday in the deadly
game being played out with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, saying
he plans to intensify efforts to remove him from power in the
aftermath of the latest crisis that moved right to the brink of
war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called off a Saturday U.S. airstrike against Iraq after
Saddam sent an urgent series of letters to the United Nations
promising to comply unconditionally with demands that he allow
weapons inspections to resume.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who came under fire for not ``pulling the trigger''
on Saddam, as one member of Congress put it, said the United States
and its allies would ``remain vigilant, keep up the pressure and be
ready to act'' immediately if Iraq shows any signs of reneging on
its latest commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough. Now Iraq must
live up to its obligations,'' Clinton told reporters Sunday at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Defense Secretary William Cohen and other members of
his national security team, Clinton stopped short of calling for
Saddam's overthrow. But he made it clear that the United States
will follow through with financial support and other efforts aimed
at stirring up opposition to Saddam from within Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the latest crisis ``demonstrates, unfortunately,
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein remains an impediment to the
well-being of his people and a threat to the peace of the region
and the security of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long term,'' Clinton added, ``the best way to address
that threat is through a government in Baghdad _ a new government _
that is committed to represent and respect its people, not repress
them, that is committed to peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments were echoed by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who said that he would keep British forces in the Persian
Gulf region on alert to provide support to U.S. forces if military
action is eventually called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be sure that what the Iraqis are saying they will
do ... This is not over yet,'' he cautioned, adding that every
promise Iraq has made this time must be ``bolted down'' before U.S.
and British forces are withdrawn from the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain ready, willing and able to strike at any point in
time,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials said they expect to have international
inspectors, who were pulled out of Iraq completely last week, back
in Baghdad within the next two days. Richard Butler, who is in
charge of the U.N. inspection effort, said he was ordering the
inspectors to return to Iraq on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler said he believed it would take longer than that to
get enough personnel and equipment in place again to carry out the
kind of surprise inspections that have already uncovered and led to
the destruction of various elements in Iraq's chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest crisis began on Oct. 31 when Saddam said he would no
longer allow inspections to continue and called on the U.N. to end
economic and other sanctions imposed against his country. Saddam
claimed again that he was not producing weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday that there is no
doubt, however, that Iraq is continuing to manufacture biological
weapons like VX nerve gas and missiles capable of delivering them
to nearby nations. He said inspectors have also found plenty of
evidence that Iraq is continuing an aggressive biological and
nuclear procurement effort abroad in violation of the agreement it
signed in 1991 ending the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aborted an airstrike against Iraq Saturday as U.S.
bombers were on their way to selected targets and fighter planes
aboard the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower in the Persian Gulf were
being prepared for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen confirmed to reporters that the order to strike had
already been given early Saturday and the planned attack was nearly
played out ``right up to the end'' when Iraq sent its first letter
to the U.N. promising to back down. But the initial letter was
unacceptable, he said, and Iraq was forced to send to follow-up
statement pledging unconditional cooperation before Clinton issued
a final order for U.S. forces to stand down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close, very close,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   As insurance to help guarantee Saddam's latest promise of
compliance, Cohen said the buildup of American forces in the region
would continue through the Thanksgiving holiday in case military
action becomes necessary. By Thanksgiving, some 22 U.S. Navy ships
will be in the Persian Gulf along with the Eisenhower. Altogether,
some 45,000 U.S. military personnel will be on station in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Iraqi ambassador Nizar Hamdoon claimed a
partial victory for Saddam, saying that his leader had at least
``succeeded in getting a good hearing'' about his frustration with
continued international sanctions that were put in place after the
war.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamdoon acknowledged that inspectors would be allowed to go
``anywhere they want.'' Asked what forced Iraq to back down this
time, Hamdoon said, ``We have decided to give it a chance because
peace, stability, preventing war, I think, is a noble goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get out of this crisis. We are not interested in
getting into another one,'' Hamdoon said later as the U.N. Security
Council began a meeting on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's decision to call off military strikes was
welcomed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as ``courageous'' and
``statesmanlike,'' it was strongly criticized by some Republican
senators who have long advocated using force against Saddam to
remove him from power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he thought it was a mistake to reverse
course on the brink of airstrikes and called on Clinton to push
ahead with destruction of sites known to be part of Saddam's
weapons programs. He also called for strikes against Saddam's
military forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have the forces moving there now, we ought to use
them,'' Lugar said, adding that diplomacy with Saddam has been a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're in the dodge and weave period again,'' he said on
NBC's Meet the Press. ``We've been embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also called for assassination to be
considered as an option to get rid of Saddam, even though it is
outlawed by U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the criticism, Clinton agreed that military action
would ``significantly degrade the capability of Saddam Hussein to
develop weapons of mass destruction.'' But he said it would also
mark the end of the U.N. presence in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would delay it, but we would have no oversight, no insight,
no involvement in what is going on within Iraq,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return of the inspectors, if they can act in an unfettered
way, is the best outcome because they have been and they remain the
most effective tool to uncover, destroy and prevent Iraq from
rebuilding its weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to
deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the U.N. Security Council meeting Sunday, Annan said
that member nations were satisfied that Iraq had agreed
unconditionally to allow inspections to continue. But he conceded
that he could not guarantee that the new agreement will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you that there will not be a next time,'' he
said. ``But if there is a next time, I'm not sure there will be
enough time for diplomatic appeals.''

US LEADERS KEEP AN EYE ON ASIAN ECONOMIC SITUATION AS FORUM BEGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ While most Americans don't know a
ringgit from a rupiah, U.S. voters are hypersensitive to the value
of their own money and are quickly troubled when a dollar won't buy
as much as they think it should.
</P>
<P>
   That's why both U.S. political parties are keeping a wary eye on
the Asian economic crisis and this week's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, where Vice President Al Gore will join leaders
from 20 other Pacific Rim nations.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began 16 months ago with a run on Thailand's
currency, the baht, then spread quickly to other southeast Asian
monetary units, including the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian
rupiah.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. political leaders are equally cautious about international
financial turbulence beyond the Pacific region, especially in
Russia and Latin America, and particularly about what any of these
foreign crises mean to the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   For woe be unto the American politician, especially a
presidential candidate, whom voters tie to economic bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush _ three of the
last five U.S. presidents _ who each failed to hang on to the White
House at least in part because voters thought the U.S. economy had
headed south.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got to put money on one variable'' in the political
equation, said Michael Lewis-Beck, a University of Iowa political
scientist, ``just look at how the economy's doing. That's going to
take you farther than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter satisfaction with the U.S. economy and President Clinton's
stewardship of it over the last six years was found in exit polls
to be a factor in his Democrats' better-than-expected showing in
congressional elections earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear sailing for Democrats, especially Gore,
Clinton's close ally and the leading contender for his party's
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth month in a row, consumer confidence fell in
October _ to its lowest level in two years, according to the
Conference Board's closely followed index of how Americans are
feeling about their economic future. But the measure is still
firmly in positive territory after hitting a record high in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a little less optimistic about the future, but it
hasn't had a major impact yet,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a political
scientist at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, however, is real for Democrats in general and Gore
in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the meltdown that began in Asia and has been moving in our
direction leaves our economy weakened or even stalled in the year
before the 2000 election, the probability of the Republicans
recapturing the White House increases dramatically,'' said Thomas
Mann of the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that even without pronounced spillover
from the Asian crisis, some issues arising from the globalization
of the economy will enter the domestic political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the points emphasized by liberal economists and
social policy advocates is the stark difference between what the
move to a borderless financial world has meant to workers and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a 20 percent increase in productivity, (and) the
typical worker has nothing to show for it,'' Dean Baker of the
Washington-based Economic Policy Institute told a recent forum.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant, Mark Weisbrot of the Preamble Center, said
later that the decline in real wages is ``the most outrageous''
consequence of the headlong drive to a global economy. He predicts
it is an issue that could play a major role in the next
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you it will be there in 2000,'' Weisbrot said. ``I
think even the establishment candidates are going to have to deal
with this. The whole spectrum is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   And beneath the residual overall public approval of Clinton's
handling of the economy, already there are some heavy clouds on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has lost for the foreseeable future his free hand in
international trade negotiations because of Congress' refusal to
grant him ``fast track'' authority. The power, routinely accorded
to administrations over the last several decades, was withheld
because of a ``strange bedfellows'' coalition of liberal Democrats
who want worker and environmental protections incorporated into
trade deals and conservative Republicans who see an erosion of
sovereignty in the massive pacts.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the greatest difficulty did Clinton secure additional
U.S. cash for the International Monetary Fund, which he said was
needed to guarantee bailout deals in case the Asian economic flu
spread, particularly to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal and conservative economists have taken heart in
Congress' recalcitrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is finally the well-justified backlash against a global
process that has really kind of put people last,'' Weisbrot said.
``I think it keeps building, especially if the economy slows down,
which it inevitably will.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, such as Lawrence Lau of Stanford's Hoover
Institution, discount any relationship between Asia's slide or
other international financial problems and U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exports are 12 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product, Lau said, and exports to Asia have been running 30 percent
of that, or 3.6 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aggregate, that's not going to make a big difference,''
Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many political scientists believe economic problems have
to hit very close to home before discomfort is felt at the polls.
But at that point it can be very direct and compelling. Carter was
denied a second term in 1980 partly because the second Arab oil
shock was being felt by average Americans in a dose of short gas
supplies and long lines at filling stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are very real impacts if people see the economy
not doing well,'' said Bruce Oppenheimer, a political scientist at
Vanderbilt University. ``But clearly a bigger effect is if they're
not doing well.''

A TRUCKLOAD OF `HOWEVERS' BURDENS THE IRAQIS' PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Even before the Security Council resolved
Sunday night to give Iraq a chance to prove that it really intends
to resume cooperation with arms inspectors, some familiar code
words for trouble were in the air.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to promise that no sites, including presidential
properties belonging to Saddam Hussein and his security services,
would be barred to inspectors as in the past, Iraq's representative
Nizar Hamdoon reminded reporters that certain ``modalities''
governed searches of such places, according to the agreement signed
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in February.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement effectively ended serious inspections of those
palaces and other properties and allowed only one round of pro
forma visits by monitors chaperoned by teams of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, when the Security Council meeting ended
Sunday night, Sergei Lavrov, Russia's representative and Iraq's
most outspoken advocate in deliberations, quickly noted that Iraqi
points about a comprehensive review of sanctions against Baghdad
would have to be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors may be back in Iraq as early as Tuesday.
But the level of skittishness about taking Iraq at its word this
time was manifest in the delay in beginning Sunday's Security
Council session. The postponement arose from fears that an Iraqi
official was already rolling back the added clarifications that
allowed President Clinton to give Iraq a chance to prove itself and
avoid a military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute hitch arose when Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister and spokesman on the arms issue, said in a CNN interview
from Baghdad that Iraq was committed only to what he had written to
Annan on Saturday. ``Nothing beyond that,'' he added for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   That letter was rejected as inadequate by the Clinton
administration, which refused to join a Security Council consensus
this weekend until two further, brief letters were received from
Hamdoon. Those letters removed some ambiguities in Iraq's pledges.
Was Aziz now disavowing them?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative and this month's
Council president, asked Annan to straighten this out with Aziz,
who told the secretary-general on the telephone late Sunday
afternoon that he regarded Hamdoon's letters as part of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, it was not surprising that the Council
prefaced the most critical paragraph in its statement with,
``Taking note of past experience with Iraq ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain vigilant and alert,'' said the British envoy, Sir
Jeremy Greenstock, after the meeting. The Council demanded that the
Iraqis show their intentions with ``unconditional and sustained
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those intentions will be tested as early as Tuesday, when more
than 100 arms inspectors are expected to return to Baghdad, said
Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   His inspectors, who monitor biological, chemical and missile
systems, and those of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who
watch Iraq's nuclear activities, have been in Bahrain since
Wednesday, when they were withdrawn in the face of a possible
American military strike.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 relief workers will also be returning to Iraq from
Amman, Jordan, most as early as Monday, said Benon Sevan, director
of the Iraq humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has long sought a review of sanctions on its terms, with
the lifting of sanctions foreordained. By referring to Iraq's
talking points for such a review, contained in an annex to the
letter to Annan Saturday, Lavrov raised a matter that is a virtual
anathema to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov also returned to the dormant theme of the behavior of
UNSCOM inspectors, a theme Iraq plays on when explaining why it
will not tolerate spot inspections at certain sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNSCOM also has to be guided by general principles, including
the respect for sovereignty of Iraq and respect for dignity of Iraq
and, of course, its territorial integrity,'' Lavrov said. ``I
believe that those are very clear provisions, and there were
instances in the past that some UNSCOM members were not entirely
within those parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration no longer blocking agreement on
how to respond to Saddam's overture on Saturday, the Security
Council met Sunday only to acknowledge formally Iraq's decision to
resume cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite predictions among diplomats that some Council members
would take the opportunity to criticize Clinton, albeit
diplomatically, for his comments about helping dissidents overthrow
Saddam, which many did not consider conducive to fostering
cooperation from Baghdad, the administration was applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Most Council members and U.N. officials did not support the use
of force to end this crisis. Their sense of relief was summed up by
Annan after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``In common with many members of the Security Council, I am
grateful to President Clinton for the courageous and the difficult
decision he took earlier today,'' Annan said. ``This is a victory
for all those who express their firm determination that United
Nations Security Council resolutions must be respected. It is a
victory for diplomacy and resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``for the crisis to be put permanently behind
us, Iraq must move swiftly to insure complete and unconditional
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who has now been through two major crises with Iraq in
less than a year, said he could give no guarantees that this new
agreement would work. But alluding to the threat of American and
British military strikes hanging over Iraq, he added: ``I'm not
sure that if there is a next time, we would even have time for
further diplomatic initiatives and appeals.''

OLD-TIMERS HONOR LATKA, ARAGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They came from a different age of boxing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In their time, the sport was !ital!the!off! pro game in town, at
least until the Rams landed in L.A. in 1946. Even then, Angelenos
loved a good fight and the men who did the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing fans could go to the fights six days a week in venues
throughout the city at that time, they swear. And, as with the
Shaquille O'Neals of today, everyone knew who the top contenders
were and treated them as they did the biggest movie stars of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   This was the era in which George Latka and Art Aragon plied
their trade.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, about 100 former fighters _ spanning seven decades
of boxing _ gathered with friends and family at the Old Spaghetti
Factory in Hollywood to honor Latka and Aragon on their birthdays,
Latka's 84th, Aragon's 71st.
</P>
<P>
   It was an opportunity for old friends in this tight fraternity
to get together, as many of them do every Tuesday afternoon at the
Spaghetti Factory.
</P>
<P>
   However, this was a special day, Latka's and Aragon's day, and
the focus was on them.
</P>
<P>
   Latka, remarkably lucid and thrilled to be honored, believes he
was the first professional boxer to graduate from college (UCLA,
'44). That, he said, was his greatest accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The retired teacher, who now lives in Huntington Beach, wasn't
bad inside the ropes, either.
</P>
<P>
   A master boxer who took few punches, he was one of the best
featherweights in the world in the late 1930s and early '40s. He
beat several world champions in a time when titles were meaningful
_ including L.A. legend Baby Arizmendi, who twice outpointed the
great Henry Armstrong _ but fell just short of winning a title
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he made a few dollars (a few thousand on a good night)
and rubbed elbows with the biggest names in Hollywood. He and his
wife, Trudie, still get Christmas cards from Bob Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very well known,'' said Latka, who was managed by actor
George Raft. ``It got to the point where I didn't like to go out in
Hollywood. I'd go to a restaurant or something and I'd get
approached by all kinds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``...In the day time, I couldn't even walk down the street. In
retrospect, I enjoyed it, I guess, but it got to be a pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Latka, who became a referee and judge after his career, follows
boxing closely and has his opinions, from his strong feelings that
the Nevada State Athletic Commission was right to give Mike Tyson a
license to the ridiculous notion that the sport is slowly dying.
</P>
<P>
   However, he spoke most passionately about the proliferation of
all-but-meaningless sanctioning bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a growing number of belts, Latka, as well as Aragon,
probably would've won at least one championship and reaped the
rewards that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   But Latka likes it the way it was, when there were eight
champions _ period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, television is fleecing the public,'' he said, an angry
tone in his voice as he discussed TV's insistence that its bouts be
for one title or another. ``There are so many damn world champions.
Who the hell knows who they are? I don't even pay attention to
who's champion anymore, I pay attention to INDIVIDUAL fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay attention to (Oscar) De La Hoya because he's going to be
one of the great fighters of all time,'' he added, slipping in
another well-thought-out opinion. ``He's boxing better now,
feinting, jabbing, counterpunching nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Aragon was the first to be called ``Golden Boy,'' the moniker De
La Hoya has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   And in this town, he was at LEAST as well known as the latest
incarnation. Aragon wasn't necessarily loved, particularly after
twice beating L.A.'s beloved Enrique Bolanos. From then on, he was
lustily booed by packed crowds at the Olympic Auditorium _ like the
bad guy in professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The fans had to respect his ability, though. Aragon, one of the
finest lightweights of his time, came within a few punches of
becoming world champ when he lost a close decision to titleholder
Jimmy Carter in 1951, his only world-title shot.
</P>
<P>
   Win, lose or draw, Aragon loved every minute of it, the cheers
and jeers in the ring, the never-ending attention in the media and
on the street, the countless women, the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, with those years long gone, Aragon, a successful bail
bondsman in Van Nuys, appreciated the best wishes of his friends
but wasn't as excited as Latka about visiting the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good and bad side,'' said Aragon, who normally spews
a joke a minute. ``It reminds me of what was and what could've
been. It also tells me that it's over. That's the part that hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``...It was so nice fighting. There's no feeling quite like
walking into the ring. Even the boos were fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Latka, Aragon doesn't have a problem with the number of
alphabet-soup championships. It gives more fighters opportunities
to make names for themselves, he reasons.
</P>
<P>
   And although he insists there were more quality fighters in his
day, he doesn't believe fighters from his era were any better _ or
worse _ than today's fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the biggest difference in boxing? Actually, nothing,''
he said. ``...Boxing is really no different now than it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the fighters change.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: A news conference to announce Mike Tyson's
return to boxing, scheduled for Tuesday, has been postponed because
all the details have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is expected to face Francois Botha of South Africa on
Jan.16 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas....
</P>
<P>
   Welterweight contender Oba Carr, one of the many in line to
fight De La Hoya, is scheduled to headline Thursday's card at the
Country Club in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Peter Broudy was still looking for an opponent over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-round junior welterweight bout between Ricky Quiles and
Francisco Mendez is listed as the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Victor Ortiz of Simi Valley faces Joaquin Felix in a
six-round cruiserweight bout, and Juan Lazcano takes on Oligario De
Leon in an eight-round lightweight bout. Lazcano has been sparring
with Arturo Gatti.

FAVRE PLAYS LIKE A QUARTERBACK THE GIANTS NEED 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As soon as Bret Favre's dart stuck in
Tyrone Davis' hands for a 2-yard touchdown pass in the first
quarter on Sunday, a voice in the press box intoned: ``That is
Favre's 200th touchdown pass; he's the second-fastest to 200 in NFL
history. He did it in his 107th game; Dan Marino did it in his 89th
game.''
</P>
<P>
   On another Favre completion in the second quarter, the Green Bay
Packers' quarterback soared over 25,000 career passing yards. When
he collaborated with Davis, his tight end, for a 60-yard score and
his 201st touchdown pass, he tied Roman Gabriel for 21st place on
the career list. And he's only 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Packers' 37-3 rout, the changes in the
out-of-town results on the scoreboard were more compelling than
anything the Giants did. As the remnants of 76,272 spectators
watched the final minutes, Favre displayed what the Packers possess
and what the Giants so desperately need: a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In another dreary performance, Danny Kanell completed only
 &UR; eight &LR;  of 20 passes for only 88 yards with two interceptions and
three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Coach Jim Fassel would not confirm that
Kanell would be the quarterback in the Giants' next game _ even
against the 2-8 Eagles, who lost on Sunday to the now 2-8 Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   All that Fassel would say about the identity of next Sunday's
quarterback was, ``I don't know yet,'' meaning Kent Graham, the
backup who completed 2 of 5 passes for 12 yards, might start.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants now having lost five of six games for a 3-7
record, Kanell keeps getting worse. He talked about ``this being
part of the struggle you have to go through'' as a young
quarterback, but the Giants' hierarchy has to be wondering if the
struggle is just too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Kanell suddenly shows much more potential over the rest
of the season, Fassel and General Manager Ernie Accorsi must be
hoping that there's a quality quarterback who will still be
available in the National Football League's annual stock show of
prime beef in April.
</P>
<P>
   The touted names are Kentucky's Tim Couch (if he doesn't decide
to remain in college for another season), Central Florida's Daunte
Culpepper, UCLA's Cade McNown, Kansas State's Mi &UR; chael &LR;  Bishop and
Washington's Brock Huard.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Cleveland Browns II have the first choice in
April. And three other teams with a worse record than the Giants
are expected to covet a young quarterback _ the Carolina Panthers,
now at 1-9, along with the Eagles and the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Giants were to grab one of the touted rookie
quarterbacks, they also would be wise to hire an older quarterback
to get through the next season or two, as the Jets did in signing
Vinny Testeverde and as the Buffalo Bills did in importing Doug
Flutie from the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Giants do, they can't go into next season with only
Kanell, Graham and their current third-stringer, Mike Cherry, as
the only quarterbacks on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants' offense unable to generate a touchdown now for
nearly 10 quarters, Kanell has shown himself to be no better than
the departed Dave Brown, if not worse. And with Favre on display
Sunday, the Giants' loyalists saw the quality of quarterback the
Giants need if they are to be a Super Bowl contender again.
</P>
<P>
   No other quarterback slings the ball off balance or off his back
foot the way Favre does. And no other quarterback seems to exhult
in the fun of the game the way Favre does.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Giants, Favre hit 21 of 33 for 267 yards and two
touchdowns with no interceptions. And if Mike Holmgren, the
Packers' coach, had let him throw more than two passes, which he
completed, in the final quarter, Favre would have had a 300-yard
game, maybe a 400-yard game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're a little bored now, aren't you?'''
Holmgren would say later, alluding to the fourth-quarter leash.
``He gave me that little smile and said, `You're not letting me
throw.'''
</P>
<P>
   Told later of Holmgren's remark, Favre smiled that mischievous
smile and denied he was bored, saying, ``I wouldn't call it bored.
I was happy we were up, I was pleased with the way we were playing,
but I don't think I was bored.'' Maybe not, but he would have
rather been throwing passes.
</P>
<P>
   As for his 201 touchdown passes and 25,000-plus passing yards,
Favre didn't seem impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know that until you just told me,'' he said. ``I
couldn't tell you who I passed, because no one cares. What's
important is how many Super Bowl rings you put on your fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre already has one of those rings. But the Giants can't
even dream of Super Bowl rings until they find a much better
quarterback.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Harold Bloom was 15, he saw the Old Vic perform ``Henry IV,
Part 1'' on Broadway. Ralph Richardson played Falstaff and Laurence
Olivier was Hotspur (doubling in ``Henry IV, Part 2'' as Justice
Shallow). To this day, Bloom has no recollection of who played
Prince Hal (it was Michael Warre), but seeing Richardson was, for
him, a transcendent experience.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had already read many of the plays, that performance
began his lifelong love for Shakespeare and in particular for the
character of Falstaff. That love culminates 52 years later in
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead Books).
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is in a sense a tribute to what Richardson did to
me,'' Bloom said in a recent interview. This is his 23rd book and
the one, he said, on which his reputation ultimately will rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, Falstaff has become Bloom's alter ego.
A man of comparable girth and outrageousness _ intellectual and
linguistic as well as corporeal _ he looks like Falstaff, or,
rather, like the actor Charles Laughton might have looked in that
role. In antic moments, this polymathic professor and literary
critic refers to himself as Sir John Bloomstaff, enthusiastically
accepting any twinning of the two, even warming to a friend's
notion that the real author of ``The Invention of the Human'' is
Falstaff. One fully expects him to sprinkle his conversation with
``Zounds!''
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic Bloom fashion, the book is voluminous,
idiosyncratic and dutifully unscholarly, with no footnotes and not
even an index. He wants it ``to be useful to common readers and
common playgoers'' and not to those academics that he scathingly
criticizes. ``I don't want a single person, with a few honorable
exceptions, who ostensibly teach Shakespeare to even look at the
book. They're hideous ideologues, pseudo Marxists, pseudo
feminists, pseudo historicists and disciples of Foucault,'' ending
his list of enemies with the French philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Bloom regards himself as a man without ideology, as
``a pure esthete.'' ``I care about Shakespeare,'' he said,
``because he not only meets the highest esthetic and cognitive
standards, he sets our esthetic and cognitive standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversation as in the book, he is filled with highly
opinionated, often injudicious comments, like his suggestion that
``King John'' is a better play than ``Richard III.'' Comparing
Shakespeare to contemporary politics, he says that Newt Gingrich is
a parody of Gratiano in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' while Kenneth
Starr is ``Polonius on the outside, Iago on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   About Hamlet, he said: ``He is a coldblooded fellow who winds up
loving absolutely no one. He simply is the most intelligent
character in any work of literature I've ever read.'' About
Rosalind, the love of his Shakespearean life, he has no
reservations: ``She's wholly normative _ a miracle of healthiness,
good sense, lovability.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bloom, Falstaff is not the taproom roustabout who leads
Prince Hal astray, but a quintessential lover of life and a man of
great wit and acumen. ``I like him because he is alive beyond
belief,'' he said, quoting the character's line ``Give me life,''
and adding, ``How often have I said to a friend, `Before I knew
thee ... I knew nothing and now am I, if a man should speak truly,
little better than one of the wicked'?'' This was a case of
Falstaff's turning the tables on Prince Hal, suggesting that it was
Hal who had corrupted Falstaff.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bloom-scape, Hal is not a hero but a ``charming
villain.'' Bloom follows with a characteristically sweeping
statement, ``No king is a good guy, except for poor Lear.'' Among
the saddest lines in Shakespeare, of course, is Hal's regal snub of
Falstaff, ``I know thee not, old man.'' Mr. Bloom seems to take
that statement personally.
</P>
<P>
   Because the book deals in detail with his favorite Shakespearean
characters, in addition to Falstaff and Rosalind, Hamlet,
Cleopatra, Iago and Edmund the Bastard, as well as his favorite
plays (``Henry IV,'' ``Twelfth Night,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra''),
he thought about calling it ``The Characters of Shakespeare's
Plays,'' borrowing the title from a work by William Hazlitt. Then
he decided that ``The Invention of the Human'' was more specific
and more comprehensive, although to those unfamiliar with Bloom, it
might sound Frankensteinian rather than Bloomstaffian.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the title, he said that with writers before
Shakespeare _ with the exception of Chaucer _ characters did not
change inwardly: ``I think our kind of inwardness, which really
means our sense of personality, is a Shakespearean invention. He
more than prefigured our humanity, its quandaries and dilemmas.
Shakespeare so deeply pervades not just Western culture but by now,
so far as I can tell, all the world's culture.'' And wherever his
plays are done ``even people who are not overwhelmingly literate
recognize themselves and feel that Shakespeare has put them on the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   He is amazed not only at Shakespeare's productivity, ``39 plays
of which 24 or 25 are in every way masterworks,'' but also that no
one else ``has had so powerful, fecund and inventive a mind, such a
control of language and mastery of human psychology.'' He
continued: ``As Bottom says of his dreams, the plays are
bottomless. The miracle of Shakespeare is that he is all this and
he's also a popular entertainer. His plays sold out in his day, and
they will always sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadfastly, Bloom maintains that Shakespeare's characters are
capable of change, even a villain like Edmund in ``King Lear.''
This, he said, was revolutionary in drama, and altered the
perception of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he himself had changed over the years, Bloom spoke
about the shifts in his role as a scholar and writer: ``I began as
a fierce Romantic revivalist of Blake and Shelley, in particular,
pushing aside T.S. Eliot and the New Critics as they were then
called. They seemed to be a kind of neo-Christian cabal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``middle phase,'' starting with his 1973 book, ``The
Anxiety of Influence,'' he became preoccupied with the question of
literary influence. In 1990, with ``The Book of J,'' he began his
third, religious phase. With ``The Western Canon,'' his territory
was all of Western literature. At the end of that book was a
greatly disputed list of the most valuable works of literature. Now
he says: ``You don't need a list. All you need is Shakespeare.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's ``Shakespeare'' has been nominated for a National Book
Award, but as is often the case with his work it has received a
mixed critical reception. A review in The New Yorker said it made
more sense ``as an enraptured, incantatory epic than as a courteous
explication of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the interview, Bloom announced that he had
not read that entire review, but within minutes he was quoting from
it: ``He said that for those who like me, I was a Prospero of
criticism waving his wand; and for my detractors, I was nothing but
a baffled and superannuated old Lear.'' Tossed between ``The
Tempest'' and ``King Lear,'' naturally he would prefer Falstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was a performance that turned Bloom into a
Shakespearean, with rare exceptions (Brian Bedford, Ian McKellen)
actors are not high on his list as interpreters. Nor are directors.
He called Peter Brook's historic gymnastic production of ``A
Midsummer's Night Dream'' ``a disaster,'' a word he ecumenically
applies to Kenneth Branagh ``in general.'' And he said he walked
out on Ralph Fiennes' ``Hamlet'' because he thought that the actor
played it as if ``he were a poor, spoiled little rich boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom insists that he wants better productions, but his
theatrical visits have been sporadic and exclusionary. He added
with evident pride, ``I missed as many performances as I could,
after a certain point.''
</P>
<P>
   He is completely dismissive of several Shakespearean plays,
beginning with ``Titus Andronicus,'' saying he does not want to see
it again unless it is spoofed by Mel Brooks. One of many innovative
productions that he did not see was Deborah Warner's version at
Stratford-on-Avon. It stressed not the play's grotesquerie but its
heightened sense of reality, turning Titus into a peasant warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Bloom see Sam Mendes' version of ``Troilus and
Cressida,'' or Peter Brook's ``Timon of Athens,'' which illuminated
the play through the prism of the modern liberal dilemma: Timon as
an easy mark. In each case, a director shed new light on a problem
play. Bloom also missed Robert Stephens' authoritative portrayal of
Falstaff in Adrian Noble's 1992 production at Stratford-on-Avon.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Bloom emphasizes the text. Growing up in the Bronx in
a Yiddish-speaking family, he taught himself to read English before
he was 5. An omnivorous speed reader, he could cover 500 pages in
an hour, he said, and also has a prodigious memory.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 34 years, he has been teaching at Yale (and
concurrently at New York University), and for the last 20 years he
has been teaching Shakespeare: ``I told the very amiable current
president of Yale that I intend to be carried out of my last Yale
class in a body bag, hopefully many years down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In their home in New Haven, Conn., he and his wife, Jeanne,
``drown in books,'' some 60,000 with thousands more in his two Yale
offices. His next book, a change of pace, will be a slim volume
entitled ``How to Read and Why.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his affinity for Shakespeare, he was asked if he
would have preferred to have lived during the Elizabethan Age. He
answered in the negative: ``Obviously if one is Jewish, it is
better to be alive in either 19th- or 20th-century America than
anywhere else in human history. I will settle for having been born
in 1930 in the East Bronx. Transpose me back to some other period,
and I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But, were he to time-travel, he might find Falstaff in a pub
lifting a tankard. Was there, in fact, a real Falstaff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``William Shakespeare, himself. The fat man
was inside the skinny fellow. There was more of Shakespeare in
Falstaff than in Hamlet, or in Rosalind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's idea of Arcadia is the Forest of Arden in ``As You Like
It.'' His voice brimmed with emotion as he merged with his favorite
character and recounted Bloomstaff's Dream: ``To be Sir John
Falstaff, not rejected in dead of grief, but still boisterous and
sitting on a tree stump in the Forest of Arden, trying to outfox
Rosalind.''

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Lawrence Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp. and
longtime foe of Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, failed in his
first effort to undermine the dominance of the Windows family of
operating systems with a concept called the network computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has struck upon a new strategy that would do away with
the operating system almost entirely on the powerful computers
known as servers that act as the control centers of large networks.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Comdex computer industry trade show, which opened
here Sunday, Ellison plans to introduce a new version of his Oracle
database program, code-named ``raw iron,'' that he hopes will be
sold by companies that make network servers, including Compaq, Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new database program will require only a small stub
of an operating system, known as a kernel, the system will be
faster and more reliable, Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   His network computer, or NC, was an earlier attempt at
simplifying the task of corporate PC managers by offering them
simple and inexpensive hardware that would run a World Wide Web
browser program. NCs failed to catch on, however, largely because
of the rapidly falling cost of the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to give up, he is now arguing that the NC is any device
that incorporates a Web browser. These can range from something as
simple as a cellular phone to a television set or a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing what he calls the Oracle Data Base Server
Appliance, Ellison will be trying to open a back door to realizing
the NC and laying out a new strategy in his three-year-long war for
the high ground in the increasingly bitter software marketing wars.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle Data Base Server Appliance is a refrigerator-sized
computer that will store all of a company's data, including e-mail,
text files and accounting information. Such a server, he maintains,
will require much less management and be simpler to use than a
standard server, which often has to run dozens of different
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry executives said Ellison's server appliance
might prove more difficult for Microsoft to defuse than the network
computer was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large market for dedicated appliances on computer
networks,'' said Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell Corp.,
which sells network server systems. ``It is a real revenue
opportunity, and it minimizes the role of the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Ellison has criticized Microsoft's strategy to
place millions of servers running Windows 2000 _ the new name for
Windows NT _ in small businesses and large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison says the strategy will prove costly and unmanageable for
businesses. And he accuses Microsoft of worsening the shortage of
high-technology workers in the United States because its systems
require so many people to administer.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative vision of computing, Ellison's system would
centralize the storage of information.
</P>
<P>
   His critics call it a look backward toward the era of the
mainframe computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the files where they are,'' said Janet Perna, general
manager of IBM's database business. IBM's rival DB2 system, she
said, employs pointers on the central server that lead people to
data distributed among many computers in a corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the database market is crucial because these
enormous electronic filing cabinets are the increasingly essential
software programs that permit large and small corporations to track
and control all aspects of their business. Applications can range
from running a corporation accounting system to e-mail servers that
act as electronic post offices.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for market share in the $8.6 billion database
industry has become a crucial beachhead for software companies that
offer one-stop shopping for the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, says Dataquest, a market research firm, almost 53
percent of the market for corporate databases has been controlled
by Oracle and IBM, which created the most popular format, the
relational database. However, Microsoft, which has only a 4.5
percent market share, is preparing to enter the business.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison, who has taunted Microsoft and Gates for years with
barbed, often humorous attacks, may have found a way to confound
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   By dispensing with all but a tiny portion of the operating
system, Ellison argues, he will be able to offer a faster, cheaper
and more stable product than Microsoft's SQL Server 7, a database
for Windows 2000 that will be announced at Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters at his home in San Francisco, Ellison
said, ``I don't know why Microsoft should be threatened; we're just
saying that you don't need an operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Oracle's strategy could offer direct competition
to Windows. The Oracle 8i database can run multiple Java programs,
and it includes its own file system for storing and retrieving
documents _ functions typically performed by an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is still negotiating with computer companies about
bundling the new 8i database program with powerful server hardware,
Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing details have yet to be worked out, but he said he
expected the appliance databases to be on the market by the end of
the first quarter of next year.

   NEW YORK _ One of the groups from Artwalk NY, a series of tours
through artists' studios, shuffled into Michael Brennan's little
work space on the Bowery. As the visitors settled in, Brennan, 33,
gamely tried to explain his paintings, rectangles of evenly applied
scarlet paint framing smaller rectangles of wild brush strokes and
dried ridges in blue and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't sign the painting, would you be offended if I
hung it vertically?'' asked Leny Struminger, a computer consultant
from East Brunswick, N.J. Brennan frowned. ``Yes, I would be,'' he
replied. ``I don't think there is any artist who doesn't think
about the top and the bottom of his paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   This lively collision of worlds on Saturday captured the spirit
of the fourth annual Artwalk NY, a three-part fund-raiser. Peter
Jennings, the ``ABC Nightly News'' anchor, and the actor Matt
Dillon presided over lectures and an auction. But the walking tours
were the centerpiece of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 60 artists _ from the famous, including Chuck Close,
Julian Schnabel and Jenny Holzer, to the not yet so famous, like
Brennan _ either donated works or opened their studios. The event
was run by the Coalition for the Homeless, which raised an
estimated $400,000 for its nine programs, including food
distribution and a summer camp. Last year's Artwalk raised
$370,000.
</P>
<P>
   The day began around 11 a.m. in the Puck Building at Lafayette
and Houston streets, where the critic Jerry Saltz entertained a
crowd of about 450 with an opinionated history of the art world in
the 1980s and '90s. ``Bodily fluids are extremely interesting,''
Saltz said, chiding certain artists for their use of unconventional
media. ``We just have to do more interesting things with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, who was to interview Close onstage after Saltz's
speech, was sitting in the audience when he received an urgent
page. ``The White House is skeptical,'' he whispered, referring to
negotiations with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that morning.
``But it would be difficult for me to be pulled away from this for
too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he took the stage and spent the next 45 minutes questioning
Close, 58, who is celebrated for his large-scale portraits and
admired for his fortitude in facing an illness that left him partly
paralyzed in mid-career and forced him to invent new ways to make
his art. ``Are you surprised that you are still painting heads?''
Jennings asked at one point. Close replied in his typical deadpan:
``I never thought I would find it as satisfying as it has been. Of
all the variables that I could alter in my work, the one that was
the least interesting was the subject. Keeping the heads has kept
me engaged with everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, the crowd broke up into groups of about 15
and began to go on the art walks. These were 2{-hour walking tours
of the studios of 40 artists around the city, including Mark
Kostabi, Kate Shepherd, Alice Aycock, Pat Steir, Louis Mendez and
Vito Acconci. The walkers, some led by experts and some on their
own, visited three studios each. In many cases, the artists were
present to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   The group that visited Brennan's studio was led by Lucas
Schoormans, an art dealer out of central casting, complete with a
German accent and a black turtleneck. In addition to Brennan's
Bowery studio, Schoormans took his group to the TriBeCa home of
Antonio Murado, a Spaniard who fills canvases with loops made
without lifting his brush off the canvas, and the SoHo studio of
Bing Wright, who makes collages of photographs of water and
flowers, as well as photos of wet windowpanes.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said it was an unusual experience for the artists
and for their guests. Ms. Aycock, whose studio loft is also her
home, said it had been a tiring but rewarding day. ``I don't know
how politicians do it,'' she said after being visited by three
different tours. ``You had to speak to people on all levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The long day ended on a sumptuous note as about 1,000 people
roamed the Puck Building, grazing on treats provided by 15
restaurants including Barocco, Alison on Dominick and Le Bernardin.
They also spent thousands of dollars at an auction conducted by
Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's. The most expensive
lot was ``Phil,'' a 1998 Polaroid portrait, mounted on aluminum, of
Philip Glass by Close which fetched $26,000. Close, who earlier in
the day had likened attending auctions of his work to watching cows
go to slaughter, had already gone home.

`WATERBOY' SPENDS SECOND WEEK ATOP WEEKEND BOX OFFICE DOG PILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adam Sandler's ``The Waterboy'' scored its second
consecutive victory at the nation's multiplexes with an impressive
$25.2 million at 2,675 theaters to dominate a robust weekend at the
nation's box office during Friday-Sunday, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave the football comedy nearly $80 million after 10
days, ensuring the Disney release will hit the $100 million mark
next weekend. Studio marketing executive Chuck Viane noted Sunday
the decline from the opening weekend was only 36 percent, showing
that ``The Waterboy'' has created broad appeal beyond its core
audience of young males.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really blossomed and is attracting all demographics,''
Viane said. ``We're getting kids that have seen it two and three
times already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy,'' costing a mere $19 million, will soon become
the 11th film to top the $100 million milestone this year. Its
unexpected success lifted the overall weekend to $103 million, 22
percent ahead of the same weekend last year, and underscored the
industry's continued powerful performance with year-to-date grosses
over $5.6 billion and 10 percent ahead of last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is just barreling along,'' said analyst Arthur
Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. ``It's being bailed out by these very
successful genre movies. That's what the movie business is all
about _ if you deliver the goods you've promised, you can make a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, has upgraded his estimate of the final domestic gross for
``The Waterboy'' to $150 million. ``People love this movie,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also performing respectably were two new entries _ Sony's
slasher sequel ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
Universal's Brad Pitt drama-comedy ``Meet Joe Black.'' Moviegoers
ignored the mostly negative notices with ``I Still Know'' taking
$17.5 million at 2,443 theaters and ``Joe'' pulling in $15 million
at 2,500 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``I Still Know'' will likely gross $60 million
overall, $12 million shy of the original, while ``Meet Joe Black''
could hit $75 million. He noted that the critics' chief complaint
about ``Joe'' _ its running time of nearly three hours _ carried
little weight with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the movie and they don't realize it's three hours
long,'' Bucksbaum said. ``If you're paying $8 for a movie, you want
to get your money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said ``Meet Joe Black,'' in which Pitt portrays the
Grim Reaper falling in love, is ``an adequate success story,''
given its relatively expensive reported cost of $75 million. ``It's
a respectable opening, because this is a difficult film to
market,'' he added. ``It's not going to make much money for the
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend of ``The Siege'' came in fourth with $8.1
million at 2,579 theaters as the thriller lost 42 percent of its
opening weekend audience. 20th Century Fox, which had been the
hottest studio over the summer, is likely to lose money on the $70
million project, now with $26.3 million after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' seventh weekend of ``Antz'' finished fifth with $4.2
million at 2,351 screens and has now topped $81 million overall.
The computer-animated comedy, rushed out to beat Disney's ``A Bug's
Life,'' edged New Line's fourth weekend of ``Pleasantville'' with
$4.1 million at 1,773 sites and Disney's unimpressive opening of
family comedy ``I'll Be Home For Christmas,'' starring Jonathan
Taylor Thomas, with $4 million at 1,759 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said Thomas' box office appeal has diminished as the
``Home Improvement'' star portrays a college student. ``He's at an
awkward age because most young teen-age girls prefer someone older
like Leonardo DiCaprio,'' he noted. ``It's a hard transition for a
child star to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. continued to post moderate results from its
restored version of the 1939 classic ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which
finished eighth with $3.3 million at 1,882 theaters in its second
weekend. New Line's third weekend of comedy-drama ``Living Out
Loud'' followed with $2.7 million at 1,087 screens, beating its
ninth weekend of ``Rush Hour'' with $2 million at 1,615 theaters.
``Rush Hour'' has grossed $130 million domestically, becoming the
88th movie to top that mark behind ``The Flintstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's second weekend of Academy Award contender
``Elizabeth'' continued to perform well in limited release with
$340,000 at 14 theaters. Miramax's Oscar hopeful ``Life Is
Beautiful'' generated respectable numbers in widened release with
$880,000 at 116 sites and Sony's Irish drama ``Dancing at
Lughnasa,'' with Meryl Streep, opened solidly with $45,300 at two
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is expected to see big numbers next weekend from its
opening of ``Enemy of the State'' with Will Smith as an innocent
man on the run. It will face competition from Paramount's debut of
its animated ``Rugrats,'' which has generated serious buzz as a
project that could draw substantial numbers of teen-agers and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Enemy of the State' should be a solid hit but we think
`Rugrats' will surprise a lot of people,'' Bucksbaum said.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Sunday that President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq had unconditionally retreated and once again had
vowed complete cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. That vow
will be tested quickly, Clinton said, and U.S. and British forces
that nearly struck Iraq on Saturday will remain poised to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has backed down, but that is not enough,'' Clinton said
in a brief White House appearance before reporters on Sunday. ``Now
Iraq must live up to its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called more directly than ever before for the
overthrow of Saddam, calling him ``an impediment to the well-being
of his people and a threat to the peace of his region and the
security of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of seven years of confrontation with Iraq
over weapons inspections, senior U.S. officials struggled to
explain why Clinton found acceptable on Sunday what his national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, said was unacceptable on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Iraqis had clarified their position overnight in
two letters that eliminated all unacceptable conditions. The
administration regards those letters as binding on Baghdad,
officials said, despite comments on Sunday by the Iraqi deputy
prime minister, Tariq Aziz, that seemed to cast doubt on their
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the officials said, Iraq had now agreed to hand
over to the weapons inspectors two sensitive documents on its
chemical and biological weapons programs and promised the
inspectors full and unfettered access to all sites _ including
those the Americans deemed too controversial to risk last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. weapons inspection team called UNSCOM, or U.N. Special
Commission, has been stymied for the last year, the officials said.
But they insisted that Saddam's retreat now had ``opened a window
of effectiveness for UNSCOM that we want to use as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected U.N. inspectors to return to Iraq in
about two days with a specific list of documents they want to see
and sensitive sites they want to inspect, together with the
personnel and the equipment to do it. At least some of those sites
were at the center of a dispute with Saddam this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the those documents, dealing with Iraq's chemical-weapons
program, was found at the Iraqi air force headquarters but was
seized from UNSCOM by Iraqi authorities; the other document,
dealing with Iraq's biological weapons program, the U.N. inspectors
know about but have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   If the Iraqis resist inspection efforts now, the officials said,
the U.S. and British military are prepared to attack. But the
officials acknowledged that military action would be impossible so
long as officials of the inspection team and the other nations on
the Security Council believe they are getting adequate cooperation
from the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   In the effort to contain Iraq, economic sanctions are only
helped by a functioning inspection program, one senior official of
a NATO country said. ``For nearly two years, UNSCOM has been pushed
backward and for the last year, its performance has been next to
useless,'' the official said. ``But we now have an opportunity to
get UNSCOM back to a satisfactory level of performance, and UNSCOM
has the greatest possible leverage just now to inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said: ``UNSCOM should feel pretty good,
because they're now in a stronger position than they've been in a
long time. It's much harder for Saddam to wriggle around now about
what compliance means. The spotlight is on Saddam, where it
belongs, and not on UNSCOM. And Iraqi obstruction will be clear and
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true for only a limited time, another official
conceded. ``Sure, there's a window for UNSCOM to be effective
now,'' the official said. ``But Saddam will shut that window as
soon as he thinks he can, and then we're back just about where we
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official said, ``Saddam can be in no doubt that we
intended to use force, because it was on its way. That makes the
threat of force pretty credible again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Washington also vowed that force would be used
against Iraq if Saddam broke his promises to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan that he would guarantee complete access for inspectors.
But that threat proved hollow, paving the way for this latest
chapter in the ongoing effort to get Iraq to disarm against its
will.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton called the return of the weapons inspectors
``the best outcome, because they have been and they remain the most
effective tool to uncover, destroy and prevent Iraq from rebuilding
its weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton listed five benchmarks to judge Iraq's compliance: Iraq
must allow inspectors ``unfettered access'' to all sites they
choose to see, ``with no restrictions or qualifications''; it must
turn over all relevant documents on the production of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them;
it must not interfere with the inspectors themselves or question
their independence or professional expertise _ for example, by
dictating the composition of UNSCOM teams; it must ``resolve all
outstanding issues raised'' by the weapons inspectors; and it must
accept all the relevant U.N. resolutions regarding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and the British had authorized the use of force
against Iraq to break out of the cycle of Iraqi defiance and
retreat, the officials acknowledged. But they also said Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain decided it would be immoral to
continue with an attack once there were serious signs of an Iraqi
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's diplomatic initiative came as B-52 bombers loaded with
cruise missiles were airborne. There was no indication that the
specific decision to use force on Saturday _ made by Clinton on
Friday night and by Blair on Saturday morning _ was leaked to Iraq,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision at about 8 a.m. on Saturday to call off the
air strikes actually postponed them for 24 hours, officials said
Sunday. At 3:30 a.m. Sunday, after clarifications from Iraq,
Clinton decided that Washington ``would take `yes' for an answer''
and called off the bombing again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair spoke eight times on Saturday, officials said;
British pilots were to be responsible for 20 percent of the targets
to be hit by manned airplanes, as opposed to cruise missiles, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over until absolute and unconditional compliance
is guaranteed and delivered,'' Blair said Sunday morning in London.
If Iraq violates its new pledges, he said, there will be air
strikes, and ``there will be no warning whatsoever.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said in an interview that
if Saddam interferes again with inspections, ``our forces are there
and we've shown we're ready to use them.'' What has been gained
now, Bacon said, ``is the chance to have a more effective
inspections regime'' and a clear ``capitulation'' from Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's two goals are to end the sanctions and the inspections,
in order to keep his weapons of mass destruction, Bacon said.
``What he's left with this time is an international community more
united behind his need to meet U.N. resolutions before sanctions
are lifted, and a commitment to hand over documents he's been
refusing to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also said Sunday that it would suspend the
deployment of dozens of additional aircraft and ground forces to
the region, where the United States already maintains some 23,000
troops as well as a dozen warships and 170 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Those aircraft that had already arrived in the Persian Gulf _
six B-52s, four B-1s, and several support aircraft _ will remain
there. Several squadrons of fighter planes got as far as U.S. bases
in Europe and will remain there. The rest of the 139 aircraft that
President Clinton ordered to the region last week will remain at
bases in the United States, as will roughly 4,000 ground troops who
had been readied to go.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort to keep the spotlight on Saddam's defiance and
not on the inspection team's methods led to decisions last summer
that proved extremely controversial and led to the resignation of a
highly regarded U.S. inspector, Scott Ritter. Ritter charged that
Washington had discouraged the commission's chairman, Richard
Butler, from confrontational surprise inspections, because it did
not want a new crisis with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials say the charge is unfair, because the
policy was designed to avoid the expulsion of UNSCOM and a military
confrontation on Saddam's timing and terms, when there was no unity
in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Security Council is firmly behind the
inspectors' right to complete access to all sites, the officials
argue, those very inspections should be carried out as soon as
possible, to test Saddam's compliance while military force remains
on standby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law of the land was to avoid unnecessary confrontation
last summer, it's to press ahead right now,'' one official said.
``The point is to put Saddam on the spot, not UNSCOM, and I'm sorry
Ritter didn't understand that, because we could use him now. We
always preferred to have sanctions plus UNSCOM, so long as UNSCOM
is useful, and UNSCOM has a chance to be more useful than before.''

MATADORS' LUCK CAN'T LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The offense is so talented and explosive, it
offsets the deficiencies of the defense. So a week ago coach Bob
Toledo took his defense to task.
</P>
<P>
   However, we're not talking about UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   This is Cal State Northridge, but many of the same ``offense is
fantastic, defense is soft'' principles apply.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the history of the Division I-AA NCAA
selection committee, the Matadors should make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Discounting the outcome of the Montana State at Montana game
next Saturday _ which could help CSUN grab the Big Sky's automatic
bid _ a Matadors win at Idaho State, which is more baked than a
potato at this point, puts No.24 CSUN (7-3) in a very, very
favorable position. And since the Bengals are 2-8 and widely
considered the worst Big Sky team, it would take a colossal
collapse for the Matadors to fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to the defense. A trip to playoffs doesn't figure to
last long if the current defensive play continues.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Big Sky is a pass-happy league, but teams have run the
ball mercilessly against CSUN. Even in Saturday's 42-38 escape win
at Southwest Missouri State, the Matadors yielded 284 yards
rushing. Opponents average 199.4 yards rushing per game, second
worst to Idaho State.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win at Idaho State and go into the playoffs, we're going
to have to play much better,'' CSUN rush end Brennen Swanson said.
``I don't know what else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it has to do with a nonphysical defensive line that's
been easily pushed around. CSUN's saving grace might be the return
of Sean Beard and Jacob Mageo, both of whom missed extensive time
this season but could return at Idaho State. They should offer some
help.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the points factor. While CSUN is in the middle of
the Big Sky pack in allowing 23.8 points per game, it has given up
28 or more points in a game five times and 32 points four times.
The Matadors lost two of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason (Southwest Missouri State) was scoring so much was
because we kept running cover three to stop the run, and with that
I'm almost four yards further back than I usually am,'' said CSUN
safety Jeremy Golden, who added 12 tackles to stretch his
team-leading total to 88. ``The quarterback kept checking either to
a run or to passes on the outside. They would never go up the
middle. And they had a good line, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the defense had strong efforts in wins against
Northern Arizona, a Brian Ah-Yat-less Montana, Southern Utah and
Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde play in the last two games.
The defense didn't come alive until the final minutes, when
enormous plays were made to preserve wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you allow (opponents) to score that many points, (the
defense is) going to have to show up some time,'' CSUN coach Ron
Ponciano said. ``It seems like when it gets down to the wire,
they've been making big plays. There's that level of intensity and
concentration and effort that we have at the end of the game that
we haven't had early and in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also the quick-hit scoring drives that don't give
CSUN's offense time to catch its collective breath. Of Southwest
Missouri State's five touchdown drives, none took more than three
minutes and three lasted less than 75 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get too frustrated because I'm trying to think
positive out there,'' CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady said. ``We
stopped ourselves a couple times and came off the field and they
scored. We were hoping the defense would get a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, but with our offense we should be able to score at
any time. Our defense, sooner or later they come up big.''
</P>
<P>
   But at some point the offense won't be able to bail the defense
out. And when that happens, CSUN's season will end. &QL;

<P>
   THE QUARTERBACK
</P>
<P>
   If there was a better grade, Cal State Northridge's Marcus Brady
would get it. Four touchdowns, 466 yards on 34 of 40 passing, no
interceptions, a touchdown run, a touchdown catch and a bevy of
checks at the line of scrimmage. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A+
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS
</P>
<P>
   Jaumal Bradley ran hard for 52 yards and Marcus Bivines picked
up a first down on a fourth-and-1 in the third quarter. Bradley
added three catches and a touchdown reception, but his value is as
a motivator in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   RECEIVERS
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Arnold and Drew Hill combined for 14 catches and 278 yards
and Brady completed passes to eight Matadors. Hill's re-emergence
as an inside threat opens the field for Arnold, who can't be
covered most times.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A+
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE
</P>
<P>
   Brady was given time to throw, though he was sacked five times.
Rushing game remains a limited factor, but when the offense puts up
532 yards and 42 points, how can it be a bad day? Right, it can't.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE
</P>
<P>
   Shawnbay Jones had three sacks and seven tackles. Other than
that, this depleted group didn't do very much besides get blown off
the ball. Maurice Daniels ran for 248 of the Bears' 284 yards
rushing. Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS
</P>
<P>
   CSUN could have used Cos Abercrombie. Shayne Blakey made 10
tackles, but 38 points doesn't reflect well on any part of the
defense. Insignificant defensive line play also affected this
group.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS
</P>
<P>
   Chazz Moore got beaten twice for touchdowns, Mel Miller once and
Donnell Day once. Yikes! What's supposed to be the best part of the
defense was beaten time and again until Bears quarterback Derek
Jensen started missing open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Punter Ethan Beck was pressed into place-kicking duties and made
all six of his PAT attempts. Nothing else stands out, which falls
into the ``no news is good news'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   COACHING
</P>
<P>
   This is where offense and defense cancel each other out. Not
much a coach can do when the defensive line is getting blown off
the ball, but a win on the road is worth something.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B

STAKES ARE HIGH IN FIGHT OVER ATM FEES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Connecticut officials and two major banks will
face off in court on Monday in a ferocious battle over a state rule
_ one of just two in the country _ that forbids banks to charge
noncustomers who use their automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, customers who use another bank's ATM frequently
are charged twice for the privilege, by the other bank and by their
own. The fee is typically $1 to $1.50 by each bank. Consumer
advocates and banking industry officials say that if Connecticut's
ban is upheld, other states might seize the opening to impose
similar bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Connecticut's interpretation stands, you could be opening
the floodgates for other states to follow,'' said James Febeo Jr.,
staff lawyer for the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group
for banks.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent is so important that the banks, Fleet Bank and
First Union Corp., are trying to overturn the restriction in both
state and federal courts. In an indication of the banks' aggressive
strategy, both banks have asserted in federal lawsuits filed last
week that Connecticut's restriction on ATM charges _ which the
banks call ``convenience fees'' _ is a violation of the banks'
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Legal authorities said that although civil rights laws are
typically used by people with grievances against police or schools,
federal law does recognize that a corporation is entitled to some
of the same protections afforded a person.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute does not involve the fees that banks charge their
own customers. So although Fleet Bank is free to penalize one of
its depositors in Connecticut for using a First Union ATM, for
instance, First Union cannot impose its own charge for that
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Although limits on ATM fees can be expected to play well with
voters, state legislatures have consistently refused to act on such
proposals, partly because of effective banking lobbies and the
nation's climate of deregulation, industry experts say. But
Connecticut and Iowa, the only other state with such a ban, have
relied on their regulators' interpretations of state law. In both
cases, banking regulators have issued opinions declaring that
because state law does not explicitly provide for such fees, they
are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet said in court papers that Connecticut's ban was causing it
to lose $15,000 a day. First Union put the figure at $10,000 daily.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association, the largest industry group,
contends the proliferation of ATM's has been possible only because
people are paying fees to use them. ``No fees means no choice,''
said John Hall, a public relations manager for the association, who
pointed to the cost of renting the space for the machines, filling
them with cash and maintaining their computer links.
</P>
<P>
   James Schepker, a Fleet spokesman, said noncustomers should pay
when they receive a service from the bank. ``This is an issue that
comes down to free-market competition,'' he said. First Union said
it would not discuss the matter during litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, who as Connecticut attorney general will
argue the state's case, said its significance went beyond ATM
charges to whether states would have any say in fees banks try to
impose in the future. ``This is trench warfare for both sides,'' he
said. ``We're going to fight this till the last dog dies or the
last banker barks.''
</P>
<P>
   ATM fees are a small but escalating expense that has sneaked up
on consumers, especially since April 1996, when the largest
networks of ATM's lifted their ban on such charges. The General
Accounting Office, which conducts investigations for Congress,
released a study in February that concluded that 79 percent of
ATM's operated by banks charge a fee for users who do not have
accounts at those banks. The study found that the typical charge
had leaped to $1.50, from $1 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are cheering on Connecticut officials. ``More
banks are charging fees, and the fees are climbing,'' said Bill
Anderson, the publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a consumer
information service. ``If your service station increased a gallon
of gas by a dime and nobody protested, they would keep increasing
it. That's what's happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of several signs of a backlash against the banks, a
member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors proposed an
ordinance last month to protect consumers from being charged twice
for one transaction. In Philadelphia, though, the City Council in
September abandoned a plan to punish banks for charging ATM fees
after banks threatened to drop the city as a client.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, alliances of smaller banks have agreed not to
charge one another's customers for ATM use, to give them a selling
point against their huge competitors. In western Pennsylvania, such
a group calls itself the Freedom ATM Alliance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At an ATM kiosk in lower Manhattan on Saturday night,
conversations about the fees tapped a geyser of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Merryl Winter, 26, a special education teacher, said she paid
$15 a week in fees because she does not like to carry a lot of cash
and her bank does not have machines near her school. Hilary Brown,
21, a social-work major, called the fees ``a tip for banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and the banks already have gone several rounds. Last
week, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals referred the matter to
the state courts, overturning an earlier decision by U.S. District
Court in New Haven that had permitted the fees. Last month, Fleet
Bank, First Union and BankBoston began imposing a $1 fee on
nondepositors who used the banks' ATM's in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But when Connecticut Banking Commissioner John Burke issued an
order for them to cease charging the fee until a state court could
consider the matter, they agreed to stop temporarily. On Monday, in
Superior Court in Hartford, Fleet and First Union will challenge
his order.

AFTER LATEST DEBACLE, GIANTS' COACH LOOKS TO 1999 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON  
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Maybe it was the time the Green Bay
Packers split a receiver wide at the goal line and the New York
Giants did not bother to send a defender out there to cover him.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was when Giants quarterback Danny Kanell did a
reprise of his version of the Statue-of-Liberty play, the football
taken out of his hand for a fumble as he brought it up to throw _ a
replay of a misplay from a Giants defeat of last month. Kanell's
fumble was sandwiched between two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was when Giants Coach Jim Fassel finally caved in,
turning his sideline into a fire drill as he made wholesale changes
in the offensive lineup. It mattered little. The Giants' offense,
in any grouping of players, has now gone nearly 10 quarters without
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your moment, but somewhere along the way in the Giants'
numbing 37-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, the 1998
Giants bottomed out, and with that came the acknowledgment that
their season is not only lost, not only beyond rescue, but has
become material for next year's planned rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The defending National Football Conference East champions are in
a rebuilding mode.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Fassel has insisted he was not going to make lineup
changes that would suggest he was playing with the 1999 season in
mind. After Sunday's collapse, with his team in a deep decline,
Fassel has revised his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the way we are going to play, then I am going to
give some other guys a chance to play,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that included Kanell, whose record as a Giants starter
is now 10-9-1 after a dreadful 8-for-20 passing day, Fassel said he
had not made that decision. But even that response is a change of
heart for Fassel, who after every previous Giants loss has said
that Kanell was still his starter.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, who was replaced late in the third quarter by Kent
Graham, seemed to understand how badly the Giants have stumbled.
``I don't think you can get any lower than this,'' Kanell said.
``It was that ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare day in the Giants' locker room, when the poor play
was so universal that offensive and defensive players shared the
sting of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that we have the record we have after the
season we had last year,'' said the Giants' Pro Bowl defensive end
Michael Strahan. ``Things are going to have to change around here.
I don't know if it's changing this year, maybe next year. But
things have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-7 record, the Giants have their worst record after 10
games since the 1995 season, when the team finished 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look at everything,'' Fassel said. ``I think a
lot of guys were giving a full effort, but when I examine the tape
of the game, I expect to see some guys who aren't. And I won't
tolerate anything less than full effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' troubles were so numerous that almost no portion of
their performance deserved praise. They rushed for only 65 yards,
with starting running back Gary Brown carrying eight times for 21
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Wheatley, who finally got some rushing carries in the
second half, gained 20 yards on five attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell threw for 88 yards, most of it in the Giants' lone
scoring drive in the second quarter. The offense he led converted
only two of 11 third-down opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants averaged 2.6 yards a rushing carry and 2.1 yards a
passing attempt.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Giants' front four, the team's strength,
registered just one sack and seldom pressured Green Bay quarterback
Brett Favre, who had a steady game with two touchdown passes and
267 yards on 21-for-33 passing.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the Giants' linebackers, the defensive line did
little to stop the Packers' running game, which, plagued by
injuries, was almost nonexistent before today. The Packers' Darick
Holmes rushed for 111 yards, the first Green Bay running back to
run for more than 100 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' secondary had many lapses, too, with loosely covered
Green Bay receivers piercing the middle of the field and with poor
judgments by other Giants defenders hurting the team at pivotal
junctures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on this team had their moment out there when he
didn't make a play,'' Kanell said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first of those breakdowns came in the first quarter of
a scoreless game. A Green Bay penalty near the Giants' goal line
had backed the Packers up to a second-and-12 at the 12-yard line.
But on the next play, Giants linebacker Marcus Buckley, who has
struggled to replace the injured Corey Miller, was blocked
completely out of the play on the right side of the Giants' defense
as Green Bay's Raymont Harris dashed unimpeded through the opening
Buckley's absence presented.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was knocked out at the 2. On the next play, Favre lofted
a pass to tight end Tyrone Davis, who had lined up on the right
side of the Packers' line and been left completely uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   After Kanell suffered his first interception _ an underthrown
pass that was picked off by Leroy Butler _ the Packers extended
their lead to 10-0 with a 39-yard Ryan Longwell field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lone score of the game followed, Brad Daluiso
kicking a 24-yard field goal at the conclusion of a 9-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the eight passes that Kanell completed came during that
drive. The Giants quarterback connected with Ike Hilliard twice for
40 yards and found tight end Howard Cross for a 12-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Green Bay long to answer the Giants' score. Favre
was sacked on first down of the Packers' next possession, but on
second down he completed a 10-yard pass to Robert Brooks. On a
third-and-3, Favre connected with Davis again for a 60-yard
touchdown pass play.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Giants free safety Tito Wooten went for the
deflection as he ran alongside Davis. When Wooten missed the ball,
Davis caught it and turned upfield. He outran strongside safety
Percy Ellsworth for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers added a field goal for a 20-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants made any adjustments at halftime, they did not
show them in third quarter. Green Bay expanded its lead with
another Longwell field goal _from 31 yards _ on its first
possession of the second half, and the next time the Packers got
the football they drove 73 yards for a touchdown and a 30-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Favre riddled the Giants' defense in this 11-play drive, which
concluded with a 7-yard touchdown run by fullback William
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes concluded the scoring with a 2-yard touchdown run. &QL;

NEWS ANALYSIS: AT ABC, TEMPORARY JOBS ARE AT ISSUE 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JODI WILGOREN  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To understand the labor dispute between ABC and its
union of 2,200 off-camera workers, grab the remote control and
click. Now click again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   It is the proliferation of cable channels and new television
networks, staffed by free-lance and other non-union technicians,
that is driving the wedge between the network and its largest
union, the National Association of Broadcast Engineers and
Technicians. With media competition increasingly intense and new
technology cutting the number of people needed to produce programs,
broadcast and labor experts said the current standoff could trigger
a shift in how television crews are organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is not the same as it used to be,'' said Christopher
Dixon, a media analyst for Paine Webber. ``The normal day-to-day of
producing, manufacturing and distributing television has changed
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of noisy picketing in New York and four other
cities _ Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington _ as
well as boycotts of the network by some politicians and
celebrities, the two sides await a ruling from the National Labor
Relations Board on whether ABC's refusal to provide certain
information about its health care plan to the union constitutes an
unfair labor practice. But broader, more fundamental differences
remain over how many temporary workers should be allowed, and
control over certain jobs and machines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, participants on both sides say, the crucial issues
are competitiveness and job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC, CBS and NBC no longer have a virtual oligopoly, and the
oligopoly was the largest reason the union could be so powerful,''
said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociologist at the City University
Graduate Center. ``It's a changed culture. You have schools of
communication turning out technicians like popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, said the network needed a
contract with its union of editors, engineers and camera operators
more like the one such workers have with NBC and CBS. That means
allowing raising the level of daily hires for temporary jobs to 35
percent or 40 percent rather than the current 14 percent, and
taking advantage of computerized editing machines, for example,
that let writers produce their own station promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that ABC has the most expensive, most
restrictive contract in the industry,'' Ms. Hoover said. ``We want
more flexibility and more opportunities to control costs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is that competition that scares many union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people don't have any security anymore,'' said
Yolanda Rodriguez, an ABC tape operator and editor. ``These people
are so hungry, they're willing to take our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   After 19 months of working without a contract, the union staged
a one-day strike on Nov. 2, timed to disrupt ``Monday Night
Football'' and election news coverage. The network responded by
refusing to let the employees back to work unless they agreed to
give advance warning of any future strikes _ 72 hours for in-studio
broadcasts, two weeks for programs on the road.
</P>
<P>
   While such requests are common in a time-sensitive business like
broadcasting, notification would undercut the union's power by
severely diluting the impact of any job action.
</P>
<P>
   With the lockout, ABC and its parent, the Walt Disney Company,
are using an increasingly popular hardball tactic intended to
reduce labor's leverage by proving employers can operate with
temporary workers. But it is also a gamble: if courts rule the
lockout illegal, ABC could be ordered to pay the workers back
wages, plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, however, often takes months, or even years.
Meanwhile, workers collect only $200 a week from their union for
walking the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's strategy is to push them out of the driver's
seat,'' said Tom Juravich, director of the Labor Center at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. ``It's very difficult, once
one is outside, to leverage back in.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is paying bonuses to its own employees and hiring temporary
workers to keep programs on the air. Most technical glitches have
been invisible to the average viewer, but Whoopi Goldberg, Tony
Bennett and Adam Sandler, along with many Democratic politicians,
have refused to appear on the network.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has refused to give the network any exclusives,
and Vice President Al Gore canceled an interview earlier this month
with ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockouts often blow up in the employer's face,'' warned Kate
Bronfenbrenner, director of labor-relations research at Cornell
University. ``The support of the public is much greater when
workers are saying, `We want to work _ they won't let us work.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street analysts say the lockout has had little
financial impact, in part because ABC is only a tiny part of
Disney's operations.
</P>
<P>
   With its famous fat salaries for top executives _ Michael Ovitz
recently received an estimated $140 million to leave the company _
Disney, which bought ABC in 1996, has been the target of much of
the union's ire. Outside ABC's headquarters on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan, workers have hung a Mickey Mouse doll from a noose.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has long been unionized, though relations are sometimes
contentious. Unions at Disney World in Orlando, Fla., are in
negotiations with the company over health-care concerns, and
workers at Euro Disney in France spent a month on strike this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoover, the ABC spokeswoman, said the new ownership did not
change the network's commitment to working with the technicians'
union and its 19 other unions. Last week, she noted, a union
representing 500 stagehands reached an agreement with ABC for a new
four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the future may depend just as much on what happens to
independent contractors working on small cable programs as it does
on the big three networks and their unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying issue here is the dramatic changes in the
broadcast industry,'' said Greg Tarpinian, a union consultant. ``In
the long run, they will have to organize all the nonunion
operations or else lose their bargaining clout.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, I stepped into a pothole crossing Madison
Avenue at 23rd Street, sprained my ankle and had it taped at a
hospital. Just as I was about to write a letter, I read that the
mayor planned to fill all the city's potholes. The article included
a telephone number to call with any sightings.
</P>
<P>
   I dialed the number, was asked to hold by a recorded voice and
after a delay of several minutes, a woman came on the phone. I told
her I wanted to report a pothole, and gave the location.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: OK, wait one minute. (She seemed to be asking someone
else in the office a question.) What borough is that in?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Wait one minute (again an aside). Is that on the East
or West Side of Manhattan?
</P>
<P>
   Me: Madison Avenue, East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (again a pause): Is that 23rd Street or Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   Me (starting to get slightly exasperated): Street.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Is the pothole on the sidewalk or street?
</P>
<P>
   Me: In the crosswalk.
</P>
<P>
   Operator: Oh, do you mean those two white lines?
</P>
<P>
   Me (in disbelief): Yes, that's right, that's what a crosswalk
is.
</P>
<P>
   Operator (after a brief delay): OK, dear, your pothole number is
DM98274028. You should check regularly to see if it's been
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pleased to have my own pothole number _ but where do those
operators come from?
</P>

   Bill Barbanes is both a registered Democrat and a contact-lens
wearer, and while his political views are crystal clear, his
eyesight is sometimes fuzzy, particularly in the first hour after
inserting his lenses.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, he popped in his contacts, and although his
vision was blurry, he hurried out to vote before going to work. He
fumbled his way up the block to the polling place, signed in and
somehow managed to cast his ballot. Only when he was back outside
did he realize that his left lens was in his right eye and his
right lens in the left eye.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the chilling thought. Did his vote for Vallone go to
Pataki, and could he have voted for D'Amato instead of Schumer?
He'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel, theater, museums and dinners _ a perfect weekend in
Manhattan for Louise Condak Liebold and her husband, who live in
Westbury. They had finished eating at a delicatessen on Seventh
Avenue when Mrs. Liebold, addressing her spouse, said, ``What a
waste! Too bad I can't take the chicken leftovers back to the
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The tables were extremely close, and the remark was heard by an
expensively dressed woman next to them. The woman put her hand on
Mrs. Liebold's arm. ``My apartment's nearby, so I'll take your
leftovers, if you don't mind,'' she said. The waiter heard the
exchange, swept the Liebold leftovers off the table, wrapped them
and presented them to the woman, and out she marched.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the dining experience of Emmett Evans and his wife,
from Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands, who went to the Oyster
Bar at Grand Central Terminal for a late lunch. They smiled at the
two attractive young women at the next table, sat down and ordered.
While they were enjoying their cocktails, the women got up, smiled,
paid their bill and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the Evanses' waiter, and a cluster of other beaming
waiters, came over. ``Those lovely ladies paid your bill,'' their
waiter announced. The couple were stunned. Why would the young
women do that? ``They said you reminded them of their parents,''
the waiter explained.
</P>
<P>
   The notice posted at the cashier's counter at Liberty Display
and Supply on West 26th Street is so popular, they've had it
photocopied to accommodate customers who start copying it down or
comment on it. ``If you are GROUCHY, IRRITABLE or just plain MEAN,
there will be a $10 charge for putting up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schifrin recently retired after 50 years in the
wedding-ring business. One of his favorite customers was a young
woman who earlier this year chose a ring for her fiance and asked
if she could get a refund if he didn't like it. Schifrin pointed to
the sign: ``No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Next day she came in, fiance in tow, and showed him the ring. He
approved. What he didn't know then was that she quietly ordered
that it be engraved ``3-2-98 No refunds. No returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As my parents were discussing preparations for their 56th
wedding anniversary next January, they again recalled their wedding
day in Brooklyn in 1943 and one of my favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   My father, a boy from Bensonhurst, was wearing his first tux. My
mother, a girl from the Bronx, was wearing more chiffon than she
had ever seen in her life. As children of Italian immigrants, their
wedding was as lavish as their shoe-factory paychecks allowed _ a
real singer at the nuptial Mass, sandwiches and confetti candy in
the church hall, a formal studio portrait and a rented limousine.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the photographer's studio after the Mass, hunger
overtook the wedding pair. My father's brother, the best man, took
charge and ordered the driver to detour to Coney Island. My uncle
jumped out at Nathan's, bought four hot dogs and four sodas and ran
back to the car with his culinary treasures. Sated and satisfied,
off they sped to have their pictures taken.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I look at my parents' wedding portrait, I see two
happy, elegantly posed young people. But I like to think that I
detect a trace of mustard on my father's chin and a sprig of
sauerkraut in my mother's bouquet.

   The westbound crosstown bus was stopped for a light at Park
Avenue when the driver announced that the bus ahead was blocked and
unable to move between Park and Madison. A woman in the back
yelled, ``Can you make a detour?'' The driver paused and then
announced: ``I can, but let's take a vote. How many want me to make
a detour?'' A loud chorus of ``yes'' followed, and annoyed
passengers were soon smiling. Roberta Altman describes it as a nice
example of democracy at work.

preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds. The children were seated,
having a snack when they arrived, and their daughter, Annie,

PAULA KISSINGER, 97, MOTHER OF FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
</HEADLINE>
 MOTHER-NYT  (ms) 
 By MARILYN BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paula Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany who held
the Bible at the White House in 1973 when her first-born son,
Henry, was sworn in as Secretary of State, the highest Cabinet post
in her adopted land, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center
on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 97.
</P>
<P>
   From the time she arrived in America in 1940 with her husband
and two young sons until the time she died, Mrs. Kissinger lived in
the same apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan,
where she was well known and well regarded by the once large
German-Jewish emigre community there.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Kissinger _ the practical one in the family _ who
decided that they had to leave Germany when Hitler came to power.
Dr. Henry Kissinger told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that his
father was reluctant to recognize the growing evil around him. ``My
father was lucky he had an earthy wife who made all the
decisions,'' he said. ``She looked after necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   She got in touch with a cousin in New York, and it was soon
arranged. ``It was my decision, and I did it because of the
children,'' she told Isaacson. ``I knew there was not a life to be
made for them if we stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kissinger was born Paula Stern in 1901 into a prosperous
middle-class family in Leutershausen. In 1922, she married Louis
Kissinger. He was 35; she was 21. They moved to Furth, where he was
a teacher, and within the year their first son, Heinz Alfred, was
born. He took the name Henry when the family came to the United
States. The next year a second son, Walter Bernhard, arrived. Both
sons, as well as six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren,
survive Mrs. Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived in New York she quickly mastered the language
and, to supplement the money earned by her husband and her sons,
she became a cook and a caterer in Washington Heights. She refused
to leave the neighborhood, even after her husband died 10 years ago
and her elder son asked her to move in with him and his wife
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, she fell in her kitchen and was unconscious
for several hours. She was put on a life-support system, but when
doctors wanted to remove it, her son Henry refused. When the
doctors explained that she would not be able to think or speak, he
replied, ``You don't know my mother.'' After being unconscious for
days, she awoke and asked him, ``What day is it?'' When he told her
it was Tuesday, she said, ``Cancel my 10 o'clock dentist
appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Germany a few times, once when Dr. Kissinger was
given an honorary degree. She was struck by the unreality of it
all. ``First you get chased away, and then you get treated like
royalty,'' she told a reporter. Back home, when her son came to
visit, the neighborhood was all excited and she admitted to being
proud: ``They say, `My son the doctor.' What should I say, my son
the Aussenminister?'''

 &HT;    As states agonize over tobacco deal, industry backs good bet
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ The tobacco industry is embracing a proposed
$206 billion settlement of states' health-related lawsuits as a way
to avoid potentially devastating jury verdicts, Lorillard Tobacco
Co.'s chief executive said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It greatly reduces the risk of a large class-action award,''
Lorillard Chairman and CEO Alex Spears said in an interview, as the
attorneys general of eight states prepared today to unveil details
of the proposed 25-year settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, states across the country will
consider whether to join in the landmark settlement. Besides the
eight states negotiating with the industry, 30 others, including
Georgia, are plaintiffs in the litigation. Georgia would receive an
estimated $2 billion to $3 billion in the settlement. The state
could reject the settlement and pursue a separate lawsuit, which
could result in billions of dollars more, or nothing at all.
Georgia officials are expected to decide this week.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' remarks early Sunday were believed to be the first
public comments by an executive of any of the four tobacco
companies involved in the intense negotiations with attorneys
general from Washington, North Carolina, California, Colorado, New
York, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro-based Lorillard, which produces Newport, Kent and
True cigarettes, agreed Saturday to the proposed settlement along
with the other major cigarette makers, Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco
and Brown &AMP; Williamson. Without a settlement, Spears said, the
industry is vulnerable to awards that could reach tens of billions
of dollars for each state. And if the industry wanted to appeal a
verdict, a judge could require cigarette makers to post an
immediate bond, which could exceed the amount of the verdict by
many times. ''That could be huge,'' Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to be announced today would salvage parts of a
broader tobacco settlement that died in Congress last summer. The
major tobacco companies had agreed in June 1997 to settle for
$368.5 billion over 25 years, but the industry withdrew its support
after legislation to enact the settlement raised the price tag to
$516 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal, negotiated over five months, is less
attractive to the tobacco industry because it does not put an end
to class-action lawsuits, as the earlier proposed settlement would
have done, Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit involves a group of plaintiffs, such as
the estimated 500,000 Floridians represented in the first
class-action lawsuit against the industry to go to trial. Legal
observers estimated the plaintiffs in that trial in Miami could
receive $200 billion. ''You are still going to have such suits
against you,'' Spears said. He added the industry still faces legal
threats from individuals and from municipalities, such as city and
county governments.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Laurence Owen Vine Gandar, the
South African newspaper editor credited with bringing investigative
journalism to a country that desperately needed it, died Saturday
in Pietermaritzburg.
</P>
<P>
   He was 82, and had been suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   As editor and editor-in-chief of The Rand Daily Mail from 1957
to 1969, Gandar was the first to turn a major South African
newspaper into an instrument for crusading for human rights rather
than a tool for selling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so eventually cost him his job at the Johannesburg paper,
after he oversaw a powerful series of articles, beginning in 1965,
about appalling conditions for blacks in South African prisons.
</P>
<P>
   When he defied police demands that he not publish his articles,
his paper suffered repeated raids, telephone taps and prosecution
under the Prisons Act, one of several laws that essentially made it
illegal to criticize the police, the army or prison administrators
without their permission. During the trial, witnesses disappeared,
and he and his reporter, Benjamin Pogrund, were convicted and
fined.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, wrote Rex Gibson, The Mail's night editor at the
time and eventually one of Gandar's successors in the top job,
``the press as a whole had been deterred from publishing prison
revelations and Gandar had signed his own professional death
warrant. As soon as it was decently possible, Gandar was fired.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of journalists who eventually became famous for reporting
on apartheid said, though, that they drew their first inspiration
and tutelage from Gandar.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the first editor to make a subtle change in his
pages that infuriated thousands of white readers. He stopped
referring to blacks as ``natives'' and instead called them
``Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as Laurie, Gandar was described by other editors as
reserved and laconic, going into battle with a shrug rather than a
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an aura of cool remoteness which appeared to defy
attempts by his staff to get to know him better and which, on
occasion, infuriated the authorities, who were trying to intimidate
the English-language press in general _ and The Rand Daily Mail in
particular,'' Raymond Louw wrote in a memoir published Sunday in
the national Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
   Louw, who edited the Mail from 1966 to 1977, also said that
Gandar's writing helped condition reluctant whites to the
inevitability and justice of majority rule. ``His liberal
philosophy of nondiscrimination, of freedom, tolerance and justice
for all helped prevent this country from sliding into civil war,''
added Louw, now publisher of a respected newsletter, Southern
Africa Report.
</P>
<P>
   Gandar was considered ahead of his time, but his editing was in
keeping with the mores of his day. After the 1960 Sharpeville
massacre, in which panicky police officers opened fire on a crowd
of 5,000 protesters surrounding their station, killing 69 and
wounding 178, Gandar obtained a dramatic photograph showing bodies
stretched out as far as the camera could capture.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, pictures of corpses seldom appeared, and Gandar
also worried the sight would provoke another riot, wrote Harvey
Tyson in his history of the South African press, ``Editors Under
Fire.'' Gandar did not use the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand Daily Mail, which was indirectly controlled by Harry
Oppenheimer, then head of the DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and
Anglo-American Corp., was closed in 1985, at the height of the
government's efforts to throttle dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer had practiced a hands-off attitude toward the paper
editorially, but also sat by as it suffered deep financial losses,
and ultimately he just let it fold, Louw said in a recent, rather
uncomplimentary contribution to a page of 90th birthday tributes to
Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Gandar was born in Durban, South Africa, in 1915, studied at
Natal University and reported for small newspapers. During World
War II, he fought as an infantryman in North Africa and Italy. In
1953, he joined the Anglo-American Corp.'s public relations
department, from which he was recruited for the editorship of The
Mail.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a grandson, Owen.

3 MILLION GREEN REASONS TO PLAY IN PHOENIX OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sometimes the only way to lure a Tiger or a Shark or a
Freddie into the fray is to show them the money.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the logic behind the Phoenix Thunderbirds' decision to
up the ante to $3 million for the 1999 Phoenix Open. The $500,000
increase will boost the champion's share to $540,000 _ more money
than three of the four major championships paid in 1998. The
increase will be announced today at the Phoenix Open Tee-Off
Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The increase) shows our commitment to the tour and its
players,'' said Ray Artigue, the tournament chairman. ``We're
trying to keep the money that we pay out in healthy relation to
what other professional sports are paying out to their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, it's very important to us that we provide
our community with the best tournament we possibly can. By
increasing our payout to $3 million, we feel we're insuring our
place as one of the best events in professional golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be enough to gain commitments from Tiger Woods, Greg
Norman and Fred Couples?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have designs on the money title (for 1999), it will be
pretty hard for them to look past Phoenix,'' Artigue argued.
</P>
<P>
   But golf's three marquee names have not necessarily based their
schedules on potential purses. None of them was present at last
year's Phoenix Open, although Woods played here to record crowds in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tim Grant, the Big Chief of the Thunderbirds, the
chances of landing the Great White Shark and Tiger appear to be
reasonably good. Couples is more of a ``wait-and-see deal'' for the
Jan. 25-31 event at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that Norman plans to play on the West Coast (for
the first time in seven years),'' Grant said. Norman missed most of
the 1998 season with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman's also building a course here in the Valley (Stonehaven
in Scottsdale). So maybe both of those factors, plus our increased
payout, will help get a commitment from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that negotiations with Woods' camp have been ongoing
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray (Artigue) has put together a great proposal for Tiger to
do a clinic here, and we're just waiting to hear back from his
people,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples hasn't played in Phoenix since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie is Freddie,'' Grant said. ``The more you press him,
the less likely you'll get him. We've got to play that one
low-profile and just hope he comes. He has said several times that
he would like to come back. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   If Norman, Woods and Couples do pass up Phoenix, it won't be
because of the money. Only the Masters ($3.2 million), TOUR
Championship ($4 million) and PLAYERS Championship ($4 million)
paid out more money among the 43 tour events this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Most tournaments are expected to announce increases for 1999,
and the newly created World Tour is offering three $5 million
events to a selected field. Still, none of the regular tour stops
will pay more than Phoenix, although the Bob Hope Classic, Doral
Ryder Open and the Byron Nelson Classic also are expected to be at
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Thunderbirds' move particularly gutsy is that the
Phoenix Open has no presenting sponsor for 2000, as a result of
Motorola's recent decision to pull out of the final year of its
three-year contract with the Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   No need to panic, Artigue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like the Phoenix Open property is one of the most
attractive on tour, and we're confident that (a future sponsor)
will recognize that,'' said Artigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're saddened that our run with Motorola only lasted
two years. At the same time, we've got some exciting opportunities
on the table. I truly believe that we're worth more, especially
with our new link with CBS Sports and the purse increase.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost unfathomable, but in 1986, the last year the
Phoenix Open was held at Phoenix Country Club, the total purse was
$500,000. And just two years ago, the payout was $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in just the past two years, we've doubled the money,''
Artigue said. ``It just shows that we're a committed partner in
growing the tour, especially on the West Coast. And by staying on
top, we're giving our fans the best tournament we can possibly give
them.'' &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS TARGET REYNOSO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - By week's end, the Diamondbacks could have another man
in their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He's free-agent right-hander Armando Reynoso, who was 7-3 in 11
starts for the New York Mets in 1998, including a 5-4 victory over
Arizona at Bank One Ballpark on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso's agent, Oscar Suarez, met with Diamondbacks General
Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. and Assistant General Manager Sandy
Johnson on Sunday and came away optimistic that a deal can be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez said although the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies
and San Diego Padres also have expressed interest in the
32-year-old Reynoso, the pitcher's first choice is to come to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good meeting. The interest is very strong,'' Suarez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso is a native of Mexico and has numerous friends and
relatives in this region, according to Suarez.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez said Reynoso also could be instrumental in improving the
comfort level of outfielder Karim Garcia, also a native of Mexico.
Garcia, 23, and Reynoso were teammates for a brief period for the
Obregon ballclub in the Mexican League.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way for Armando to help the club than to take
Karim under his wing,'' Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso was selected by the Colorado Rockies from Atlanta in the
1992 expansion draft and was the club's Pitcher of the Year (12-11)
after beginning the season at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was 3-4 in nine starts before an elbow injury cut
short his season. He underwent ``Tommy John'' surgery, in which a
ligament from the left wrist was transplanted into the right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He was 7-7 with 18 starts in 1995 and 8-9 in 30 starts in 1996
before being traded to New York for pitcher Jerry Dipoto. Reynoso
was 6-3 in 16 starts for the Mets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso has been plagued by nagging shoulder difficulties over
the last few seasons, including the start of the 1998 season. Once
healthy, however, he provided the Mets with a solid presence on the
mound. He is not an overpowering pitcher but has excellent control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that there's a great deal of interest
there,'' Garagiola said. ``We're hopeful that something can get
done by the end of this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso would join a rotation that includes right-hander Andy
Benes and left-handers Brian Anderson and Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are hoping the rotation also will include
left-hander Randy Johnson, with whom they have had repeated contact
over the last few weeks, or right-hander Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Stottlemyre will visit with Arizona officials
Tuesday at Bank One Ballpark. He began the 1998 season with St.
Louis, beating the Diamondbacks twice, then was traded to the Texas
Rangers and finished with a combined record of 14-13. &QL;

Colorado to compete for a purse of several thousand dollars, won by
a man who killed nine coyotes. Using only a specialized ``call'' to
lure the coyotes, the hunters killed 200 of the 545 coyotes they
had spotted. Hunting contests, primarily in Western states, have
environmentalists facing off against farmers and ranchers. (Kevin

SECOND-HALF OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION NOT ENOUGH FOR CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>

 ATTN: Dallas Morning News  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The scoreboard doesn't lie. Long after an
emotion-charged showdown ended Sunday, it still showed that the
Cardinals had defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Cardinals, their latest late-game heroics
could not erase mistakes made earlier in what proved to be a 35-28
setback that dropped them to 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good job'' from well-wishers just didn't cut it with
quarterback Jake Plummer, not even after he took the Cardinals from
a 28-0 deficit to the brink of overtime with 465 passing yards,
third-most ever by a Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bummed out,'' Plummer said. ``I've never accepted losing.
I hate losing. People come up and say, `Good job,' and I wonder
what they're saying that for. We lost. The job is to go out and
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals offensive players could say they didn't lose, they
just ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   They could say the officials didn't have the spine to throw a
flag in the end zone on the final play where Cardinals receiver Rob
Moore was wearing not only a red jersey but also Cowboys cornerback
Kevin Smith on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   They could say there was more to be encouraged than discouraged
about.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above would be correct.
</P>
<P>
   What could have made all of the above moot, though,is a stronger
start. That's a recurring theme that did not escape the attention
of offensive coordinator Marc Trestman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process, and that's just where we're at right now,''
Trestman said. ``You go back to the Detroit game and we came out
very shaky in the first half. It was the same against the Redskins.
We've used the first half as a feeling-out process, and then all of
a sudden the game gets our attention and we play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that we need to go no-huddle to start
the game, but we have to find something that allows us to play the
way we've played in the second halves when we're letting go and
playing relaxed. That's going to be a point of emphasis. We have to
play a lot better in the first 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals trailed 28-0 with 3:29 left in the second quarter
before, as Trestman put it, the game got their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to start the first half faster, get some big plays
in the first half, get some points, get ahead, get a lead,''
Plummer said. ``We kept it interesting. I don't think anyone left
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, a combination of the Cardinals' no-huddle
offense, the Cowboys playing softer with a big lead, and the line
giving Plummer time to fire put them Cardinals into a position of
having two shots from the Dallas 5 to send the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a pass that Frank Sanders couldn't haul in.
``That's me, it just went through my hands,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Then on the final play, Plummer lobbed a fade-pattern pass to
Moore that was broken up by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wasn't looking at the ball,'' Moore said. ``It
looked like one ref wanted to throw his flag and then didn't.
That's a play for me to make. I had both hands on it. When I pulled
it down I hit his shoulder pads and knocked it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   So it ended, after a closing two quarters in which Plummer
completed 18 of 35 passes for 304 yards and two touchdowns without
an interception. His 465 passing yards in the game were one yard
short of the record by a Cowboys opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake played a phenomenal game,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can only wonder how phenomenal it might have been
had they started sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play just the second half,'' said Moore. ``That's
what we've been doing for three weeks. I wish we could play the
third quarter first.''

CARDS PLAN TO CARRY THIS LOSS WITH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Attn: Dallas Morning News  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals guard Chris Dishman wasn't moping.
Instead he was scribbling a message on his game gloves: ``Dallas
35, Cardinals 28.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put these in my locker as a little reminder,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman's mood typified the attitude of the Cardinals in the
aftermath of Sunday's gut-wrenching 35-28 loss to the Dallas
Cowboys. A frenzied comeback from 28-0 fell five yards short of
overtime and ended momentary hopes of a share of first place in the
NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the locker room wasn't one of despondence. It was a
feeling of determination and anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think it will be hard to bounce back from this,
but it's hard right now,'' Dishman said. ``It's like losing a wife
or a kid. It's hard to explain to somebody who hasn't faced a big
loss. But we have to do our job and get after Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we finished up the second half is how we want our
offense to work. If we had done some of those things in the first
half, we wouldn't be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals play Washington and Kansas City on the road in
their next two games, then finish the season with three of their
final four at home. Coach Vince Tobin's postgame message was to
keep getting the job done and their probable first-round playoff
opponent would be the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of it,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``We're still
5-5. We just have to handle our business and chances are we'll play
them again. We not going to hang our heads about this, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Larry Centers and Aeneas Williams said it's the role of the
veterans to keep the team on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the character to bounce back from this,'' Centers
said. ``It's up to the older guys to show we're not going to give
up. We didn't exactly shoot par, but we finished the hole strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited a bit too long to get started but showed character
coming back when most people thought it was over. We've been behind
at halftime in our last three games, and we've come back strong.
Our quarterback (Jake Plummer) had a coming out today and showed
the heart we want to exemplify on this team. He is a great
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added, ``In the past, if we were down, 28-0, we could
easily pack our bags and forget it. But this team believes it can
always win. Regardless of the score going into the fourth quarter,
we know we can win. We know it because we've shown we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Tommy Bennett said the loss has merely stoked the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss, but I think we'll feed off this,'' he said.
``We had a chance to win and got a few unfortunate calls. But we
know now we can play with these top teams. It's something we can
feed off and take with us to Washington.'' &QL;

COWBOYS FIND 2 OF 3 NOT BAD  
 SMITH, AIKMAN CARRY LOAD WHEN IRVIN SHUT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -On a day when Dallas receiver Michael Irvin had
his 117-game streak of consecutive games with at least one
reception snapped by the Cardinals and cornerback Aeneas Williams,
one would figure the Cowboys' offense would be in for a long day.
</P>
<P>
   One would figure wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that two of the Cowboys' ``Big Three'' on offense
were enough to get the job done in a 35-28 victory Sunday at Sun
Devil Stadium. The result is a two-game lead for Dallas over the
Cardinals in the NFC East race, with the Cowboys also holding the
tiebreaker should Arizona pull even in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Williams' shutout of Irvin, the Cowboys churned to 354
yards and romped to a 28-0 lead before the Cardinals rallied in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The other two offensive stars, quarterback Troy Aikman and
running back Emmitt Smith, shredded the Cardinals, and they did it
playing behind a banged up offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, with 118 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries, moved
past Walter Payton and Jim Brown on the NFL's all-time rushing list
and left the Cardinals' defense standing almost as still as those
old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes, including a string
of 13 straight that began on the first play of the Cowboys' second
possession of the game and continued until Mark Smith batted down
an attempt with just over 10 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But he never found Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked off and they gave me stats, and Michael didn't have a
catch,'' said Dallas Coach Chan Gailey. ``I was shocked. We threw
it to a lot of people, and I couldn't 2believe Michael didn't have
a catch. That's unusual to score that many points and throw to that
many different receivers and him not have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of (double-teaming) and creating problems
on that side. I don't know how long that will last, but until
people realize we can go to other places with it, they'll keep
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman sent to eight different receivers. None caught more than
three balls. Fullback Daryl Johnston had the only touchdown
reception.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys were able to hit for big plays _ a 70-yard
completion to wide receiver Billy Davis, a 43-yarder to tight end
Eric Bjornson, a 33-yard shot to tight end David LaFleur and a
28-yarder to wideout Ernie Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said the Cardinals tried to take Irvin away, but it's
nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the way it came up,'' he said. ``We had some
things called to try to get Michael the ball. They rolled someone
over there to keep him from getting opportunities. He didn't even
get many balls thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But David LaFleur had a big ballgame, Ernie Mills and Billy
Davis made some big catches, and that's what we have to have if
they're going to do those types of things against Michael. Other
guys have to make plays, and they were able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin didn't comment on the end of his streak, but Smith said
the Cowboys' star was deeply disappointed to see it stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised (he didn't catch a pass),'' Smith said.
``But when you're double-covering a guy, it's hard to get the ball
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel for him because I know he's very frustrated. I
feel his pain. But he's got an opportunity to start a new streak.''
</P>
<P>
   So who would have expected the Cowboys to wrack up 35 points on
the day Irvin's streak died?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't,'' Smith said. ``We get 35 points, I expect Michael
Irvin to have at least eight catches. It wasn't that way, but it
says a lot for our offense that we were able to move the ball by
spreading it around.''

COMMENTARY: LOOKING BACK AT A 5-YEAR-OLD'S DRIVING FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES ESTRIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He had to wait 11 years after his first attempt, but
on Sunday, Rocco Morabito finally drove his sister all the way to
the beach. He was safe at last from the police, thanks to the
learner's permit he got on his 16th birthday, and he handled the
car even better than he had the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier when you can see over the top of the steering
wheel,'' he explained as he pulled out of the garage at his
family's home in Port Chester, navigating the same narrow driveway
where his famous ride began the morning of Dec. 4, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rocco was 5 years old and 3 feet tall. His
2-year-old sister, Brandi, wanted to go the beach, and Rocco got
halfway there, cruising at 20 miles an hour along a main
thoroughfare in Westchester County. Then a police officer in Rye,
Robert Vogel, spotted their car, which appeared to be driverless.
Rocco responded to the flashing lights and siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pulled over perfectly,'' Vogel reported. ``He didn't even
hit the curb. It was a beautiful job.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children, who were wearing pajamas, started crying for
their mother, but Rocco regained his composure when Vogel said she
would be summoned to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mommy can't come here because I have the only car,'' Rocco
told the officer. ``I can drive. I'll go get her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocco was front-page news (``JUNIOR JOY RIDE'') in New York
City, and for a while his ride was better known internationally
than Paul Revere's. Well-wishers and automotive companies showered
him with cards and gifts. He was interviewed by David Letterman and
countless journalists, who happily reported his ambition to become
a truck driver. His best media moment came when he was asked on ``A
Current Affair'' if he had learned any lesson from the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied. ``I learned how to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he'd had a little practice beforehand, because his
grandfather had let Rocco sit in his lap and drive the car around a
parking lot. But it still took remarkable initiative to make off
with the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew he was a smart, observant kid,'' said his
mother, Susan Morabito. ``He'd carefully watch everything you did.
But we never imagined he could figure out how to take the car. I
almost had a heart attack when they called me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocco got the car keys by standing on a chair to reach his
mother's purse on top of the refrigerator. He opened the garage
door, put his sister in the back seat and buckled her seat belt.
Then he moved the automatic front seat all the way forward and the
steering wheel all the way down. He set off, carefully avoiding the
wall lining the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining, so I stopped in the driveway to turn on the
windshield wipers,'' he recalled. ``I knew how to do that from
watching my dad. Then I pulled out of the driveway and watched for
other cars. I could just see over the dashboard if I looked through
the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   As he retraced the route Sunday along Midland Avenue, he pointed
out the stoplights where he'd dutifully observed the law, and
recalled the little drama at the intersection with Peck Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was stopped at this light,'' he said, ``a man came up
to me and said: `You're not supposed to be driving. Get out of the
car.' He tried to reach in and turn off the engine, but I hit the
power window. As the window was rolling up, I started to drive
away. He got his hand caught for a moment and then let go.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only a temporary escape, because the man found Vogel
in a nearby deli and sent him in pursuit of the two outlaws. ``We
were really scared when he pulled us over,'' Rocco said. ``My
sister tried hiding under the back seat. I slid over to the
passenger's seat to pretend I hadn't been driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Vogel was onto them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after safely conducting his family's new station
wagon to the beach at Rye Playland, Rocco said he still found
driving exciting, but confessed that he had set aside his
truck-driving ambitions. As a junior at Port Chester High School,
he plays on the football and baseball teams, and is hoping to get a
sports scholarship to college. ``I'd love to play professional
sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As they looked out at the water Sunday, Rocco and Brandi still
couldn't explain exactly what came over them that morning in 1987.
``I've been asked over and over why I did it,'' Rocco said, ``but I
don't know. The only reason I can think of is that my sister wanted
to go to the beach.''

WILDCATS READY TO START SECOND SEASON  
 ASU SHOWDOWN, THEN BOWL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, ARIZ. - Arizona had just gone 10-1 for the first time
ever, but coach Dick Tomey was already restless. It was time to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   For Tomey, the regular season ended on Saturday with Arizona's
27-23 victory at California.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind we've completed the regular season, and now we go
into a season itself,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State on Nov. 27 at Arizona Stadium. Year after year,
it's the state's football Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a season within itself,'' Tomey said Sunday when
his Wildcats climbed to No. 8 in both the Associated Press and
ESPN/USA Today polls. ``That is the way we have always looked at
the ASU game. We have all of our other regular-season games, and
then we have the ASU game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going to be playing up an octave. It's going to be
the same thing in Tallahassee (Florida State), Gainesville
(Florida), Columbus (Ohio State), Ann Arbor (Michigan).''
</P>
<P>
   But, for Arizona, this year's ASU clash strays from the usual
scenario. There is a role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, a disappointment, tries to be the spoiler. Arizona, a
surprise, tries not to have a Rose Bowl possibility and a shot at
its best season in history snatched away.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl still is subject to to all the variables in the
Bowl Championship Series as well as how UCLA fares against Southern
California and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to either would knock UCLA out of consideration for the
national championship game in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl and would
send the Bruins to the Rose Bowl. The Bruins ensured themselves of
that much with their victory Saturday at Washington that clinched
at least a tie for the Pac-10 title. Arizona could earn a share of
the title by beating ASU in conjunction with a UCLA loss to USC,
but the Bruins would get the Rose Bowl nod by virtue of their 55-28
victory over the Wildcats on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona, the other stake is school history. The Wildcats
have never won more than 10 games in a season. Although this team
is the first to go 10-1, the 1993 Wildcats did achieve a 10th
victory at the Fiesta Bowl after two losses.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that the Sun Devils would love to stand in the
way of a high water mark in an Arizona football history that dates
back to 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? Maybe later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Wildcats have a week to heal from the expected
bumps and bruises that have collected over the course of 11 games.
The Wildcats' unusual schedule has not included a bye week until
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have played 11 straight games, and no one in our league or
the NFL has to do that'' Tomey said. ``We are glad to have the week
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the week off will refresh us, let us rest up and heal.
More than anything, it gives the guys a chance to get away from
football for a while. It gives us a chance to to be re-energized.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Arizona to go back to the practice field for
some light work on Wednesday. It didn't sound as if Tomey is
planning any major changes before the ASU clash. In an interesting
twist Saturday, he abandoned his usual quarterback rotation in the
second half. Keith Smith played throughout the second half. Smith
usually splits each half with Ortege Jenkins, the star last year in
Arizona upset of ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not committed to do anything in the second half but
win,'' said Tomey, referring to the Washington game in which
Jenkins dominated play in the second half of a comeback victory.
``It was the same thing at Washington when we though Keith might
have been bogged down a little bit. We are going to do what we have
to.'' &QL;

IOWANS GRILL GIULIANI ON PIGS AND THE PRESIDENCY 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ It was Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's second visit to
this largely rural state, and for the second time, he came to boast
about his success in cutting taxes, crime and the welfare rolls
back in the big city. But by Sunday morning, inquiring minds in
Iowa had heard so much about New York that reporters decided it was
time to question him about pressing local issues.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, did the mayor of New York City think about
Iowa's hog problem? In the interest of controlling odors and
pollution, should state government limit the size of the
confinement systems that large-scale hog enterprises employ? Or
should the farms grow unfettered, so that Iowa can remain the
nation's largest producer of pork?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has a detailed opinion about most quality-of-life
issues back home, said that it would be arrogant of him to propose
a solution, but that he had asked a lot of questions about the
matter, which he said he found fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read an article in the newspapers today about the
terrible problem of the independent and the small producers who are
losing their businesses,'' Giuliani said Sunday during a morning
taping of a television interview. ``It's something that I would
have to spend a lot of time looking at and studying.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, whether the mayor came here because he is considering a
run for higher office, which he has all but denied, or because he
wants to help other Republicans around the country, as he says, he
got a more realistic sense on his trip this time about what it
might be like to run for national office. And Iowans got more of a
sense of how he would deal with their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani began his weekend visit here with a speech on Saturday
at Iowa State University in Ames, on civility. It turned out to be
his best chance to tout his accomplishments in New York. For the
rest of his time in Iowa, he was thrown question after question
about his ambitions for higher office and about how a
quintessentially urban politician could succeed as a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   There were questions about Giuliani's support of abortion and
gay rights, and how he could win over the social conservatives who
tend to dominate the nominating process for Presidential
candidates. Giuliani waded delicately through the queries, saying
he had far more in common with social conservatives than it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are entitled to their viewpoint and I am entitled to
mine, and we should respect each other,'' he said in the television
interview. ``In areas where there are differences of personal
conscience or whatever, let's agree that the party is broad enough
to embrace both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Giuliani wanted people to know that he had a
lot more in common with Midwestern farmers than it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is without reference to running for President,'' he said,
``but to give us a sense of how connected we are as human beings,
90 percent of the issues that I read about in The Des Moines
Register or that I've talked about in Iowa or South Carolina or all
over, are the same in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Local reporters were not the only ones treating Giuliani as a
Presidential candidate. Hugh Winebrenner, a professor of political
science at Drake University in Des Moines, came to the Mayor's
speech at Iowa State University to compare him with other
politicians who have trooped through Iowa recently.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that Dr. Winebrenner said he noticed was
Giuliani's security detail: two guards standing in the front of the
room where the Mayor spoke to a crowd of about 450, and at least
one more in the back, whispering into a microphone on his wrist.
There was also a state trooper stationed by the door. ``The guy
comes in here like he's already President of the United States,''
Dr. Winebrenner said. ``Most of them come in by themselves, or with
a single staffer. This is a little too big-time for Iowa.'' But
despite his prominence, Giuliani has plenty of obstacles to
overcome if he is to be considered a serious Presidential contender
in Iowa, said Dr. Winebrenner, who studies the Iowa caucuses and
keeps a running tally of every politician who visits. ( Giuliani
has spent only three days here, he noted, but Lamar Alexander spent
36 and Dan Quayle 19.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly starts out with a well-known name, and that was a
heck of a good crowd there today,'' Winebrenner said Sunday. ``But
it's yet to be seen whether there's a place for a moderate like
Rudy Giuliani in Iowa this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rice, the political science professor who invited the Mayor
to speak at Iowa State University, had a different view. People
outside New York state know Giuliani not so much for his politics,
he said, but for his appearances on national television shows:
``Saturday Night Live,'' ``The Late Show With David Letterman''
and, most recently, ``The Guiding Light.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Rice said, they know Giuliani as a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tell my students Giuliani is coming, they think
`Saturday Night Live,' and I mean that in a good way,'' he said
after the speech, waiting for Giuliani to finish taping an
interview with a CNN crew who had flown in from Atlanta. ``He's
someone people can identify with beyond politics. I don't want to
say a cultural icon, but he's crossed the line from politics into a
broader appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he had invited a number of ``major politicians who are
talking like Presidential candidates,'' and that Giuliani was the
first to accept. [After Iowa, the Mayor flew to Detroit to deliver
a speech, and was to continue his travels on Monday in Tennessee,
after a hasty return to New York for John Glenn's parade.)
</P>
<P>
   Neelika Jayawardane, a graduate student at Iowa State, said she
was impressed by the size of the crowd _ only the rap musician
Ice-T and the anthropologist Stephen Jay Gould have drawn larger
audiences there in recent years, she said. But people were too
focused on Giuliani's celebrity status, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People stop using their critical thinking skills when they are
gullible enough to buy into someone's celebrity,'' she said. ``He
has this fame that he has developed by going on television shows,
and that's very smart. But who is he, really?''

KEALY EXPECTED TO FACE UA

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Quarterback  &UR; Ryan Kealy has recovered well from
arthroscopic knee surgery and is expected to play against Arizona
on Nov. 27, Arizona State Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy did not play in Saturday's 51-19 loss to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming along real well,'' Snyder said. ``He has so much
competitiveness that he will be really anxious to play in the game
coming up. He'll be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to stand on the sideline again and watch the game. I
think we'll find that he'll be highly motivated and ready to go.''
</P>

   Snyder is less confident about the status of tailback  &UR; J.R.
Redmond, who has a nagging ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been close to a month,'' Snyder said. ``I know he ran
that (57-yard) touchdown (against Oregon), but that still wasn't
him. He's just not the same guy. God, I'm hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond had 10 carries for 70 yards against the Ducks. He did
not return kickoff or punts. &QL; 
Secondary problems &QL; 
Just when Snyder thought it couldn't get worse, his secondary took
another hit.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman  &UR; Courtney Palmore suffered a dislocated
shoulder in Oregon and will miss the Arizona game.
</P>
<P>
   Palmore is the team's top reserve at safety and one of its top
special-teams players. ASU already was pretty depleted at defensive
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the places we were thinnest . . . we got it,' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmore's absence will complicate matters at practice. Starting
free safety  &UR; Mitchell Freedman has been unable to practice much of
the season because of injuries. Without Palmore to step in, the Sun
Devils will be walking through strategies much of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback  &UR; J'Juan Cherry also is limited because of injuries
and can't practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the defensive side of the ball, it's going to be stand
around and check assignments,'' Snyder said. ``I prefer not to do
that, I prefer execution . . . but if you can't run very well and
it aggravates (the injury) to run, the next best thing you can do
is walk through it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Justin Taplin will get more work at cornerback this week.
</P>
<P>
   The depth problems at defensive back has limited ASU's ability
to use nickel and dime packages. That was evident against Oregon,
which often went with three wide receivers. To help with the
shortage, ASU drops back linebacker &UR; Eric Fields into coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do because of our personnel,'' Snyder
said. &QL; 
No average Smith &QL; 
After watching film of the Oregon game, Snyder was no less
impressed by the performance of Ducks quarterback  &UR; Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And Oregon makes the most of his abilities, which makes life
miserable for every position on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Tackles have to watch for traps. Ends need to be aware of
sprint-outs. The Ducks can effectively run short routes and deep
routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put a different quarterback in, all that doesn't
concern you,'' Snyder said. ``But because of who he is . . . He may
be the best option runner in the league and probably the best
passer.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Snyder said he was pleased with the performance of quarterback
 &UR; Steve &UR; Campbell. &QL;

BLAME THE DEFENSE, NOT THE REFEREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 RAW, UNEDITED VERSION  
 ATTN: Dallas Morning News  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Welcome to the great conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Time mysteriously disappears against the Raiders, and the
Cardinals lose. A flag remains in the pocket of an official, and
the Cardinals lose. One league referee is actually suspected of
having a personal vendetta against the Birds. And while we're not
sure of this, there are reports that Oliver Stone delivered the
post-game address when first place disappeared on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   You can blame the officials. You can whine about a flag that
could've been thrown. Should've been thrown. Would've been thrown
if they were playing anyone but the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can look at the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, you don't win when you give up 35 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big plays killed us,'' defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is admirable that the lads didn't quit on Sunday, highly
encouraging that the offense is suddenly a juggernaut. And all this
talk about exacting revenge when these two teams meet again in the
playoffs was positively striking in its assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone else concerned about how the offense is now compensating
for the defense? A defense that almost blew the game against the
Redskins and handed the Cowboys an insurmountable lead?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of this is attributed to the absence of Eric
Swann. Except Swann's temper got him bounced in the first quarter
of the first game in Dallas, a day when Andre Wadsworth took the
field without a single practice, and the Cardinals weren't pushed
around like this.
</P>
<P>
   And some of this is simply a talented offensive coordinator
turned head coach finding ways to exploit the Cardinals' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel did it. Chan Gailey did it. Who's next?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game where we'll have to look at the film,'' Corey
Chavous said. ``Anytime you get exploited, other teams will take
advantage of you. And it looks like we have some areas we need to
address.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Simeon Rice and his one tackle put on a pair
of army fatigues and left. Andre Wadsworth and his three tackles
explained how the defensive line was ``pounding them up front``,
only to get burned when the Cowboys ``resorted to a little bit of
trickery to get us off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoreboard, fellas. Scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   On the first series of the game, a blitzing Tommy Bennett
flattened Troy Aikman. He was rarely touched again the rest of the
afternoon. And only once were the Cowboys handed a three-and-out.
It occurred with under five minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get them into third down,'' Cardinals coach Vince
Tobin said. ``We didn't play as well defensively as I would have
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   An understatement straight from the master.
</P>
<P>
   An awful play in the first quarter - a reverse that led to a
fumble, a reverse mysteriously called when the offense was just
starting to find its legs - didn't help. Neither did Deion Sanders'
obligatory impact play that directly led to a touchdown. But the
defense was a passenger on Sunday, from missed tackles to blown
assignments to an overwhelmed front four.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Tillman had another bad day. He made the wrong read and left
a receiver uncovered, leading to a 43-yard gain and, one play
later, a Dallas touchdown. But aside from Aeneas Williams, the odor
was a team effort.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot for the afternoon: Trailing 35-21 in the fourth
quarter, Jamir Miller was nailed for defensive holding, nullifying
an Emmitt Smith fumble that could've changed the outcome. On an
ensuing 3rd-and-6, the Cowboys converted. And after Ronald McKinnon
missed a tackle, Smith turned a flare pass into a 24-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you give a running back 100 yards at home, even one
like Emmitt Smith, that's a concern,'' Chavous said. ``And in
critical situations, we have to get off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the bravado, know that Swann will miss at least another
week and the Cardinals could easily lose their next three games.
And before they teed off on Sunday, Cris Collinsworth called the
Cardinals the ``worst 5-4 team in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're just another team mired in mediocrity. And until
the defense rediscovers its roar, they're headed in one direction.
The wrong way. &QL;

3 MILLION GREEN REASONS TO PLAY IN PHOENIX OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 ATTN EDITORS: CORRECTION, STORY EMBARGOED UNTIL PMs  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sometimes the only way to lure a Tiger or a Shark or a
Freddie into the fray is to show them the money.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the logic behind the Phoenix Thunderbirds' decision to
up the ante to $3 million for the 1999 Phoenix Open. The $500,000
increase will boost the champion's share to $540,000 _ more money
than three of the four major championships paid in 1998. The
increase will be announced today at the Phoenix Open Tee-Off
Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The increase) shows our commitment to the tour and its
players,'' said Ray Artigue, the tournament chairman. ``We're
trying to keep the money that we pay out in healthy relation to
what other professional sports are paying out to their players.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, it's very important to us that we provide
our community with the best tournament we possibly can. By
increasing our payout to $3 million, we feel we're insuring our
place as one of the best events in professional golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be enough to gain commitments from Tiger Woods, Greg
Norman and Fred Couples?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have designs on the money title (for 1999), it will be
pretty hard for them to look past Phoenix,'' Artigue argued.
</P>
<P>
   But golf's three marquee names have not necessarily based their
schedules on potential purses. None of them was present at last
year's Phoenix Open, although Woods played here to record crowds in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tim Grant, the Big Chief of the Thunderbirds, the
chances of landing the Great White Shark and Tiger appear to be
reasonably good. Couples is more of a ``wait-and-see deal'' for the
Jan. 25-31 event at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that Norman plans to play on the West Coast (for
the first time in seven years),'' Grant said. Norman missed most of
the 1998 season with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman's also building a course here in the Valley (Stonehaven
in Scottsdale). So maybe both of those factors, plus our increased
payout, will help get a commitment from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said that negotiations with Woods' camp have been ongoing
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray (Artigue) has put together a great proposal for Tiger to
do a clinic here, and we're just waiting to hear back from his
people,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples hasn't played in Phoenix since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie is Freddie,'' Grant said. ``The more you press him,
the less likely you'll get him. We've got to play that one
low-profile and just hope he comes. He has said several times that
he would like to come back. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   If Norman, Woods and Couples do pass up Phoenix, it won't be
because of the money. Only the Masters ($3.2 million), TOUR
Championship ($4 million) and PLAYERS Championship ($4 million)
paid out more money among the 43 tour events this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Most tournaments are expected to announce increases for 1999,
and the newly created World Tour is offering three $5 million
events to a selected field. Still, none of the regular tour stops
will pay more than Phoenix, although the Bob Hope Classic, Doral
Ryder Open and the Byron Nelson Classic also are expected to be at
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Thunderbirds' move particularly gutsy is that the
Phoenix Open has no presenting sponsor for 2000, as a result of
Motorola's recent decision to pull out of the final year of its
three-year contract with the Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   No need to panic, Artigue said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like the Phoenix Open property is one of the most
attractive on tour, and we're confident that (a future sponsor)
will recognize that,'' said Artigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're saddened that our run with Motorola only lasted
two years. At the same time, we've got some exciting opportunities
on the table. I truly believe that we're worth more, especially
with our new link with CBS Sports and the purse increase.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost unfathomable, but in 1986, the last year the
Phoenix Open was held at Phoenix Country Club, the total purse was
$500,000. And just two years ago, the payout was $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in just the past two years, we've doubled the money,''
Artigue said. ``It just shows that we're a committed partner in
growing the tour, especially on the West Coast. And by staying on
top, we're giving our fans the best tournament we can possibly give
them.'' &QL;

`WATERBOY' SPENDS SECOND WEEK ATOP WEEKEND BOX OFFICE DOG PILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adam Sandler's ``The Waterboy'' scored its second
consecutive victory at the nation's multiplexes with an impressive
$25.2 million at 2,675 theaters to dominate a robust weekend at the
nation's box office during Friday-Sunday, studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave the football comedy nearly $80 million after 10
days, ensuring the Disney release will hit the $100 million mark
next weekend. Studio marketing executive Chuck Viane noted Sunday
the decline from the opening weekend was only 36 percent, showing
that ``The Waterboy'' has created broad appeal beyond its core
audience of young males.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really blossomed and is attracting all demographics,''
Viane said. ``We're getting kids that have seen it two and three
times already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy,'' costing a mere $19 million, will soon become
the 11th film to top the $100 million milestone this year. Its
unexpected success lifted the overall weekend to $103 million, 22
percent ahead of the same weekend last year, and underscored the
industry's continued powerful performance with year-to-date grosses
over $5.6 billion and 10 percent ahead of last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is just barreling along,'' said analyst Arthur
Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co. ``It's being bailed out by these very
successful genre movies. That's what the movie business is all
about _ if you deliver the goods you've promised, you can make a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, has upgraded his estimate of the final domestic gross for
``The Waterboy'' to $150 million. ``People love this movie,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also performing respectably were two new entries _ Sony's
slasher sequel ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
Universal's Brad Pitt drama-comedy ``Meet Joe Black.'' Moviegoers
ignored the mostly negative notices with ``I Still Know'' taking
$17.5 million at 2,443 theaters and ``Joe'' pulling in $15 million
at 2,500 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``I Still Know'' will likely gross $60 million
overall, $12 million shy of the original, while ``Meet Joe Black''
could hit $75 million. He noted that the critics' chief complaint
about ``Joe'' _ its running time of nearly three hours _ carried
little weight with patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like the movie and they don't realize it's three hours
long,'' Bucksbaum said. ``If you're paying $8 for a movie, you want
to get your money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said ``Meet Joe Black,'' in which Pitt portrays the
Grim Reaper falling in love, is ``an adequate success story,''
given its relatively expensive reported cost of $75 million. ``It's
a respectable opening, because this is a difficult film to
market,'' he added. ``It's not going to make much money for the
studio.''
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend of ``The Siege'' came in fourth with $8.1
million at 2,579 theaters as the thriller lost 42 percent of its
opening weekend audience. 20th Century Fox, which had been the
hottest studio over the summer, is likely to lose money on the $70
million project, now with $26.3 million after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' seventh weekend of ``Antz'' finished fifth with $4.2
million at 2,351 screens and has now topped $81 million overall.
The computer-animated comedy, rushed out to beat Disney's ``A Bug's
Life,'' edged New Line's fourth weekend of ``Pleasantville'' with
$4.1 million at 1,773 sites and Disney's unimpressive opening of
family comedy ``I'll Be Home For Christmas,'' starring Jonathan
Taylor Thomas, with $4 million at 1,759 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said Thomas' box office appeal has diminished as the
``Home Improvement'' star portrays a college student. ``He's at an
awkward age because most young teen-age girls prefer someone older
like Leonardo DiCaprio,'' he noted. ``It's a hard transition for a
child star to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. continued to post moderate results from its
restored version of the 1939 classic ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which
finished eighth with $3.3 million at 1,882 theaters in its second
weekend. New Line's third weekend of comedy-drama ``Living Out
Loud'' followed with $2.7 million at 1,087 screens, beating its
ninth weekend of ``Rush Hour'' with $2 million at 1,615 theaters.
``Rush Hour'' has grossed $130 million domestically, becoming the
88th movie to top that mark behind ``The Flintstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's second weekend of Academy Award contender
``Elizabeth'' continued to perform well in limited release with
$340,000 at 14 theaters. Miramax's Oscar hopeful ``Life Is
Beautiful'' generated respectable numbers in widened release with
$880,000 at 116 sites and Sony's Irish drama ``Dancing at
Lughnasa,'' with Meryl Streep, opened solidly with $45,300 at two
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is expected to see big numbers next weekend from its
opening of ``Enemy of the State'' with Will Smith as an innocent
man on the run. It will face competition from Paramount's debut of
its animated ``Rugrats,'' which has generated serious buzz as a
project that could draw substantial numbers of teen-agers and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Enemy of the State' should be a solid hit but we think
`Rugrats' will surprise a lot of people,'' Bucksbaum said.

BARBARA THORNTON, 48, SINGER WHO CHAMPIONED MEDIEVAL MUSIC 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thornton, a singer and musicologist who, with Benjamin
Bagby, founded and directed Sequentia, the medieval music ensemble,
died Nov. 8 at the Caritas hospice in Cologne, Germany. She was 48
and lived in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a brain tumor, Jon Aaron, her
manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton, whose soprano voice had a mezzolike hue and a
texture that gave it a distinctive character, was a specialist in
the music of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen, and it
was largely because of Ms. Thornton's performances and recordings
with Sequentia that Hildegard and her works have lately become the
focus of scholarly and popular interest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when Sequentia toured with a production of Hildegard's
``Ordo Virtutum,'' an allegorical work in which the soul is
confronted by both the Virtues and the Devil, Hildegard was
virtually unknown outside a small circle of musicologists and
students of medieval sacred works. Since then, the ensemble has
recorded nearly all of Hildegard's extant music for the Deutsche
Harmonia Mundi label, including two versions of ``Ordo Virtutum.''
When Sequentia offered its production again last summer, at the
Lincoln Center Festival, it was a popular draw, and one of at least
three versions of the work presented in New York City this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah
Lawrence College. During a tour with the Sarah Lawrence European
Chorus in the early 1970's, she decided to continue her studies in
Europe, and coached in the operatic repertory with teachers in
Amsterdam, Zurich and Cremona, Italy. Her growing interest in early
music led her to Basel, Switzerland, where she enrolled at the
Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, from which she received an advanced
diploma in performance practice in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   She met Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist, in Basel in 1974,
and started Sequentia with him in 1977. Like many early-music
ensembles, Sequentia expanded and contracted as the music required,
sometimes using solo voices and a single accompanying instrument,
sometimes drawing on a men's choir, the Sons of Thunder; a women's
choir, Vox Feminae, and medieval harps, strings, flutes and
hurdy-gurdy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton often wrote program notes for Sequentia's
performances and recordings. Besides its Hildegard series, the
group recorded three disks of sacred works from Spanish monasteries
_ including the ``Codex las Huelgas'' and works composed for King
Alfonso X (``El Sabio'') _ as well as several collections of
courtly love songs and a compilation of sacred and secular works by
Oswald von Wolkenstein, a knight, poet and composer who straddled
the 14th and 15th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by Bagby, her companion; her parents, Fletcher
and Margaret Thornton of Exeter, N.H., and two sisters, Susan Frey
Starbuck of Seattle, and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vt. &QL;

MILES PENNYBACKER, 97 A FOUNDER Of RAYTHEON 
 (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miles Pennybacker, who helped start the Raytheon Co. 1925, died
Nov. 9 at the Watrous Nursing Home in Madison, Conn. Pennybacker,
who lived in Westport, Conn., was 97.
</P>
<P>
   He started Voltarc Tubes in 1927 to make neon tubes for electric
sign companies. He was able to fight off an infringement suit by
Claude Neon, who held the neon patent, because of a singular design
for an electrode that heated the helium gas in the neon tubes. He
sold the company and retired in 1967. It was renamed Voltarc
Technologies in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jean; two daughters, Anne Watts of
Rockville, Md., and Claire Wilson of Putney, Vt.; a son, Bruce, of
Chapel Hill, N.C.; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia L. Storch, an innovator in women's health care, died
Nov. 9 at her home in Tenants Harbor, Maine. She was 65.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   She was best known as a private practitioner who was widely
influential in changing the rules of treatment for women in the
1970's. Until then, relatively few women practiced as gynecologists
and fewer still in the field that came to be known as feminist
medicine, in which women were encouraged to take a hand in making
informed medical decisions for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the first self-declared feminist physician,'' said
Barbara Seaman, a medical historian.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Chesler, a co-founder of the Women's Health Network and
author of ``Women and Madness,'' called Dr. Storch ``both a pioneer
and role model in feminist medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storch was born in Pittsburgh. She graduated from Bryn Mawr
College and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. In 1971 she moved
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   She directed the Adolescent Gynecology and Family Planning
Clinic at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which provided
treatment as well as information on birth control and sexually
transmitted diseases to tens of thousands of disadvantaged
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dr. Storch, Ms. Seaman said, women were expected to leave
the thinking to their gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Seaman, Dr. Storch insisted that patients in
her downtown Manhattan practice take an active part in deciding
everything from what form of birth control to use to whether to
attempt childbirth without painkillers. And she aggressively
promoted care for neglected problems like premenstrual syndrome and
menopause.
</P>
<P>
   After her retirement from private practice in 1989, she sought a
wider audience for her approach to medicine as a television and
radio producer. She created specialized programming for family
physicians on the Lifetime medical network, and later became the
head of Ob/Gyn news for the Medical News Network.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Storch is survived by Jean Hewitt, her partner of 20 years,
and a sister, Suzanne Storch of Inverness, Calif.

MARY MAIN, 95, AUTHOR OF EVA PERON BIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Main, a novelist who also wrote a highly regarded biography
of Eva Peron, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She
was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Main was born to British parents in Buenos Aires, where her
father was general manager of the Buenos Aires Western Railway.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in privileged Anglo-Argentine society, attending
finishing school in England before returning to her home, where she
married James Main, a British engineer, in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the couple moved to the United States and Ms. Main
began writing short stories for The Saturday Evening Post,
Collier's and other magazines. She published two novels in the late
1940's, and in 1950 Doubleday asked her to write a biography of Eva
Peron, who with her husband, Juan, was at the peak of power in
Argentina. Fearing trouble from the Peronistas, Ms. Main researched
the book clandestinely in Argentina and published it under the
pseudonym Maria Flores. ``Evita: The Woman With the Whip'' appeared
in 1952, shortly after Eva Peron's death. After Juan Peron was
thrown out of power, subsequent editions appeared under Ms. Main's
real name.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ``Evita'' in the
1970s and the appearance of the movie version in 1996 revived
interest in Ms. Main's book, and it was republished several times
in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt compassion, not sympathy,'' Ms. Main said in a 1980
interview in The New York Times. ``Eva did evil things, but she
wasn't really evil. She lived a life of fantasy. She was her own
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Maria Flores, Ms. Main wrote two other books based on events
in Latin American dictatorships: the novel ``The Call From Calle
Moreno,'' about a doctor called in to treat a victim of Juan
Peron's police, and ``The Benefactor,'' a story inspired by the
disappearance of the Columbia University professor Jesus de
Galindez, who was widely assumed to have been kidnapped by agents
of Rafael Trujillo, the Dominican dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Main's eyesight began to fail slowly in the 1940's, but it
was many years before she could accept that she was going blind.
</P>
<P>
   She was totally blind by the early 1960's, but she continued to
write, dictating her works on tape and editing by going back and
forth from one tape to another. But she published only one more
book, ``The Girl Who Was Never Queen,'' a historical novel, in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, she moved to Connecticut to live with her son, Jeremy.
She joined the National Federation of the Blind, founding its
Stamford-area chapter and serving as its president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren,
two stepgrandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

IVAN SHAPIRO, 69, ADVOCATE ON SOCIAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NOAM S. COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ivan Shapiro, a real estate lawyer and former
president of the Ethical Culture Society, who was also a leader in
organizations concerned with civil liberties and the homeless, died
Nov. 5. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease and cancer,
his wife, Maria, said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro was born in New York City in 1928. He graduated from
City College in 1948, and from Harvard Law School in 1951,
specializing in real estate law. He became a partner at the law
firms of Wein, Lane &AMP; Malkin and Greenbaum, Wolff &AMP; Ernst before
joining Willkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher in 1981 as a specialist in large
commercial real estate transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel to his legal career, Shapiro became a leader of the
Ethical Culture Society; he was its president from 1972 to 1978 and
chairman of its schools from 1977 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro also became a member of the New York Civil Liberties
Union, joining its board in 1966 and later becoming its treasurer.
There, he focused on abortion rights and on the separation of
church and state, a topic he often addressed in speeches broadcast
from the Ethical Cultural Society's Sunday meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was someone who didn't get the visibility, but he was a
pillar of the development of the modern-day civil liberties
union,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York
Civil Liberties Union. ``He helped frame some of the most important
civil liberty issues of the late 20th century, and he did it in a
humanistic way.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Shapiro was the president of Urban Pathways, a
nonprofit agency that serves the homeless population of New York
City. During his time as president, the agency acquired an empty
plot in Hell's Kitchen and built a residence for 55 formerly
homeless men and women who are mentally ill. In 1996, the six-story
building on West 46th Street, with individual studio apartments and
supervised treatment, was named Ivan Shapiro House.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's first marriage, to Florence Goodstein, ended in
divorce. In addition to his wife, Shapiro is survived by two
daughters, Alexandra Shapiro of Malibu, Calif., and Lisa J. Kubiske
of Annandale, Va., and two grandsons. &QL;

REASONS TO CELEBRATE FOR TOP-RANKED USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beating UCLA was even sweeter than usual for the USC men's water
polo team Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   USC's 9-6 victory over No. 2 UCLA clinched the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation regular-season championship for the No. 1 Trojans
and almost assured them of a berth in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was huge first of all to beat the Bruins,'' said
goalie Richard McEvoy, who had 10 saves in the Trojans' ninth
straight win, ``but also because it puts us in a good spot for
NCAAs. Our goal is to go undefeated the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Host USC improved to 20-1 overall and 7-0 in conference play,
with two games remaining. One of those games is against the Bruins
(15-4, 6-2) _ whom the Trojans have now beat twice this year _ in
the season finale Saturday at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's SC-UCLA, it's all emotion,'' Trojans coach John
Williams said. ``This game was in the top two or three of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   A steal by USC's Allen Basso set up a pass to wide-open Peter
Janov at the other end of the pool midway through the fourth
quarter. Janov went one-on-one with Bruins goalie Parsa Bonderson
and used a soft toss into the corner of the net to give the Trojans
their biggest lead of the day, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   The junior 2-meter man led USC with four goals. Marko Pintaric,
James Castle, Adam Guerro and Basso scored one each.
</P>
<P>
   Pintaric made a two-point shot with 5:29 left in the first
quarter to give the Trojans the initial lead. Castle's back-handed
spin shot a little more than a minute later provided a 3-0 cushion.
The Bruins twice drew within one, but USC's superior defense
controlled the game. Even with a two-man disadvantage late in the
fourth quarter, the Trojans shut down UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our worst game of the year,'' Bruins coach Guy Baker
said. ``We played scared. We weren't even close to what we wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kern led UCLA with three goals and Bonderson provided 10
saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans won't savor the victory long, though.
</P>
<P>
   They witnessed first hand the struggles of last year's
regular-season champs. Pepperdine didn't even make the final of
last year's MPSF championships following a season much like the
Trojans are experiencing this year. USC entered the tournament as
the No. 4 seed and won the title. The Trojans then gave the Waves a
scare before falling in overtime in the NCAA final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was important,'' Williams said. ``But you can't say
this is the game. We still play UCLA again this week and probably
in MPSF. We didn't rest for the game, we didn't prepare any
differently.''

VALERIE HOBSON, 81, ACTRESS AND PROFUMO'S WIFE 
 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Hobson, a British movie star who stayed loyal to her
husband, John Profumo, after he figured in a sex scandal as a
member of Britain's Conservative government in 1963, died on Friday
at a London hospital. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, the British news agency Press
Association said.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hobson, a British naval officer's daughter, starred in
British films of the 1930s and 1940s. As the the movie historian
Ephraim Katz put it, ``She developed into one of the prime leading
ladies of the British screen, gentle, graceful and elegant, the
personification of the well-bred upper-crust English lady.''
</P>
<P>
   She retired as an actress after starring as the governess, Anna,
in the 1953 stage production of the musical ``The King and I'' in
London. That role, The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday, was her
greatest success, and ``as an actress, she knew, like Garbo, when
to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The British critic W.A. Darlington wrote in The New York Times
that in the musical her singing voice ``was true and clear'' and
``besides the great good looks which had taken her on to movies,
she proved to have a warm and charming personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier she starred as Estella in David Lean's ``Great
Expectations'' (1946), which the critic Leonard Maltin has called
``one of the greatest films ever made, a vivid adaptation of
Dickens' tale of a mysterious benefactor making a poor young orphan
a gentleman of means.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of her best-remembered film roles was her starring part,
with Alec Guinness, in the much-applauded black comedy ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' (1949).
</P>
<P>
   In 1954 she married Profumo, a Conservative member of
Parliament. He stepped down in disgrace as Secretary of State for
War in 1963 after it had become known that he was having an affair
with a British call girl, Christine Keeler, who was also involved
with a Soviet military attache.
</P>
<P>
   Later Profumo did much to redeem himself by throwing himself
into unpaid charity work. Miss Hobson also did volunteer work, for
a leprosy relief organization and for children with mental
handicaps. In 1975 she and her husband went to Buckingham Palace,
where he was honored for his good works by being made a Commander,
Order of the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   The 1963 scandal became the basis for the 1989 film ``Scandal''
_ which, the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, ``so
abridges and elides the real-life case that it isn't easy for a
non-student to follow the chronology of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Larne in Northern Ireland, Miss Hobson went on to attend
the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She began her performing career
on the London stage, acted in some modest British films, then made
some Hollywood movies for Universal _ largely forgettable, except
for ``The Bride of Frankenstein,'' where she played the baron's
wife _ and returned to Britain in the mid-1930's.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1939 marriage to Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, a baronet who
had produced several movies she was in, ended in divorce in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Mark
Havelock-Allan and David Profumo.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A DEMOCRATIC `GROUND WAR' SLIPS BY THE RADAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the surprises in the recent elections, one widely shared
prediction turned out to be correct. Despite increases in those
eligible and registered to vote, only 72.5 million Americans turned
up at the polls, 2.5 million fewer than four years ago. It was the
lowest voting participation rate since 1942 and the lowest outside
the South since 1818.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath this dismal trend lies an encouraging phenomenon
that bears examination. About a dozen states increased turnout, in
many cases because of get-out-the-vote drives by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the election on the ground,'' asserts Gov. Roy Romer of
Colorado, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, referring
to the thousands of foot soldiers thrown into the breach in a way
the party had not done in decades. Romer and other political
operatives have come to realize that attack ads on television and
radio may persuade some voters at the cost of turning off others.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks especially to the Christian Coalition and other religious
conservatives, Republicans marshaled sufficient ground forces to
influence the results in the last several elections.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, however, the AFL-CIO spent millions on attack ads
to try to elect Democrats in a few dozen congressional races. They
lost almost all of them, but infuriated the Republicans so much
that they counterattacked in Congress by introducing anti-union
bills. This election, the AFL-CIO shifted strategy and spent more
money on mailings, telephone calls and other low-key but intense
efforts to motivate union members and their communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats selected a handful of races where they knew
turnout could make a difference, organized Democratic allies and
enlisted thousands of volunteers to make calls, go door to door,
pass out leaflets and otherwise contact individual voters, usually
on behalf of a cause like Social Security or women's issues.
</P>
<P>
   The allied groups included unions, women's organizations, black
community groups, gay activists, youth groups, seniors, ethnic
groups, disability groups and many others. The Democrats' surveys
showed that personal contact with a party worker was more effective
than television ads in motivating voters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of theories about why voter turnout has
declined. Some say voters have grown cynical, doubtful of
government's role in their lives and alienated by negative
campaigning. Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, argues that all Americans should be
alarmed by what he calls the ``long-term demobilization'' of
voters. The committee found this year that the overall drop in
turnout among Republicans from 1994 was 19 percent, compared with
only 2.1 percent for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   My own feeling is that an additional factor reducing turnout
rates is that political organizations no longer invest in producing
the turnout. Getting out the vote was forgotten as campaigns turned
more and more to costly television advertising, raising more and
more money from special interests to do it. This year the Democrats
invested in the ``ground war'' in Kentucky, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii and Maryland, all states that
experienced an increase in turnout.
</P>
<P>
   It may be wishful thinking, but if this election forces the
rediscovery of old-style politics closer to the voter, and the
possibly diminishing returns of negative advertising on the
airwaves, it will have benefits more far-reaching than anything
else the winners may achieve.

CAMINITI AND ASTROS RENEW THEIR RELATIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 AGENTS-NYT  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The acquisition of Ken Caminiti signaled the rebirth of the San
Diego Padres' franchise four years ago, but now the third baseman
is headed back to the Houston Astros. Caminiti, the National
League's most valuable player in 1996, agreed to a two-year, $9.5
million contract with the Astros Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who acquired Caminiti as part of an 11-player trade
with the Astros in December 1994, hoped to re-sign him. Given his
diminished production, however _ he batted .252 with 29 home runs
last season, after hitting .326 with 40 homers in 1996 and .290
with 26 homers in 1997 _ San Diego wanted to pay him about $3
million a season, far below what other teams were offering.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was a Gold Glove winner in 1996 and 1997, but his
defensive skills were dramatically hampered by injuries last
season; playing against the Yankees in the World Series, he botched
several plays, and twice his knee appeared to buckle as he took a
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Caminiti, 35, has a well-earned reputation for
toughness, and the Detroit Tigers dangled a three-year, $21.5
million contract in front of Caminiti before they signed Dean
Palmer. Caminiti preferred to remain with the Padres or return to
Houston, the team with which he broke into the big leagues in 1987.
Houston also holds a $5.5 million option on Caminiti for the 2001
season.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was happy to return to Houston, in part because he
maintained his home in nearby Richmond, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a strange life on a family, and I think happiness
is being with my family, my kids and my wife,'' he told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Padres, the Yankees may have to fill an opening in
their World Series lineup. Center-fielder Bernie Williams is
considering offers from other clubs, so the Yankees are looking
elsewhere. Brian Cashman, their general manager, flew to Arizona
last night, apparently to meet with Albert Belle, the slugger who
has another two weeks to decide if he wants to leave the Chicago
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, 32, would fit neatly into the cleanup slot in the Yankee
lineup, between right-fielder Paul O'Neill and first-baseman Tino
Martinez. An improved outfielder, Belle would play left field, and
the Yankees would use either Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis in center
field, or acquire another center fielder, such as Anaheim's Jim
Edmonds, or the free-agent Brian Jordan, who will meet with the
Yankees on Wednesday. Boston also has interest in Belle, who others
say is seeking a huge contract and wants to be among the game's
highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on the verge of completing a minor trade with
the Minnesota Twins. The Yankees will receive Dan Naulty, a
28-year-old right-handed pitcher who has pitched in 97 games in the
majors. In return, they will deal the minor-league infielder Allen
Butler, an eighth-round pick in the 1996 draft.

HINGIS LOOKS FOR FIRST TOURNAMENT VICTORY SINCE MAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sushi platter was not allowed to remain a marine
still life for long. After doing a double-take at the size of her
portion, Martina Hingis activated her chopsticks and went
spear-fishing from a restaurant banquette in New York City last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the second-ranked Hingis has had better luck catching
fish than titles. Though she ended 1997 ranked No. 1 in the world
by a landslide, this year she will settle for second place, unless
Lindsay Davenport loses in the first round of the Chase
Championships and Hingis wins the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So there she was, just 18 but already on the rebound, chowing
down and shoring up her stamina for the most important hunt on her
agenda _ the year-ending Chase Championships at Madison Square
Garden that begins Monday. Hingis, mired in a slump she deems a
personal insult, hoped to reclaim the No. 1 ranking that Davenport
took from her a month ago. Davenport also took away Hingis'
bragging rights as the United States Open champion by beating her
in the Open final. Now, Hingis is simply trying to win a title, not
the ranking sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of the year for me,'' Hingis said. ``I didn't win
a tournament since May, and believe me it would be nice to walk
away from 1998 with a win. When you're used to being a champion,
it's like a drug, you want to be there again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now she's been better than me, and I want to beat her. I
don't have this feeling about anyone else,'' Hingis added, in what
amounted to a candid and unapologetic declaration of war against
the towering Californian, the winner of all three finals the duo
contested this year. It rankles the average-sized teen-ager that,
in recent history, bigger is proving to be better. According to
Hingis, the so-called ``big girls'' are apparently ganging up on
her.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to a group of bullies that includes
Davenport, Venus Williams and Mary Pierce, is 29-year-old Steffi
Graf, who humbled Hingis by 6-0 last Friday night in the third set
of their quarterfinal in Advanta, and spoiled Davenport's bid to
clinch as the year-end No. 1 by beating her in the final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they've figured out my game,'' said Hingis, who
often toyed with that cartel of heavy-hitters during her 1997
heyday and still senses she has the strategy to outwit them. ``But
the big girls, their bodies are bigger than mine, and they've
worked on themselves. I have to be more clever and faster than
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Hingis was just that, but then an inevitable case of
ennui set in. ``Sometimes when you're over-confident, you kind of
lose your focus,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hingis' predecessor at the top, the regally remote Graf,
always scoffed at the notion that the computer ranking was anything
more than a manufactured statistic, Hingis was unashamed to admit
that she reveled in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bug me to be No. 2. I don't like the 2,'' she said
last week as, with her sushi leftovers stowed in a doggie bag with
a piece of chocolate cake, she ambled along Madison Avenue to an
autograph session. ``I mean, last year I was almost unbeatable.
There is nothing for me to lose anymore.'' Hingis is as blunt in
reviewing her shortcomings as she was last year when she
matter-of-factly declared herself the best player on earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and not so far from braces and pigtails, a 16-year-old
Hingis not only became the youngest No. 1-ranked woman in tennis
history, she monopolized three of the four slam championships with
her canny mixture of clockwork counter-punching and opportunistic
show-stoppers that sliced up the court. Though her serve did not
sting, the rest of her arsenal did. More subtly than sensationally,
Hingis turned the competition to little more than accessories to
her ambition. They praised her work ethic and versatility, they
(publicly) declared her the undisputed No. 1 in 1997, and they
(secretly) devoted themselves to disputing her stranglehold in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hence this mixed bag of a year where she successfully defended
the first slam title of her career in Melbourne, acquired and
discarded her first serious beau (the bleached-blond 106th-ranked
Spaniard, Julian Alonso), became the first female athlete to grace
a GQ cover, and ceased to be the first lady of tennis when
Davenport displaced her on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hingis appeared to be on track early in 1998, Monica
Seles reduced her to rubble in their French Open semifinal, and
Jana Novotna snuffed out her Wimbledon defense in the semifinal
round. Discouraged, Hingis went into a summer funk from which she
was not quite able to bestir herself at the United States Open,
where her slam campaign concluded on the meek note of a 6-3, 7-5
loss to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she's lost her touch for the game, although she
has seemed a little tired this year,'' Davenport said. ``It's more
that the rest of us realized the one way to beat her is overpower
her. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.'' Lately it has.
</P>
<P>
   From invincible to vulnerable? Hingis refuses to view her
evolution that gloomily. Aware that Davenport improved her game,
Hingis vowed to do the same. Her lackluster autumn schedule
included a loss to Patty Schnyder, also from Switzerland, who
happens to be her first-round Chase opponent. At their Grand Slam
Cup match, Hingis retired with heat cramps. After visiting her
horses in the Czech Republic, Hingis repaired to the Bollettieri
Sports Academy to recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on myself there,'' said Hingis, who also got
treatment for a chronic ankle sprain. Hingis noted that her court
coverage suffered this season as Davenport's improved. ``I thought
I had improved myself in 1998, but I also got worse in some areas.
You want to make her move around, but it's easy to say and hard to
do. I've had to concentrate on motivating myself. You feel more
tired when you're losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week at the Advanta Championships in Philadelphia, Graf saw
to it that yet another successful title defense eluded the upstart
who had dared to pronounce her over-the-hill last year. Now Hingis'
last chance for restitution is the Chase Championships, one of the
rare main events that she has never won. The French Open is the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like a dream final to play Lindsay: No. 1 against
No. 2 with everything on the line,'' Hingis said. Everything except
the No. 1 ranking.

CARDINALS ARE ALMOST-READY-FOR-PRIME-TIME PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 EDITORS: RAW, Unedited version 
 ATTN: Dallas Morning News 
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The plan was sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal on offense,'' Vince Tobin revealed during the week,
``is to score more points than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Dallas Cowboys somehow got wind of this
strategy and adopted it themselves. Late in the second quarter
Sunday, the Cowboys had 28 points; the Cardinals zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 28-0?'' Jake Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake didn't remember. ``I just knew it was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was worse than bad. This had the look and feel of one of
those Grade AA eggs the Cardinals usually lay in big games and this
was their biggest game in a long long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards were playing to a full house for a share of the NFC
East lead. Mercy, what if they won? Would players suffer vertigo?
The last time a Cardinals team was so high in the standings it got
a nosebleed.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Cardinals talked about playing in a game like this
back in training camp. Now they had the opportunity to prove to
everyone, and themselves, they are ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time as in national TV. Prime Time as in Deion Sanders who
picked off a Plummer pass and ran to the Arizona two-yard line to
set up Dallas' fourth score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 28-0?'' Jake said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes it was.
</P>
<P>
   But no one will remember 28-0. What we will remember is Jake
Plummer skittering around in the backfield and rolling out under
pressure and throwing on the run and leading a Cardinals
second-half comeback against odds longer than Deion's limousine.
</P>
<P>
   We will remember Plummer's three touchdown passes against a
Dallas secondary that suddenly appeared defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   We will remember Cowboys owner Jerry Jones pacing the sideline
for the benefit of TV cameras and glancing up at the ticking clock
and holding his breath _ as we all did _ when No. 16 softly lofted
ball one last time, the final play.
</P>
<P>
   A fade route in the corner of the endzone. Rob Moore was there.
So was the Cowboys' Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Jump ball. Contact. Incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   No flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,'' Deion said
after the Cowboys' 35-28 victory. Dressed in an electric blue suit,
red lizard shoes and a Dick Tracy fedora to match, Sanders also
might want to thank Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith and the wisdom of
the side judge who reached for the hankie in his hip pocket, as if
he felt a sneeze coming on, but then took his hand away.
</P>
<P>
   No whining, please. The officials didn't beat the Cardinals.
Aikman and Smith and Billy Davis and David LaFleur did. The Cowboys
scored five touchdowns. Five touchdowns against a defense that gave
too much ground and left too many receivers uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Five TDs will beat the Arizona Cardinals almost every time.
</P>
<P>
   Please, no talk of moral victory either. Losing is losing.
Plummer waved off those who recited his statistics _ 465 yards
passing, the most ever by an NFL player in Sun Devil Stadium. ``I'd
rather win,'' he said, quietly, ``and throw for 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals should be heartened. They turned certain
embarrassment into an afternoon to remember and a performance they
can build upon.
</P>
<P>
   They outplayed the Cowboys in the second half and when it was
over and the division leaders found their pulse they sounded more
like survivors than winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 28-0?'' Jake asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they could come back,'' admitted Chan Gailey, a
better and classier coach than Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hennings, the Cowboys defensive tackle, talked about the
Cardinals fight and heart. Dale Hellestrae, a Valley resident in
the off-season, spoke the unvarnished truth when he said the
Cardinals ``are a step below us'' _ but not a giant step.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have beaten every NFC East opponent. The Cards
twice. But this wasn't the same Arizona team Dallas rolled over in
the season opener. These are the new Cardinals, the young and the
restless. They have talent, and promise.
</P>
<P>
   And a future. Gailey said, ``I can't put into words the
improvement they've made.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to be gracious in victory. But the winners' remarks
had a ring of sincerity. Dallas lost here a year ago _ the day the
goalposts came down. And Sunday the Cowboys very nearly were pushed
into overtime by the heroics of a quarterback who said his team
````never'' quits, as you can tell.'' &QL;

LOS ANGELES ARCHDIOCESE ENVISIONS NEW CATHEDRAL AS BEACON OF FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beside the Hollywood Freeway, the beacon from the
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will be unmistakable: a
six-story cross framed in luminous alabaster, beaming Christ's
symbol to 42 million drivers a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you ever get off the freeway and go into it, we think
the cathedral will draw people to God's presence,'' said Cardinal
Roger Mahony, leader of the nation's largest Roman Catholic
archdiocese and spiritual architect of the new cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Our Lady of the Angels, scheduled for dedication in 2001, will
replace the earthquake-damaged St. Vibiana's Cathedral as the
religious center for 4 million Catholics in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Poised above the third-busiest freeway in California and
designed to seat more worshippers than any cathedral in the
country, Our Lady of the Angels will be a world-class religious
monument befitting a city of Los Angeles' stature, church leaders
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has a lot to do with the city's identity,'' said
archdiocese spokesman the Rev. Gregory Coiro. ``I think the
cathedral represents the loftier aspirations of the people of the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Critics view the $163 million edifice as an
emblem of Los Angeles' renowned excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large, triumphal, monumental churches, while they give grand
aesthetics, are inappropriate to the worship of a Christ that was
born in a feeding trough and died on a cross,'' said Jeff Dietrich,
a member of the Catholic Worker, a religious community devoted to
feeding the poor that has protested the cathedral project.
</P>
<P>
   They also question the appropriateness of its elite list of
top-dollar donors, suspecting the cathedral is more of a public
works project than a spiritual undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top contributors are movie executive Roy Disney and
his wife, Patty; department store heiress Betsy Bloomingdale;
Universal Studios Chairman Emeritus Lew Wasserman; Mayor Richard
Riordan; comedian Bob Hope; and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey
Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reads like a chamber of commerce for downtown
development,'' Dietrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony said the archdiocese makes no secret that Our Lady of the
Angels is joining an effort to revive downtown Los Angeles, as the
cathedral will benefit Angelenos of all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will be a very exciting space for the community
in general,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the archdiocese spends millions of dollars in
community services and no donations were accepted if they come at
the expense of other charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Located on 5.6 acres at Grand and Temple avenues near the
freeway, the cathedral will be surrounded by a landscaped plaza,
meditation garden, children's hedgerow maze, pools and fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Along the rectory on the site's east side will be a conference
center, cafe, California history museum and services for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Towering over all will be the cathedral, with a ceiling soaring
above 100 feet and massive, bronze doors opening 20 feet high and
30 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   It is planned to stand for 500 years, Mahony said, and it will
hold more than 3,000 people at maximum capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral's sheer size poses the architectural challenge of
infusing warmth into immensity. Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo
answered that with earthy materials and ethereal lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Diffuse sunlight will stream through panes of Spanish alabaster,
in mosaics of white, brown and tawny stone. Mahony said the
slanted, recessed windows are designed to borrow from the original
California missions, as do the adobe-colored concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   Panels of alabaster will also surround the 60-foot-high altar
cross, backlighting the symbol at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside, the effect of natural light and atmosphere, wood pews
and ceilings, is to create a warm and friendly space,'' Mahony
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other features aim toward a hands-on liturgy. A baptismal font
will be large enough to allow full immersion of adults, in addition
to the simple sprinkling of holy water.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of traditional church design, the entryway opens
onto the altar side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people when they come into a church would come into the
back row, and then too many of them will sit in the back row,''
Mahony said. ``So we faked them out by bringing them in the
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Rows of pews will be placed on either side of the altar instead
of just in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is closer to the altar, as well as to each other, so
it's a community rather than a sense of isolation,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   On the northern wall, a mural will depict the history of the
Catholic faith in Los Angeles, from the early missions to the
dedication of Our Lady of the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The painting will end midway down the wall, leaving space for
future church leaders to document the next 500 years.

   LOS ANGELES: 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Our Lady of the Angels project came to life after the 1994
Northridge Earthquake struck a death blow to St. Vibiana's, on 2nd
Street downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it has been besieged by opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the quake, Mahony announced that the archdiocese
would raze the unsafe St. Vibiana's and build a larger cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, the church began dismantling the bell tower of St.
Vibiana's but the Los Angeles Conservancy sued, arguing the
building was not damaged beyond repair. Superior Court Judge Robert
H. O'Brien ordered the archdiocese to conduct an environmental
review and obtain demolition permits.
</P>
<P>
   Coiro said the archdiocese is still completing the environmental
impact report and has put the property up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Shoshone Gabrieleno Nation and Spirit of the
Sage Council sued the archdiocese, arguing that a skull and arm
bone found during the 1950s proved the site housed Native American
remains. O'Brien ruled in June the Archdiocese could start
building.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups appealed, but could not halt construction.
</P>
<P>
   Weather permitting, Mahony said, dedication is expected to take
place by Sept. 4, 2001, in time for the feast of Our Lady of the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that the cathedral's celestial dimensions
reflect worldly extravagance not in keeping with the Christian
mission.
</P>
<P>
   At the October groundbreaking, protesters commandeered a skip
loader before Mahony could scoop the first shovel of earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had anything near the amount of money that was being
spent on this cathedral _ if anything near that was going to the
poor _ I would be standing with the cardinal today, helping with
the groundbreaking,'' Dietrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Mayer, a member of St. Frances De Sales Catholic Church,
said found the protest ``disgraceful'' but struggles with the
cathedral's cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's that much expendable income out there we should
probably be doing more for the poor of our city,'' said Mayer, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hernandez, a parishioner at Our Lady of the Valley
Catholic Church, agreed: ``It's a lot of money. I think we lack
many things here. And it seems to me the schools are lacking,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony noted the annual contributions of hundreds of other
Catholic organizations, hospitals and individual churches total
more than the cost of the cathedral, Mahony estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that across the archdiocese it would amount to a
minimum of $250 million a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese provided $7.5 million to the neediest Catholic
schools and churches. And its Education Foundation gives $4 million
to $5 million in tuitions for lower-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities, an organization affiliated with the church,
provides close to $20 million annually in food, counseling,
homeless aid, immigration assistance, and services to youth and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not take a gift from anybody if by giving to the
cathedral they would stop giving to other causes,'' Mahony said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Peters, director of corporate communications for The
Walt Disney Co., which contributed to the cathedral's public plaza,
said the company also donates to Catholic Charities and other
community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very supportive of projects that serve the needs of our
community,'' Peters said. ``And churches often focus on these kinds
of programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clergy and parishioners said the cathedral will aid other
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that by having a church like that there over the
years, more money will be spent on the poor,'' said the Rev. Robert
McNamara of St. John Eudes.
</P>
<P>
   Added Barbara Welsh, 50, a member of St. Francis De Sales: ``I'm
thrilled that they're doing it,'' said ``I think the thing is,
build it and they will come.''

UNDERDOG USUALLY DOES WELL IN THIS COLLISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The prevailing theory is that anything can happen
when UCLA and USC collide, but that is not true. Something will
happen. Something specific, something exciting and something
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   If history holds, the underdog will rise.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog has covered the point spread nine years in a row in
the cross-town showdown _ an amazing streak that began when 3-7
UCLA tied the No.8 Trojans in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have been underdogs five times during their
seven-game winning streak and covered the spread each time _
including 1993, when Rose Bowl-bound UCLA was a one-point underdog.
Last year, UCLA was a 10-point favorite and won 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are a 7-point favorite this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ BCS update: The Bruins remained third in the Associated Press
and the ESPN/Coaches' Top-25 polls, but they moved up one spot in
the Sagarin computer ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Expect UCLA to remain No.2 when the Bowl Championship Series
rankings are released today, trailing Tennessee and holding a
narrow lead over Kansas State. Both teams closed ground on the
Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   __ So close, so far: Tod McBride nearly blocked his third punt
of the season in the fourth quarter at Washington. He charged
through a hole in the protection but missed the ball and was called
for roughing the kicker _ the first such penalty called on the
Bruins this year.
</P>
<P>
   Washington retained possession, but safety Larry Atkins
intercepted Huskies quarterback Brock Huard a few plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit him,'' McBride said. ``I guess they called it on
me because I was the only one around, but I didn't touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Decision time?` The Bruins are two wins from a potential
conflict. The Fiesta Bowl is Jan.4 at 5 p.m., but the men's
basketball team is scheduled to play Arizona State that day at 7:30
p.m. at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   There are two obvious options: Move the basketball game to
Jan.3, a Sunday, or keep the game on the 4th but move tipoff to
noon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the conflict is moot if the Bruins don't qualify for
the Fiesta Bowl, which explains their reluctance to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   __ A reminder: As usual during USC week, practice is closed to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Right tackle Brian Polak injured his right
knee during the third quarter but returned a few plays later and is
expected to play this week.

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer was the first
to reach side judge Nate Jones and lashed out at him
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Step up and make the call,''' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer was more polite than some of his teammates in discussing
the final play of the game, an incomplete pass to wide receiver Rob
Moore in the right corner of the end zone that preserved the Dallas
Cowboys' 35-28 victory over the Cardinals Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were convinced that Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith
had roughed up Moore and should have been called for pass
interference..
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very upset,'' linebacker Jamir Miller said. ``The
officials threw the game. That's B.S. ... They must be on the
Cowboys' payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith acknowledged that he ``thought it was a flag'' the
way the Cardnals responded. ``But it is over with, we won the game
and that's all that matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin, who rarely criticizes officials,
was incensed by interference not being called, especially after
Moore told him that one official had reached for a flag in his back
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like there were an awful lot of people pushing
and shoving,'' Tobin said. ``I didn't see a lot of looking back for
the ball. What I saw was Rob Moore go up for the ball, and guy come
into him. He (Moore) has to reach all the way over the top of
(Smith), and (Smith's) got his helmet buried in Rob's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing: the Cardinals have had a lot of
controversial calls, and it seems most of them have gone against
us. That bothers me a lot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Crybabies?
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he got tired of the Cowboys trying to influence the
officials' calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like a bunch of little girls crying,'' Miller said.
``That's not how you play football.'' &QL; 
Moore speed
</P>
<P>
   Rob Moore thought he was gone, otherwise he would have run out
of bounds to sto p the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the guy until the last second,'' Moore said of
Kevin Smith, the Dallas Cowboys cornerback who would become a
menace more than once in the closing seconds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 seconds to go and the Cardinals 62 yards away from
sending the game to overtime, quarterback Jake Plummer hit Moore
deep over the middle. Moore spun away from Smith and broke away
toward the goalline. But Kenny Wheaton dove and got just enough of
Moore's shoe to trip him. Inbounds at the Dallas 5.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Cardinals, who were out of timeouts, could get
set up for Plummer to spike the ball to stop the clock, only 9
seconds rema ined. It was a 57-yard play that used 27 precious
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Had Moore taken a flatter path to the sideline, he would have
been able to get out of bounds an d save roughly 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought I would be able to get in (the end zone),''
Moore said. ``I was just living for the moment at the time. He s
urprised me. He got just enough of my legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 5-5 now but there's no question we're still in the
playoff race. The challenge for us emotionally is to get back for
the next game. Games like this take a lot out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Smit h was involved in controversial coverage on Moore on the
final play of the game. The Cardinals claimed Smith interfered with
Moore in the end zone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dropping an opportunity &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have run the reverse to Frank Sanders dozens of
times on the prac tice field without a snafu. When they tried it in
the first quarter shortly aft er Dallas had taken a 7-0 lead,
though, it was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders came aro und from the left side and fumbled the handoff
from Jake Plummer. Hurvin McCorm ack of the Cowboys recovered at
the Cardinals 32. Four plays later, it was 14-0 in a deficit that
would reach 28-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was too early to affect the gam e much,'' Sanders said.
``It gave them seven points, but there was a lot of tim e left.
We've shown that we can come back, it doesn't matter if it's Dallas
or whomever. That is just one of those plays that you run one time
in a game and h ope to catch the defense out of position. I
attribute the fumble to me. I just dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders atoned to some degree with several big plays in a
second-half rally, finishing with 11 catches for 190 yards. &QL; 
Cowboys impressed &QL; 
Plummer threw for 465 yards and three touchdowns _ 123 yards more
than the second-best performance in the NFL Sunday (San Francisco's
Steve Young passed for 342 in a loss). And Dallas cornerback Deion
Sanders came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's going to be special. You keep the right personnel
around him, he's a special quarterback. He looked like a young Fran
Tarkenton out there. I've seen him on film, week in and week out,
trying to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some tremendous plays. There are not many quarterbacks
in the NFL who can make those plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of quarterback you don't want to see in the
fourth quarter to tell you the truth. Because he finds a way to get
the job done. He did an exceptional job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had an excellent ballgame,'' Aikman said. ``I've
been a fan of his. I enjoy watching him play, and I knew he was
going to continue to compete. They've got a good one in him. He's
going to win a lot of football games for them over the course of
his career.'' &QL;

N.Y. BOROUGHS BATTLE OVER TRASH AS LAST LANDFILL NEARS CLOSE
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sculptor who has lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
for 20 years says he is thinking of moving to get away from the
garbage. A retired salesman in Hunts Point in the Bronx crinkles
his nose as he describes the acrid smell of the endless garbage
trucks. On the Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook, a man rails against
a plan to bring immense garbage barges to a newly created shipping
hub for trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to bring in here is death, the barges of
death,'' said the man, Jay McKnight, who lives in public housing
and is a member of the Red Hook Lions Club.
</P>
<P>
   These scarred old waterfront areas are ground zero in the
scramble to find a solution to the flow of residential trash that,
by law, must stop going to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten
Island by Dec. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   They are home to what are called transfer stations, buildings
where local commercial garbage has for a decade been unloaded from
standard-sized garbage trucks, compacted and transferred to
18-wheelers for shipment out of state. Now, residential waste is
starting to go to these commercial stations, and soon new, much
larger stations will be added to transfer residential waste to
railroad cars or oceangoing barges.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that as Fresh Kills prepares to close, large
swaths of the city will experience a much closer connection with
garbage, both through the transfer stations and the fleets of
trucks traveling to them.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the city is changing its entire system for handling
the 3.5 million tons of waste it produces yearly, a tonnage equal
to 76 Titanics. Exporting to other states, at a cost the city
estimates may exceed $6 billion over the next 30 years, is the
linchpin of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that the rules on placing transfer stations are
illegal, that city laws for fairly sharing odious activities are
ignored and that minority residents suffer unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, these issues were addressed at a Brooklyn hearing by
an Environmental Protection Agency advisory panel. It may recommend
an increased Federal role in insuring that waste disposal policies
here and in other cities are not discriminatory. On Thursday, the
State Department of Environmental Conservation withdrew permits for
two transfer stations in Williamsburg after opponents raised
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents hope delay will stall the city's drive to close Fresh
Kills, and force a policy re-evaluation. They demand a more open
process, adherence to city rules against ``clustering'' unpleasant
public services. Even as they say they favor closing Fresh Kills,
they seethe that poorer, minority areas dominated by Democrats
appear to be sacrificial lambs for satisfying white Republican
Staten Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall has so far sketched a rigid approach. The city would
assign huge contracts to large garbage companies to ship trash by
rail or barge to Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states, and it
would truck trash out until then, reducing the flow to Fresh Kills
to nothing in three years.
</P>
<P>
   As tension builds between the boroughs, there are hints that
City Hall's approach may be changing. Joseph J. Lhota, Deputy Mayor
for Operations, said the city hoped to make far more use of its
existing city-owned waterfront stations for transferring garbage to
barges _ something critics have strongly urged.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean dumping was the primary means of disposal until 1935, when
a coalition of New Jersey coastal cities forced New York to end the
practice. (Ocean dumping of sewage sludge was banned in 1992.) Then
landfills and incinerators were used for garbage. Apartment
incinerators were outlawed in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, landfills in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens closed.
Fresh Kills, which opened in 1948 as a temporary dump, became the
only disposal site after incinerators ended.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the city stopped collecting commercial waste. A new
industry emerged to handle this waste, shipping some of it out of
the city. In 1988, even more commercial waste was pushed to
out-of-state landfills when the city raised the price it charged
commercial haulers to dump at Fresh Kills.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990's the city started to make plans to close Fresh
Kills, prompted by two Federal lawsuits. Engineers developed plans
for a vast enclosed transfer station there for shipment to
out-of-state landfills. But planners assumed the landfill would be
open for another 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, in 1996, it appeared the City Council would pass a law
to begin closing Fresh Kills. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, both of whom rode strong Staten Island majorities to
victory, jointly announced the dump would close. The State
Legislature passed a law to do this.
</P>
<P>
   At that point only the closing date was known. A task force was
set up with limited options: no incinerators or landfills.
Moreover, the task force decided that recycling could not come
close to filling the need.
</P>
<P>
   Export seemed the only route. The city took its plans for a huge
transfer station at Fresh Kills _ behind the scenes, those plans
had come to appear politically impossible because of Staten Island
opposition _ then asked the major waste companies to propose a
similar center somewhere else on New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The companies came back with 13 proposals, including building
huge stations in Red Hook, Bay Ridge, the South Bronx and
Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal to put garbage in huge containers on barges at the
marine transfer stations was rejected as impractical. But the idea
has come to dominate discussions of garbage strategy. Opponents
favor the eight existing marine transfer stations, where white
sanitation trucks already go, because they are evenly distributed
around the city and are not concentrated in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: For the first time since the 1930s, when ocean
dumping ended, none of New York City's garbage will be disposed of
in the city. But more areas of the city will play host to garbage,
perhaps permanently.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ The way the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals
played football Sunday, who needs the NBA?
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the pro basketballers don't settle their labor problems,
sports fans searching for high-scoring games might want to tune
into Jake ``The Snake'' Plummer and his Cardinals. They scored 28
points in a stretch of 27 minutes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing on the run and usually off-balance, Plummer brought the
Cardinals back from a 28-0 deficit, only to see his team lose 35-28
when his final pass, from the Cowboys' five-yard line, bounced off
cornerback Kevin Smith and eluded intended receiver Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have thrown the ball a foot higher, Rob, being the
athlete he is, comes down with the ball,'' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We survived,'' a relieved Cowboys safety, Darren Woodson, said
in the visitors' locker room at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Said fellow safety Omar Stoutmire: ``In the second half, we
didn't come out ready to play, but we get to go home happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they survived the challenge to their leadership of the
NFC East. By beating the Cardinals, however narrowly, the Cowboys
advanced their record to 7-3, giving them a two-game lead over
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, there was little to fault with the Cowboys, who had
no turnovers and no sacks. Emmitt Smith rushed for 118 yards and
had the sixth three-touchdown day of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Smith set up the first score by running 14 yards after taking a
pitch from a wide receiver, Ernie Mills, on a highly unusual option
play. On the next snap, Chris Warren, giving Smith a breather, used
a block from left guard Nate Newton to run three yards into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals tried a trick of their own on the ensuing
possession, but their end-around backfired. Dallas had the play
diagnosed and tackled Frank Sanders for a 13-yard loss. Sanders
fumbled, and Hurvin McCormack recovered on the Arizona 32.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey rarely uses a tight end for receiving,
but David LaFleur made a key play _ 18 yards to the one-yard line _
when he outfought safety Tommy Bennett for a pass from Troy Aikman.
A touchdown followed on a pass to fullback Daryl Johnston as the
Cowboys took a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Aikman again called on the tight
end. This time it was Eric Bjornson, who with no one within 10
yards of him, caught what turned into a 43-yarder to set up a
one-yard TD run by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cardinals defensive end Andre Wadsworth: ``They caught us
off-balance with passes to all those players. The option play was a
little bit of trickery, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders gave the Cowboys another scoring opportunity in
the second quarter when he intercepted his fifth pass of the
season. Though hobbled by a sprained big toe on his left foot,
Sanders returned the ball 22 yards to the Arizona two, and Smith
plunged the ball over the goal line on his third try.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was 28-0, and the game appeared to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had every right in the world to quit,'' said Cowboys
defensive end Greg Ellis. ``But we couldn't keep Plummer contained.
One time I hit him, and he got up and said, `I don't know how I got
that pass off.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals never thought of quitting against a Dallas team
that was physically damaged and emotionally flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit there and get lulled to sleep and let a team come
back,'' said Cowboys receiver Billy Davis. ``But we had injuries
and situations we hadn't been in before. We can learn from this
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders limping off the field, Plummer (31-of-56 for 465
yards) knew he could exploit a defense that was also missing nickel
back Kevin Mathis, who suffered a broken forearm last week against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left the game, they went to that corner,'' Sanders
said. ``They had the freedom to do some things. Let's be honest _
the first half wasn't like the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' other starting cornerback, Kevin Smith, was
impaired by a slight separation of the left shoulder, suffered in
the second quarter. He had to abandon his bump-and-run style of
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Deion hurt and Mathis down, it was a scramble for us,''
Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``We had to use some
inexperienced guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was sidelined for the entire third quarter and most of
the fourth. Using a no-huddle offense, Jake the Snake struck again
and again, working over such nonentities as Charlie Williams, Kenny
Wheaton and Singor Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Down by a touchdown with 36 seconds left in the game, Plummer
threw 57 yards to Moore, who caught the ball after Wheaton slipped.
Wheaton recovered to trip up Moore on the five-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play, Plummer tried to throw a fade over Kevin
Smith's head and into Moore's hands. But the ball bounced off
Smith's back, and Moore couldn't pull it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I jumped up and tried to go over his back to get the
ball, I got both hands on it,'' Moore said. ``I don't know what
happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals cried pass interference, but there was no call as
the ball landed in the painted grass of the end zone, game over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great football game,'' Gailey said, ``for those who
like scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who miss the NBA.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The silver plaques hang on the wall, too heavy _ at least for the
time being _ for their owners to hold.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kacy Clemens knows exactly which one belongs to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' says Kacy, 4-year-old son of Toronto Blue Jays
righthander Roger Clemens, as he points to one of four Cy Young
Awards that occupy a space in the family's Houston home.
</P>
<P>
   How many 4-year-olds own a Cy Young, let alone know what the
award, given annually to each major league's top pitcher,
represents?
</P>
<P>
   ``He won those because he strikes out a lot of guys,'' Kacy said
of his father.
</P>
<P>
   With four Cy Youngs and four sons _ Koby, 11, Kory, 10, Kacy, 4,
and Kody, 2 (that's K as in strikeout) _ the math couldn't be more
perfect for Clemens, who has spent the past 15 years building a
baseball legacy to pass on to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Clemens household is expecting a new arrival. Only
this one's for Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is the odds-on favorite to become the first pitcher in
major-league history to be named a five-time Cy Young winner when
results of ballots cast by the Baseball Writers' Association of
America are released today. Clemens heads a list of American League
candidates that includes Boston's Pedro Martinez and the Yankees
duo of David Cone and David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   With an unprecedented fifth Cy Young, Clemens would move out of
a tie with Greg Maddux and Steve Carlton as the only pitchers to
win the award four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maddux and Carlton are great names,'' said Clemens, who won
the AL's Cy Young in 1986, 1987 and 1991 while with the Red Sox and
in 1997 with the Blue Jays. ``I think I enjoy it most when people
call me a power pitcher, because I was first a pitcher, and I
developed the power later.''
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Clemens showed no signs this past season of losing any of
the velocity that earned him the nickname ``Rocket.'' For the
second year in a row, the Spring Woods product claimed an AL
pitching triple crown by combining the most wins (20, tying with
Cone) and strikeouts (271) with the lowest ERA (2.65). Clemens is
just the fourth pitcher in baseball history to have pulled off the
feat in consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has 233 wins and 3,153 strikeouts for his career,
reflected Sunday on the path his big-league career has taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the triple crown again was mind-boggling,'' said
Clemens, who in 1998 became just the 11th pitcher to reach 3,000
strikeouts. ``I never thought about it 15 years ago when I first
started. As I'm getting older, I'm getting a little better. Last
season, I was clocked seven or eight times at over 100 mph. I'm
usually at 95, and that's because of my conditioning and leg
strength. I've always had a good work regimen, and that's what has
kept me healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who joined Toronto in 1997 after 13 seasons in Boston,
is a devoted family man. His own father died when he was 9, and
because of his hectic schedule during the season, Clemens finds
time with his boys to be precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That void was there when my father passed away, so I really
didn't have that father figure,'' Clemens said. ``I tell these guys
that are hanging around the clubhouse that do have fathers that
they are fortunate they've had their fathers this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens said that ideally he would like to end his career
playing for either of the two major-league teams in Texas _ the
Astros or the Rangers. But his first commitment is to fulfill the
remaining two years of a four-year contract with Toronto and
hopefully return to the postseason. Clemens has an escape clause
that allows him to force a trade if he believes the Blue Jays are
not making an effort to upgrade their chances at a pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clemens raised a number of questions and complaints
on his personal Web site (www.rocketroger.com), ranging from the
state of Toronto's ownership to his displeasure with the way the
Blue Jays are handling contract talks with his buddy, free agent
Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both (Texas and the Astros) are in contention and are
playoff-caliber teams,'' Clemens said. ``That makes it even more
enticing. Right now, I want to win as a Toronto Blue Jay. That's
why I signed a four-year deal with them. They have given me an
opportunity and paid me very well to come up there and perform for
them. But I just don't want to go out there and perform. This isn't
like a Broadway show, even though I try to make it exciting for the
fans. I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Before acquiring Randy Johnson in late July from the Seattle
Mariners, the Astros inquired about Clemens but backed off because
of Toronto's steep asking price. Talks concerning Clemens and
prospective teams are expected to heat up at next month's winter
meetings in Nashville, Tenn. The Blue Jays have reportedly asked at
times for two position players and a quality pitcher in return for
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep an open mind,'' Toronto general manager
Gord Ash said. ``If we were actively trying to deal Roger Clemens,
we could have done the deal already. We haven't been overwhelmed
yet, but a couple of clubs have stepped up to the interesting
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clemens is spending his offseason working in
the community. He held his annual celebrity softball game to
benefit local charities Sunday at Rice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush participated in the event, which
also featured Canseco, Ken Caminiti, Shane Reynolds and Mike
Hampton, and had nothing but praise for Clemens' work _ on and off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when people help the community,'' Bush said. ``He's
a big-name guy that has everything going for him and is one of the
most well-respected athletes. That's what I call one of my thousand
points of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he were playing for the Astros. We would love to have
him in Texas. Wherever he is, he's a credit to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is able to fulfill his dream and play in front of the
hometown crowd in Houston is buried in the back of his mind _ but
not forgotten. Clemens knows it would be a grand finish to a Hall
of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he decides, his family will play a big part in the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two oldest boys always ask, `When are you coming home?'''
Clemens said. ``The next week it's, `Dad, are you going to chase
300 wins?' We're going to have to wait and see.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The next time The Star-Spangled Banner is played in
Atlanta, the last four words will no longer be ``home of the
Braves.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Falcons officially shoved the Braves into the background
Sunday and became the toast of Atlanta by beating San Francisco
31-19 before 69,828, the first sellout in the Georgia Dome since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (8-2) broke a first-place tie with the 49ers (7-3)
in the NFC West and ended a five-game losing streak in a series
that had been dominated by San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking up at them for a long time, and the view
from here sure looks good,'' said Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle,
a 12-year veteran who set an NFL record Sunday by scoring his fifth
career touchdown on a fumble recovery. ``It took a lot of blood,
sweat and tears to get where we are. We'd been manhandled by the
49ers, and to beat them in a game of this magnitude shows we're for
real.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Atlanta will argue that point, not after the Falcons
built a 24-6 lead in the fourth quarter and survived a furious
rally by the 49ers when quarterback Chris Chandler completed a
78-yard touchdown pass to Terance Mathis with 2:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two seasons, coach Dan Reeves has restored pride in
a franchise whose one and only division title was in 1980. The
Falcons know that if they want to win a second NFC West
championship, they had to beat San Francisco. Over their last 18
games, the Falcons are 14-4 compared to the 49ers' 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49ers have dominated us, and they've pretty much had their
way in this division,'' Reeves said. ``We've arrived for one day,
but tomorrow, we have to come back down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard to get to this point, and we want to
advance beyond this point by doing the same things that got us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they collapse, the Falcons have a chance to earn
home-field advantage. Of their last six opponents, the only team
with a winning record is Miami, which visits the Georgia Dome in
the regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in a position where we're in control, but
it won't mean anything if we don't finish it,'' Reeves said.
``Every team on our schedule's capable of beating us.''
</P>
<P>
   And now is appears that Atlanta is capable of beating any team.
The Falcons withstood quarterback Steve Young's 342 yards passing
and Jerry Rice's 169 yards receiving on 10 catches. They now have
won six of seven games, and in each of those victories, they have
scored at least 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta defensed us very well, almost to the point of
frustration,'' Young said. ``Every game's like a car wreck, and I'm
surprised at our inability to do things. We put ourselves in a jam.
Now some pressing and urgency are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who entered the weekend leading the NFL in average
time of possession, controlled the ball for 34 minutes, 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who was 12-of-21 for 198 yards, one touchdown and no
interceptions, is playing better than any time during his 11-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson carried 31 times for 100 yards and
scored two touchdowns on runs of 10 and two yards. He has rushed
for 1,066 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. It is the third
consecutive season Anderson has passed the 1,000-yard mark. He also
tied William Andrews' club record of seven 100-yard games in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 49ers are the barometer in the NFC West,'' Anderson said.
``If you want to win the division, you have to go through San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons went through San Francisco on Sunday, but it took a
while. Atlanta led 7-3 at halftime and 10-6 after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of feeling each other out and playing a game of
field position,'' Anderson said. ``Then, we just kind of
exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan
intercepted Young and returned it 34 yards to the San Francisco
one. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Anderson scored on a
two-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a confidence boost, and that play (his interception)
gave it to us,'' Buchanan said. ``After that, it was like, `Hey, we
can play with those guys. Let's smack them in the mouth. Let's take
their respect.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' next series, Young was sacked by tackle Shane
Dronett, who forced a fumble that Tuggle recovered at the one and
rolled into the end zone for the touchdown. Morten Andersen's extra
point gave Atlanta a 24-6 lead with 14 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals was to not let them score quick at the start
of the second half,'' Buchanan said. ``We didn't. But we let them
score quick at the start of the fourth quarter, and it almost cost
us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Young on consecutive series threw touchdown passes of 54
yards to Terrell Owens and 65 yards to Rice, who had dropped an
easy pass in the end zone in the second quarter. Wade Ritchey's
extra point left the 49ers behind 24-19 with 3:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they scored those two quick touchdowns, our backs were
against the wall,'' Reeves said. ``I felt like we had to score a
touchdown on our next series.''
</P>
<P>
   On second down from Atlanta's 22, Mathis was supposed to run a
short sideline route, but the 49ers were in bump-and-run coverage.
Rookie cornerback R.W. McQuarters was pressing Mathis at the line
of scrimmage. Mathis adjusted his route, and Chandler saw the
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the guy came up to bump Terance, I just decided to take a
shot,'' Chandler said. ``It was a high-percentage pass. Terance ran
a great route and made a great catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who throws one of the best deep balls in the league,
made a perfect pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``When their corner got in my face, I converted my assignment to
a fade route,'' Mathis said. ``I got a good release, took off and
Chris' pass was perfect. I pride myself in making big plays, and I
was fortunate to have that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers got the ball back one more time but ran out of downs
at their 48.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BCS! BCS! BCS! Rah! Rah! Rah!
</P>
<P>
   I love it, the BCS. College football has never been more
exciting because of the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   It's hip, it's hot, it's happening. As I sit here typing, I
realize I'm not going to sleep a wink Sunday night, so extreme is
my anticipation to see how the computers will digest Saturday's
spate of gridiron craziness and spit out the Chosen Two.
</P>
<P>
   The polls are blah, predictable and boooring. But the Bowl
Championship Series rankings, with its witch's brew of human
prejudices and obscure statistical data, is pure pins-and-needles
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   How much, if any, will Tennessee be punished for winning a game
it fully deserved to lose?
</P>
<P>
   Will Kansas State, despite having ended 30 years of subjugation
at the hands of Nebraska's bullies, get kicked in its purple fanny
yet again for feasting on Indiana State, Northern Illinois and
Northeast Louisiana early in the year?
</P>
<P>
   Will the man-made brains overlook the fact that UCLA, for all of
its offensive might, is a hair short on defensive muscle?
</P>
<P>
   Does Florida stay as dead as dead can be for having lost to
Tennessee in overtime by the margin of a missed chip-shot field
goal in the third week of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the last, the answer is a resounding ``yes!'' unless
the three unbeatens all tumble. The BCS is completely intolerant of
defeats and does not want to hear excuses.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the BCS is quite the farce regarding its intended
purpose. It has no more of a chance of delivering an undisputed
national champion than throwing darts at a dart board would. But
what it has done is take the ``who's No. 1?'' debate to an
infinitely more convoluted level.
</P>
<P>
   That's BCS, as in big mess. And if it doesn't lead to a real
playoff involving at least eight teams, nothing will. In the
interim, though, I suggest we enjoy ourselves. I certainly am.
</P>
<P>
   There's a pretty good chance the BCS mainframe will whir and
burp a couple of times, then duly inform us that Tennessee and UCLA
are now fast-tracking to the Fiesta Bowl for the national title.
Imagine. K-State ends a three-decade losing streak against the
'Huskers, and their reward could be the brink of oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   If the 'Kats do suddenly find themselves on the outside looking
in, they will be screaming their fool heads off about the gross
injustices of what was intended to be a better mousetrap. Alas,
should the Vols and the Bruins win out, a likely scenario, K-State
could have 10 cows plus a conniption fit and it still wouldn't be
going to Tempe _ never mind that Bill Snyder's lads may finish No.
1 in the coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   See, the computer won't know squat about how Arkansas
quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled away a sure victory for the
Razorbacks. All the computer will know is that the Vols defeated
the now-ninth-ranked team in the country to stay unbeaten, whereas
K-State was having to fight for its very life against the, ahem,
lowly 'Huskers, who tumbled to 17th after their 40-30 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has surrendered more than 23 points to all except two of
its nine victims, but said scalps, according to Jeff Sagarin's
computer, constitute the 10th-toughest gantlet in the country. The
murdered row of Wildcats foes, in contrast, is way, way down there
at 74th, another 50 spots below Tennessee's 24th, too.
</P>
<P>
   As for Florida State and Texas A&AMP;M, both presumably fatally
tarnished at 10-1 (the latter courtesy of the former), they are
virtually certain to stay also-rans in the BCS pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Aggies whip Texas and then knock off Kansas State in
the Big 12 Championship Game, they could be relegated to the Alamo
Bowl with 11 victories, since the Holiday Bowl would surely favor
Nebraska over them, even with the 'Huskers' three defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton Bowl, with the first choice among the bowls tied to
the Big 12, desperately desires a Texas-Arkansas matchup and, the
Texas Tech loss notwithstanding, is expected to force the issue
anyway with the Longhorns unless the Aggies utterly humiliate them.
</P>
<P>
   In which case Nebraska would get the invite. A&AMP;M was in Dallas
last year, and the Cotton pickers are high on fresh faces.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks, however, may have played themselves out of the
Cotton's now-humble reach by nearly blindsiding the Vols. And the
Hogs do figure to get another shot at Tennessee on the SEC's
championship weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl could be back in a deep funk as well, if UCLA
leapfrogs to second in the BCS. The unbeaten Bruins vs. either
Michigan or Ohio State is far more appealing than inserting
Arizona, another 10-1 afterthought, into the mix. No bowl has ever
been more of a stumbling block to proposed playoff plans than the
Rose. Perhaps losing UCLA would be painful enough to get
Granddaddy's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, what time is it, anyway? Those BCS rankings out yet? The
suspense is killing me.

FURIOUS FINISH  
 COMEBACK ENDS IN CONTROVERSY AND FRUSTRATION  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The clock didn't lie, but the Cardinals still
couldn't believe their biggest game in the franchise's Arizona
history ended in such a foul manner.
</P>
<P>
   Make that a non-foul manner.
</P>
<P>
   An official reached into his back pocket _ press box observers
said it was side judge Nate Jones _ to grab a flag and call pass
interference on Dallas Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith in the right
corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the official stopped himself and instead signaled that
quarterback Jake Plummer's pass to wide receiver Rob Moore was
incomplete, preserving the Cowboys' 35-28 victory over the
Cardinals Sunday before 71,670 fans at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team I wish there was something I could tell them
that would make them feel better,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin
said. ``They should have had a chance to go into overtime. We were
denied that chance, and that's extremely disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had driven from their 22-yard line to the Dallas 5
in the final 52 seconds. Then, Plummer tried to loft the ball on a
fade route to Moore, who had Smith draped over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referees deserve to be under investigation for that (non)
call,'' Cardinals linebacker Jamir Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals also know they lost the game much earlier.
They fell behind, 28-0, in the second quarter and never got closer
than seven points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't spot a team like that 28 points,'' Cardinals wide
receiver Eric Metcalf said. ``They're too good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense wasn't good _ Plummer's 465 passing yards
was the second-most allowed by them in 29 seasons _ but they
managed to hold on and beat the Cardinals for the 16th time in 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   A two-game sweep over the Cardinals this season all but clinches
the NFC East title for the Cowboys (7-3). They have a two-game lead
over the Cardinals (5-5) and hold the first tiebreaker against
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are tied with New Orleans for the third and final
wild-card spot in the NFC playoffs. But if the season were to end
today, they would win the tiebreaker over the Saints because of a
better NFC record.
</P>
<P>
   They were lucky to be in Sunday's game considering the way they
played defensively the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys moved the ball at will. Running back Emmitt Smith
had 71 of his 118 yards at halftime and quarterback Troy Aikman had
13 consecutive completions in one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' offense did it without wasting any energy; none of its
first four scoring drives took longer than five plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they got, we gave them,'' Miller said. '`When we
decided they weren't getting anything else, they didn't get any.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also took advantage of two costly Cardinals'
turnovers, scoring after wide receiver Frank Sanders lost a fumble
at the Arizona 32 on a reverse and when Plummer was intercepted by
All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders, who returned the ball 22 yards to
the Cardinals 2.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said Deion Sanders baited him into throwing his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so far off,'' Plummer said of Sanders. ``I tried to
look up the field. As I threw it . . . he was Deion, a quick burst
to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Once it reached 28-0, the Cardinals finally got moving. Using
the no-huddle offense for one of the few times this season, they
scored on a 2-yard scoring pass from Plummer to Sanders in the
closing seconds of the first half and then cut the margin to 28-14
on a 15-play, 60-yard drive to open the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt by doing the no huddle, we were putting pressure on
their defense to get their calls made,'' Tobin said. ``It looked
like they were lagging coming out of the huddle, and we felt that
was the best way to score quickly. We needed points.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 35-14 late in the third quarter, Plummer marched the
Cardinals 73 yards in seven plays, capping the drive with a 4-yard
scoring pass to Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake played an absolutely phenomenal game,'' said Tobin of
Plummer, who threw for 305 yards in the second half, more than his
total in any game this season.
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals' drive ended at Dallas 16 midway through the fourth
quarter, but they got the ball back with 4:39 left and went 70
yards in eight plays. A 7-yard pass from Plummer to running back
Adrian Murrell cut the lead to 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you come to the bench (after scoring) and feel
invincible,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``We felt that way in the
second half. That no-huddle stuff is for real.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense forced Dallas to punt in the final minute
and took over on their 22.
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-yard completion to Metcalf, Plummer found Moore wide
open over the middle. Moore, taking advantage of the absence of
Deion Sanders (bruised toe), went 57 yards before being caught from
behind by Kevin Smith at the Dallas 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might score,'' Moore said. ``I saw Eric (Metcalf)
making a block and thought that was it. Then, at the last second, I
saw the guy flash and make a play on my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, out of timeouts, scrambled to spike the ball with
11 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer threw too low for Sanders on second down, leaving three
seconds on the clock and time for a final pass to Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Rob the fade signal, but I left it short,'' Plummer
said. ``It's obviously a route I need to work on in practice. If I
threw the ball a foot higher, with Rob's height and leaping
ability, even with the pass interference, there's no question it
would have been a touchdown.''

LOS ANGELES WOMAN CALLS FOR HELP FROM CAR TRUNK AT NEVADA CASINO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER and DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A woman who told police she was kidnapped as she
left her church Saturday night was found alive in Nevada after she
used her cellular phone to call for help from the trunk of her car.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dekkers, 44, was found Sunday still locked in the trunk of
her BMW convertible in the parking garage of Whiskey Pete's Hotel
Casino in Primm, Nev., said Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Paul
Sciarrillo.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old stockbroker from suburban Encino showed no
visible injuries, but was treated for shock and dehydration at a
hospital and released. She was expected to return home late Sunday,
Sciarrillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had tracked her through the day as Dekkers called 911
from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to trace her through her cell phone,'' said
Officer Eddy Zelaya.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no suspects or known motive for the kidnapping,
Sciarrillo said. The investigation is continuing, with assistance
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker's call for help sparked a furious search lasting much of
Sunday, with several police agencies from the two states trying to
locate the missing woman's BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction apparently happened around 10 p.m. Saturday as
Dekkers was leaving Bel Air Presbyterian Church, officials said.
The pastor, Jim Lee, said Dekkers is a volunteer who works with
children at the church, which overlooks the San Fernando Valley
from Mulholland Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Lee wasn't sure why she was there so late in the evening.
``There was a couples class last night, but they were saying she
wasn't there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In her cell phone calls, Dekkers said she had been abducted by a
gunman wearing a ski mask, police said. Officers at the church
Sunday morning said a janitor saw her leave the building and head
downhill toward a parking lot but had not witnessed a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about 7:25 a.m. Sunday, Dekkers called her husband,
Hendricus, from her cell phone. He alerted the police.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, she called 911. Those calls were picked up
by the California Highway Patrol's Barstow office, indicating that
she was somewhere in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, who learned of the abduction as police cordoned off
their Encino street, described Dekkers as friendly woman and mother
of one who used to arrange Christmas caroling parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very amiable, she'll always say hello,'' said Lou
Marino, who lives nearby.

JAPAN RAISES TO $195 BILLION THE VALUE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS
PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs top three grafs and headline for corrections)  (sw) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government has racheted up to a monumental
$195 billion the size of a new economic stimulus package that it
announced on Monday morning, making this the largest package Japan
has drawn up in eight years of economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the government was suggesting that it would
spend $148 billion. So, in barely four days, the government has
increased the amount of the plan by about $47 billion _ more than
the entire amount of the bailout fund for Brazil that was arranged
last week by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the plan's size, while boosting the impact that
it will have on the world's second-largest economy, underscores the
anxieties in Tokyo and around the world about Japan's recession and
the risk that it will drag down the rest of the world's economic
growth as well. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said on Monday only
that the package would be ``substantially bigger'' than 20 trillion
yen, or $164 billion, but details released by government officials
showed it at about $195 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step to put the Japanese economy on a
recovery orbit within a couple of years,'' said Obuchi, announcing
the measures on Monday morning. ``I will make every effort to
achieve these targets.''
</P>
<P>
   A catch-all of tax cuts, spending and lending measures, Monday's
stimulus package is in many ways a last-ditch attempt by Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to demonstrate his resolve to pull Japan out
of its worst recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Japan's government adopted a stimulus and
spending plan worth $137 billion, and the money from that package
is slowly beginning to roll into the economy. Still, the government
has suffered repeated criticism that it is not doing enough to
boost consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Japan has been shackled by a fiscal
austerity law that called for stiff reduction in government
deficits over the next few years and essentially a balanced budget
by fiscal year 2005. This package, however, includes a freeze on
that law, a move that will allow Obuchi to make good on a promise
he made soon after he took office this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confusion surrounding the actual spending amounts of
the package, some critics fear that the package may be less than
what is being presented.
</P>
<P>
   At about five percent of total economic output, the new package
is the largest Japan has ever recorded, and in some ways, the most
ambitious. Government estimates suggest that the package could
boost real gross domestic product by 2.3 percentage points over the
next year, which would pull Japan out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, however, exactly how much of the money the
government pours in will lead directly to economic growth. The
package contains special financing measures that are not direct
government investment in bricks and mortar, but instead are meant
to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government has earmarked about $66 billion for
developing infrastructure in areas such as information technology,
telecommunications and the environment, and it aims to create one
million jobs through training assistance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one of the major appeals of American officials, it is
trying to lift spending by individual consumers and corporate
spenders over the next year and a half through long-term tax cuts
that will slash individual and corporate income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure that will cost the government a total of $50
billion in tax revenue, Obuchi plans to lower the maximum
individual income tax rate to 50 percent, from 65 percent, where it
is now. The government will also lower the corporate tax rate to
about 40 percent, from 46 percent at the moment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The package also includes measures that arose from political
bargaining. Since the Liberal Democratic Party is short of a
majority in the Upper House of Parliament, it has had to curry
favor with other opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in response to a demand from the New Komei Party, the
latest plan will distribute about $5.7 billion in shopping coupons,
each worth nearly $165, to the elderly and to families with young
children, to encourage people to spend. Many economists are
skeptical about whether this measure will lead to a surge in
consumption, for while consumers may spend the shopping vouchers,
they may then save that much more from their salaries, leaving the
money in the banks.
</P>
<P>
   While banks usually would take their customer deposits and lend
it out to corporate and individual customers, the biggest challenge
the government is facing now is that the nation's banks _ wracked
by bad loans and weak capital bases _ simply are not lending their
money.
</P>
<P>
   So another pillar of this package is the government's desperate
attempt to assume a greater role as the nation's banker. Indeed, it
is revising the law to allow the Japan Development Bank to lend
directly to corporations that need money to redeem bonds or pay off
their debt, or that of their affiliates. It will also expand the
scope of guarantees the government issues to enable medium-size
companies to get loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a complement to this package, the Bank of Japan, the nation's
central bank, on Friday adopted three measures to help bring money
to cash-strapped corporations. Under the measures, the Bank of
Japan will ease the rules under which it buys commercial paper
issued by companies and conducts open-market operations. The
central bank will also set up an emergency loan program in which
banks can borrow a certain amount of money from the central bank if
they increase their lending to corporations from September levels.

   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Greg Norman came back to golf like _
well, like a shark coming back to water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a good, solid return,'' Norman understated late Sunday at
Sherwood Country Club after winning his own tournament for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for Norman _ out of golf for seven months after
shoulder surgery _ or for teammate and fellow Australian Steve
Elkington in the 10th annual Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   First, they needed to withstand a tournament-record-tying round
of 17-under-par 55 by Peter Jacobsen and John Cook. Then, they had
to outlast the red-hot Jacobsen/Cook entry in a playoff lasting
three holes.
</P>
<P>
   But Team Australia prevailed thanks to some big bites by the
Shark in the stretch run. Norman birdied No. 18 to tie his team for
the lead in regulation play at 27-under-par 189. And he followed
with three successive birdies in overtime _ the last good for the
win and $320,000 first-place money in the $1.3 million event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I was Greg's partner,'' said Elkington, who also
contributed several significant shots.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elkington who kept the team alive on the holes just
before the stretch. Putting last in the scramble format that
allowed each team two chances at every shot, Elkington salvaged
birdies on holes No. 13, 14 and 15 _ a run that started with
Jacobsen and Cook already in the clubhouse with a four-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   After a par on No. 17, Norman/Elkington had to birdie the
446-yard 18th to get into a playoff, and they were down to their
last chance after Norman's approach shot landed in a greenside
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But Elkington stuck a 158-yard shot within 10 feet of the cup
and Norman drained the birdie to force OT. And, on the third
playoff hole, after Cook and Jacobsen both went long on approach
shots, Elkington hit a 9-iron from 146 yards to within two feet of
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Elkington credited Norman for hitting mid-green with his
approach, enabling him to shoot at the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg hit a great shot to allow me to go after it,'' Elkington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman was happy with his partner's play all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great team player because you've always got a great
backup player,'' Norman said of Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   Their combined efforts overshadowed a remarakable performance by
Jacobsen and Cook, who equaled the 1993 tournament single-round
record set by Norman and Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   Team Cook/Jacobsen finished with nine birdies and four eagles,
missing an outright record when they three-putted No. 2 after
reaching that par-5, 531-yard hole in two shots.
</P>
<P>
   The discouraging greenwork on that hole led to three straight
opening pars by Jacobsen and Cook, who started the final round four
strokes off the lead and had no inkling of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we thought we were going to finish dead last,''
Jacobsen said. ``We were thinking it was going to be a long day.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it wound up being a long time before they dipped as low
as par again. They did no worse than birdie on their next eight
holes and found themselves 12 under par for the day after their
first 11 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter drove the ball great,'' said Cook, who said Jacobsen's
shotmaking with all clubs freed him to fire at the pin and charge
putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a great format,'' Jacobsen said. ``The most
important thing is you've got to have fun and let it all hang out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have lit it up today (but for the opening three pars)
and we did _ but we thought we'd have to shoot 18 under to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They almost did, which might have been the only way they could
have held off the rejuvenated Norman, a crowd favorite who drew a
huge ovation after his winning putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg looks the same,'' Jacobsen said of the tournament host
and now 75-time worldwide winner, whose shoulder was popping out of
its socket on backswings just seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect place for me to come back _ in a team event
_ Norman said. ``It's been a great week, not an easy week, but I
pulled a lot of good out of it _ a lot of good old feeling.''
