<HEADLINE> Gingrich Weds in Simple Ceremony  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
one-time congressional aide Callista Bisek were married Friday
night in a private ceremony in a hotel courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 friends and relatives attended the ceremony under a
tent at the Morrison House hotel in this Washington suburb. A local
policeman kept reporters and a few bystanders behind a fence on the
sidewalk a few feet away as a darkening sky threatened rain.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in tails, walked smiling into the small courtyard to
the strains of Pachelbel's Canon played by a string quintet. Bisek
wore a white, strapless dress with short train. The four
bridesmaids, one of whom moments earlier had sung ''Ave Maria,''
wore black gowns and held small rose bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   The service was conducted by former House chaplain the Rev.
James Ford. Gingrich's half-brother, Randy McPherson, and a friend
of Bisek, Mary Jo Kamish, served as best man and maid of honor.
Gingrich's half-sister, Candace, also was in attendance, clad in a
hot-pink suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the vows, the wedding party and guests made their way back
into the hotel -- almost completely rented out for the occasion --
and dined on many courses of Georgia, Wisconsin and Chesapeake
fare, representing Gingrich and Bisek's home states, and where they
live now. A white chocolate cake with raspberries completed the
evening, along with Nicholas Feuillate champagne.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third marriage for Gingrich, 57, and the first for
his 34-year-old bride. Gingrich was divorced from his second wife,
Marianne, in December 1999 after 18 years of marriage. He divorced
his first wife, Jackie, his high school geometry teacher, after 19
years.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Woman: I Prayed, I Screamed  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- ''I am a survivor,'' Tillie Tooter
said Friday as she sat in a wheelchair, the left side of her
forehead covered by a purple bruise and her body itchy from
hundreds of insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   To get through a three-day ordeal in her wrecked car inches
above the muck of a swamp, she had a cough drop, a peppermint and
one piece of gum. She absorbed rainwater with golf socks and sucked
on them to prevent dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come from Brooklyn, New York, and if you don't learn to
survive there, you are not going to make it at any place,'' the
83-year-old woman said.
</P>
<P>
   As she waited for someone to rescue her from her car that was
pushed off a 40-foot bridge by a hit-and-run driver and into trees
above the swamp, Tooter's body trembled from dehydration, her mouth
coated by sweat, blood and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cursed and I pleaded and I begged ... God, for my mother,
for somebody to get me out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   She rummaged through her bloodied white purse, wrote a farewell
note to her family and thought about her life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had made peace with myself that I was dying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, 15-year-old Justin Vannelli, working for his dad's
highway cleanup company, reached down to pick up a bumper on the
side of the bridge. He noticed the trees below were mangled, like
something heavy had fallen on them.
</P>
<P>
   She screamed for him not to leave as he looked down and saw her
car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard him say the police are coming. ... I knew then that I
had a chance to live,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter called Vannelli her hero and kissed him twice during
their first formal meeting Thursday at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do I have to say to Justin? I love him forever. He saved
my life,'' Tooter said.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter's journey started early Aug. 12 as she drove to the
airport to pick up her granddaughter and the granddaughter's
boyfriend. She said she never saw the car that struck her from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Her Toyota Tercel climbed a three-foot concrete barrier, skidded
along the top and then fell straight down 40 feet, landing in some
mangrove and willow trees that cushioned the blow. She suffered no
broken bones or internal injuries, only cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the highway, at least two passing motorists called
authorities to report that a car went off the bridge. A Fort
Lauderdale Fire-Rescue Department crew searched the area, using
spotlights and flashlights, but did not see her car because they
were a little too far east.
</P>
<P>
   After Tooter's car settled in the trees, she unhooked her
seatbelt and fell into a foot-wide space between the door and seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in such an awkward position my back was breaking, my
bones were aching,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To attract attention, she honked the horn and flashed the lights
until her battery died. She looked for her cell phone, but it flew
out during the accident. She yelled. Then she became frustrated in
the 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   She passed time by singing songs from the 1940s and '50s -- ''The
good songs with the named bands'' -- and remained trapped in her car
until she was found Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, but investigators are looking at the
driver of a car found wrecked just east of the bridge. He claimed
to have been in a one-car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter places the blame on whoever the other driver is, but
she's happy to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a miracle that I am here, because I didn't expect to
be,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms Off Antigua  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Chris, the third named storm of the hurricane
season, was downgraded to a tropical depression Friday, and the
long-lived Alberto built itself up into a hurricane again deep in
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   With steady winds decreasing from 40 mph to 35 mph, Chris
continued its northwesterly course east of the Caribbean island of
Antigua. A reconnaissance plane that flew into the storm reported
that some slow strengthening was possible over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The track was expected to stay safely north of the Caribbean
islands, but people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were
advised to keep an eye on the developing storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty minimal threat to the islands,'' said Eric
Blake, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''It would need to reintensify and make a deviation, make a left
turn toward the islands to pose any threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The islands may get some showers and a temporary shift in the
trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., Chris was about 360 miles east of Antigua. The storm
was moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Monday before forecasters can tell whether Chris poses
any threat to the continental United States. The storm could slow
down, and pose a threat to the northwestern Bahamas early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alberto became the longest-lived August tropical
storm on record, strengthening into a hurricane again Friday with
85 mph winds as it spins in the open Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto, which formed Aug. 4 never posed a threat to land.
</P>
<P>
   Since record keeping began in 1900, Hurricane Felix was the
longest-lived August storm, surviving 14 days in 1995. The
longest-lived Atlantic storm on record is Hurricane Ginger, which
kept its name for 21 days in September 1971.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., Alberto's center was about 1,100 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores Islands. It was moving northwest at 6 mph.

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Mexico Election Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants opened fire, hurled
molotov cocktails and ignited cars Friday during a post-election
battle that left at least nine dead and dozens injured in this
ruling party stronghold on the outskirts of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The violence erupted between two groups allied with the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in Chimalhuacan, a
suburban town of trash dumps and flea markets and one of several
poor communities known as Mexico City's misery belt.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe Buendia, a PRI activist already reprimanded by the
party for having strippers at a campaign rally, is under
investigation for allegedly urging her supporters to attack
loyalists of Chimalhuacan's new mayor, said Santos Montes Leal,
assistant attorney general for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Buendia's son had lost the party's mayoral nomination to a
member of the Antorcha movement, a Marxist-leaning group also
aligned with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The violence broke out as a crowd of 3,000 gathered at the
town's main plaza to inaugurate PRI Mayor Jesus Tolentino.
</P>
<P>
   Armed men fired shots, rocks and sticks into the crowd of
Tolentino's supporters, who themselves had engaged in street
battles during rallies for the mayor immediately after the
election. Vehicles were torched.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine of the mayor's supporters were killed, and 42
other people were injured, the majority of them Antorcha members,
said Eliseo Lugo, spokesman for the state attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were searching hospitals and homes for more wounded,
some of whom were taken away from the scene by family members, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracks of blood streaked the sidewalk, littered with Antorcha's
trademark red flags. Trucks smoldered nearby hours after the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 245 members of a neighborhood organization
headed by Buendia, Lugo said. She couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's top brass distanced itself from the incident. Cesar
Camacho Quiroz of the executive committee said those responsible
were acting on their own volition.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the July 2 elections, in which the PRI lost the
presidency for the first time in 71 years, the party reprimanded
Buendia for having male strippers perform on Mother's Day to draw
local support for its presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 6, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Todd Ritchie's slider was back. So was the
Pittsburgh Pirates' luck.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie kept the Cincinnati Reds out of a big inning and Dante
Bichette let in Pittsburgh's go-ahead run with a fielding error in
the eighth, setting up the Pirates' 6-3 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds (59-61) have lost four in a row, scoring a total of
eight runs during a slump that's dropped them below .500 and
widened their gap with first-place St. Louis to 7&AMP;frac12; games in the NL
Central. The Cardinals beat Philadelphia 7-6 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guys are playing hard and doing the best they can. We just
need a little luck,'' Reds starter Scott Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for the Reds, who couldn't recover from Bichette's
error and couldn't do much against Ritchie (6-6). He went 7 1-3
innings and gave up three runs -- Ken Griffey Jr. had a sacrifice
fly, a solo homer and a run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie has pitched two solid games since returning from a
pulled muscle in his right side that limited him for a few starts
and finally disabled him for nearly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He probably was hurt a lot longer than we knew,'' manager Gene
Lamont said. ''He's pitched two good games since he came back.
Tonight he had a good slider. In his last five or six starts, he
was pretty much a fastball-changeup pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie admitted he was bothered by the injury for longer than
he let on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how far exactly that goes back,'' he said. ''I
was definitely hurting before I went on the disabled list. It
wasn't real painful, but it was affecting my slider and my velocity
was down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams pitched out of a two-on, two-out threat in the
ninth by retiring Dmitri Young on a forceout for his 17th save in
21 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's 35th homer tied it at 2 in the sixth, but Bichette's
seventh error helped the Pirates go ahead to stay in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall singled off Scott Sullivan (2-5) with one out and
Brian Giles followed with a single to right that Bichette charged
but missed, letting the ball roll to the wall. Kendall, who stopped
at second, continued home on the misplay.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette bent over, dropped his head and put his hands on his
knees for several seconds after throwing the ball in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got under my glove,'' Bichette said. ''That's all I can
say. It's a lonely feeling, but you've got to pick yourself up and
go back out there. Missing a ball like that is the worst fear of an
outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles scored from third on Aramis Ramirez's soft double to
right, which eluded a sliding Bichette and put the Pirates up 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got some good breaks,'' Lamont said. ''A lot of those have
been going against us. Tonight they went for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Brown and Kendall added RBI singles in the ninth off
Danny Graves. Kendall also had a solo homer as part of his
three-hit night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a tough time on this trip so far,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson gave up two runs in seven innings and set a club
record for wild pitches by throwing his 20th in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, last year's NL Rookie of the Year, surpassed the
club record that Jim Maloney set in 1963 and matched in 1965.
Maloney pitched 250 innings each of those seasons, while
reliever-turned-starter Williamson broke his mark in his 100th
inning this season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's sacrifice fly put the Reds ahead in the first, but the
Pirates strung together three consecutive hits to take their first
lead in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall hit his 11th homer with one out, and Giles singled and
came around on John Vander Wal's double to the wall in left-center
for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey tied it with a one-out homer in the bottom of the
inning, ending Ritchie's streak of nine consecutive batters
retired.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Only three umpires worked the game because Terry Craft was
sick. ... A cameraman tumbled into the stairwell at the end of the
Pirates' dugout when a railing gave way a half-hour before the
game. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and
released. ... Pirates 2B Warren Morris went 0-for-4, extending his
slump to 1-for-20. ... One of Williamson's pitches to Enrique
Wilson in the third inning bounced three feet in front of the
plate. ... Reds 2B Pokey Reese was scratched from the lineup
because of a tight left hamstring. ... Larkin had an infield
single, leaving him one hit shy of 2,000 career. He will be the
first major league shortstop to have 2,000 hits, 170 homers and 350
steals. ... The Reds lead the majors with 81 wild pitches, two shy
of the club record set in 1965. The major league record is 94 wild
pitches by the 1986 Texas Rangers.

<HEADLINE> Lewis To Appeal $250,000 Fine  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Shocked by the $250,000 fine the NFL
levied against him for obstructing justice in a murder case,
Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis said he plans to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Friday he plans to appeal the fine, but declined to
discuss it after the Ravens' 24-13 victory over the Carolina
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to talk about the game I'll talk about the game,''
Lewis said. ''My problem is my problem, if there even is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Pro linebacker was originally charged with murder in the
death of two men outside an Atlanta nightclub following a
post-Super Bowl party in January. He ended his trial early by
pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charge of obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue handed down his
punishment by levying what is believed to be the highest fine
against a player for an infraction not involving substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' agent, Roosevelt Barnes, refused comment Friday but told
CBSSportsline.com that the fine set an awkward precedent for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean $250,000? For what? It was a misdemeanor, that's all
Ray pleaded guilty to, remember? That's like pleading guilty to a
traffic ticket,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to fine Ray, then the league is going to have
to check the traffic records all over the league and fine everyone
who ever ran a red light. Now wouldn't that be an awkward thing to
have to do?''
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue said in his ruling that the fine was based on the
perception Lewis' case created because by not telling police the
full story, Lewis ''fueled a public perception that he had
something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In doing so,'' Tagliabue added, ''he put his own livelihood
and reputation needlessly at risk and he caused great harm to other
NFL players and to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also ruled that Lewis will be fined another $250,000
and be subject to suspension if he violates any of the terms of his
12-month probation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' case was just one in a string of embarrassing incidents
for the NFL over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Panthers receiver Rae Carruth, the first active NFL
player to be charged with murder, sits in a jail cell a mile away
from Ericsson Stadium awaiting his trial.
</P>
<P>
   And former Panthers running back Fred Lane was shot and killed
by his wife in July in what police called a domestic dispute. No
charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth, cut by the Panthers last November when police charged
him with masterminding the shooting death of his pregnant
girlfriend, could go to trial as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, in a rare interview earlier
this week, said he dreads the trial and the distraction it will
create.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned about that every day regardless of when the
trial is,'' he said. ''This is beyond when the trial is going to
be. It's just a horrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson said he didn't think the Panthers -- or the NFL --
should be held accountable for Carruth's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what we could have done,'' Richardson said. ''We
have won the player support program award for the NFL for two years
in a row. We have a full-time chaplain. I don't know how I could do
any more of it than I do.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Ordered To Pay $600,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court Friday ordered the
Environmental Protection Agency to pay $600,000 to a black female
employee who claimed race and sex discrimination by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Lynne Coleman-Adebayo, 47, was sent from the agency's
Office of International Activities and into a domestic position in
1997 after years of what she said was racial and sexual harassment.
Coleman-Adebayo, a senior official and African affairs specialist,
won the suit after a two- week trial and nearly three days of
deliberations in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was called 'uppity,' an 'honorary white man' and a host of
other derogatory names, as well as being denied promotions,'' she
said Friday at a news conference. ''There is a culture of
intimidation and intolerance at the EPA.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury denied her claim that she was discriminated against
because of a physical disability. She has multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The suit named EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner as the
defendant. The EPA released a statement that indicated that the
agency may appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed, but this is obviously a mixed decision,''
the statement read. ''The agency defended itself vigorously against
these charges. We will be reviewing further options available to us
along with the U.S. Attorney's Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman-Adebayo started work at EPA in 1990, focusing on
southern Africa. She directed EPA's programs leading up to the
World Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her suit stated that she was denied promotion on two different
occasions, while white men in similar positions were not. She also
cited racial slurs, and was removed from a position on a major
U.S.-South African commission.
</P>
<P>
   When she complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the jury ruled, she was retaliated against with reduced
assignments.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Rob Moore Injures Knee  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Arizona wide receiver Rob Moore was one of
seven Cardinals players who left Friday night's game against the
Minnesota Vikings with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Moore tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and
cornerback Coby Rhinehart tore two ligaments in his right leg. Both
are likely lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Johnny Rutledge sprained his knee in the first
quarter. Cornerback Tom Knight injured his left hand in the first
quarter. In the third quarter, cornerback J.J. McCleskey broke his
right ankle and linebacker Ronald McKinnon bruised his right thigh
and didn't return. In the fourth quarter, Arizona linebacker Ray
Thompson sprained his left knee and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   McCleskey is expected to miss the entire year, but the other
injuries weren't immediately thought to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Moore injured his knee on the Cardinals' first drive of the
game. He appeared to catch his knee in the Metrodome turf on the
opposite side of the field from the play, an incomplete pass from
Jake Plummer to Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew something was wrong right away,'' Moore said. ''I had a
feeling it was something serious. You hope the pain subsides, but
it never did. It got more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a two-time Pro-Bowler, said he's never suffered a similar
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out of my break and just 'pow,''' he said. ''I felt
something pop. I've never felt anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Vince Tobin blamed the Metrodome turf for the
injuries in the 35-17 Minnesota win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost some very good football players, it looks like for the
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had three catches for 62 yards and a touchdown in
Arizona's first two preseason games. He had no catches against the
Vikings before his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rhinehart lay on the turf for several minutes and was taken off
the field on a motorized cart after injuring his leg on the second
play of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rhinehart was injured when he tried to defend a long pass from
Daunte Culpepper to Randy Moss. Moss caught the pass for an
apparent touchdown, but the score was nullified by offsetting
penalties -- pass interference on Moss and defensive contact on
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Cubs 2  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Steve Finley, Greg Colbrunn and Tony Womack
homered in Arizona's six-run second inning and Curt Schilling threw
a six-hitter as the Diamondbacks won their fifth straight Friday
night, 11-2 over the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (10-7) improved to 4-1 since the trade that brought
him from Philadelphia. Three of the victories have been complete
games. Schilling, who has a major league-best seven complete games
this season, is 9-3 in his last 13 starts. He struck out 10 and
didn't walk anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 39th and 40th home runs
of the season. The first was a 417-foot blast to lead off the
fourth inning, and the second a 378-footer leading off the ninth.
It was his 43rd multiple homer game, 42nd with the Cubs to tie
Ernie Banks' club record. He has four multihomer games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Bautista had a three-run triple as Arizona got to
right-hander Ruben Quevedo (1-5) for nine runs in the first three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter usually doesn't start Colbrunn and
Bautista against right-handers, but Colbrunn was batting .452 in
his last 10 starts and Bautista hit .412 on the Diamondbacks'
just-completed six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's move paid off. Colbrunn was 3-for-3 with three RBIs,
Bautista 2-for-4 with three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo allowed seven hits, struck out three and walked three as
the Cubs lost for the sixth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams led off the second with the first of his three
walks, then Finley snapped an 0-for-13 streak with a towering home
run to right field on Quevedo's 3-2 pitch. It was Finley's 29th
homer, but only his second in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn followed with his ninth homer of the season to put the
Diamondbacks up 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista lined a one-out single off Quevedo's leg. Schilling
squared for a sacrifice bunt, then pulled back and singled to right
to put runners on first and second. Womack hit the next pitch into
Chicago's bullpen in right field, a three-run homer that made it
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led off the third with another walk, then Colbrunn
singled and Damian Miller walked to load the bases with one out.
Bautista cleared the bases with a triple to deep center to put
Arizona ahead 9-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Schilling has walked four batters in 41 innings since
coming to the Diamondbacks. ... Cubs manager Don Baylor decided to
put off Kerry Wood's return to the rotation for a couple of days.
Wood will start Tuesday's game in Houston. Wood has been sidelined
since July 30 with a left oblique strain. ... The Cubs have allowed
three home runs in an inning five times this season. ... Womack's
seven homers this season are a career high. ... Two of the hits
allowed by Schilling were by pitchers -- a single by Quevedo and
double by Kyle Farnsworth. ... Arizona's Luis Gonzalez extended his
hitting streak to 10 games.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Moves Against AIDS in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- A week before his trip to Africa,
President Clinton is signing a bill to set up a global trust fund
for AIDS victims that has been likened to a kind of Marshall Plan
against the infectious disease -- the leading cause of death on the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was signing the bill into law in Lake Placid, where he
was celebrating his 54th birthday Saturday with his family. The
measure creates a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund to provide grants for
AIDS prevention, care and education to countries hardest hit by the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   It also authorizes funding for the administration's fiscal 2001
initiatives to fight HIV and AIDS worldwide and strengthens the
U.S. response to the pandemic that killed 2.8 million people across
the globe last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes $300 million for the U.S. Agency for
International Development to pay for education, voluntary testing
and counseling, prevention of mother-to-child transmission and care
for those living with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   It also authorizes $50 million in new funding for the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization; $10 million for the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; and $60 million to fight
tuberculosis -- the single largest killer of adults worldwide and
the leading cause of death of those with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Following graf EMBARGOED until 10:06 a.m. EDT
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighting AIDS worldwide is not just the right thing to do,
it's the smart thing. In our tightly connected world, infectious
disease anywhere is a threat to public health everywhere,'' Clinton
said Saturday in his weekly radio address. ''AIDS threatens the
economies of the poorest countries, the stability of friendly
nations, the future of fragile democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   End embargoed material
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who travels to Nigeria and Tanzania next week, is
directing Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to begin negotiations
with the World Bank to set up the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed by Congress last month, authorizes U.S.
contributions of $150 million a year for two years. The money is
intended as a springboard to bring in up to $1 billion a year from
international donors. The House had pushed for a $500 million U.S.
contribution over five years, but the Senate scaled it back.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund ''represents an extraordinary effort to move with
urgency to address the horrific AIDS epidemic,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, House sponsor of the bill. ''It is our hope and
expectation that the annual contribution from the U.S. will
leverage enough contributions from other donors to increase several
fold the size of the trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, administered by the U.S. representative to the World
Bank board of trustees, will gather public and private funding to
combat the spread of HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa which has
10 percent of the world's population but 70 percent of the world's
AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   Following graf EMBARGOED until 10:06 a.m. EDT
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are calling it the Marshall Plan for AIDS,'' said Sandra
Thurman, director of the AIDS policy office at the White House,
referring to the massive plan for the economic recovery of Europe
after World War II. ''We're looking at a pandemic the likes of
which we have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   End embargoed material
</P>
<P>
   AIDS kills 6,000 people a day in Africa and has orphaned some 15
percent of children in the worst-affected cities. The United
Nations has predicted the disease will wipe out half the teen-age
population in some poor African countries. By some estimates, the
disease will lower life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 59
years in the early 1990s to 45 by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   American attention to the AIDS crisis has taken on a new
dimension in recent months since the administration declared it a
national security threat that could destabilize fragile democracies
and crush economic progress for whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   Five major pharmaceutical companies, responding to complaints
that new effective AIDS treatments are beyond the reach of millions
of Africans because of high costs, have agreed to make substantial
cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and other developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Convention Should Help Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore left the Democratic National
Convention for a weekend campaign trip down the Mississippi River
with the party's presidential nomination and a bump in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a week or more to know whether Gore gets a
meaningful convention bounce in the polls after his convention
here. But early surveys suggest the vice president will get enough
of a boost to keep the campaign competitive as it heads into the
final two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll released Friday had
Gore within 5 points of Republican George W. Bush, 45 percent to 40
percent. Bush had an 18-point lead in the tracking poll after the
GOP convention, and was 11 points up as recently as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It may take until midweek or later to get a realistic picture of
how much bounce Gore will get from his convention. Few voters would
have seen his convention speech by the time the tracking poll
wrapped up Thursday night. Also, some of the surge in poll numbers
after a political convention can evaporate as quickly as it
appears.
</P>
<P>
   Gore narrowed Bush's lead among men from 18 points to 10 points
in the tracking poll. The two candidates were even among women, a
group Gore needs to win. Gore was 4 points behind among
independents at week's end after trailing by double digits.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking poll of 1,000 likely voters was taken Wednesday and
Thursday nights and has a 3 percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC News overnight poll showed the race virtually even,
though such polls are sometimes more a measure of emotional
reaction to big events than a gauge of settled public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the crucial state-by-state race for electoral votes, Bush has
had a clear lead or an edge in many battleground states in the
Midwest, including some that should be pro-Democratic. If Gore's
national numbers rise appreciably in the coming weeks, that could
indicate some of these states will be very competitive.

<HEADLINE> US Coordinates Russia Aid With NATO  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon says it is prepared to send a
small team of technical experts to the scene of the sunken Russian
submarine if Russia decides it could use U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that Russia has not
asked for American help, but he has offered to send a team of
experts to provide engineering, medical and other advice. That team
was being assembled Friday for possible use, he said, although
there is no indication Russia will ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand ready to provide whatever assistance would be
required and called for,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed team would include three or four people, with
expertise in submarines, underwater rescue techniques, diving and
medical issues, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said.
They would have computer links to broader technical resources at
military installations in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he received a written reply Thursday evening to his
letter Tuesday to Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev in
which the secretary urged him to ''not hesitate to ask'' for
American assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Sergeyev thanked Cohen for his concern and
suggested U.S. officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
join ongoing consultations about potential avenues of assistance to
the rescue effort. One such consultation was held Friday and
another was scheduled for Saturday, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia asked for British and Norwegian help Wednesday; those two
nations are sending rescue teams to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering to send a small team of U.S. technical
experts, Cohen said the United States could help set up an
''international coordination cell'' at NATO headquarters and send
special diving suits.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not talked to Russian officials about whether
they believe some members of the submarine crew are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that they are agreeable and willing to have NATO
assistance, should it be necessary in their judgment, is some
indication that they still feel that there are sailors alive,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning that two American submarines were in the
Barents Sea when the submarine Kursk sank Aug. 12 and detected
sounds of two explosions, Cohen said no U.S. ships were involved in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. submarines got no closer than about 70 miles from the
scene of the accident, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. There were two U.S. subs within listening distance of
the Kursk not by design but because one had just arrived to relieve
the other, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, the newest of 11 Oscar II-class attack submarines in
the Russian fleet, has been of particular interest to the U.S.
Navy. Late last summer, the Kursk slipped into the Mediterranean
Sea and shadowed a U.S. carrier battle group -- the first time in at
least two years that a Russian sub had been in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to Congress last October, Vice Adm. Daniel J.
Murphy Jr., commander of the Sixth Fleet based in the
Mediterranean, described that mission as ''inconvenient'' for U.S.
forces. He said nine Navy P-3C Orion electronic surveillance
aircraft were diverted from missions over Kosovo to search for the
Russian submarine, which he described as having the ''very best
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar II-class submarines were designed to stalk U.S.
carrier battle groups and, in time of war, attack with nuclear
cruise missiles. The Kursk was commissioned in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> USDA To Crack Down on Tainted Meat  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is preparing
another in a series of food-safety protections, a ban on the sale
of meat from animals in which excessive drug residue has been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, packers can throw out the part of an animal
that is tested for drug residue -- typically the liver or kidney --
and sell the rest. The new policy, which could be made final as
early as next month, would require that the entire carcass be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The violation rates are very, very low,'' said Karen Hulebak,
chief scientist for the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service. ''We're talking about a small number of animals
in the scheme of all the animals slaughtered in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials said the policy would apply to all livestock but
it would primarily affect slaughtered dairy cows, the source of
about 40 percent of the nation's hamburger meat.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to bring USDA procedures into line with the Food
and Drug Administration's policy on chemical residues in food. FDA
sets the limits, or tolerances, for drug residues in food animals.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not believe that unsafe meat is reaching
consumers, Hulebak said this week.
</P>
<P>
   About 0.2 percent of the cattle tested in 1997 had drug residues
in excess of FDA limits, or about 12,400 of the 6.2 million cattle
slaughtered that year. Animals are tested for more than 50
different compounds, including a variety of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has proposed or is working on several
regulations intended to provide consumers with new protections.
Among other things, it is setting new testing requirements for
listeria, a pathogen in processed meats, and has proposed expanding
the nutrition labels on processed foods to include artery-clogging
trans fats.
</P>
<P>
   USDA also is expected soon to announce new testing requirements
in beef plants for the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hanson, a food safety specialist with Consumers Union, said
the new policy on drug residues would be a ''step forward in
increasing the safety of the food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocacy groups contend that livestock producers are
giving excessive amounts of hormones, antibiotics and other drugs
to their animals. There is concern among scientists, for example,
that harmful bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics when they
are exposed to the drugs in animals and become more of a threat to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   There also is evidence that certain human illnesses and allergic
reactions are due to drug residues in meat.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the new policy would have a significant
economic impact on meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins in the packing industry are so thin that
slaughterhouses process or resell every bit of the cattle they
kill, including the blood, bones and even the intestinal contents.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would be a pretty dramatic shift,'' Janet Riley, a
spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, said of the proposal.
Packers can't control the use of drugs in animals they buy, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA does not test every animal for drugs, but instead conducts
a monitoring program for a list of drugs that changes each year,
depending on what chemicals officials think they need to watch for.
</P>
<P>
   Tests also are at packing plants on animals that USDA
veterinarians suspect may have excessive amounts of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy cattle, because they are slaughtered at an older age than
cattle raised for beef and accumulate more drug residue in their
systems, are tested the most frequently.
</P>
<P>
   When drug residues in the liver or kidney exceed FDA tolerances,
tests are also done on the meat. However, FDA has not set
tolerances in meat for most drugs, so there is no established limit
for USDA officials to use in determining whether the meat is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the department's current policy, the meat can be cleared
for sale if the residue in the meat does not exceed the limits set
for the liver and kidney.

<HEADLINE> Man To Be Questioned About Bombings  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pakistani man is being detained in
California for alleged immigration violations, but Argentine
officials believe he may be linked two terrorist bombings against
Jewish targets in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service confirmed Friday the
arrest of Mohammad Abass Malik last Tuesday and said he was being
held at an INS detention facility at San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Argentina's intelligence service, Fernando de
Santibanes, said Malik is wanted for questioning in the 1992
bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires and the bombing of a
Jewish community center there two years later.
</P>
<P>
   He said Argentine authorities believe Malik ''is related'' to
the embassy bombing and ''may have a connection'' to the second
incident as well.
</P>
<P>
   The combined death toll of the two bombings was 115, making them
the most serious incidents of international terrorism in the
Western Hemisphere in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes disclosed the arrest to The Associated Press on
Tuesday but there was no official U.S. confirmation until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Argentine Supreme Court reportedly planned to
fly to California to question Malik, but this could not be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
the Jewish center Thursday during her five-country swing through
South America.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini and
Jewish leaders to pay homage to the 86 victims of the July 18,
1994, bombing. The 1992 embassy bombing killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes said the alleged linking of Malik to the bombings was
based on information obtained by Interpol, the international police
agency.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. officials have agreed not to release Malik pending
a determination of the facts. If circumstances warrant, he said,
Argentina will seek Malik's extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina initially blamed Iran for the 1994 bombing but later
withdrew the accusation. Iran has denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Santibanes said Argentina is committed to finding the
perpetrators of both bombings and is cooperating with the CIA,
Israel's intelligence service and similar agencies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that this new cooperation will bear fruit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is home to some 300,000 Jews, the second-largest such
community in the Americas.

Putin Defends Submarine Handling

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Responding to criticism over his handling of the Russian
nuclear submarine sinking, President Vladimir Putin said Friday that rescue
efforts swung into action almost immediately after the disaster occurred. ''It
became clear that the military had an extraordinary situation on their hands,''
Putin said of the sequence of events when the submarine failed to appear on Aug.
12. He stressed that all the necessary measures were taken immediately. Putin
has been sharply criticized by many Russians for failing to cancel the vacation.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Napster Inc., the high-tech bane of the music industry,
said Friday that a federal court judge erred last month by issuing a preliminary
injunction that would have virtually shut down the popular music-sharing
software company. In a brief filed with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
Napster reiterated its position that neither its users -- who trade music for
free -- nor the company that helps them do so are in violation of copyright law.
On July 26, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel granted the injunction at the
request of the Recording Industry Association of America, which sued Napster in
December for copyright infringement.

   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico (AP) -- Assailants opened fire, hurled molotov cocktails
and ignited cars Friday during a post-election battle that left at least nine
dead and dozens injured in this ruling party stronghold on the outskirts of
Mexico City. The violence erupted between two groups allied with the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in Chimalhuacan, a suburban town of
trash dumps and flea markets and one of several poor communities known as Mexico
City's misery belt. Guadalupe Buendia, a PRI activist already reprimanded by the
party for having strippers at a campaign rally, is under investigation for
allegedly urging her supporters to attack loyalists of Chimalhuacan's new mayor,

Workers Optimistic in Verizon Talks

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping back from their threat to break off contract

expressed optimism Friday that a revised company proposal could end a two-week
strike. The new bargaining came as Verizon reported its first major system
outage since the strike began. ''We're going in the right direction,'' said Jeff
Miller of the Communications Workers of America, the larger of two unions
negotiating to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6. He said the unions were
''beginning to see more substantive bargaining'' on key union concerns,
including mandatory overtime and the movement of work.

<HEADLINE> Albright Traverses Latin America  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright traversed Latin America this week, championing democracy
and seeking support for a U.S. drug-fighting effort in Colombia
that has prompted regional concern.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Albright wound down a five-day, five-nation visit to
the region. While she talked of trade and maturing democracies
throughout the whirlwind tour, at each stop she expounded on what
she sees as the immediate threat to democracy in the region: the
increasing troubles in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Her trip comes ahead of a scheduled one-day visit to Colombia by
President Clinton on Aug. 30. That is sure to be a defining moment
for the massive $1.3-billion aid package to strengthen Colombia's
fight against drugs, known as Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In a region where U.S. involvement, whether military or
political, is often viewed as meddling and intrusive, some in Latin
America express less than full-throated support for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with Albright in Brazil on Tuesday,
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said Brazil, the
region's economic giant, was worried about possible spillover
effects from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brazil has made it very clear that it does not want to get
unilaterally involved in Plan Colombia,'' said David Fleischer, a
political scientist at the University of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Brazilian officials later downplayed the apparent
disagreement, and in Santiago on Thursday, Albright said Brazil was
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   During stops in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador, Albright
made clear she was seeking political support -- not financial
backing or military assistance for the plan. And she received just
that from the countries farthest removed from Colombia's 36-year
civil war between the government and leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, the strongest U.S. ally in the region, agreed to
provide technical assistance. Neighboring Chile said it
''strongly'' supported the plan, and Foreign Minister Solded Alvear
said the plan represented an effort ''to restore peace and fight
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the Argentine capital, Albright said the increased
focus on Colombia was part of an effort to strengthen democracy in
four countries saddled with social and political problems -- the
others being Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them are complicated and all of them are very important
to the national interest of the United States as well as their
regions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the initiative, about 100 U.S. military personnel are
training Colombian army anti-narcotics troops. Armed with
U.S.-supplied weapons and helicopters, the Colombians are to seize
drug crops from leftist guerrillas and other armed groups, paving
the way for subsequent eradication by crop-dusters.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Albright shuttled between Latin American capitals,
some in the region say they are concerned that the counter-drug
offensive will mean increased problems for them.
</P>
<P>
   Along Colombia's southern border, Ecuador is already a popular
rest and resupply point for Colombian rebels. And as the conflict
heats up, there is sure to be an increase of displaced Colombians
wading across the river into Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say the plan includes
significant funding for Colombia's neighbors. At least $20 million
in aid has been earmarked for Ecuador, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Demand Expected For Rangeland Seed  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY TEAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Just as firefighting manpower and equipment
have been pushed to the limit fighting fires that have burned more
than a million acres in the West, the Bureau of Land Management
expects the same strain on resources once the flames are
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   A small cadre of men and women is preparing the bureau's
warehouse in Boise for an unprecedented demand for seeds that will
restore life to the blackened lands.
</P>
<P>
   Natural resource specialist Cindy Fritz predicts shortages of
people, tools and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have the same resource limitations this fall as we have
on the lines right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, the warehouse stockpiles millions of pounds of
seed from two dozen growers to support range rehabilitation
throughout the Western Great Basin. Last year, more than 7 million
pounds was used.
</P>
<P>
   Located near the National Interagency Fire Center, the
industrial-sized complex is filled with stacked pallets of seed
bags. The air is heavy with the aroma of 62 varieties including
sagebrush, bitterbrush, alfalfa and wheatgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Every district in the region already has claimed its regular
allotment, which totals just over 2 million pounds. Fritz is
seeking millions more in the aftermath of one of the worst fire
seasons in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 68,000 fires this year had burned 5.2 million
acres, mostly in the West where the bureau manages the most federal
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation specialists have two goals this fall --
stabilizing watersheds to control erosion and limiting the invasion
of noxious weeds like cheatgrass and medusahead wild rye that push
out native grasses and degrade the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau ecologist Julie Kaltenecker called weed control critical
to the health of the range. The invasive weeds may have fueled the
fires by overtaking normally open space between shrubs on the
range, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have more continuous fuels, and so we get these huge
catastrophic wildfires,'' Kaltenecker said.
</P>
<P>
   A rehabilitation plan that gives native grasses the maximum
chance for survival is the trick to controlling the weeds, Fritz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Eurasian imports are capable of standing up to weeds from
the start and are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Science, I think, would say pretty strongly that we have a
much greater chance of establishing some of the introduced species
that are aggressive as seedlings,'' said professor Ken Sanders at
the University of Idaho, a specialist in rangeland ecology.
''Natives don't have that. Cost aside, there's just not the source
of seed to cover the acreage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaltenecker said the bureau views using native species as smart
ecological policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, using native species to revegetate rangelands more
closely mimics the diversity and hopefully the function of the
community,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau biologist Signe Sather-Blair says it costs about $60 per
acre to rid burned areas of cheatgrass and rebuild stands of
sagebrush and natural grasses.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of rehabilitation causes disagreement. Native
species tend to be more expensive. Kaltenecker said though that the
gap is closing as more growers produce native seed and the
government buys it.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Family Feuds Over Children  </HEADLINE>
By MARTA W. ALDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Sammy March was about to start
kindergarten, his little sister Tzipi still in diapers, when their
mother vanished four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Janet March, a young artist born into wealth and privilege, is
presumed dead, though her body has never been found and no one has
been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappearance has now pitted her husband, Perry March,
against her parents, Lawrence and Carolyn Levine, in a complex and
unprecedented child custody case involving the Tennessee
Legislature, the U.S. State Department and the judicial systems of
Tennessee, Illinois and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Levines want custody of Sammy and Tzipi, now 9 and 6,
because they believe March killed their 33-year-old daughter and is
an unfit father.
</P>
<P>
   March, 39, says he's innocent, and that the Levines have used
their money and power to trample on his civil rights. The case is
expected to go to trial late this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is ... filled with emotions about the most
fundamental and personal of family ties,'' said Jeff Mobley, the
court-appointed conservator of Janet's estate.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a family tragically altered by events we still can't
explain.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Janet March seemed to have a comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
   She recently had moved into a $750,000 custom home that she
helped design. Her husband was an attorney in her father's
prominent law firm, and the family was influential in Nashville's
Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Then she vanished on Aug. 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Friends describe Janet as a responsible mother who would not
abandon her children. But March says he came home that day to find
his wife complaining she needed a vacation. He says she wrote a
12-day to-do list on the home computer then, while the children
were sleeping, left in her Volvo with three bags, a passport and
$5,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   March acknowledges his nine-year marriage was strained. Family
members say Janet was scheduled to meet with a divorce lawyer the
day after her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   When she didn't return in two weeks -- missing Sammy's sixth
birthday and his first day of school -- the family went to police.
But by then, the trail was cold. Police found her Volvo a week
later in the parking lot of a Nashville apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive search turned up no clues.
</P>
<P>
   March stopped cooperating with police when the investigation
began focusing on him. He says he didn't go to police earlier
because the Levines wanted to keep family problems private and
believed she would return.
</P>
<P>
   March says his cordial relationship with the Levines soon
unraveled. He was fired from the family firm, his pension fund was
frozen and his Tennessee law license was stripped.
</P>
<P>
   He moved his children to a Chicago suburb, then in 1999 to
Ajijic, Mexico, where his retired father lives. March opened a
legal consulting business, ended his children's visitation with the
Levines and says he recently married a local woman with three
children.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Lawrence Levine was laying the groundwork to gain
permanent custody.
</P>
<P>
   Levine worked with a state senator to amend Tennessee's parental
rights law so a court can remove custody from a parent convicted or
found civilly liable in the death of the child's other parent.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained a civil default judgment against March in January as
a Nashville judge declared Janet legally dead and ruled him
responsible. A jury later awarded the Levines $113.5 million -- the
largest judgment in Tennessee history.
</P>
<P>
   After seeking advice from U.S. State Department officials, the
Levines flew to Mexico and, on June 21, got a Mexican judge to
enforce a Chicago judge's visitation order. They took the children
from school while March was being interrogated by immigration
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Levines returned to a Nashville judge to get temporary
custody and requested permanent custody under the revised state law
they helped write.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Levines have orchestrated a perfect chess play here,''
said March's Chicago attorney, Vincent Stark. ''It shows that if
you've got the money and the power, you can get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   March, who faces arrest in Nashville for violating a court order
to return several of Janet's personal items to the Levines, is now
fighting for his children from Mexico. He believes the amended
Tennessee law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want my kids back,'' March said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been the subject of judicial rape in Nashville ... and
my children have been stolen from me. But there is a United States
Constitution and eventually someone will read it and enforce my
rights under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine attorney Harris Gilbert says the couple always has
followed the law and pursued the children's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wasn't an abduction or kidnapping,'' he said. ''They are
doing what's right for their family and doing it in a lawful
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the Levines have declined to comment publicly
about March or the custody battle. Their friends and family have
protected their privacy, and their attorneys have refused to
comment, citing a gag order.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilbert said the Levines ''are having a great time'' getting
reacquainted with their grandchildren -- ''the joy of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to lose a daughter, but to be deprived of the
right to see your grandchildren had been absolutely devastating to
them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hopes in Submarine Disaster Shift  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Hopes for saving any of the 118 sailors on a
sunken submarine shifted to British rescuers Saturday after
exhausted Russian teams failed to latch on the vessel's damaged
escape hatch or detect any signs of life on board.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian ship bringing a British rescue team and a
sophisticated mini-submarine was expected to reach the accident
site by Saturday afternoon, Britain's Ministry of Defense said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers hope the LR5 submarine, described as an ''underwater
helicopter'' because of its maneuverability, would be able to
connect with the hatches of the shattered Russian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers aboard another vessel were also approaching the
site but were not due there until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were to fly by helicopter to each ship
Saturday to discuss coordinating the rescue effort, said Col. John
Espen Lien of the Norwegian Northern Defense Command.
</P>
<P>
   Russian escape capsules reached the hatch several times early
Saturday and Friday, but could not dock with the Kursk, lying 350
feet below the surface, officials said. There were no signs of life
inside the submarine, which went down in the Barents Sea last
Saturday during a military exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Russia vowed to continue to try, but mounting evidence that the
submarine suffered massive damage darkened hopes that anyone could
still be alive inside the nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is extremely grave,'' said Adm. Vyacheslav
Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet. He said there had been no
contact of any kind with the submarine since Monday despite
repeated claims that knocking had been heard from inside the
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Popov said the ship was crippled by a huge internal explosion
when it went down. Officials said earlier the Kursk had been in a
collision, but Popov said the explosion could have been triggered
from inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be two causes of the explosion -- an external impact,
that is to say a collision, or internal,'' he said on the RTR
television channel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area last Saturday at the time the Kursk was lost. A Norwegian
seismic center said the second blast registered at magnitude 3.5,
equivalent to a mild earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not determined precisely how the
submarine got into trouble. There have been no reports of other
vessels in the area with which the Kursk might have collided. A
likely scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has given wildly contradictory estimates of how long
the Kursk's emergency oxygen supplies could last, ranging from a
few hours to two weeks. But officials admit they have no idea of
conditions inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are distressed that the military was slow to
accept help and are angry at President Vladimir Putin for keeping a
low profile and staying on vacation when the vessel went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow from Ukraine early Saturday, cutting
short his trip to a summit of former Soviet republics. He said he
did not fly to the rescue site because it would have been a
distraction to the recovery efforts.

<HEADLINE> Expos 6, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Mike Thurman pitched into the eighth inning for
only the second time this season, and the Montreal Expos stopped a
seven-game losing streak Friday night by beating the San Diego
Padres 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman (3-3) allowed five hits in seven-plus innings, walked
four and struck out one, getting help from four double plays. He
also contributed a pair of sacrifice bunts that helped lead to two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland got four outs for his third save in six
chances, sending San Diego to its fourth consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Clement (11-11) gave up five runs -- three earned -- and
seven hits in five innings, needing 32 pitches to get through the
first inning. He also threw two wild pitches and committed a
double-error that allowed a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero and Geoff Blum hit RBI singles in the first,
and Milton Bradley's RBI double made it 3-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored in the bottom half on a groundout by Wiki
Gonzalez, but the Expos increased their lead to 5-1 in the third
following following an error by third baseman Phil Nevin that
allowed Guerrero to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Blum walked, Clement threw a wild pitch and Brian Schneider hit
a high chopper a few feet in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Clement fielded the ball and tried to shovel it to Gonzalez at
the plate. Guerrero slid in ahead of the throw, which went all the
way to the backstop as Blum scored. When Clement failed to handle
Gonzalez' return throw, he was charged with another error.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which scored just four runs while losing three games
to Atlanta, got a pair of runs in the eighth on Mike Darr's RBI
grounder and Anthony Telford's wild pitch with a runner on third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Montreal C Lenny Webster was placed on the 15-day disabled
list, retroactive to Monday, with a sore right elbow. Webster was
replaced by Brian Schneider, who was recalled from Triple-A Ottawa.
... Clement's 18 wild pitches are a team record. He is second in
the majors to Cincinnati's Scott Sullivan (20). ... Peter Bergeron
is still nursing a bruised left thumb and was held out of the
lineup. ... The Padres (10-7 in August) need just five wins in
their last 12 games of the month for their first winning month
since June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Parents Charged With Baby Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The parents of a missing 8-month-old
baby who was found dead in a pond were charged with murder Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph and Kristi Melancon reported Emily Rose Melancon missing
last week and made impassioned pleas for her return.
</P>
<P>
   The break in the case came following a police interview with the
couple during which Kristi Melancon told police the baby died while
in her care, Hopkinsville Police Department spokesman Mike Wood
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Joseph Melancon led authorities to the location of the
baby's body. The body was found Friday morning in a pond on Fort
Campbell, where he is a soldier, said Capt. Carl Purvis, spokesman
for the military post.
</P>
<P>
   The body was taken to Fort Campbell's Blanchfield Army Community
Hospital for an autopsy. Accidental death has not been ruled out,
Wood said, but there was sufficient evidence to bring murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Melancon, 25, was charged with murder, tampering with
physical evidence and falsely reporting an incident. Joseph
Melancon, 24, was charged with murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering
with physical evidence and filing a false report.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach the jailed suspects or an attorney
representing them for comment were unsuccessful Friday night.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Livan Hernandez finally pitched his first
career shutout and Rich Aurilia hit a two-run homer as the San
Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves and Greg Maddux 2-0 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (12-8), making his 105th career start, had taken
shutout bids into the eighth inning five times previously this
season, going into the ninth scoreless three times.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up four hits, struck out a season-high 10 and walked
just two. Atlanta didn't get a runner past first.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (13-7) has lost four of his last five decisions, with the
Braves scoring just 10 runs in Maddux's last six starts. In three
of them, Atlanta was blanked.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux allowed both runs and five hits in seven innings,
striking out eight and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has won four straight games and is 31-13 in its
last 44.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow singled with two out in the fourth, and Aurilia
followed with a drive just inside the left-field foul pole for his
14th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who earlier this week agreed to a $90 million,
six-year contract extension, got an infield hit in the ninth for
his 1,000th career hit.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Atlanta was blanked for the sixth time this season. San
Francisco pitchers have thrown a league-leading nine shutouts. ...
The Giants (69-51) are a season-best 18 games above .500. ...
Maddux has a 2.72 ERA in his last six starts but is just 1-5 during
that stretch. ... Hernandez is 5-2 since the All-Star break.

   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton went 3-for-5 to improve to .399, but
Mark Kotsay's three hits and Ramon Castro's three-run homer carried
the Florida Marlins over the Colorado Rockies 9-8 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay, 3-for-5 with a solo homer and three runs scored, is
22-for-61 over 17 games. Derrek Lee had three hits and an RBI and
Henry Rodriguez added a two-run homer for the Marlins, who have won

</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (1-1) allowed eight runs and nine hits in three-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca got three outs for his 35th save in 39

</P>
<P>
   Ben Petrick and Juan Pierre each drove in a run with singles in
the bottom half as Colorado closed to 6-2. Smith got a run back in
the third for the Marlins by slapping a two-out single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Successive singles by Helton, Hammonds and Larry Walker to open
the Rockies third accounted for one run, and Todd Walker's

<HEADLINE> Mets 5, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo went 4-for-5 with a
tiebreaking RBI single, and Mike Piazza homered and drove in three
runs as the New York Mets beat the slumping Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' 20th victory in 25 games, coupled with Atlanta's loss
to San Francisco, reduced the Braves' lead over New York to 1 1-2
games in the NL East and maintained the Mets' 4 1-2 game advantage
over Arizona in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing, who entered the game in the sixth inning as part of
a double switch, greeted reliever Terry Adams (5-5) with a leadoff
single in the seventh. He scored from second when Alfonzo followed
a one-out walk to Derek Bell with a single to right, sending the
Dodgers to their ninth loss in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White (2-0) allowed one hit in 1 2-3 innings after
relieving starter Al Leiter, who was charged with three runs and
six hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched out of a jam in the eighth with the tying
run at third, and Armando Benitez got three outs for his 32nd save
in 36 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, winless in four road starts, took a two-hit shutout and
3-0 lead into the sixth before the Dodgers tied it with four
consecutive hits and a sacrifice fly to take Kevin Brown off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield led off with his 38th homer, two behind Sammy
Sosa for the major league lead. Eric Karros singled, Shawn Green
followed with a ground-rule double and Adrian Beltre fisted a 1-1
pitch to center to score Karros. Green scored the tying run on Todd
Hundley's fly to Jay Payton in shallow center.
</P>
<P>
   An intentional walk to Kevin Elster and a walk to pinch-hitter
Jim Leyritz loaded the bases before Leiter gave way to White. F.P.
Santangelo struck out, and first baseman Todd Zeile preserved the
tie with a diving grab of Mark Grudzielanek's grounder down the
line before throwing to White covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   After converting Elster's fielding error into an unearned run in
the second inning, the Mets extended their lead to 3-0 in the third
when Piazza followed a one-out single by Alfonzo with his 32nd
homer. It was Piazza's first in 19 at-bats this season against the
Dodgers, and first in 28 career at-bats against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza singled home Alfonzo in the ninth to give him 100 RBIs
for the fifth consecutive season. Alfonzo has three four-hit games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown who has made five starts since his previous victory on
July 24, was charged with three runs -- two earned -- and six hits in
six innings. He struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hundley was ejected by umpire Mike Everitt for arguing a
called third strike in the eighth inning. ... Brown has surrendered
18 home runs in 175 innings, one fewer than he did last year in 252
1-3 innings. ... Santangelo, replacing the ailing Devon White in
center field and the leadoff spot, struck out four times -- three
times looking. ... With only 55 stolen bases through their first
121 games, the Mets need 11 more as a team to tie Roger Cedeno's
total from last season, when he set a franchise record with 66. ...
Piazza, who entered the game with a major league-leading .410
batting average in road games, has 28 RBIs in his last 28 games
overall.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Won Few Converts  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- For its makers, Concorde proved to be the swiftest
turkey in the skies. Hoping to sell hundreds, the British and
French manufacturers persuaded airlines to take options on a total
of 74. Only 16 were built.
</P>
<P>
   Protests about noise, national rivalries and an oil crisis all
played a part in killing the market for supersonic airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a technical miracle, but an economic disaster,'' said
Ronald Davies, curator of the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum in
Washington, D.C., and author of the book ''Supersonic Nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was always bound to be uneconomical to fly,'' Davies said.
''It was costly, it wasn't big enough, and really the nail in the
coffin was when the world authorities decided it wouldn't be
allowed to fly over land because of the sonic boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Long an emblem of luxury and technological prowess, the
supersonic jet favored by the rich and famous may slip quietly into
history after the July 25 crash of an Air France Concorde outside
Paris. With official doubts mounting about the safety of Concorde's
tires, British Airways indefinitely grounded its fleet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft could cross the Atlantic at an
altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph, completing the trip from
London to New York in less than four hours -- half the time of
regular jets.
</P>
<P>
   Although there always seemed to be people willing to pay the
round-trip ticket price of $10,000, Concorde had its detractors
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The first ominous signs might have been oil price shocks and
uncertainty about whether the noisy plane would be allowed to land
in New York, said Brian Trubshaw, the test pilot who flew the first
British Concorde flight in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a supersonic passenger plane gained momentum in the
1950s, after Chuck Yeager's 1947 blast through the sound barrier.
Manufacturers in Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United
States scrambled to develop a design.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the British Aircraft Corp. and Sud Aviation of France
agreed to cooperate, along with engine builders from both
countries. In 1963, Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp. and Air
France all signed options on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mounting excitement, Beverly Shenstone, technical
director of what would later become British Airways, called
Concorde ''the largest, most expensive and most dubious project
ever undertaken in the development of civil aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, British Airways ended up with half the world's
Concorde fleet, and became its ardent defender.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Concorde's first prototype rolled out at Toulouse,
France. It lifted off 13 months later, three months after the
Soviet version of the supersonic plane made its first flight.
</P>
<P>
   Options for 74 Concordes were sold by 1967; eight each for
British Overseas Airways Corp., Air France and Pan Am; six each for
American Airlines, TWA, Eastern Airlines and United Air Lines; four
each for Air Canada and Qantas; three each for Japan Air Lines,
Lufthansa, Continental and Braniff; and two each for Air India,
Middle East Airlines and Sabena.
</P>
<P>
   But when final orders were placed in 1972, British Airways took
five planes and Air France took four. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air
France took the unsold planes in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But British Airways had no place to fly the Concorde except to
Bahrain when it began service in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Protests against the noisy engines and sonic booms led the U.S.
government to ban Concorde landings in 1975, and they were banned
in 1976 by the Port Authority of New York, which operates John F.
Kennedy airport. The market opened up after the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear the Port Authority's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the airlines tried various plans to make use
of its fleet, including a joint venture with Singapore Airlines and
a London-Washington-Dallas tie-up with Braniff that lasted only a
year. Air France had a Paris-Washington-Mexico City service from
1978 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, there was talk of converting a Concorde to fly for
Federal Express, Trubshaw says in ''Concorde: The Inside Story,'' a
book whose official publication date fell on the day after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France both stopped underwriting Concorde's costs in
1984, and the two airlines took responsibility. British Airways and
Air France both insist the aircraft was profitable, but refused to
give details.
</P>
<P>
   Davies called the claim ''absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Having been given the airplane, and operating it, they are
able to cover the cost of the crew and the fuel and possibly the
cost of the maintenance on an individual flight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the fuel bill must be pretty high -- for every seat that
that the Concorde carries across the Atlantic, it had to carry a
ton of fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   The planes actually required eight times as much jet fuel per
passenger as a 747, said Mike Stoddart of Charterhouse Securities,
a London-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each
100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per
passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747.

<HEADLINE> Gore Starts Four-Day Boat Trip  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- His floating armada drifting steadily
south, Vice President Al Gore is turning his attention to taxes and
the environment, but taking time for Mark Twain in a colorful
riverboat ride designed to seize the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore brigade mixed dockside rallies, somber policy forums
and more than a little soaking up the sun in a lazy float down the
Mississippi River on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential nominee was upbeat, plunging into
waiting crowds wherever they appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, he's excited,'' said eldest daughter Karenna Gore
Schiff. ''He's bouncing around. I don't know if it's because he
hasn't had any sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended the often glacial pace of his campaign, sputtering
for hours between events and seeing only scattered folks along the
river banks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to target a lot of important communities in key
states that often decide presidential elections,'' he said. ''The
states in this part of the Midwest are always crucial to the
outcome of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was hoping to come roaring out of his nominating convention
with a vengeance, grabbing campaign attention with his 400-mile,
photo-friendly cruise down the river.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the cruise focusing on health care, but was turning to
taxes and the environment, issues the Gore camp believes will
resonate in the industrial Midwest, a key electoral battleground.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got two and a half months to have a good discussion,''
said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The broad and muddy Mississippi was the ideal backdrop to talk
about the environment, where Gore argues that Republican rival
George W. Bush's record is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   His crowds were big and enthusiastic. About 5,000 cheering
backers opened his trip in La Cross, Wis., and 3,000 showed up in
Prairie du Chien, Wis., according to police estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Gore's boat trip takes him past Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, all states where Clinton
ran well in his two presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear mix of recreation and politicking as his big
riverboat drifted downstream at 8 mph, flanked by a group of
smaller boats dashing about carrying photographers and security
officials. Adding to the party atmosphere, the occasional boat
roared by with backers waving signs and shouting encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   When the boat moved closed to shore, passing motorists stopped
to sit and wave. When it moved through locks, crowds gathered and
Gore hopped off to shake hands, with some results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a registered Republican and I'm going to vote for him,''
said Carl Hanneman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never seen a candidate before,'' said Carrie Begalke,
who shook hands with Gore. ''I'm on the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hung out with their wives
in the top level, occasionally basking in the sun and posing for
pictures. Lieberman broke off at mid-day to observe the Sabbath
beginning at sunset Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hoopla, the campaign was taking pains to focus on
issues. At campaign rallies along the river, Gore hammered at a
long list of issues he highlighted in his acceptance speech
Thursday night, and there was plenty of time for policy as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening leg, the campaign brought along about 20 local
Wisconsin residents for a round-table discussion of health care
issues, while aides issued a detailed 11-page policy statement
listing what they see as differences between Gore and Bush on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''On their boat trip down the Mississippi River, Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman will highlight some real concrete differences on the
important issues facing working families,'' said the campaign's
position paper. ''These differences have a real impact for working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   At rallies from Dubuque south, Gore was pushing his plan to
offer tax breaks for day care, education expenses and other
expenses which impact middle-class voters most directly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was carefully staging all of his events for the
ever-present television cameras, featuring barber shop quartets,
patriotic bunting and actors dressed as Mark Twain doing
impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gilding held a mock news conference with Gore to spout
famous Twain sayings aboard the riverboat, named ''Mark Twain.''

<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Dirk Been, the Bible-toting
''Survivor'' contestant, says his fellow castaways were intimidated
by the strength his Christianity gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Been, who was voted off the island in the fifth week of the CBS
hit, was interviewed on Pat Robertson's ''700 Club'' talk show on
the Christian Broadcasting Network. The interview will be broadcast
Tuesday, the day before the ''Survivor'' finale reveals which of
the 16 contestants lasted the full 39 days and won $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Been told CBN interviewer Gordon P. Robertson, son of the
religious broadcaster, that he was not kicked off because of his
beliefs but from the strength he derived from them.
</P>
<P>
   The other contestants saw ''there's real power in this guy, we
don't know what it is, but if we want to win the game, we have to
get rid of him,'' Been said.
</P>
<P>
   Been held a Bible on his lap during the interview, but not the
one he was seen reading frequently on the island. He said he left
that one behind and other contestants told him it was read
extensively.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- When mixing fashion with politics, designer
Nicole Miller keeps her mind wide open.
</P>

   Miller's newest fashion statement -- ties and scarves emblazoned

</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and wife, Laura, wore them, as did President

slightly more popular with the GOP though, as the elephant design
was the hotter item at Miller's boutique in Los Angeles, which
played host to the Democratic National Convention.

<HEADLINE> 27 Bodies Exhumed in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Twenty-seven bodies have
been exhumed from a mass grave found earlier this week in the
Serb-controlled part of Bosnia, about half those thought to be in
the grave, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-foot-deep pit was located earlier this week by the Muslim
Commission for Missing Persons near the village of Kalimanici,
about 20 miles east of the Bosnian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will need at least four more days to complete the
exhumation,'' commission head Amor Masovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Masovic said a total of 50 bodies are to be exhumed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the remains are Bosnian Muslims from the
eastern town of Visegrad, brought to the area by bus and executed
by Serb soldiers at the beginning of the 1992-1995 war.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 people were killed during the war, and more than
20,000 are still missing.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged To Abide By Covenants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- After signing two international
agreements on political and civil rights, Turkey must now abide by
its obligations and take concrete steps to improve its human rights
record, Kurdish and human rights groups said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights this week. Ankara had rejected the agreements for
34 years, apparently worried about the implications for the
country's 12 million Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants include the right for minorities to speak in their
language -- a right still limited for Turkey's Kurds. Signatories
also vow to uphold the right of all people to self-determination,
freedom of expression and the freedom from discrimination on ethnic
or religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is long-delayed step toward democratization,'' said Ali
Riza Yurtsever, a senior official of the People's Democracy Party,
Turkey's only legal pro-Kurdish party. ''But we are not sure if
they will be applied or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Yurtsever and the Human Rights Association warned that
Turkey's parliament, which has to ratify the agreements, may oppose
sections of the covenants.
</P>
<P>
   Although a ban on the Kurdish language was lifted in 1991, it is
still illegal to speak Kurdish in official settings and scores of
activists have been jailed for using the language. Publications and
broadcasting in Kurdish are also banned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turkey needs to rewrite the constitution and the entire legal
system to bring them in line with the standards defined in
international agreements,'' Nazmi Gur of the Human Rights
Association told the English-language Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The signing is seen as another step by the Turkish government to
improve its highly criticized human rights record in its drive to
join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. covenants were first adopted in 1966 and have been
signed by more than 130 countries.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Hopes for saving any of the 118 sailors on a
sunken submarine shifted to British rescuers Saturday after
exhausted Russian teams failed to latch on the vessel's damaged
escape hatch or detect any signs of life on board.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian ship bringing a British rescue team and a
sophisticated mini-submarine was expected to reach the accident
site by Saturday evening, several hours later than initially
forecast, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers hope the LR5 submarine, described as an ''underwater
helicopter'' because of its maneuverability, would start operations
Saturday night and be able to connect with the hatches of the
shattered Russian vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian divers aboard another vessel were also approaching the
site but were not due there until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were consulting with British and Norwegian
naval authorities to coordinate the rescue attempt, the Russian
navy said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian escape capsules reached the hatch several times early
Saturday and Friday, but could not dock with the Kursk, lying 350
feet below the surface, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of life inside the submarine, which went
down in the Barents Sea during a military exercise Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Russia vowed to continue the rescue operation, but mounting
evidence that the submarine suffered massive damage darkened hopes
that anyone could still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was ''beyond critical,'' said Navy spokesman Capt.
Igor Dygalo. Asked what he meant, Dygalo said the rescue efforts
had failed so far, but the rescue effort would not be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet, said
there had been no contact of any kind with the submarine since
Monday despite repeated claims that knocking had been heard from
inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Popov said Friday that the ship was crippled by a huge internal
explosion when it went down. Officials said earlier the Kursk had
been in a collision, but Popov said the explosion could have been
triggered from inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be two causes of the explosion -- an external impact,
that is to say a collision, or internal,'' he said on the RTR
television channel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area Aug. 12 at the time the Kursk was lost. A Norwegian seismic
center said the second blast registered at magnitude 3.5,
equivalent to a mild earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not determined precisely how the
submarine got into trouble. There have been no reports of other
vessels in the area with which the Kursk might have collided. A
likely scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has given wildly contradictory estimates of how long
the Kursk's emergency oxygen supplies could last, ranging from a
few hours to two weeks. But officials admit they have no idea of
conditions inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are distressed that the military was slow to
accept help and are angry at President Vladimir Putin for keeping a
low profile and staying on vacation when the vessel went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow from Ukraine early Saturday, cutting
short his trip to a summit of former Soviet republics. He said he
did not fly to the rescue site because it would have been a
distraction to the recovery efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   YOKOTA AIR BASE, Japan (AP) -- Remains believed to be those of 14
American servicemen missing in action from the Korean War were
delivered Saturday to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were flown aboard a U.S. Air Force plane from the
North Korean capital of Pyongyang to Yokota Air Base near Tokyo for
a United Nations Command repatriation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Each set of remains was contained in an individual coffin
covered with a U.N. flag during the ceremony, attended by some 100
people, including about 20 Korean War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   They were scheduled to be taken to the Army Central
Identification Laboratory at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii later
Saturday for forensic examination and positive identification.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 sets of remains are the most recovered in a single
operation since excavations began in 1996, when communist North
Korea first agreed to allow U.S. searches on its territory.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 26 sets of remains have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,100 U.S. servicemen are still listed as missing from
the 1950-53 war. Remains of fewer than half that number are
believed to be recoverable.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka To Continue Censorship  </HEADLINE>
By NAMINI WIJEDASA
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka's government has rejected
demands from newspaper editors that media censorship be lifted for
upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government does not need to lift the censorship because it
only concerns sensitive military information,'' Deputy Media
Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yapa said the censorship does not bar media criticism of the
government's performance. But newspaper editors worry the
restrictions will be arbitrarily applied.
</P>
<P>
   ''One cannot have this sort of media restriction during an
election campaign. It is very bad and we cannot ignore it,'' said
Victor Ivan, convener of the Free Media Movement and editor of the
Sinhala language Ravaya (Echo) newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we avoid referring in newspapers to the defeats in the
north and east during an election campaign when it is a major part
of the government's performance during the past six years?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sri Lankan government forces have been fighting Tamil Tiger
rebels who want an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the
country's north and east, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese
majority. The 17-year war has left more than 62,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Media censorship was imposed in May after the military lost
several big battles to the rebels. The restrictions drew criticism
from the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and from
Sri Lanka's opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight, take legal action if necessary, until the
censorship is withdrawn,'' said W. J. M. Lokubandara, leader of the
main opposition United National Party in Parliament. ''The
existence of these regulations will definitely and seriously mar an
independent election.''
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga dissolved Parliament on Friday,
days before its six-year term was to end. Elections are to be held
Oct. 10.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Beaten for Halting Soccer  </HEADLINE>
By BEHROZ KHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Hundreds of angry tribesmen armed with
stones attacked more than 100 hard-line Muslims who had halted a
soccer match on religious grounds, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said several people were injured in the brawl Friday,
which began after the hard-line Muslims called the players' dress a
violation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The group of more than 100 Taliban, or students of Islam, forced
their way into a sports stadium in the tribal town of Landikotal on
the border with Afghanistan, demanding that the match be stopped,
said Sahibzada Anees, a senior government official. Hundreds of
tribesmen responded by beating them, some with assault rifles,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a fierce hand-to-hand fight and members of the two
sides kicked and punched each other,'' Anees said from Landikotal.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani Taliban want to impose a harsh brand of Islam
similar to that espoused by Afghanistan's Taliban ruling militia.
The Afghan Taliban, who rule more than 90 percent of Afghanistan,
bar women from work and education, require them to wear veils and
forbid them from traveling without a male family member. The Afghan
Taliban have also outlawed all light entertainment, including
television and music.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban say shorts and short-sleeved shirts violate Islam's
dress code, which forbids even men from exposing any part of their
bodies. Ultra-orthodox Islamic clerics say athletes also must
properly cover their bodies and must not shave or trim their
beards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani Taliban, encouraged by the success of the Afghan
Taliban, have also launched a campaign against television and
women's education, a move bitterly resisted by the tribal people.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani Taliban involved in Friday's clash are members of
a religious school adjacent to the stadium. They also were
complaining that spectators' loud cheers and shouts disturbed their
prayers and religious studies, Anees said. Earlier Friday, the same
group of the Taliban set fire to a house where a private musical
performance was held 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taliban have no right to interfere in other peoples' lives
in the name of religion,'' said Ibrahim Shinwari, one of the
organizers of the soccer match.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Seeks Japan Apology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea said Saturday that Japan
must apologize and compensate for its colonial rule of Korea before
re-establishing ties with the isolated communist state.
</P>
<P>
   The issue should be considered as a key agenda item when
officials from North Korea and Japan meet in Tokyo from Monday to
Friday to discuss setting up diplomatic ties, said Rodong Sinmun,
the official daily of the North's ruling Workers Party of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's redress is ''a master key'' to opening diplomatic
relations between the two countries, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese authorities should make a proper decision at an
early date, deeply mindful of the consequences to be entailed by
their dishonest attitude toward the issue of settlement of its
past,'' Rodong said in an article carried by the North's official
foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   In April, North Korea and Japan sat down for the first time in
more than seven years to discuss normalizing ties, but Pyongyang
suspended talks a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles to normalization include Pyongyang's refusal to
discuss accusations that its agents abducted at least 10 Japanese
in the late 1970s to train spies. North Korea has denied the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has demanded Japan compensate and apologize for its
colonial rule in the 35 years before its World War II defeat in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of isolation, North Korea has made unprecedented
diplomatic overtures toward the outside world, including
participating in a summit meeting with South Korea in June, the
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its Asian allies remain concerned about
the North's missile and nuclear programs.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Opposition Meet Broken Up  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Police used tear gas to break up a
demonstration organized by a Kenyan opposition leader Saturday
after ruling party activists turned the rally into a stone-throwing
riot that left seven people seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the fighting involved more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was called by James Orengo, a member of
parliament from the opposition FORD-Kenya party, to jump-start the
constitutional review process. He also planned to discuss a drought
that has created water and electricity shortages throughout the
country, as well as government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But before the rally could begin, activists from the youth wings
of the ruling KANU party and the allied National Development Party
began destroying the platform and the tent where Orengo was
schedule to speak Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The KANU and National Development Party youth groups had
promised to stage a parallel rally at Kamukunji square and break up
Orengo's rally if FORD-Kenya members insulted President Daniel arap
Moi or National Development Party leader Raila Odinga.
</P>
<P>
   FORD-Kenya activists began throwing stones at the KANU/NDP
activists Saturday morning when they began tearing down the stage
set up for the rally. Police used tear gas to stop the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Police supervisor Nanwel Mwacheche declared the rally a security
threat and ordered the FORD-Kenya youth to disperse. When they
refused, police fired tear gas again, prompting activists from both
sides to resume fighting. Police said seven people were seriously
injured in the running battle.
</P>
<P>
   Similar fighting has broken out almost every time the opposition
tries to stage a rally in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Kenyans will one day be liberated from this
diabolical regime,'' said Mwangi Wa Kibe, a FORD-Kenya activist as
he watched the second round of fighting. ''This act of stopping
this meeting is cowardice and barbaric. ... We are not free, we
don't have security in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another of group of 25 ruling party activists were
outside the National Assembly building, brandishing stones and
blocking Orengo and other opposition leaders from attending the
rally. While security guards kept the youth from entering the
parliament grounds, they did nothing to disperse the crowd outside
the gate and allowed them to search vehicles as they came out.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from political opponents, Moi agreed in December
1997 to a review of Kenya's 1963 constitution, which has entrenched
the ruling Kenya National African Union party and contains many
provisions used by Kenya's British colonial government to stifle
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   But the review process stalled in February 1999 after political
parties and interest groups disagreed over who would be represented
on a 25-member commission that was supposed to oversee the review.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by design or oversight, the law that established the
commission failed to stipulate how political parties and other
interested groups were to share the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between KANU and other groups widened when the
KANU-controlled National Assembly, or parliament, created a
27-member committee Dec. 15 to spearhead the review. The following
day, religious and community leaders set up their own committee to
do the same.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--NYPD Commissioner, 1st Ld-Writethru, 580  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - City Corrections Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a
former police detective and a trusted staff member of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, was named Saturday as the new police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made the announcement at City Hall.
Kerik, 44, who once worked as a uniformed cop, becomes the city's
40th police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bernie has (one) thing so important as police commisioner -
having served as a police officer, understanding the difficulties
and split second decisions an officer has to make,'' Giuliani said.
''He brings a quality of leadrhsip.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik earned praise for his successful three-year tenure at the
Corrections Department, where he has earned the respect of the
12,400 employees. He oversees approximately 130,000 inmate
admissions yearly in the city's 16 jails, 15 court holding pens and
four hospital wards.
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Department Joseph Dunne, also a contender for the
commissioner's job, was named First Deputy Commissioner, the second
in command in the department. Dunne is currently the department's
third in command.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik's only roadblock in getting the top job was that he does
not have a college degree, a prerequisite to being police
commissioner. He needed a waiver from City Hall to bypass this
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout with an equivalency diploma, Kerik has
been taking courses through Empire State College and needs 24 more
credits for his bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik was named by Giuliani as Corrections Commissioner in
January 1998. Prior to being commissioner, he was the Corrections
First Deputy Commissioner, appointed that position in January 1995.
He joined the department in 1994, and also has served as the
executive assistant to the commissioner and as director of the
Investigations Division.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a New Jersey native, joined Corrections after serving
eight years as an NYPD cop, spending much of his career as a
narcotics detective in Manhattan. He received 30 police citations,
including the Medal of Valor.
</P>
<P>
   He earned that award after surving a 1991 shootout in Washington
Heights, an incident that Giuliani recounted in his news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik worked on the New York Drug Enforcement Administration
task force, helping direct an investigation that resulted in the
convictions of more than 60 members of the infamous Cali drug
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the NYPD, Kerik served as a military police
officer in the U.S. Army and as warden of the Passaic County Jail.
A martial arts expert, Kerik spent four years in various security
assignment in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In December, 1997, he was appointed by Giuliani as a member of
the newly-formed New York City Gambling Control Commission. The
five-member Commission is charged with establishing and enforcing
regulations for shipboard gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik replaces outgoing commissioner Howard Safir, who attended
the Saturday morning news conference announcing his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, a longtime friend of Giuliani's, announced on Aug. 8 that
he would step down to take a job with an Atlanta-based firm,
ChoicePoint, a credential, verification and identification service
provider. Safir was appointed commissioner in 1996; his last day on
the job was Friday.

<HEADLINE> After Attack, More Kosovo Patrols  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRKVENA VODICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers increased
patrols in a Kosovo village Saturday, a day after nine Serb
children were injured in a grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came just hours after an explosion in the province's
capital wounded one woman and damaged several political offices.
</P>
<P>
   Flight Lt. Tim Serrell-Cooke, a spokesman for British
peacekeepers, said the grenades were hurled by three occupants of a
vehicle who ignored warning shots fired in the air by a U.N.
policeman as they sped away.
</P>
<P>
   The grenades were tossed into a basketball court in the village
of Crkvena Vodica, about 7 miles northwest of Pristina, the
provincial capital. Nine children were treated for minor injuries
and released from a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Two men were questioned and released, told to report back
Saturday for further interrogation, Serrell-Cooke said. Angry and
tense villagers stoned a car carrying ethnic Albanians early
Saturday, but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombings forced an end to the government crackdown on
Kosovo Albanians last year, but violence continues to mar chances
of ethnic reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 200,000 Serbs who lived in Kosovo have fled, after a
rash of revenge attacks by the majority ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of the injured children expressed anger Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some of us are guilty, let them hit on us, not on our
kids,'' said one woman, whose 8-year-old girl was among the
injured. Like others, she would not give her name for fear of
further attack.
</P>
<P>
   One man blamed ''Albanian terrorists'' for the incident. He said
the children hurt were aged 5 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Another blast, attributed to political tensions ahead of local
elections in October, damaged a building housing the offices of the
Democratic League of Kosovo in the central town of Malisevo.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the explosion late Friday. U.N. spokeswoman
Claire Trevena said a dark colored van was seen leaving the blast
site after the explosion, but U.N. police had no suspects in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The party is led by pacifist Ibrahim Rugova, the symbol of
Kosovo Albanian resistance to Serb dominance in the decade before
tensions exploded into violence in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina on Friday, an explosion went off behind a building
run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
damaging offices of Serb, ethnic Albanian and other political
parties housed there.
</P>
<P>
   One woman suffered cuts and bruises and several other people
were in shock, Serrell-Cooke said. NATO officials said the
explosion appeared to have been caused by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE is in charge of democracy-building in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, a southern Yugoslav province, has been run by the United
Nations since the end of the 78-day NATO bombing campaign.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and what she doesn't want to talk about  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - While Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton will talk at length about health care, education and job
creation, there is one subject - her marriage - that she studiously
avoids.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject keeps coming up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just two days before she arrived in Los Angeles with
the president for the Democratic National Convention, he talked
with a group of ministers about his affair with Monica Lewinsky,
saying it was a ''terrible mistake'' and that he had been working
hard on rebuilding his life.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, aboard his presidential
campaign plane, told reporters that Clinton's personal behavior in
the White House had ''embarrassed the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the first lady sat down for an interview with The
Associated Press at her Los Angeles hotel. The smiles and
chattiness evident throughout most of the interview disappeared
when the subject of her husband and Bush's comments was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has expressed his own feelings about that ...
All the rest of us are focused on the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about what Bush had said and whether such comments were
too personal, she said, ''I'm going to keep talking about the
issues in this campaign because there are such big differences that
affect the lives of American families.''
</P>
<P>
   And how is her family doing? ''We're doing fine,'' she said
simply.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state of her marriage is a campaign issue,
according to polls that have consistently shown her trailing her
Republican opposition - first Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and now Rep.
Rick Lazio - among white women, a crucial voting bloc. Interviews
with those women show that some resent what they see as her riding
her husband's coattails. Others believe she should not have stuck
with the president in light of his infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Monday, just before her speech to the convention,
about her husband's remarks to the ministers, the first lady told
ABC's Peter Jennings that ''he's the best spokesman for what he
feels and what he wants to tell the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a wife's answer,'' Jennings suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I think my business and my family is really to be kept
private,'' she said. ''I don't think it is anyone else's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's Dan Rather had little luck when he tried to get the first
lady to open up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very grateful for our family and for the effort and work
that goes into any family and I've nothing to add to what he said
the other day when he spoke,'' she said. ''I think that this
convention, his remarks tonight, this election is about the future
and that's what we're going to keep talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's Larry King got a similar response when he asked how she
was doing emotionally in the wake of her husband's affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that's my business, and I don't talk about my
personal business and I feel strongly that what goes on in a
marriage or a family should remain in that marriage and in that
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady did attempt to answer some questions about her
marriage and her husband's infidelity in an interview with Talk
magazine that appeared a year ago. In it she said her husband's
cheating amounted to a ''sin of weakness'' and that she had stayed
with him out of love. But the interview seemed to make things
worse. Some of her statements seemed to imply she was blaming her
husband's infidelity on psychological abuse he had suffered as a
child when his mother and grandmother battled over who should care
for him.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the magazine hit the streets, the first lady told
reporters during a visit to a furniture factory in Jamestown that
she didn't mean to excuse her husband's infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is responsible for their behavior and I am a very
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was done talking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   I've said all I'm going to say on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe strongly that the country has put that issue
behind it. I have as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she has talked about her marriage since then. In
January, she told a Buffalo television interviewer that she planned
to spend the rest of her life with her husband. The very next
morning, she told a Buffalo radio talk show host she had never been
unfaithful in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were spending this weekend near Lake Placid in the
Adirondacks, celebrating the president's 54th birthday.

<HEADLINE> Public forum latest for New Jersey court systems  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Those who tried to block open hearings for
judges feared this would happen: a sitting Superior Court judge
exposing her private life in a newly public forum.
</P>
<P>
   Many claimed disclosing such intimate details would taint the
reputation of all judges, not just the jurist accused of violating
the ethics code.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was their only argument,'' said Raymond Trombadore, a
lawyer who fought to make the once-secret disciplinary hearings
open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Most opponents were judges, who rarely speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Four days of testimony chronicled the affair between Judge
Rosemarie Williams, 47, and sheriff's officer Alfred ''Wes''
Bridges, 28. From its beginnings as an office romance to its end in
a series of angry confrontations, witnesses relayed accounts that
seemed more fitting to divorce court.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Supreme Court chambers, reporters took notes. Lawyers
observed. State court employees gawked. One woman opened the heavy
glass doors and said, ''I just wanted to see what it was like in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a few private citizens found time to watch this first for
New Jersey. Since court rules were rewritten in 1997, no Superior
Court judge had an open hearing after being charged with a public
or private violation of the code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Now Williams waits for word from the Advisory Committee on
Judicial Conduct while those who argued for open hearings praised
this session. And the state court system prepares its annual
judicial training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Trombadore said this public hearing was exactly what the public
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people will distrust any hearing simply because it's
secret. It's highly suspicious,'' Trombadore said.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier hearings, people were shut out. That could foster
perceptions that judges were treated favorably by their colleagues,
Trombadore said.
</P>
<P>
   Now people can read accounts of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm really interested, I can attend and listen to it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When cases involve a judge's private life, people should be
trusted to distinguish between details that pertain to judicial
performance and those that don't, Trombadore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges are human beings. They're subject to all the foibles of
human beings,'' Trombadore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the judicial system at last, public expectations are being
fulfilled. They have a right to be involved in the process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is accused of shouting profanities at Bridges and his
female companion Tami DeVitas during two public confrontations on
April 14. State officials also allege Williams posed as a police
officer after authorities were called following the dispute. The
committee, which recommends actions to the Supreme Court, gave no
date for when it will announce a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The judge repeatedly denied the charges during the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   All state judges are required to attend the yearly Judicial
College, according to Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the state
court system.
</P>
<P>
   And all newly appointed judges must attend training sessions
before they hear cases, Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs feature seminars on professionalism and ethics
''as part of every new judges training and it is recommended for
sitting judges,'' Comfort said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is discussion about everything. That's on the bench and
off the bench,'' Comfort said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: We'll Assist Russia With Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon says it is prepared to send a
small team of technical experts to the scene of the sunken Russian
submarine if Russia decides it could use U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that Russia has not
asked for American help, but he has offered to send a team of
experts to provide engineering, medical and other advice. That team
was being assembled Friday for possible use, he said, although
there is no indication Russia will ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand ready to provide whatever assistance would be
required and called for,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Russian and U.S. navies held a telephone
conference call early Saturday in which the United States renewed
its offer, said Capt. John Carman, spokesman for NATO's Atlantic
command post in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian delegation reviewed some technical information
provided by the U.S. Navy but did not request U.S. assistance,
Carman said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed team would include three or four people, with
expertise in submarines, underwater rescue techniques, diving and
medical issues, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said.
They would have computer links to broader technical resources at
military installations in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he received a written reply Thursday evening to his
letter Tuesday to Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev in
which the secretary urged him to ''not hesitate to ask'' for
American assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Sergeyev thanked Cohen for his concern and
suggested U.S. officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
join ongoing consultations about potential avenues of assistance to
the rescue effort. One such consultation was held Friday and
another was scheduled for Saturday, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia asked for British and Norwegian help Wednesday; those two
nations are sending rescue teams to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering to send a small team of U.S. technical
experts, Cohen said the United States could help set up an
''international coordination cell'' at NATO headquarters and send
special diving suits.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not talked to Russian officials about whether
they believe some members of the submarine crew are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that they are agreeable and willing to have NATO
assistance, should it be necessary in their judgment, is some
indication that they still feel that there are sailors alive,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning that two American submarines were in the
Barents Sea when the submarine Kursk sank Aug. 12 and detected
sounds of two explosions, Cohen said no U.S. ships were involved in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. submarines got no closer than about 70 miles from the
scene of the accident, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. There were two U.S. subs within listening distance of
the Kursk not by design but because one had just arrived to relieve
the other, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, the newest of 11 Oscar II-class attack submarines in
the Russian fleet, has been of particular interest to the U.S.
Navy. Late last summer, the Kursk slipped into the Mediterranean
Sea and shadowed a U.S. carrier battle group -- the first time in at
least two years that a Russian sub had been in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to Congress last October, Vice Adm. Daniel J.
Murphy Jr., commander of the Sixth Fleet based in the
Mediterranean, described that mission as ''inconvenient'' for U.S.
forces. He said nine Navy P-3C Orion electronic surveillance
aircraft were diverted from missions over Kosovo to search for the
Russian submarine, which he described as having the ''very best
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar II-class submarines were designed to stalk U.S.
carrier battle groups and, in time of war, attack with nuclear
cruise missiles. The Kursk was commissioned in December 1994.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Peace in Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- It was a sweltering day, even for Jerusalem,
when 16 Israeli and Palestinian city planners and geographers met
over coffee and cake in a well-to-do Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Mideast summit at Camp David had just collapsed, but the
atmosphere in the air-conditioned conference room of the Ambassador
Hotel was relaxed. Undeterred by their leaders' failure, the
experts tossed around ideas about how to run a city that might one
day be home to two capitals.
</P>
<P>
   They carefully avoided the dispute over sovereignty that stumped
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they talked about practical matters. Should there be a
joint police force? Where should dozens of new embassies be
located? How to limit building height around the walled Old City,
Jerusalem's main attraction and home to major holy shrines?
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's future is quietly being shaped in such informal
sessions, the so-called ''second track'' that has run alongside the
official negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Since participants are not designated as negotiators, they have
greater freedom to explore proposals and test the other side's
reaction. At the same time, they are in close touch with the
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a leading Israeli participant, political science
professor Menachem Klein, also serves as an adviser to Israel's
acting foreign minister and top negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami.
Palestinian Manuel Hassassian, head of the Jerusalem Task Force,
works at the Orient House, the PLO headquarters in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The give-and-take works both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's new proposals at Camp David -- he offered the
Palestinians limited control in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
and suggested he was willing to redraw the municipal boundaries --
galvanized the second track.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of swapping (Jerusalem land) that was taboo in the
past is now something we are taking into consideration,'' said
Hassassian, sweeping his hands over a large map of Jerusalem in his
Orient House office.
</P>
<P>
   Before Camp David, Israel had insisted it would never relinquish
sovereignty over any part of the city, including the Arab
neighborhoods it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camp David was a partial failure only, not totally, and I
think that we have to build on it more intensively,'' Hassassian
said.
</P>
<P>
   The method of talking informally in a comfortable setting was
first successfully applied in 1993 when Israelis and Palestinians
met away from the spotlight in Oslo, Norway. Those meetings led to
the breakthrough agreement of mutual recognition between Israel and
the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of experts have come together in Israel, the
Palestinian areas and abroad, sometimes in large groups, sometimes
in an intimate circle.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim, Christian and Jewish clergy have begun tackling the most
difficult issue -- control of the holy shrines in the Old City. The
Temple Mount, former site of the Jewish Temples and known to
Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, is considered the
fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be creative enough to propose ideas that benefit
both sides,'' said Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin who, along
with Israeli academic Ron Pundak helped organize the second track.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is opening our horizons,'' Hassassian said.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at the hotel in east Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood of
Sheik Jarrah on July 27, two days after the breakdown of the Camp
David talks, participants tackled several angles of the Jerusalem
problem, including security, city management and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Each side will present detailed ideas in writing in upcoming
meetings, including sessions in September and November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The papers are trying to answer the question of what will
happen the day after the (peace) agreement,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Hassassian, who is writing the Palestinian paper on security,
said he is proposing to form a joint force he calls PIP,
Palestinian-Israeli Police, that would respond, for example, to
traffic accidents involving residents from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A similar idea is also mentioned in the Israeli paper on
security, written by former Jerusalem Police Chief Arieh Amit.

<HEADLINE> Who Will Be Final Survivor?  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Well, who's it gonna be: Rudy, Richard, Kelly or
Susan?
</P>
<P>
   If you can't place these names, if ''Tagi'' and ''Pagong'' don't
ring a bell, you must have squandered your summer at the beach,
ballpark or backyard grill.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else has been bingeing on ''Survivor,'' CBS'
Darwinistic campout. And come Wednesday, after 12 tension-building
episodes, the mystery -- who won this crazy game show? -- will be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't believe everything you hear. Be ready for anything.
Watch your back.'' That's the way to survive on this island,
according to ''Survivor'' host Jeff Probst.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Probst will preside over the multiround
elimination process that will decide the show's one true survivor --
the one who was spared by luck and cunning from exile by all the
others. And who then will have a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a real endurance test, and not just for the 16
castaways who marooned themselves on that island near Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   What was it about the show that kept viewers watching all
summer? What inspired the viewing parties with tropical drinks and
fake bugs in the guacamole dip? The heated weekly debate over who
will be voted off the island? (And for that matter, what made
''voted off the island'' the latest fad expression?)
</P>
<P>
   One big attraction is the ritual punishment of the tribal
council vote. Watching someone banished is cruel fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''People enjoy being mean,'' says Steven Reiss, professor of
psychology and psychiatry at Ohio State University. ''It's tough to
acknowledge, but it explains a lot of human behavior. And we need
relatively harmless outlets for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning TV writer Tom Shales damned ''Survivor''
as ''a worthless piece of crap.'' Other critics who decry so-called
''reality TV,'' however, make a sporting exception for
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   They like the eye-popping scenery; the slick production values
that juice up the story as it naturally unfolds; the love 'em, hate
'em cast of characters; the psychological intrigue; the subversive
alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Each castaway must live with the conundrum of needing the
others' support while contriving to do them in.
</P>
<P>
   You might call it ''Iron John Meets Sammy Glick.'' Or, as
executive producer Mark Burnett summed up, ''This is like an
extreme version of an office or a large family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' started with a bang back on May 31, then saw its
audience get even bigger. Perched in the Nielsen top spot every
week since its fourth broadcast, it drew its largest audience yet
last week -- 28.7 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Loria was among them, as he has been since Day One. A real
estate professional from Riverside, Calif., he loves talking about
''Survivor'' at work. He prowls the ''Survivor'' Web site. He even
glories in his advantage over most West Coast fans: With his
satellite dish, he catches the East Coast feed of ''Survivor''
three hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like it on TV,'' Loria says.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, he really has. That's the program's charm: It's
a soap opera, sportscast, whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   As for who won it, that actually was decided back on April 20,
the show's 39th and final day on the island. Since then,
remarkably, the network has managed to keep the secret -- despite no
end of attempts, particularly by computer hackers, to unveil it.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion, with all its artificial immediacy, plays out
over two hours Wednesday, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern, to be
followed by an hour-long live reunion chat with all 16 castaways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the oversell of the drama is part of the fun,'' says
Probst, who will announce the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' arrived on American television in a wave of
so-called ''reality'' programming. Its direct forebear is a popular
Swedish series, ''Expedition Robinson,'' but the real impetus came
from a British import called ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire,''
which premiered on ABC a year ago and was an instant sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire'' spawned game show clones, which quickly flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox, which had found success with reality programming in
the outrageous manner of ''World's Most Shocking Moments,'' thought
it had the perfect hybrid: a game show crossed with a sleazy
spectacle. Airing one day after Valentine's, ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' was not only embarrassing but bogus and
something of a scandal. Fox pledged to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   Then CBS announced two series that sounded no less weird:
''Survivor'' and a Dutch import, ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother,'' which premiered July 5 and airs six times a
week, records the vapid life of contestants sequestered in a
camera-arrayed house. Many viewers complain that watching paint dry
on that house would be more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But the networks hope to jolt you with more such series in the
months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, red-hot thanks to ''Survivor,'' is developing
''Destination Mir,'' which would blast a contestant into outer
space. And in January, immediately after CBS' Super Bowl telecast,
his ''Survivor 2'' will premiere, taped in the Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   Fair dinkum, mate. But for now, it seems, life just won't be the
same off the island.

<HEADLINE> Endless Disasters Hitting Russia  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The loss of a Russian nuclear submarine is just
one more catastrophe in a nation that has been transformed by years
of decline and stagnation from a superpower into a technological
junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   Disasters ranging from crashing airplanes to industrial
accidents have become commonplace in Russia, an increasingly poor
country that can't afford to purchase new equipment or maintain
aging Soviet-era machinery. In industry and the military, the
problem has been compounded by carelessness, lack of training and
pilfering.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin describes the increasingly worn-out
equipment as one of the main obstacles to economic growth. ''Only 5
percent of our enterprises are actively using modern
technologies,'' Putin said at a recent meeting with scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu has repeatedly
warned that Russia faces disaster as everything from airplanes to
elevators go without the maintenance vital to keep aging machinery
running safely. In their annual forecast released in January -- one
which drew quick comparisons to Nostradamus' darkest prophecies --
Shoigu's experts predicted that the country could face a steady
string of technological disasters starting from fires, collapsing
buildings and breaking pipelines and ending with leaks of radiation
and poisonous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have warned that if the current shortage of funds for
new equipment and maintenance goes on, most of Russia's industrial
equipment could be unusable by 2007. Companies struggling to stay
afloat and workers desperate to get any kind of pay continue to use
aging equipment that should have been junked years ago, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''This danger is augmented by the popular neglect of safety
rules in the run for profit,'' said Marina Ryklina, a spokeswoman
for the Emergency Situations Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Soviet times, when discipline and fear of punishment
were stronger, safety rules are commonly ignored in modern Russia.
A string of plane crashes were blamed on overloading after pilots
accepted bribes to take extra cargo, weighing down their aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas explosions have become commonplace in apartment
buildings because of a lack of maintenance. In rural areas, people
hack holes into oil pipelines to siphon fuel, often causing fires
or explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people are electrocuted every year while trying to
pilfer communication wires, electric cable and train and plane
parts for sell as scrap metal. Large areas are left without
electricity after power lines are looted.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, many Russians say, is a tendency to
minimize or dismiss danger -- a trait that is sometimes boasted of
as a national characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people drown in Russia every summer, mostly men who
swim when drunk. Drownings in Russia and other ex-Soviet republics
are up to 500 percent higher than in Western nations, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is a glaring example of the breakdown,
experts say. Even though the Kursk was one of the most modern
vessels in the navy, its safety systems apparently failed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a single rescue system functioned on this top-of the-range
submarine, so what can be said about the older ones?'' said
Alexander Golts, a military analyst for the weekly magazine Itogi.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting it is still a world power, the navy refuses to scrap
hundreds of rusting Soviet-era ships and submarines even though
there is no money for maintenance. Navy officials admit that 70
percent of their ships need major repairs, and scores of vessels
simply sank because their hulls rusted out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should we keep a huge and expensive nuclear fleet if we
are short of funds to send it to sea for even three days?'' the
daily newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta said Friday. ''We must live in
accordance with our means and not turn the seamen into kamikaze
when they go on an exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Low military wages have contributed to a steady decline of skill
and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Officers, who earn the equivalent of $100 a month when they get
paid, have to moonlight as gypsy cab drivers or security guards to
feed their families. Theft is endemic in the military, with
servicemen stripping ships and planes of parts and metal to sell
for food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, four Russian sailors and a retired officer
were arrested on charges of stealing radioactive fuel from a
nuclear submarine. And an officer on another nuclear submarine
stripped the vessel of a filtration unit that controlled the air
supply. The crew would have suffocated if the theft hadn't been
discovered in time.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers sues over stadium repairs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Rutgers University has filed a lawsuit
against the company that expanded and renovated its football
stadium, which is plagued by problems - including faulty guardrails
and cracking concrete - just six years after it reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Friday, claims Terminal Contracting Corp. of
Wood-Ridge used sloppy workmanship and substandard materials to
build the stadium, forcing the university to pay for expensive
emergency repairs. It asks for at least $3.6 million of the money
it has spent for those repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers also named a construction management company and a
Princeton architectural firm for failing to supervise properly the
$22.6 million renovation that was completed in 1994 to herald
Rutgers' entry into the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said repairs needed for public safety have
been completed in time for the Sept. 2 home opener against
Villanova, but Rutgers will spend as much as $3 million more to
finish the remaining repairs by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the university should be compensated for the
significant cost of these extensive repairs by the firms
responsible for ensuring the integrity of the project,'' David
Scott, attorney for the university, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Terminal declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The project manager, Lehrer, McGovern, Bovis, Inc. of Princeton,
also was named in the lawsuit. Company officials said they were
surprised to be sued, as Lehrer is currently working on stadium
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're shocked,'' Stephen Steelman, senior vice president at
the company, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's
editions. ''Personally, I'm dismayed that they decided to make us a
part of that. We volunteered our services at below cost to
implement some of the changes that they've identified. We've been
working closely with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers officials did not comment on why they are suing a
company that continues to work there.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's problems became public in April, when it was
learned that guardrails designed to keep people from falling to
lower levels had loosened from their concrete settings.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also claims inadequate expansion joints have caused
sidewalks and walls to crack, and accuses the contractor of
allowing various structural deficiencies.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Almost No Submarine Hope  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Even as international help was finally arriving at
the scene, the Russian navy said Saturday there is almost no hope
of finding any survivors among the 118 sailors trapped in a
crippled nuclear submarine on the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak said rescue efforts would not end but
there was little chance that anyone could still be alive on the
Kursk after a week in the Arctic depths. He called it the greatest
catastrophe in the history of Russian submarines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regrettably, in effect we have crossed the critical boundary
of ensuring the life of the crew,'' he said in an interview on
Russia's RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lack of contact with the submarine allows us to say that
apparently the critical condition of the crew has already
arrived,'' Motsak said. ''Most possibly, we will have to admit that
our worst expectations have materialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say a huge explosion shattered the submarine on Aug.
12. Motsak said it appeared most of the crew members were killed in
the first minutes afterward, when the submarine slammed into the
bottom of the sea and many survivors likely drowned.
</P>
<P>
   His statement came shortly before a British rescue team arrived
at the site with an advanced mini-submarine. Norwegian divers were
expected to arrive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Design drawings provided by the Russians indicate the British
LR5 mini-sub should be able to connect with the hatches on the
Kursk, the British Ministry of Defense has said. Commander Alan
Hoskins, who is organizing the British rescue team, said the team
would continue with its mission unless told by the Russians that it
is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that the British or Norwegian rescuers will manage to
do at least something. Even if one person is saved that will
already be a lot,'' navy spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky said in
Murmansk on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Motsak said rescue efforts would continue at least through
Sunday, but indicated the emphasis would be on finding out what
happened to the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must get inside the submarine and evacuate the crew. The
essential thing is to find them -- alive or dead -- and get them to
shore to do what must be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission investigating the disaster said Saturday
that the Kursk suffered a massive explosion which ripped through
the confined space of the submarine. The explosion apparently was
in the forward torpedo compartment, which was loaded with up to 30
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the submarine hit the seabed at high speed, its torpedoes
apparently detonated,'' Motsak said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian rescue teams have been gathered at the scene of the
accident for days, but high currents and zero visibility have
frustrated the rescue efforts. On Saturday, Russian rescue teams
failed to latch on to the badly damaged rescue hatch at the rear of
the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the
situation was ''beyond critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Vyacheslav Popov, commander of the Northern Fleet, said
there had been no contact of any kind with the submarine since
Monday despite repeated claims that knocking had been heard from
inside the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The navy had given wildly contradictory estimates of how long
the Kursk's emergency oxygen supplies could last, ranging from a
few hours to two weeks. But officials admitted they had no idea of
conditions inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have not determined precisely how the
submarine got into trouble in the first place. There have been no
reports of other vessels in the area with which the Kursk might
have collided. A likely scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's
forward compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said earlier the Kursk had been in a collision, but
Popov said the explosion could have been triggered from inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be two causes of the explosion -- an external impact,
that is to say a collision, or internal,'' he said on RTR.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the
area Aug. 12 at the time the Kursk was lost. A Norwegian seismic
center said the second blast registered at magnitude 3.5,
equivalent to a mild earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians are distressed that the military was slow to
accept help and are angry at President Vladimir Putin for keeping a
low profile and staying on vacation when the vessel went down.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow from Ukraine early Saturday, cutting
short his trip to a summit of former Soviet republics. He said he
did not fly to the rescue site because it would have been a
distraction to the recovery efforts.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Return Home After Eruption  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Most residents of an island near Tokyo returned to
their homes Saturday after a volcanic eruption that spewed
gray-black ash as high as five miles into the air had forced them
to seek shelter, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption Friday was the largest by 2,686-foot Mount Oyama,
which dominates the resort island of Miyake, since the volcano
awoke last month from a 17-year slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Though no injuries or damage were reported, the massive column
of ash and steam rose menacingly into the sky 120 miles south of
Tokyo on a day that nerves in Japan's capital were frayed by a
series of earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake residents awoke Saturday to find homes and roads covered
by as much as eight inches of ash.
</P>
<P>
   Tadashi Kuriyama, an official at Miyake Airport, said both
scheduled round-trip flights between the island and Tokyo were
canceled Saturday because of a half-inch blanket of dust on the
runway. He said the airport would remain closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Island official Shinoru Kurose said that by late Saturday, 149
residents were still staying in a public school gymnasium and would
spend the night there.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, 2,162 people were ordered to evacuate to designated
shelters on the island, but began returning home Saturday morning.
The island is home to about 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said that Oyama was still sending up
white smoke Saturday evening. The eruption on Friday spewed out
gray-black ash for about 3 1/2 hours, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation came just eight days after 634 people on the
22-square-mile island were forced to leave their homes temporarily
following a smaller eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's was the fifth and most spectacular in a series of
eruptions that began July 9.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Meteorological Agency said that rising underground magma
was likely to blame, and warned that volcanic activity on Miyake
may continue.
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears that heavy rain forecast for Saturday could
add to the misery by causing mudslides, but the island had clear
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Seismic activity has been intensifying in the area this week,
and an observatory on Miyake had recorded almost 600 tremors Friday
when Mount Oyama came to life at 5:02 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama last erupted in 1983. Five hundred homes were
destroyed when lava flowed over its western flank, though timely
evacuations prevented any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Miyake is one of the largest of the Izu islands, a chain of
volcanic islands off Tokyo which stretch 335 miles from north to
south.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, a moderately strong earthquake with a
preliminary magnitude of 5.4 jolted parts of eastern and
northeastern Japan Saturday night, but there were no reports of
damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, which hit at 9:41 p.m., was centered about 20 miles
below the seabed off the coast of Ibaraki prefecture northeast of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said the temblor was unrelated to any
of the quakes recorded Friday in the Izu Islands, where two strong
ones caused landslides. Another moderate one injured a woman in
Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> College guide names Cornell University best based on writing instruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - A new college guide named Cornell the
country's best private research university after comparing how
schools teach students to write.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell freshmen must take two seminars, each of which requires
six to 14 essays.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League college has also established the Knight Institute
for Writing in the Disciplines, which handles the freshman seminars
and works with about 30 professors to make writing more central in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one of the misconceptions students have coming away
from a required writing course is that they have learned how to
write once and for all,'' said Jonathan Monroe, director of the
institute. ''What a professor in history considers to be good
writing may not be exactly the same as what a professor in English
or anthropology or biology considers to be good writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell hopes to expand the program to 60 classes in coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 edition of ''The Best College for You,'' published by
Time magazine and The Princeton Review, hits newsstands Monday.

<HEADLINE> Assembly coup leader out, but not down  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - His lofty Assembly leadership post is
gone, his salary is cut, his staff dispersed, his computers carted
away.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bragman has been vanquished, stripped of considerable
power and perks after his failed bid to take over the Assembly's
top spot from Speaker Sheldon Silver.
</P>
<P>
   So what is he doing?
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old politician has become an aggressive critic of
the legislative system he has worked so deftly for two decades. He
is conferring with his fellow Assembly Democrats. And he is
defiantly refusing to concede defeat in his campaign to shake up
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the strange case of Michael Bragman: He is waging a war
his opponents say is already over, and he is fighting it from a
twilight zone somewhere between speaker-in-waiting and political
roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am dedicated to ensuring that this is not over,'' he said in
an interview at his suburban Syracuse district office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost 35 staff people. I lost $34,500 in salary. I lost the
ability - temporarily, and I underscore that - to do all the things
that I've been doing in past years ... All of those things are
secondary when I think about us having the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman's stated goal is to open up the operations of a
legislative system that is sometimes compared to the old Soviet
Politburo. The New York state Legislature - both the Democrat-run
Assembly and Republican-led Senate - is notorious as a place where
leaders hold tight to power and make important decisions behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's ''good government'' groups routinely call for
legislative reforms, but they don't usually get such a
full-throated boost from a consummate legislative insider like
Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   Until this May, Bragman was the No. 2 man behind Silver with the
title of Assembly majority leader. Bragman was the tall figure with
a businesslike demeanor who would inform members of their marching
orders on session days. Bragman also was known for his ability to
raise campaign funds and to bring home so-called pork barrel
funding for projects in his home district.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of pictures on the wall of his district office speak to
the powerful company he kept - Bragman with Hubert Humphrey, Tip
O'Neill, Jesse Jackson, President Clinton and Hillary Clinton. One
picture shows Bragman and Silver side-by-side on the Assembly
floor, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the alliance between Bragman - a conservative-leaning
upstate Democrat - and the speaker from Manhattan was based more on
political expediency than friendship. Tensions between the pair had
been apparent for years. They spilled out into the open in May when
Bragman cobbled together support among Assembly Democrats to
overthrow Silver. He claimed Silver had become too secretive and
out of touch with his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the battle, Bragman claimed 50 ''rock-solid''
votes - more than half of the 98 Assembly Democrats. Most of those
votes evaporated over several days of intensive jockeying by Silver
and Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Silver won. Describing Bragman as a ''cancer'' in
the leadership team, he stripped his rival of his majority leader
title and the attendant benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And that would have been the end of Bragman's story - had he
taken the cue of other fallen leaders at the Capitol and faded away
into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Bragman is doing the opposite. He has tapped volunteers to
help out his depleted staff and has taken the unprecedented step of
augmenting staff salaries with his campaign funds. He continues to
hold a campaign war chest with a balance of $1.2 million in July -
a huge amount for a state lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   He has continued to publicly expound on the themes he said drove
his attempt to topple Silver. A tour of the state is planned and he
uses his campaign Web site - www.bragman.org - as a cyber-soapbox
to tout reforms that would empower rank-and-file Assembly members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members don't know how many shirts to pack, they don't
know when they arrive in the Assembly chamber how long we're going
to be working, what bills are going to be considered,'' Bragman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman shows off a pile of congratulatory e-mails his office
has received from around the state. And despite his stormy year,
Bragman remains popular enough in his home district that
Republicans declined to run a candidate against him this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He also has remained plugged into Democratic politics - taking
calls from an Assembly member and a labor leader during an
hour-long interview recently. An annual clambake fund-raiser held
just after his defeat by Silver drew political heavyweights
including Hillary Clinton, who kissed Bragman on the cheek as she
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, Bragman continues to work with a group of
about 17 other rebel Assembly Democrats who call themselves the
Assembly Majority Reform Caucus. The caucus could figure in the
shadowy inside game for control of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman is not divulging strategy, but a clear opportunity
presents itself after the November elections, when the 150 members
of the newly elected Assembly must vote for a speaker before they
begin the 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   Most years, Democrats vote in a bloc for their conference
leader. But things could get complicated if there is a fracture in
the Democratic vote - which now accounts for 98 of the 150 votes in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   If a split occurs, Assembly Democrats could be forced to
negotiate over whether to choose Silver, Bragman or somebody else.
Alternatively, a Democratic candidate could deal with Assembly
Republicans over their bloc of votes.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of ''ifs'' in that scenario, and Silver has
already taken steps that could head it off at the pass.
</P>
<P>
   He has been conciliatory with members that had lined up against
him and appointed ''focus groups'' of Assembly Democrats to come up
with recommendations on changing some majority procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the speaker is more accessible than he has been,
his senior staff are more accessible, information is more readily
available,'' said Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat who had
backed Bragman's coup attempt, but switched to Silver's camp.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a feeling among Assembly members that Bragman's
actions have increased pressure for change, that doesn't
necessarily translate into a momentum for a new speaker.
Ironically, Silver could potentially increase his job security by
allowing some of the reforms being promoted by Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's no reform at all then you're jamming a lid on a
steaming kettle,'' said Assemblyman Edward Sullivan of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, through his spokeswoman Patricia Lynch, said he would
not comment on stories about ''the former majority leader.''
Silver's allies insist that the fight for control is over, that
Bragman had made a power grab and it failed.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be the case, Bragman said at least he could
say to himself that he did the right thing. He paused a second,
then added: ''But I think it can be accomplished.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Patients To Climb Mount Fuji  </HEADLINE>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- More than 200 cancer patients from the United
States and Japan will climb Mount Fuji this week in a bid to
inspire mutual hope and determination to conquer their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to hold hands with all of the families who have
faced cancer, here in Japan,'' Andrea Martin, founder of the Breast
Cancer Fund, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization, said
Saturday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a breast cancer survivor, said the climb is also aimed
at drawing attention to increasing breast cancer rates. The disease
is the leading cause of death for American women ages 25 to 55,
according to the Breast Cancer Fund.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 160 Japanese cancer patients, including 85 with
breast cancer, and 60 Americans with the disease will begin
climbing 12,460-foot Mount Fuji, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They will be accompanied by more than 200 family members and
other supporters for the trek, which ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The participants will take buses to a point about halfway up the
mountain, from which the summit can be reached on foot in several
hours.
</P>
<P>
   As most climbers usually do, however, the group will spend
Monday night just below the summit to adjust to the high altitude
before reaching the top Tuesday morning in time to see the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Each U.S. team member has raised funds ranging from $5,000 to
$30,000 for future cancer research, education, patient support and
other activities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to climb Japan's most famous mountain was proposed by
Martin and Dr. Jinroh Itami, a Japanese oncologist who leads a
cancer support group that considers mountain climbing as an
inspiring metaphor for the challenge of overcoming cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Itami said he hopes the event will boost awareness and hope
among Japanese cancer patients and inspire them to be much more
active in challenging their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so excited,'' said Helen Louise Ittner, a 65-year-old
breast cancer patient from San Francisco. ''We are going to the top
and we are going to beat this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ittner, whose mother died at 56 and her sister at 46, both of
breast cancer, said she wants to climb to honor them as well as all
the people who have fought the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Since she heard about the event last year, she has been
regularly hiking and working out at a gym. Ittner was first
diagnosed in 1995 and had a recurrence last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel much better now,'' she said, smiling. ''And I feel very
fortunate. My mother and sister didn't get to live this long.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, some 30,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer
each year, and the growth rate is among the world's fastest, said
Kimiko Goldberg, also a patient and a leader of a Japanese support
group.
</P>
<P>
   The climb is the third for the Breast Cancer Fund. In 1996, 17
patients climbed the 23,000-foot Aconcagua in Argentina, and five
breast cancer survivors climbed Alaska's 20,400-foot Mount
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   For Cathy Masamitsu, a third-generation Japanese-American, the
climb is not only for herself but also for her grandmother, who
died of breast cancer without ever being able to return to Japan
after emigrating to the United States in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   After her second diagnosis, Masamitsu learned she needed to
''look at the bigger miracle'' rather than dwelling on her own
sadness. So she began telling her story as a way of sharing mutual
concerns and challenges with others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reaching out and sharing positive attitude is very important
for our healing,'' she said. ''Ultimately, many more lives will be
saved.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Climbers Freed in Kyrgyzstan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Four American mountain climbers
abducted by Islamic militants described their captivity Saturday as
an adventure and said they were happy their families didn't know
about the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The four, all in their 20s and from California, were climbing in
Kyrgyzstan's Turo pass when they were taken captive, Kyrgyz
officials have said. They were released Thursday, but it wasn't
clear when they were taken or how they were freed.
</P>
<P>
   President Askar Akayev, who met with the four on Saturday, said
they had been hiking in an area frequently traveled by rebels who
invaded Kyrgyzstan earlier this month. The rebels are trying to
carve out an Islamic state in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''The terrorists move through these mountain passes,'' Akayev
told the climbers through a translator in a meeting that was
televised.
</P>
<P>
   John Dickey, 25, replied that the ordeal was ''an adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey and the other three climbers, who identified themselves
as 22-year-old Jason Smith, 22-year-old Tommy Caldwell and
20-year-old Beth Radley, looked to be in good health. They were
dressed in brand-new military fatigues given to them by the Kyrgyz
army.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't beat us or anything like that,'' Smith told
Associated Press Television News. He said the four were camping out
near a rock face when they were shot at and seized by militants.
</P>
<P>
   The four said they lost about $30,000 in climbing equipment to
the militants. When asked if they had anything to tell their
families, they said it was best that relatives didn't know of their
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all very happy that our families do not know,'' Smith
said. ''It's probably best that they only find out now that we're
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear where in California the four are from.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has broken out in several spots recently between
government troops and rebels seeking to take control of the remote,
rugged area where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan converge.
</P>
<P>
   The government says more than 25 Kyrgyz troops have been killed
in clashes over the past several days.

<HEADLINE> More Women on Stamps Backed  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Less than 1 percent of commemorative
stamps issued by the U.S. Postal Service portray women or women's
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's because there is a gender invisibility in our
country about the significant achievements of women,'' said author
Jane Plitt, who thinks pioneering businesswoman Martha Matilda
Harper is worthy of such recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, Harper created what Plitt described in a
recent biography as America's first retail franchise, a
beauty-salon chain that boasted 500 branches worldwide at its peak
in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Plitt's push for a Harper stamp has drawn the support of U.S.
Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who is starting a bipartisan effort
aimed at boosting the number of women depicted on postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 1,700 commemorative stamps issued by the Postal
Service over the last two centuries, the agency says 133 salute
women. In a ''Women on Stamps'' pamphlet published a year ago, it
listed 22 female performers, 14 authors, four first ladies and 15
pilots, athletes, educators and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the first colonial child born in America,
Virginia Dare in 1587; flag designer Betsy Ross; sharpshooter Annie
Oakley; and 19th-century suffragist Susan B. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Plitt maintains that a dozen of the listings should be excluded
because, rather than being gender-specific, they honor professions
like nursing or ballet, famous families, or associations like Big
Brothers-Big Sisters of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 20 stamps for insects and spiders,'' Plitt
complained. ''Our Postal Service is choosing to give more credence
to animals and flowers than they do to half the American
population. It takes somebody to ask 'Why?' I think they should be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter planned to unveil a proposed Harper stamp Sunday at
Anthony's restored home, where the women's rights crusader was
arrested for daring to vote in 1872. The 19th Amendment giving
women the right to vote was passed 80 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surely if Daffy Duck and other cartoon characters appear on
stamps, we cannot allow trailblazing women like Martha Matilda
Harper to be ignored,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters need to collect 150,000 signatures to show there is
''genuine interest'' in a Harper stamp. The Postal Service gets
thousands of suggestions for new stamps, and one honoring Harper is
being assessed by its Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, Slaughter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice Thurgood Marshall said, 'If people are not visible it
is as though they're not there,' and that is exactly what has
happened with these stamps,'' Plitt said. ''It is as though women
are not there.''

<HEADLINE> Key Events in Russia Sub Trauma  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A look at some of the key events in the weeklong
drama surrounding the sunken Russian submarine Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 12. -- The submarine crashes to the bottom of the Barents
Sea during naval exercises.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 13. -- Russian ships hunt for the missing submarine. The
loss is not announced.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 14 -- The navy announces a submarine has suffered a
malfunction in the Barents Sea, but says it has only been missing
one day. Officials say surface vessels in radio contact, and air
and power lines linked up to the submarine, indicating quick
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 15 -- Navy says rescue effort underway with underwater
capsules. Unconfirmed reports speak of sounds from vessel
indicating survivors.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 16 -- Rescue efforts continue. Top officials give
contradictory reports on state of Kursk and chances of survivors.
After refusing Western aid, Moscow asks Britain and Norway to send
rescue submarine and divers. Public criticism grows of handling of
the event and President Vladimir Putin's decision not to interrupt
his vacation to handle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 17 -- Government commission says Kursk collided with
another object despite U.S. and Norwegian reports of massive
explosion in region at time submarine went down. British and
Norwegian rescue crews head for Russia on ships.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 18 -- Russian rescue capsule reaches Kursk's escape hatch
for the first time, but finds it too badly damage to dock.
Government says huge explosion shattered Kursk, but uncertain as to
what triggered it.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 19 -- Attempts to dock with escape hatch fail again.
Russian navy says virtually certainly that all crew dead, most
perishing in first few moments of disaster. British rescue team
arrives on scene. Putin returns to Moscow ahead of schedule.

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Tutsis Protest Talks  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Riot police on Saturday clubbed Tutsi
demonstrators trying to mobilize opposition to a Burundi peace
agreement that President Clinton is being asked to endorse on a
trip to east Africa next week.
</P>
<P>
   The clash on the streets of the capital, Bujumbura, epitomized
the uncertainty over the accord with Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   President Pierre Buyoya, a retired Tutsi major, said Friday that
he and opposition leaders, including Hutu rebels involved in a
seven-year civil war, have asked former South African President
Nelson Mandela to put off the signing of a power-sharing agreement
set for Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who has been trying to cut a deal among Burundi's 19
political parties and interest groups, has invited Clinton and
other world leaders to take part in the signing ceremony in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Wednesday that Clinton will visit
Tanzania this month to show U.S. support for the Burundi peace
process, but did not disclose any other details about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Saturday's anti-government demonstration said life
in this central African nation, already beset by a poor economy and
an upsurge in rebel attacks, will get worse if the government
agrees to share power with Hutus who have been fighting the
Tutsi-dominated government and army since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot negotiate with people who carried out a genocide.
They should be tried in court. The peace agreement will have no
future,'' said Lothaire Niyonkuru, a university lecturer whose
group, Action Against Genocide, organized the rally.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have been killed since Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated the first democratically elected
president, a Hutu, in October 1993. Burundi's first experiment with
democracy collapsed amid ethnic violence when Hutu politicians and
soldiers took up arms, accusing the Tutsi-dominated army and
government of robbing them of the 1993 vote.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 protesters were arrested and others dispersed by
police wielding clubs when they tried to gather at the downtown
market, near the U.S. Embassy. During the protest, police beat up
and confiscated tapes from a Reuters TV cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a warning we want to give to Mandela, President
Clinton and all the others who will assist in the signing of the
Arusha peace agreement so they know that the Burundians are against
it,'' said Diomede Rutamucero, leader of PA-Amasekanya, one of the
other groups involved in the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya on Friday condemned the banned demonstration and accused
the organizers for trying to create ''confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They are people who don't want peace,'' Buyoya told reporters
on his return from South Africa, where he held talks with Mandela
and both Hutu and Tutsi opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's draft proposal centers on an ethnically balanced
government, parliament and army. But both the rebels and the
government objected to the proposal, and could not agree on when a
cease-fire should take effect and who should be in charge of a
three-year transition period.
</P>
<P>
   If Mandela insists on signing the agreement Aug. 28, ''we can
extract the points on which there is consensus and sign and give
time to other points where there is no consensus,'' Buyoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutu rebels, meanwhile, stepped up attacks all over the country,
causing tension in the lakeside capital where gunfire and artillery
explosions echoed from the surrounding mountains on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Four people, including one soldier, were killed Thursday in
Gatumba, west of Bujumbura, when three military positions came
under rebel attack, Radio Burundi reported. In a separate incident,
one rebel was reported killed in Kanyosha, south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Buyoya was scheduled to attend the funeral for Col.
Balthazar Nyezimana, the highest-ranking army officer to die in a
rebel attack. The killing has strained the army, which has been
ordered not to respond at a time when violence could easily spin
out of control, officials said.

<HEADLINE> 16 years after abduction, boy returning to abductor  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Leonard Cammalleri abducted his infant son
and hid him for 12 years - from schools, doctors and his mother.
Cammalleri went to prison for the crime. Now he has won the right
to visit his son and is fighting for full custody.
</P>
<P>
   The father is the only parent whom Lenny, now 17, wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a devastating double defeat for the boy's mother,
who was said to be ''ecstatic'' when reunited with her son in 1996.
She is heartbroken that she was unable to restore the mother-child
bond, her lawyer said. And she opposed giving the father visitation
rights on the ground that ''he took the childhood away from this
child.''
</P>
<P>
   But Family Court Judge William Warren of Rockland County, where
the boy attends a school for children with emotional problems,
ruled last month that Cammalleri, 48, can take Lenny home every
weekend and any other time that doesn't interfere with the boy's
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not return a call seeking comment. Transcripts of
the court session are sealed, but The Associated Press obtained a
copy of the visitation order.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the decision I would have made but it's not an easy
decision to make,'' said the mother's lawyer, Deborah Sheehan.
''You have a young man saying he wants to be with his father. I
guess there's a concern, when there's such a longing, that it might
be hurtful to him not to see his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Gilmer-Tullis, family services advocate for the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said it's not rare for
an abductor, once released from jail, to get visitation with the
abducted child.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that the boy was with the father and only the father for
12 years, perhaps the system was looking at a way to reduce the
trauma experienced by the child when he was returned to the
mother,'' she said. ''More than likely he was going through some
kind of anxiety, some kind of trauma, and the mother probably was
as well, feeling sadness and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When a child is taken, the child you had at that point of time
certainly does not come back to you, the same child you remember,''
she said. ''All those years have been unfortunately lost and they
cannot be regained.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case that won national attention, Stephen Fagan of
Massachusetts kidnapped his daughters - then ages 5 and 2 - in
1979, told them their mother had died in a car crash and fabricated
new lives for them in Florida. The daughters stood by their father
and refused to see their mother even after he was arrested in 1998
and they learned the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Cammalleri said his son did not want to be interviewed for this
article. He will not say why he took his son in 1984, claiming any
negative comments about his ex-wife, Candice Hartman, would be
considered a violation of his probation, which followed his 2&AMP;frac12;
years in prison. But at the time of his arrest, his lawyer said
Cammalleri feared his wife was a child abuser.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Hartman's lawyer says the ex-wife claims Cammalleri had
abused her.
</P>
<P>
   While in hiding with the child, in Florida and the Bronx,
Cammalleri would not send him to school, fearing discovery. He
taught the boy himself and made a living doing odd jobs and giving
piano lessons, he said. He also dispensed with doctor's visits and
the boy missed out on normal childhood inoculations and checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very lucky,'' Cammalleri said. ''Lenny never got
seriously sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, meanwhile, ''spent those 12 years basically in hell,''
Sheehan said. ''She spent her time and money looking for her child.
She hired private investigators and lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, police got a tip and found Cammalleri and the boy in an
apartment on East 163rd Street. Cammalleri was arraigned in federal
court in White Plains and Hartman was flown in from the Midwest for
a reunion with her long-lost 13-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she last saw this child, he was using a bottle,'' said
Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro. ''She's
absolutely ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny, however, was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very angry when he met his mother, and scared,''
Sheehan said. ''His father had been taken away from him and he had
only heard terrible things about his mother. He did not feel
rescued.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy threatened to kill his mother, she said, and ''she was
advised by medical and psychiatric personnel that he needed to be
in a residential and therapeutic community.'' Ever since, he has
been in boarding schools in Connecticut and Rockland County, with
the bills paid by the victim assistance program in Connecticut,
where Lenny was abducted.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, until Cammalleri was released from prison,
father and son had no contact. Hartman tried to restart a
relationship with her son, but he began visiting Cammalleri's
family in the Bronx and rejecting his mother, Sheehan said. Now he
won't see her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It breaks her heart,'' Sheehan said. ''I don't think unless it
happens to you, you can understand the enormous pain.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cammalleri sought visitation, Hartman opposed any contact,
hoping that as the child grew ''he could be able to make better
judgments on his own and not come back under the influence of his
father,'' Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he won generous visitation, the Rockland ruling did not
satisfy Cammalleri. In an interview at the Bronx apartment he
shares with his mother, he said the boy is unhappy at the boarding
school but can't be removed without the blessing of the custodial
parent. He claims the boy was not permitted to testify about his
desire to leave the school and rejoin his father.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny is eager to enter ''a normal public high school'' in New
York City, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system is holding my son captive,'' he said. ''It's all
because I took him. They're punishing him because of what I did. I
didn't trust the system 16 years ago and I sure don't trust it
now.'' He said he wants to keep trying for custody but can no
longer afford a lawyer. His lawyer in Rockland, Arleen Lewis, did
not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cammalleri said the boy is well-adjusted, makes friends easily
and simply wants a normal life with the father he loves. He said
Lenny shows talent for electrical work and there's no reason he
won't grow into a happy and well-rounded man.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, though her delight from her son's 1996 rescue has
faded, is hopeful that one day, ''They'll be reunited with
affection and love for one another as mother and child,'' Sheehan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' she added, ''there's no Disney ending.''

<HEADLINE> NJ mental hospital employee dead with Legionnaires' disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey health officials said employees
at a state mental hospital should not fear an outbreak after a
co-worker died of Legionnaires' disease.
</P>
<P>
   A lung X-ray showed the 60-year-old man, whose identity was not
released, had the respiratory disease. But medical examiners had
not determined if the disease was responsible for the man's death.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they would attempt to trace where the man
had been the ten days previous to his death. The man died Wednesday
night, said Pam Ronan, a Trenton Psychiatric Hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they had inspected the heating,
ventilation and air conditioning systems at the Ann Klein Forensic
Center. Medical questionnaires also were distributed to staff.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA Local 1040 union, which represents the hospital
employees, said it worried that the Department of Health was slow
in testing the facility for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Human Services, which oversees the hospital,
said it looks like the infection was an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the man was a building maintenance supervisor at
the Ann Klein center, which employs over 400 people and can treat
up to 150 patients at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The disease was named for its first known outbreak at an
American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976. That outbreak
killed 34 people and infected 221.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control reports seven people this year
have been diagnosed with the disease in New Jersey. One person was
determined to have died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, between 8,000 and 18,000 people in the United States
get the disease each year, according to the CDC.

<HEADLINE> DeGeneres, Heche Split Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche have split up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, we have decided to end our relationship,'' the
couple said in a statement in Saturday's Daily News. ''It is an
amicable parting, and we greatly value the 3&AMP;frac12; years we have spent
together.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres, 43, was the first openly gay lead on television. A
year after declaring her homosexuality in a Time magazine cover
story in 1997, ABC canceled her ''Ellen'' series, citing declining
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Heche, 31, and DeGeneres collaborated on an HBO film ''If These
Walls Could Talk II' in April. Heche directed DeGeneres and Sharon
Stone in the story of a lesbian couple trying to have a baby -- a
tale said to mirror the plans of Heche and DeGeneres.
</P>
<P>
   Heche also filmed a three-month cross-country standup comedy
tour of DeGeneres, which culminated with an HBO cable special that
aired last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News quoted unnamed friends as saying no third party
was involved in the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Heche had been romantically linked to actors Steve Martin and
Richard Burgi before hooking up with DeGeneres.

<HEADLINE> Brooks: Attraction Idea Not So Good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Garth Brooks says turning his Nashville
home into a Graceland-style museum seemed like a good idea -- until
he talked with the people that run Elvis Presley's tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   They told Brooks his hilltop house would have to be torn up to
make way for security cameras, fire exits and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't fun anymore,'' Brooks said Friday, two days after
neighbors complained about the proposal in a meeting with the
singer's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   He's soured on the idea for now and plans to continue using the
Nashville area house, known as the Blue Rose Estate.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 38, has sold 97 million albums in his 10-year career,
making him the best-selling artist in country music history. His
hits include ''Friends in Low Places,'' ''The Dance,''
''Shameless'' and ''Two of a Kind, Workin' on a Full House.'' He
and wife Sandy have three daughters, ages 8, 6 and 4.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth man admits killing cousin and neighbor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - An Elizabeth man faces 23 years in prison
after admitting he killed his neighbor in 1997 and his 16-year-old
cousin two years before that.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier death had gone unsolved for five years until Horace
Vaughn's recent confession in the death of his downstairs neighbor,
Felicia ''Lisa'' Viera.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Dekota Camira Vaughn was found lying face-up in a
backyard near her aunt's house in Orange on Oct. 25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vaughn was considered a suspect in her death, he had
not been charged, according to Charlotte Smith, spokeswoman for the
Essex County Prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   When Vaughn admitted killing Viera, he told police he also was
responsible for strangling his cousin to death.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, 32, was considered a suspect in Viera's death because he
was the last person with the 38-year-old before her death on Sept.
12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts of aggravated
manslaughter and two weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   During his plea, he told Superior Court Judge John Triarsi he
stabbed Viera in her apartment after she threatened to tell his
girlfriend something. Vaughn's attorney, Mitchell Ignatoff, cut him
off before his client could elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he wrapped the woman's body in draperies and drove
her car to Newark to abandon the corpse. The car was found six days
later, and the body two days after that.
</P>
<P>
   He also told Triarsi that he suffocated his cousin at his aunt's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who has been in the Union County Jail since his 1997
arrest, faces sentencing in November.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said he was convicted in 1996 of endangering the
welfare of a child - a downgrade of a sexual assault charge in
Essex County - and sentenced to two years' probation.

<HEADLINE> Investigator: GOP 'Sold Out'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders in the Senate succumbed to
political pressure and ''sold out'' the House members who impeached
President Clinton, ensuring the Senate would not remove him from
office, the chief investigator contends in a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we ever appeared on the floor of the United States
Senate, the House impeachment managers and I knew we didn't have a
shot to win,'' writes David Schippers, top investigative counsel to
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee during the
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the U.S. Senate, politics trumped principles, and polls
trumped honor,'' Schippers, who has returned to private law
practice in Chicago, says in a book to be published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers said the ''House managers'' serving as prosecutors
were hamstrung because the Republican-controlled Senate limited the
trial to five weeks, refused to hear live witness testimony, and
allowed depositions of only three prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats argued at the time that Republicans were
pushing a case based on private misconduct that never should have
reached the level of impeachment. Some Republican senators
questioned whether it would sully the Senate. Polls consistently
showed about two-thirds of Americans believed Clinton should remain
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers notes in the book, ''Sellout,'' there were more than
enough Republicans, if all stuck together, to win the
simple-majority votes needed to set rules and mandate ''a full
impeachment trial.'' There were 55 Republican and 45 Democratic
senators.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote was needed to convict Clinton; he was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved two articles of impeachment in December 1998,
charging the president with perjury and obstruction of justice in
his efforts to cover up his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott opened his first meeting with House
managers by telling Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, ''Henry, you're not going to dump this garbage
on us,'' according to Schippers' account.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' writes that Lott, R-Miss., explained, ''Everybody
wants a fair hearing, but we don't want to spend weeks on this,''
and Lott insisted, ''We can't look partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I learned that every time I heard the word 'bipartisan' on
Capitol Hill, we were about to be sold out,'' Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott could not be reached immediately for comment. A spokesman
said Hyde, R-Ill., was traveling and could not be reached.

<HEADLINE> Warmer Weather Melts North Pole Ice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in 50 million years, visitors
to the North Pole can see something extraordinary: water.
</P>
<P>
   The thick ice that covers the Arctic Ocean at the North Pole has
melted, leaving a mile-wide stretch of water at the top of the
world, The New York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent visitors to the pole told the Times about the
unexpected sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if anybody in history ever got to 90 degrees
north to be greeted by water, not ice,'' said Malcolm C. McKenna, a
paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   The water could be the result of global warming, although there
is a debate among experts about the cause. Some believe it could
simply be a natural occurrence rather than the result of a
''greenhouse effect'' caused by manmade pollution and increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have said that the last time the North Pole had this
much water was 50 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For oceanographer James C. McCarthy, who visited the pole
earlier this month on a tourist cruise, the disappearing ice was a
cause for concern. Passengers aboard the cruise were shocked to
find water when there has long been only ice.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Inaugurated in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Fresh from a landslide re-election,
Hugo Chavez took the presidential oath of office Saturday,
promising to complete his ''social revolution'' for the poor but
plagued by allegations that he's leading Venezuela into an economic
abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His right hand in the air and his left on a new constitution he
pushed through last year, Chavez declared: ''I swear before this
revolutionary constitution that I will battle without rest
alongside my people to honor the mandates of the Bolivarian
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some might still think that Fidel Castro is guiding this
revolution. We like Fidel very much but the ideological leader is
Simon Bolivar,'' Chavez said, referring to the 19th century South
American liberation hero who was born in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Chavez and his wife, Marisabel, walked past dozens of
soldiers while a military band played patriotic music in the
legislative palace in Caracas, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who staged a failed 1992 coup
attempt, took his oath for a new six-year term just three weeks
after easily winning re-election in balloting required by the new
constitution. The ceremony was attended by dignitaries and senior
officials, but no foreign heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in two years Chavez has been sworn in -- a
result of the president's overhaul of political institutions in
this South American nation of 24 million people. Since taking
office, his leftist coalition has eliminated the old Congress and
Supreme Court, and dealt heavy blows to the two traditional
political parties that ruled Venezuela during 40 years of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Venezuela's current economic and social situation
''savage,'' Chavez promised Saturday to create a more equitable
society during his new term and to carry out an ambitious land
reform program. In international affairs, he urged ''an end to the
bombardments, the embargoes, the sanctions and the threats of the
most powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will keep fighting for a multipolar world,'' he said, a
veiled reference to U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, Chavez's revolution has amounted to an assault
on the democratic balance of power. But to Venezuela's poor
majority, which forms the base of his support, Chavez's fiery
rhetoric promising an end to social injustice has been an antidote
to despair.
</P>
<P>
   During his three-hour inaugural address, Chavez denied claims
that his revolution doesn't respect dissent. He said the presence
of opposition members in the new Congress ''is an indication that
this revolution was born with a respect for diversity ... for
freedom of thought and freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez vowed to turn his attention to the ailing economy in his
new term. For the first time in memory, the economy has turned sour
-- shrinking by 7 percent last year -- during a boom in the
international price of oil, Venezuela's top export.
</P>
<P>
   A Central Bank official said Friday that the economy was well on
its way to recovery, growing by about 2.5 percent in the year's
first half. Still, the president's detractors say his constant
verbal attacks on the private sector augur poorly for investment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also wonder about the possible negative economic effects
of Chavez's irreverent foreign policy. The United States and other
industrialized countries have been closely observing Chavez's
friendship with isolated leaders such as Iraq's Saddam Hussein,
Castro and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi. They are also watching his
efforts to keep oil prices high by trying to persuade OPEC to honor
its established quotas and avoid overproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a big mandate in
July 30 elections. It gained three-fifths of a new, 165-member
unicameral legislature and 14 of 23 state governorships. But
results of many of those races have been questioned, with
opposition candidates pointing out a wide range of irregularities
in the vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution gives Chavez a six-year term that can be
extended by another six years. The old 1961 constitution had
five-year terms and prohibited immediate re-election.

<HEADLINE> Corrections commissioner named NYPD commissioner  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - City Corrections Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a
former police detective and a trusted staff member of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, was named Saturday as the new police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made the announcement at City Hall.
Kerik, 44, who once worked as a uniformed cop, becomes the city's
40th police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bernie has (one) thing so important as police commissioner -
having served as a police officer, understanding the difficulties
and split second decisions an officer has to make,'' Giuliani said.
''He brings a quality of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik earned praise for his successful three-year tenure at the
Corrections Department, where he has earned the respect of the
12,400 employees. He oversees approximately 130,000 inmate
admissions yearly in the city's 16 jails, 15 court holding pens and
four hospital wards.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a dream from many, many years ago, when I
started in law enforcement,'' Kerik said. ''This is something I
dreamed of, something I thought would never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Department Joseph Dunne, also a contender for the
commissioner's job, was named First Deputy Commissioner, the second
in command in the department. Dunne is currently the department's
third in command.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik does not have a college degree. But while the degree is
required for police officers holding ranks of captain or above, it
is not required for the job of police commissioner, which is a
civil service position.
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout with an equivalency diploma, Kerik has
been taking courses through Empire State College and needs 24 more
credits for his bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, after thanking Giuliani, expressed his gratitude to
former mayor Edward I. Koch. Kerik, while living in the Middle
East, called the city Department of Personnel to get an application
for the police force - and was twice hung up on.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a letter to Koch, who personally responded, and soon
received a half-dozen applications in the mail. Kerik was sworn in
as an officer on July 15, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik was named by Giuliani as Corrections Commissioner in
January 1998. Prior to being commissioner, he was the Corrections
First Deputy Commissioner, appointed that position in January 1995.
He joined the department in 1994, and also has served as the
executive assistant to the commissioner and as director of the
Investigations Division.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, a New Jersey native, joined Corrections after serving
eight years as an NYPD cop, spending much of his career as a
narcotics detective in Manhattan. He received 30 police citations,
including the Medal of Valor.
</P>
<P>
   He earned that award after surviving a 1991 shootout in
Washington Heights, an incident that Giuliani recounted in his news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik worked on the New York Drug Enforcement Administration
task force, helping direct an investigation that resulted in the
convictions of more than 60 members of the infamous Cali drug
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the NYPD, Kerik served as a military police
officer in the U.S. Army and as warden of the Passaic County Jail.
A martial arts expert, Kerik spent four years in various security
assignment in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In December, 1997, he was appointed by Giuliani as a member of
the newly-formed New York City Gambling Control Commission. The
five-member Commission is charged with establishing and enforcing
regulations for shipboard gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik replaces outgoing commissioner Howard Safir, who attended
the Saturday morning news conference announcing his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Safir, a longtime friend of Giuliani's, announced on Aug. 8 that
he would step down to take a job with an Atlanta-based firm,
ChoicePoint, a credential, verification and identification service
provider. Safir was appointed commissioner in 1996; his last day on
the job was Friday.

<HEADLINE> Youth Day Draws 2 Million To Rome  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A sprawling, sweating campground with a population
rivaling summertime Rome's sprang up Saturday for Pope John Paul
II's World Youth Day -- nuns settling in beside bikini-wearing
faithful for a sunset prayer vigil by the copter-commuting pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd estimated by the Vatican at two million covered 15
rolling acres outside Rome, where they would camp out until the
pope's closing Mass Sunday morning. Fire hoses, fans and fainting
tents worked to relieve countless young pilgrims overcome by heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''That. Feels. So. Goooood,'' said Katy Rothman of Somers, N.Y.,
reveling under the blast of spray that greeted the young woman
after a three-hour walk to the campus outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs ran alongside the pontiff's white ''popemobile'' as he
rolled through the crowd Saturday evening, flying in to lead a
prayer vigil later in the evening before returning for Sunday's
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   World Youth Day -- back in Rome this year, after starting there
under John Paul 15 years ago -- fell on what forecasters projected
as the hottest weekend of the year. Hundreds of pilgrims had been
treated at the campus by mid-afternoon, most overcome by the Roman
sun and Mediterranean humidity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the illnesses was serious, doctors said. Most of the
heat cases recovered after a half-hour in air conditioned
''fainting tents'' with friends and nurses fanning them.
</P>
<P>
   Innumerable hoses turned on the crowd kept the heat manageable
once pilgrims reached the site.
</P>
<P>
   Young people stripped down to shorts and bikinis around gushing
hydrants, splashing in welling mud pools. Woodstock comparisons
seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hot, and I'm going to get wet anyway,'' said Dina Focina,
22, waving a hand at her two-piece.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors vigil and Mass close a six-day slate of events that
brought the hordes of young Catholic pilgrims to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The young people came from some 160 countries, sleeping in
convents, schools, hotels and private homes around Rome after
months of fund-raising and saving for plane or train tickets. Rome,
for its part, was emptied of perhaps 2 million of its 3 million
people for Italy's traditional mid-August beach break.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers said organizers of Sunday's Mass were having to break
communion wafers into pieces, caught short despite long shifts by
baker nuns.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul started Youth Days in 1985, seeking to inspire young
Catholics as other faiths gained followers in much of the world.
The first one, in central Rome, drew about 200,000 people, some
waving banners of the then-banned Solidarity movement in John
Paul's Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowd in John Paul's papacy was a World Youth Day
gathering in 1995, which drew some 4 million people in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   This week, young Catholics walked through the dark or for hours
along sun-blanched streets to reach the Tor Vergata site of the
latest Youth Day edition.
</P>
<P>
   Amelisa Radeghieri, 24, of the northern city of Reggio Emilia,
camped out overnight Friday just to get a good spot after being
shut out of a glimpse of the pope at the 1997 edition in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to get the first spot -- and we got it,'' Radeghieri
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Africa AIDS Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton signed a bill
Saturday that sets up a global trust fund to provide funds for AIDS
prevention, health care and education to countries hardest hit by
the disease, which killed 2.8 million people last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today alone, African families will hold nearly 6,000 funerals
for loved ones who died of AIDS,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio
address, delivered less than a week before he was to visit Nigeria
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighting AIDS worldwide is not just the right thing to do,
it's the smart thing. In our tightly connected world, infectious
disease anywhere is a threat to public health everywhere,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating a World Bank AIDS Trust Fund, the bill
authorizes funds for the administration's fiscal 2001 initiatives
to fight HIV and AIDS worldwide and strengthens the U.S. response
to the health emergency.
</P>
<P>
   It includes $300 million for the U.S. Agency for International
Development for education, voluntary testing and counseling,
prevention of mother-to-child transmission and care for those
living with HIV or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Already HIV-AIDS is the leading cause of death in Africa and
increasingly threatens Asia and the states of the former Soviet
Union,'' Clinton said. ''In the hardest-hit countries, AIDS is
leaving students without teachers, patients without doctors, and
children without parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also authorizes $50 million in new funds for the
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization; $10 million for the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; and $60 million to fight
tuberculosis -- the single largest killer of adults worldwide and
the leading cause of death of those with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The bill authorizes U.S. contributions of $150 million a year
for two years. The money is intended as a springboard to bring in
up to $1 billion a year from international donors. The House had
pushed for a $500 million U.S. contribution over five years, but
the Senate scaled it back.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund ''represents an extraordinary effort to move with
urgency to address the horrific AIDS epidemic,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, House sponsor of the bill. ''It is our hope and
expectation that the annual contribution from the U.S. will
leverage enough contributions from other donors to increase several
fold the size of the trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, administered by the U.S. representative to the World
Bank board of trustees, will gather public and private funding to
combat the spread of HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa which has
10 percent of the world's population but 70 percent of the world's
AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are calling it the Marshall Plan for AIDS,'' said Sandra
Thurman, director of the AIDS policy office at the White House,
referring to the massive plan for the economic recovery of Europe
after World War II. ''We're looking at a pandemic the likes of
which we have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS kills 6,000 people a day in Africa and has orphaned some 15
percent of children in the worst-affected cities.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has predicted the disease will wipe out half
the teen-age population in some poor African countries. By some
estimates, the disease will lower life expectancy in sub-Saharan
Africa from 59 years in the early 1990s to 45 by 2015.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Hostage Release Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators came tantalizingly close to
freeing 24 hostages from a remote jungle camp Saturday but failed
when the Muslim rebel abductors accused the Philippine military of
preparing to attack once the four-month kidnapping ordeal ends.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine and Libyan negotiators, as well as diplomats from
several Western nations with citizens among the captives, flew to
the violent southern Philippines with high hopes of a release after
three Malaysians and a Filipino were freed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Finnish envoys wept when they heard the negotiating team
had left the Abu Sayyaf rebel camp on Jolo island empty-handed
after the kidnappers offered to release only two hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret to announce that our mission has been
unsuccessful,'' said a grim Robert Aventajado, the chief Philippine
negotiator. ''We have to reassess the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf guerrillas refused to comply with a demand by
Philippine President Joseph Estrada that all hostages be freed in
one group.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they insisted that the captives be released in two
stages to reduce the risk of an army assault, said former Libyan
Ambassador Rajab Azzarouq, a member of the negotiating panel.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, even under the two-stage plan, some hostages would
have been kept back to protect the rebels from attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Further negotiations should take place until we are assured
that the Philippine government will stop any military attacks,''
said a rebel statement read to reporters by Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, a growing number of lawmakers demanded decisive
military action against the Abu Sayyaf, which has demanded $1
million ransom for each Western hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado denied that government troops were poised to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know for fact that the military is keeping their distance,''
he said. ''They are not doing anything because they're giving this
negotiating team as much leeway and as much chance to settle this
problem peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers on Jolo were placed on high alert for Saturday's
expected hostage release, but military officials insisted there
were no troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf group has been holding the three Malaysians, six
French, two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and 13 Filipinos
in primitive mountain huts.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of these remaining hostages were among a larger group
abducted April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort. The rebels later
seized three French journalists, and a dozen Filipino Christian
evangelists who visited their hide-out to pray for the captives.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels offered to release any two Western hostages Saturday,
Aventajado said. However, the negotiators turned down the offer
because it countered Estrada's order to free ''all or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They went there to receive all of the hostages so they would
not take anything less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A tired and disappointed Azzarouq said he would return to Jolo
when the rebels are ready to talk, but gave no time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to come back another day and renegotiate,'' he said,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very sad,'' Malaysian Ambassador Mohamed Arshad M.
Hussain said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the three Malaysians and one Filipino released Friday
were already on their way to freedom and would be picked up by a
Malaysian plane Sunday, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, negotiators said they had reached an agreement on a
guerrilla demand for an additional $1 million ransom payment, but
did not provide details.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $5.5 million was paid last month to the Abu Sayyaf
group for the release of six other Malaysians and a German,
according to military officials. A Filipino woman was released on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Western hostages were to have flown aboard a
Libyan-chartered plane to Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Libya, once accused of arming and training Islamic groups in the
mainly Roman Catholic Philippines, has played a high-profile role
in the negotiations and is believed to be paying millions of
dollars for the hostages' freedom. Libyan officials have insisted
the money will fund development projects in the impoverished region
instead of going directly to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has flown dozens of journalists from the hostages'
countries to Tripoli to cover the expected release. Its effort was
aimed in part at improving its image internationally and burying
past links to terrorism and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily armed Abu Sayyaf rebels claim they want an
independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, but others
say they are merely bandits, using Islamic ideals as cover for
other aims.

<HEADLINE> Enterprising graduate student says he's helping people auction votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TROY, N.Y. (AP) - A graduate student has created a Website
allowing people to illegally promise the highest bidder a vote for
their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these people think it doesn't matter who they vote
for,'' said James Baumgartner, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
behind Voteauction.com. ''For a few of them it will be their first
time voting, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the site was inaccessible. Earlier in the day, the
Schenectady Gazette reported that Tom Wilkey, state Board of
Elections executive director, said both New York and federal laws
prohibit vote sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this is indeed not a joke and not an attempt to make a
political point ... There are laws all over the country against
this,'' Wilkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner said more than 200 people signed up Thursday but no
votes had been auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner, 26, is from Overland Park, Kan. He did not
immediately return a call placed to his home Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Celebrates 54th Birthday  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated a quiet
54th birthday Saturday with his family in the Adirondack Mountains,
careful not to divert attention from Al Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is laying low,'' said Jake Siewert, White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, daughter
Chelsea and family dog Buddy holed up at the home of Arthur Lussi,
a wealthy real estate man who owns area resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meantime, was continuing his Mississippi River boat trip --
and celebrating wife Tipper's 52nd birthday, also Saturday -- on his
first post-convention political trip as the Democratic nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the birthday wishes started long before the actual
day.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, singer Carly Simon sang ''Happy Birthday, Mr.
President'' to him at a party on Martha's Vineyard in
Massachusetts, where he has celebrated his birthday the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   On his way into Lake Placid on Friday, Clinton stopped and got
out along railroad tracks to greet people displaying a sign that
read ''Happy Birthday, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chocolate Labrador was more interested in sniffing the
weeds. ''Come on, Bud,'' Clinton said, getting back in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, he stopped the motorcade again to greet residents
who gave him a weak, and slightly out-of-tune, birthday serenade.
Later that evening, party loyalists broke into a spontaneous
''Happy Birthday to you ...'' at a three-county Democratic Party
picnic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Adirondack Daily Enterprise printed pictures of
birthday greetings drawn by local children. Maria Trumbell of
Saranac Lake, N.Y., wrote: ''Roses are red, violets are blue, blow
out the candles so your wish will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, in Dubuque, Iowa, Gore arranged to have a string
quartet play a birthday greeting as his wife emerged from an
elevator into a hotel lobby. The vice president, daughter Karenna,
and her husband, Drew Schiff, softly sang ''Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh that's nice,'' said a surprised Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A family celebration was planned for late Saturday in Clinton,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton has celebrated one birthday in Washington,
one in Wyoming, four in Massachusetts and two now in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His 49th birthday was marred by sadness over an accident in
Bosnia that killed three top U.S. diplomats trying to broker and
end to the civil war. When he turned 50, Clinton attended a glitzy,
$10 million fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   His next three birthdays were celebrated on Martha's Vineyard
with friends, including actor Ted Danson and golfing partner and
confidant, Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating his 52nd birthday with family was a bit strained: It
came just two days after he publicly apologized to them for an
inappropriate relationship with a young White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This birthday comes five days after his farewell speech at the
Democratic National Convention where he noted his own gray hair and
reminisced: ''I was born in a summer storm to a young widow in a
small Southern town ... .''

<HEADLINE> Riot At Kenya Opposition Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Wielding clubs, stones and bottles, ruling
party activists disrupted an opposition rally Saturday and blocked
the entrance to parliament to keep government critics from
discussing constitutional reform in Kenya. Seven people were
seriously injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the youth wings of the ruling KANU party and the
allied National Development Party stormed the stage where James
Orengo, a member of parliament from the opposition FORD-Kenya
party, was to address a demonstration Saturday morning to demand
that a promised constitutional review process be restarted.
</P>
<P>
   The KANU/NDP militants tore down a tent set up over a platform
at Kamukunji square, prompting members of FORD-Kenya's youth wing
to fight back, throwing stones and bottles. Riot police, wearing
helmets and carrying shields, threw tear gas grenades to break up
the fighting, which then moved into the slums surrounding the
square.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the fighting involved more than 1,000 people.
Similar fighting has broken out almost every time the opposition
tries to stage a rally in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Kenyans will one day be liberated from this
diabolical regime,'' said Mwangi Wa Kibe, a FORD-Kenya activist as
he watched the second round of fighting. ''This act of stopping
this meeting is cowardice and barbaric. ... We are not free, we
don't have security in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   President Daniel arap Moi promised the constitutional review
under pressure from political opponents in 1997. Kenya's 1963
constitution, which has entrenched the ruling Kenya National
African Union party, contains many provisions used by Kenya's
British colonial government to stifle dissent.
</P>
<P>
   But the review process stalled in February 1999 after political
parties and interest groups disagreed over who would be represented
on a 25-member commission that was supposed to oversee the review.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by design or oversight, the law that established the
commission failed to stipulate how political parties and other
interested groups were to share the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Orengo had also planned to discuss a drought that has created
water and electricity shortages throughout the country, as well as
government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial clashes, police commander Nanwel Mwacheche
declared the rally a security threat and ordered the FORD-Kenya
youth to disperse. When they refused, police fired tear gas again,
prompting new fighting. Police said seven people were seriously
injured in the running battle.
</P>
<P>
   One group of KANU/NDP militants, swinging whips over their heads
and carrying large rocks, then went to the parliament building,
where they waited for Orengo and other opposition leaders to try to
go to Kamukunji square.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, the youths of Nairobi, have said today that Orengo should
stop abusing (Moi). He should concentrate on his politics,'' said
an NDP activist outside the parliament building, who would not give
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Police stood by while the KANU/NDP activists threw stones at
opposition leaders' cars and searched vehicles leaving the
compound.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is official state thuggery,'' said Muthusi Kitonga, an
opposition member of parliament accompanying Orengo. ''These people
here were hired by the government to come here and block us from
meeting the people.''

<HEADLINE> Libya Prepared Party for Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A big cake, red and white roses,
mountains of food and a welcome party on board a jet would have
greeted 12 Western hostages had they been freed Saturday by Muslim
guerrillas from a Philippine jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Last-minute snags, however, caused negotiators to fail to win
the release of the foreigners along with 12 Filipino hostages who
have been held by the guerrillas on the impoverished southern
island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Ilyushin plane acquired by Libya was waiting at Cebu
airport in the Philippines to take the 12 Western hostages to
Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was supposed to have been a big celebration on board,''
said a diplomat who was to have traveled with the hostages to
Tripoli. ''Of course, everybody was disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   From the harsh jungle, the hostages immediately would have
tasted the perks of freedom. The four-engine Ilyushin plane was
once used by former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin and is configured
for VIPs, officials said. It has a bedroom, wide seats and medical
equipment for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Envoys from Finland, France, Germany, Libya and South Africa who
were to have escorted the hostages to Tripoli were briefed about
the failed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The expectations were really high at first. Everybody was
looking forward to an end to the crisis,'' the diplomat told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada ordered the negotiators to win the
release of all the hostages in a single group.
</P>
<P>
   But those instructions had raised suspicions of a possible
military attack on the Abu Sayyaf soon after the release.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas later insisted on freeing the hostages in two
batches instead of one to reduce the risk of an army assault.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Moarbes, father of hostage Marie Moarbes, who acquired
French citizenship while in captivity, bought a small teddy bear
for his daughter as a gift. The distraught father returned to
Manila with the gift.

<HEADLINE> Some Russians Feared Worst for Sub  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- When word finally came Saturday that the
men on the sunken submarine Kursk were almost certainly dead, few
people in this navy city were surprised. It was the news they had
been expecting all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have known for a long time that this would happen,'' said
Valentina Boldyreva, a retiree. Like many others discussing the
tragedy Saturday, she had known there was little chance of rescuing
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a waste of time,'' she said sadly. ''It's
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy, which gave wildly contradictory accounts of
the chances of rescuing the 118 men who went down Aug. 12 on the
Kursk, said Saturday there was little hope that anybody could still
be alive. Word had been leaking out for days that the Kursk was
shattered by a huge explosion, and glum-faced navy officers said
most of the crew probably died in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear
submarines in the Russian navy, belonged to the Northern Fleet,
which is headquartered in the Murmansk region above the Arctic
Circle. Relatives of the Kursk's crew, who had been trickling into
Murmansk from all across Russia, were closeted Saturday at a nearby
navy facility.
</P>
<P>
   Murmansk stretches for 11 miles along the Kola Bay, with navy
bases dotting the area. The gray concrete apartment blocks on the
hills are home to many who served in the navy or have friends or
relatives who still serve. For days, they had watched every
television bulletin and exchanged endless rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ramnev, a sailor who knows how heartless the sea can be,
shook his head with contempt when he heard the top brass saying
that hope had run out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expected nothing else. If an explosion happened and there
was no light, there could have been no other outcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples' despair and resignation was mixed Saturday with anger
and disgust about how the government handled the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   Why, people asked, did the government wait so long before
accepting offers of help from Britain and Norway? Help finally
arrived Saturday, a week after the Kursk sank.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was absurd that they were misleading us for so long. It was
clear that if people were not saved in the first two or three days
that they're no longer alive,'' said Galina Klimova, an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin was criticized by the press and many
ordinary people for not interrupting his summer vacation to return
to Moscow to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin's conduct was ludicrous. He looked fresh and well-rested
and talked calmly about ... that we need to support the victims,''
Tatyana Volkov said. ''As if they could be supported at the bottom
of the Barents Sea.''

<HEADLINE> Women learn about shooting, firearms and gun safety  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON JUNCTION, N.J. (AP) - Second Amendment debate was set
aside on Saturday as about 100 women, some invoking the name of
famed shooter Annie Oakley, took to a private firing range here.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced and novice shooters alike gathered for the Women's
Day at the Range to practice what has long been a male-dominated
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said more women than ever are participating in
recreational shooting, adding that the event provides an
opportunity to learn about guns and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most men shoot already, and women don't have a chance to come
to the range,'' said Barbara Matreyek, of Newton, a member of the
Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Club. ''I did it for the
first time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The event featured instructions on gun safety and lessons on
properly shooting a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups rotated among outdoor ranges for shotgun and
handgun target practices, and an indoor range for rifle shooting.
The shotgun range featured moving targets of clay pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Female members of the association talked enthusiastically about
the sport, invoking the name of Annie Oakley and boasting that they
had beaten male shooters in competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gun politics were mostly pushed aside, except for the National
Rifle Association banner and occasional talk about Second Amendment
rights by members and participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're finding many more women are interested in learning about
firearms, so they could make an educated decision for themselves,''
said Michael Bodner, a coordinator of the event and regional vice
president of the association. ''People who are involved in the
sport, they know it's not a male sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodner said the 25,000-member association is about 30 percent
women.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said they came to learn a new sport and become
educated about guns and gun safety.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wells, of Lambertville, said as an employee of the state
Fish Game and Wildlife Division of the Department of Environment
Protection, she frequently works around guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been afraid of guns,'' Wells said. ''So when I
found myself around guns, I figured I should learn about them. In
order to get over the fear, I need to educate myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said she has attended other gun safety courses and plans
to attend a course on gun use next week.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bartling, of Hillsborough, held a gun for the first time
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never shot a gun before,'' Bartling said. ''I support
people's right to bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartling said she was surprised to learn that women are active
in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men and women can do equally well in shooting, which I never
thought about,'' she said. ''Women can actually surpass men's
abilities.''

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers, Palestinians Clash  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Jewish settlers overturned market
stalls, Palestinians hurled stones and Israeli troops fired rubber
bullets in a three-way melee Saturday in this divided town.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence signaled how difficult it could be to carry
out a future peace treaty, including evicting Israelis from
communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said that was the message settlers in Hebron wanted
to send Saturday. ''The settlers want to put pressure on the
Israeli delegation (to the peace talks),'' said Mustafa Natche,
mayor of Hebron, a Palestinian town of 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leader Noam Arnon denied the allegations. He said
Palestinians have been throwing metal objects at settler homes in
recent weeks, and that two women were injured Saturday. Israeli
police said an Arab taxi struck and lightly injured a settler boy.
</P>
<P>
   In response, settlers closed Shuhada Street, a main thoroughfare
that passes by several of their heavily guarded compounds, to
Palestinian traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fistfights erupted, and a group of about 40 to 50 settlers -- the
men wearing skullcaps and white Sabbath shirts -- walked into a
nearby outdoor vegetable market, overturning stalls. Israeli troops
intervened, scuffling with settlers and Palestinian vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes and cucumbers lay scattered on the ground. A
Palestinian woman shopper in a long robe and head scarf held her
hands to protect her head as she was hit by a young settler woman
who cursed her.
</P>
<P>
   Four soldiers pushed a Palestinian man into a van, pulling his
hair. Another soldier kicked a Palestinian with his boots and rifle
butt.
</P>
<P>
   The beatings angered Palestinian bystanders who hurled stones at
soldiers. Troops, in turn, fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Palestinians were hospitalized with injuries from
beatings. An Israeli soldier was also hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Amr, 25, one of the Palestinians involved in the
scuffles, said he would not accept any peace agreement that allowed
the Hebron settlers to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation will always remain tense between us and the
settlers. We cannot live together,'' said Amr.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been vague about his plans
for Hebron. Earlier this year he suggested that he wanted the
settlers to be able to remain indefinitely in the city, the burial
place of biblical patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Israeli media reports have said that in peace
negotiations, Barak was considering setting a limit of 13 to 15
years during which the settlers would have to leave Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he wanted to keep 80 percent of the 200,000
settlers under Israeli rule as part of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he would
declare the conflict with Israel over only after all issues have
been settled, including the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was responding to Barak's statement Thursday that he was
ready to accept Palestinian statehood, provided the Palestinians
proclaimed an end to the conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians face a Sept. 13 deadline to conclude
a peace treaty, and U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is visiting the region
to gauge prospects for a second Mideast summit at which a deal
could be wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, Ross was to meet with the chief Israeli
negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. Earlier in the
day, Ross held talks with Egyptian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Shop accused of selling bootleg cigarettes, goat meat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Two businessmen were accused of repeatedly
toting dead goats into work with them, after a raid on their store
for allegedly selling bootleg cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Shafi Muhammad, 49, and Mohammad Sajid, 20, face misdemeanor
charges including attempting to evade or defeat the state cigarette
tax and possession for sale of both untaxed cigarettes and cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with a search warrant found 55 cartons of ''bidi''
cigarettes with no New York State tax stamp, nearly four pounds of
untaxed tobacco and 2,300 untaxed cigars. Two potentially
counterfeit $20 bills were also seized.
</P>
<P>
   Tax department investigators performing surveillance of the
location said the two also regularly bought dead goats into the
business. The shopkeepers were cited under provisions of the state
Agriculture and Markets law.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture and
Markets said the department would release more details on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Muhammad or Sajid were available for comment Saturday. A
man answering the phone at the market said that the goats were sold
for their meat, which he said was ''perfectly legal.''

<HEADLINE> Authorities charge four from Pa. in deadly shooting that killed another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLINTON, N.J. (AP) - Four Pennsylvania men who were with a fifth
man shot to death during a firefight with a New Jersey police
officer on Friday have been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office on Saturday also
released identities of the suspects, all from Allentown, Pa. Among
them was Oneil T. McKoy, 21. McKoy died at the scene after
authorities said he fired several shots at Human Services Police
Officer Steven Sexton, who had confronted McKoy about three hours
after an earlier firefight with another police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The case began Friday morning about 3:40 a.m. during a routine
traffic stop on County Road 513 in Union Township. Police said
Clinton Patrolman Cory Kubinak asked the driver, Andre O. Warren,
to step out of the vehicle after he couldn't produce any
identification.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger jumped out of the car, fired several shots at the
officer and fled, police said. Warren, 22, also pulled a gun,
running across the road toward a Wal-Mart store as he fired at
Kubinak, who was unhurt. The three remaining passengers ran into a
wooded area near the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Using search dogs and State Police helicopters, police located
three of the passengers in the woods surrounding the Hunterdon
Developmental Center, a 600-patient facility for the mentally
retarded. They were identified as Scott A. Zeiner, 19, and Rayon
McKoy, 19. A 17-year-old boy was unidentified. They each were
charged with unlawful possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Warren was arrested near the Wal-Mart and charged with attempted
murder of a police officer and unlawful possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton, who is assigned to the Hagedorn Gero-Psychiatric
Hospital in nearby Glen Gardner, confronted Oneil McKoy in a
thicket near the institution after a helicopter spotted him, police
said. Police said McKoy fired on the officer after Sexton told him
to freeze and surrender. Sexton returned fire, killing McKoy about
6:30 a.m., police said. That scene was less than a mile from the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton was taken off duty indefinitely with pay, which is
standard procedure, said Human Services agency spokeswoman Laurie
Facciarossa. Sexton had not fired his weapon at a person during his
three years with the force before Friday's incident, and has a
clean discipline record, Facciarossa said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear if the McKoys were related.
</P>
<P>
   Rayon McKoy and Zeiner were being held on $15,000 bail in
Hunterdon County Jail on Saturday. Warren was being held on
$500,000 bail in that jail and also faced cocaine and fugitive
charges. The 17-year-old was being held in the Sussex County
Juvenile Detention Facility.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of high-profile highway
shootings involving law officers.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting of Stanton Crew on Interstate 80 and the
wounding of three young minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike
prompted the state attorney general's office to examine
use-of-force policies and issue new guidelines limiting officers'
ability to fire on moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities declined to prosecute the four
officers who fired at Crew, 31, of Morristown, after a high-speed
police chase on June 2, 1999. The two troopers in the April 1998
turnpike shooting were indicted on attempted murder charges and
await trial.

<HEADLINE> Family sues airline for delivering body late for funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - The family of an Englewood man who died
two years ago has filed a lawsuit against American Airlines,
claiming the carrier is responsible for failing to deliver the
man's body in time for his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Samuel Lorde said Lorde's funeral was postponed
twice because the body arrived in his native Barbados three days
late.
</P>
<P>
   When it did arrive, the body was in such bad condition that the
Barbados funeral home had to touch it up to make it presentable for
the funeral, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was torture all over,'' Lorde's sister-in-law Joan Woods
told The Record of Hackensack for Saturday's editions. ''We were
there and we had to postpone the funeral. I've never heard of
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorde was a machine operator for Marcal Paper in Elmwood Park
for 17 years. He came to the United States with his wife and son in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed this week in Bergen County Superior Court.
It claims Lorde's family suffered ''extensive emotional distress,
mental suffering and anguish,'' but does not demand monetary
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers Funeral Home in Hackensack also was named in the
lawsuit, but the family's lawyer, Larry Stern, said the airline was
responsible for getting the body to Barbados from Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Lorde died Sept. 8, 1998. Relatives called police when Lorde had
trouble breathing and began acting strangely. Police handcuffed him
for control when Lorde began vomiting. He became unconscious and
went into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   He died at the hospital. The Bergen County Medical Examiner's
Office later ruled that Lorde died of heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, the family contacted Conyers Funeral Home to
handle the transfer of the body to Barbados. William Conyers said
he personally delivered the body to an appropriate location at
Newark Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral that was originally scheduled for Sept. 23 finally
took place on Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The body was not on the first flight to Barbados after it
stopped over in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supposedly it was because of inclement weather,'' Woods said.
''I don't know why, because my sister and (Lorde's) daughter
arrived on the same flight that his body was supposed to come it
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The body did not arrive on a second American Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he tried to settle the situation with the carrier,
but the company has refused to deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not deal directly with any individual, so any claims
have to be filed through the funeral home,'' said Jennifer
Pemberton, an airline spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said he fulfilled his part of the funeral contract.

<HEADLINE> First infant turned in under 'safe haven' law  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An infant boy unwanted by his mother was
turned in to the pediatric emergency room at Beth Israel Medical
Center, becoming the first child to given ''safe haven'' under a
new state law, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, temporarily named Michael Doe, was brought to Beth
Israel Medical Center on Thursday evening by a police officer and a
volunteer from an anti-abortion organization. He was two days old
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 8 pounds 7 ounces and just over 21 inches long, the
infant appears to be healthy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Safe Haven Infant Protection Act, less than two
weeks old itself, gives parents - or their surrogates - a way to
surrender unwanted infants younger than 30 days old without fear of
prosecution. Previously, a parent could be charged with endangering
the welfare of a child, a second-degree offense that carries a
penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams, a spokesman for the state Department of Human
Services, said the child likely will be monitored at the hospital
through the weekend, then placed in a home pre-approved for
adoption next week.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the Department of Youth and Family Services, which
has custody of the abandoned boy, does not know the identity of the
mother and will not seek to learn it.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the baby is in good condition, the mother is
guaranteed anonymity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birthright, an Atlanta-based anti-abortion group, became
involved with the infant after a call to its 800 number. Terry
Weaver, the group's national director, said the group promises
anonymity to the women it helps and declined to discuss its
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our whole purpose is to help girls and women with problem
pregnancies,'' he told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's
editions. ''We promise confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Anthony Bucco, R-Morris, said the law worked exactly
as it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's doing what it's supposed to do: giving the opportunity to
the birth mother to give up the child no questions asked.'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect Aug. 7, was modeled after one passed
first in Texas and now in place in a dozen states and motivated by
several cases of child abandonment and death.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, six babies have been found abandoned in New
Jersey. One of them, a newborn boy found lying amid litter near
Paterson railroad tracks, later died.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known case of fatal child abandonment was the
infant who died in 1996 after North Jersey teen couple Amy
Grossberg and Brian Peterson threw him into a trash bin outside a
Delaware motel.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Favored in Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZINACANTAN, Mexico (AP) -- Jose Garcia says he was twice hauled
out of political meetings, thrown into jail and beaten for opposing
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, long the object of enforced
faith in this town tucked in the lush green forests of Chiapas
state.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he may be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico's first gubernatorial election since Vicente Fox's
stunning presidential victory July 2, an eight-party coalition --
including Fox's National Action Party -- is favored in polls to
topple the Institutional Revolutionary Party in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
had easily won every presidential election since its creation in
1929. And Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, was recently the
party's strongest of strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI often won 90 percent of the vote here. Creative rural
officials have sometimes managed a turnout of more than 100
percent, and Indian towns often hold mass meetings to agree to vote
for the PRI. Those who vary from the party line can suffer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 49, was among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would always work us over a little,'' he recalls. But
times have changed, and today a campaign sticker beside the door of
his carpentry shop openly promotes Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Marino Perez Arias, a leader of the Democratic Revolution Party
in Zinacantan, showed a reporter photos of the ruins of his house.
It was burned in 1996 because, he said, he had abandoned the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is fighting to keep its hold on Chiapas. The party has
brought in a dozen governors to campaign for its candidate, Sami
David, in hopes of halting a rapid decline of its once all-powerful
nationwide political machine.
</P>
<P>
   The local press -- much of it dependent on government aid -- has
fiercely attacked opposition candidate Pablo Salazar, accusing him
of promoting violence and forging academic credentials. Several
leading newspapers regularly carry unedited PRI news releases as
front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result Sunday, it will reverberate throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has said a coalition victory could help renew peace talks
with the Zapatista National Revolutionary Army, which staged a
rebellion in 1994 to demand greater justice and democracy for
Chiapas' poor Indians. Though open warfare lasted only two weeks,
the guerrilla presence in the state's jungle canyons has led to
repeated clashes between emboldened dissident groups and
pro-government forces.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar has vowed to crack down on paramilitary groups here. He
claims the groups were encouraged by the outgoing national
government as a way to fight the rebels without risking
international outrage at an army attack on lightly armed Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The government ''fell into the temptation of having the society
fight the insurgency. How? By arming the society itself. It is a
grave error,'' he said in an interview this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said his election would be only one element in bringing
peace to the state. Fox has promised another key move: passage of
constitutional amendments for greater Indian rights agreed upon in
principle with the Zapatistas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas accepted a law that federal legislators,
including Salazar, drew up to enact those accords. But the PRI
government rejected the plan, saying the scope of Indian autonomy
threatened Mexico's sovereignty. Peace talks stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say Fox's victory and a possible Salazar win could
prove to the rebels that peaceful change is possible, although
Fox's business-oriented economics are anathema to the Marxist
ideology that helped inspire the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Silvia Gomez Tagle of the elite College of
Mexico said the rebellion helped make a competitive election
possible. Dissident groups that had long fought for benefits as
part of the PRI system began to consider opposing the party, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the revolt, with its call for greater democracy,
helped prod the government into national political reforms --
notably a citizen-dominated electoral board that aided Fox's
victory. For Sunday's election, Chiapas also has a
citizen-dominated electoral commission that has spurned PRI demands
that it avoid quick announcements of results.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the vote could be violent.
</P>
<P>
   So many polls have shown Salazar leading that a defeat would
surely raise cries of fraud among his backers. David was briefly
knocked unconscious by an unidentified object thrown at him when he
appeared at a rally recently in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Salazar said he was warned that outgoing Gov.
Roberto Albores Guillen was planning to scuttle the election with
massive irregularities, then maneuver himself into another term as
interim governor. Outright re-election is banned in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's victory has softened the hard line of many PRI
stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Pablo wins, we won't be worried. We will have to work with
him,'' said Zinacantan's PRI chairman, Andres Sanchez Perez.

<HEADLINE> General Electric plans corporate aviation center at Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) - Talks of a General Electric Co.
corporate aviation center at Stewart International Airport are
nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations are finished, GE is expected to build a
95,000-square-foot hangar and related buildings on 11 acres at the
airport 55 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The $24 million plan will create about 200 construction jobs for
a year then add 80 full-time jobs to the area economy. Most of the
jobs will be filled from existing GE staff who will relocate from
GE's existing facility at Westchester County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's very little left to be resolved,'' said Kiran Jain,
spokeswoman for Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is seen as another step in revitalizing the airport and
the Hudson Valley, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   When the state took over Stewart in 1970 after the U.S. Air
Force deactivated its base there, it was hoped it would become the
alternative airport for the massive New York City market. It never
happened. Passenger flights declined and critics claimed the
airport failed to reach its potential under the state's
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 1, the state handed the airport over to the
National Express Group, a private company that has a 99-year lease
to try to reverse the decline.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Leading by 6 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore left the Democratic National
Convention with increasing evidence that he's getting a ''bounce''
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll of registered voters out Saturday put Democratic
nominee Gore ahead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush with 48 percent
compared to Bush at 42 percent. Bush was ahead by 11 points in the
same poll after the Republican National Convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a week or more to know whether Gore gets a
meaningful post-convention boost in the polls. But several early
surveys suggest the vice president will get enough of a gain to
make the campaign very competitive as it heads into the final two
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters
released Friday had Gore within 5 points of Bush, 45 percent to 40
percent. When polls are screened to likely voters, Republicans
often fare better because of the more reliable voting habits of
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the GOP nominee, had an 18-point lead in the tracking poll
after the GOP convention, and was 11 points up as recently as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore performed strongly in the Newsweek poll on most measures,
with almost half the people surveyed saying his convention speech
made them feel more favorably toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was viewed as stronger on the issues of the economy,
abortion, the environment, Social Security, education and even
taxes - an area where Bush has traditionally been stronger.
Significantly, Gore got about the same response on his leadership
abilities as Bush, an area where Gore had been lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning aboard a riverboat on the Mississippi River, Gore
joked when he heard about the Newsweek poll: ''I'm beginning to
think that polls have a little more relevance as we get closer to
the election.'' But he quickly added, ''I think there's too much
attention paid to polls. ... They go up and down and sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the surge in poll numbers after a political convention
can evaporate as quickly as it appears. Polls are likely to vary
considerably as public opinion starts to settle a bit after the
high-profile nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The Battleground tracking poll of 1,000 likely voters was taken
Wednesday and Thursday nights and has a 3 percentage point error
margin. The Newsweek poll of 806 people was taken Thursday and
Friday and has an error margin of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC News overnight poll showed the race virtually even,
though such polls are sometimes more a measure of emotional
reaction to big events than a gauge of settled public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the crucial state-by-state race for electoral votes, Bush has
had a clear lead or an edge in many battleground states in the
Midwest, including some that should be pro-Democratic. If Gore's
national numbers rise appreciably in the coming weeks, it could
indicate some of these states will be very competitive.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Head Talks of Child Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By CARLOS GONZALEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An army unit's fatal shooting of six
children on a school hike in the mountains this week should not
reflect badly on Colombia's human rights record, the military
contends.
</P>
<P>
   In comments late Friday, Defense Minister Luis Ramirez said
Tuesday's shooting of children by troops who may have mistaken them
for guerrillas was possibly nothing more than ''human error.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is not really a human rights issue, Ramirez added,
because ''there was no intention on the part of members of the
armed forces to cause harm to civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez appeared intent on blunting the impact of the killings
in Washington, which has conditioned a $1.3 billion aid plan for
Colombia on human rights progress.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers fired at the school group on Tuesday in Antioquia
State, killing the youths and prompting nationwide outrage in the
South American country immersed in a 36-year guerrilla conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials initially insisted the children, the youngest
of whom was six, had stumbled into a crossfire with leftist rebels.
Eyewitnesses and family members of the slain children questioned
that claim and guerrillas denied they had fighters in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, human rights monitors, and the military announced
separate inquiries. An army investigator announced Friday he was
suspending 41 officers and soldiers pending a thorough probe.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking alongside Ramirez on Friday, Armed Services chief Gen.
Fernando Tapias said any of his men would give their lives to bring
the children back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The military is set to receive the bulk of the $1.3 billion
anti-drug package approved by the U.S. Congress in June.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the package, President Clinton is required to
certify that the Colombian military's poor human rights record is
improving before he disburses the aid.
</P>
<P>
   The law contains an escape clause, however, allowing Clinton,
who is scheduled to visit Colombia on Aug. 30, to release the funds
as a matter of national security even if no such progress exists on
human rights.

<HEADLINE> Pope's Youth Day Draws 2M to Rome  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A sprawling, sweating campground with more than 2
million swaying, practically delirious fans of Pope John Paul II
sprang up Saturday on Rome's outskirts, nuns settling in beside
faithful in bikinis for a prayer service with the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old pope arrived by helicopter just as a fat, red
sun sank above the hilly grounds of the Tor Vergata university
campus, where the crowd had gathered for World Youth Day
celebrations. The temperature started cooling down from readings
that reached 100 degrees earlier in the day when pilgrims were
streaming in, almost all by foot, after walking as far as nine
miles.
</P>
<P>
   The pope smiled broadly and two youths supported his arms as he
shuffled slowly to his ''popemobile,'' which drove him to center
stage for the celebration. He was due to head home before midnight,
but most of the faithful were planning to bed down for the night in
sleeping bags, waiting for him to return early Sunday morning for a
farewell Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it hard to believe in the third millennium?'' the pope
asked the crowd. ''Yes! It is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As some couples in the crowd kissed or cuddled, John Paul
acknowledged the difficulties of following church teaching against
sex before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard, but with the help of grace it can be done,'' the
pontiff, winding down a speech that was frequently interrupted by
cheering, singing and shouts of ''long live the pope.'' At one
point the pope shot back, ''John Paul Two, he loves you!''
</P>
<P>
   In another moment, a young woman in a T-shirt broke through
security to embrace the pope, her head resting affectionately
against his for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're well over 2 million people,'' Mayor Francesco Rutelli
said at the ceremony. The number, based on surveys from police
helicopters, was almost double the Vatican's estimate at the start
of World Youth Day events on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the sun scorched the grounds while fire hoses, fans and
fainting tents worked to relieve countless young pilgrims overcome
by heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''That. Feels. So. Goooood,'' said Katy Rothman of Somers, N.Y.,
reveling under the blast of spray that greeted the young woman
after a three-hour walk to the campus outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   World Youth Day -- back in Rome this year, after starting there
under John Paul 15 years ago -- fell on what forecasters projected
as the hottest weekend of the year. Hundreds of pilgrims had been
treated at the campus by early evening, most overcome by the Roman
sun and Mediterranean humidity.
</P>
<P>
   More than a score of faithful needed hospitalization, a few of
them for seizures or heart problems, doctors said, but nearly all
the heat cases recovered after a half-hour in air conditioned
''fainting tents'' with friends and nurses fanning them.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, young people stripped down to shorts and bikinis
around gushing hydrants, splashing in welling mud pools. Woodstock
comparisons seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hot, and I'm going to get wet anyway,'' said Dina Focina,
22, waving a hand at her two-piece.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoors vigil and Mass close a six-day slate of events that
brought the hordes of young Catholic pilgrims to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The young people came from some 160 countries, sleeping in
convents, schools, hotels and private homes around Rome after
months of fund-raising and saving for plane or train tickets. Rome,
for its part, was emptied of perhaps two-thirds of its 3 million
people for Italy's traditional mid-August beach break.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers said organizers of Sunday's Mass were having to break
communion wafers into pieces, caught short despite long shifts by
baker nuns.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul started Youth Days in 1985, seeking to inspire young
Catholics as other faiths gained followers in much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest crowd in John Paul's papacy was a World Youth Day
gathering in 1995, which drew some 4 million people in the
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw To Stop Using Reagan Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A Republican congressional candidate
has agreed to a request by the staff of Ronald Reagan to stop using
a photo of the former president in campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial showing Ander Crenshaw and Reagan together ran on
cable systems this past week. Crenshaw was a co-chairman for
Reagan's 1980 and 1984 Florida campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagans do not want to imply they are endorsing one
Republican over another in a primary, Joanne Drake, chief of staff
for Reagan's office, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's staff sent a letter to the Crenshaw campaign Tuesday
that said such photographs ''are strictly meant for personal use
and never for solicitation, campaign or marketing purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's campaign manager, Foyt Ralston, said the photo will
be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston said the photo was intended to demonstrate the
Jacksonville investment banker's commitment to the Republican
Party, not to imply an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw is seeking the GOP nomination to run for the seat being
vacated by four-term Rep. Tillie Fowler, the top-ranking Republican
woman in the House.

Russia Admits Sailors Probably Dead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted today that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, just hours before
Western teams joined efforts to reach the vessel in the Arctic depths. Most of
the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes of the disaster, when a
massive explosion shattered the vessel Aug. 12 and it slammed into the bottom of
the sea, and any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled with water,
officials said.

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A class-action lawsuit accuses Ford Motor Co. of risking
thousands of lives with an intentionally confusing recall of defective tires,
claiming Ford's recall is so complicated it discourages motorists from replacing
dangerous tires. ''Everybody is getting some sort of runaround,'' said attorney
Stanley Chesley, who filed the lawsuit yesterday. Ford announced the recall Aug.
9 of 6.5 million P235/75R15 size radial ATX and ATX II brands, as well as
Wilderness AT tires of the same size made at a plant in Decatur, Ill., by
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. The tires are mostly on Ford trucks and sport utility
vehicles.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Jose Maria Olazabal moved into contention in the PGA
Championship in spectacular fashion today with a 9-under 63, tying the lowest
score ever in a major champion. Olazabal, even par to start the third round at
Valhalla Golf Club and 11 strokes behind Tiger Woods, had a chance to break the
record until his approach into the par-5 18th landed on the wrong side of a
ridge and he two-putted from about 35 feet for par. Olazabal is the 19th player
to record a 63 in a major.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - An infant boy unwanted by his mother was
turned in to the pediatric emergency room at Beth Israel Medical
Center in Newark, becoming the first child to given ''safe haven''
under a new state law, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, temporarily named Michael Doe, was brought to the
hospital on Thursday evening by a police officer and a volunteer
from an anti-abortion organization. He was two days old at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing 8 pounds 7 ounces and just over 21 inches long, the
infant appears to be healthy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Safe Haven Infant Protection Act, less than two
weeks old itself, gives parents - or their surrogates - a way to
surrender unwanted infants younger than 30 days old without fear of
prosecution. Previously, a parent could be charged with endangering
the welfare of a child, a second-degree offense that carries a
penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Williams, a spokesman for the state Department of Human
Services, said the child likely will be monitored at the hospital
through the weekend, then placed in a home pre-approved for
adoption next week.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the Department of Youth and Family Services, which
has custody of the abandoned boy, does not know the identity of the
mother and will not seek to learn it.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the baby is in good condition, the mother is
guaranteed anonymity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Birthright, an Atlanta-based anti-abortion group, became
involved with the infant after a call to its 800 number. Terry
Weaver, the group's national director, said the group promises
anonymity to the women it helps and declined to discuss its
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our whole purpose is to help girls and women with problem
pregnancies,'' he told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's
editions. ''We promise confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Anthony Bucco, R-Morris, said the law worked exactly
as it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's doing what it's supposed to do: giving the opportunity to
the birth mother to give up the child no questions asked.'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which took effect Aug. 7, was modeled after one passed
first in Texas and now in place in a dozen states and motivated by
several cases of child abandonment and death.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, six babies have been found abandoned in New
Jersey. One of them, a newborn boy found lying amid litter near
Paterson railroad tracks, later died.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known case of fatal child abandonment was the
infant who died in 1996 after North Jersey teen couple Amy
Grossberg and Brian Peterson threw him into a trash bin outside a
Delaware motel.

<HEADLINE> Body found in search for kayaker in swollen Musconetcong River  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOLLAND TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Police may have found the body of
a Pennsylvania kayaker missing since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found Saturday morning about 1&AMP;frac12; miles south of the
Milford/Upper Black Eddy bridge, on the New Jersey side, said John
Harris of the Holland Township Police Department. The bridge
connects to Pennsylvania over the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said authorities had not positively identified the
corpse, which had been in the water for at least three days. But he
said the clothing on the man matched the description given by
searchers.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives had not yet identified the body and the Hunterdon
medical examiner was scheduled to perform an autopsy on Monday,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers found the kayak belonging to 58-year-old Charles
Weaver of Riegelsville, Pa., on the river Wednesday. Witnesses said
he entered the roiling, muddy water and was thrown about before
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   The site where the body was found is about seven miles from the
point where the Musconetcong River empties into the Delaware River.
The Musconetcong at the time of Weaver's disappearance had swollen
after rains pummeled northwestern New Jersey last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Authorities ID Paramus corpse as woman from Paterson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) - A woman found next to a trash bin in the
rear parking lot of a strip mall died from numerous stab wounds,
Bergen County prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of April Caine, 21, of Paterson, was found at about
7:40 a.m. on Friday. An employee of Fidelity Investments found the
body when he walked behind the plaza to one of the trash bins.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said several people who work in the plaza, located in
the 500 block of Route 17 south, told authorities they did not see
a body there on Thursday night. It could have been there for up to
10 hours, said Bergen County Assistant Prosecutor James V.
Santulli.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors on Saturday said they were treating the death as an
''apparent homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen County Medical Center conducted an autopsy on
Saturday, saying Caine died of blood loss from multiple stab
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   A crowbar was found beneath the body. It wasn't known if the
tool was connected with the death. Authorities also said a pair of
sweat pants Caine was wearing had been pulled down.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they didn't know if the woman had been killed
in the lot or if her body had been dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   The lot borders a residential neighborhood, which is separated
by a thick line of pine trees.

<HEADLINE> No ruckus, no fuss, Indian mascot just fades away  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LEBANON, N.Y. (AP) - In some school districts across the
state, dropping an Indian nickname or mascot has led to angry
words, protests and even physical confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in this district 25 miles southeast of Albany where
district officials quietly decided to drop its decades-old Indian
mascots partly because the school is building a new gym and doesn't
want to lay down an Indian symbol then be directed to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be horrible to put down a new gym floor only to have
to pull it back up again,'' said school board president Jeanette
Linville.
</P>
<P>
   Linville said the board has discussed the issue every month for
about a year with nary a word of opposition. That, combined with a
State Education Department survey that showed 90 percent of leaders
of Native American tribes would like schools to stop using Indians
as mascots, was enough for New Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognized that symbols that may not have been thought to
have been offensive really are and we aren't interested in having
that affect our education efforts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linville also said the State Education Department is likely to
direct schools to drop Indian mascots within five years. A call to
the education department Saturday was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The school probably will let its 650 students pick a new mascot
within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The issue flared in the early 1990s when opposition mounted
against the use of Native Americans as mascots for pro teams like
the Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians and Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   At schools around the country, team names and logos were under
scrutiny. While some school district officials defended the use of
the mascots, saying they honored the tribes and their culture,
others said they were trying to gradually do away with the symbols
because they degraded or stereotyped Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In Canajoharie - a central New York community - the community
was so upset about losing its ''Redskins'' nickname, it voted to
have no mascot at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ulster County district of Onteora, the meetings were
boisterous, numerous votes were held, a school board election
revolved around the issue and there was even a shoving match
between supporters and opponents of the mascot.
</P>
<P>
   New York is especially prone to such controversies, given its
rich Indian heritage. The Cayugas, Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas and
Senecas - five nations of the original Iroquois Confederacy - are
among the tribes indigenous to the state, which is home to several
reservations.

Poll Shows Gore Leading by 6 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore left the Democratic National Convention with
increasing evidence that he's getting a ''bounce'' in the polls, as a Newsweek
poll of registered voters out today put Democratic nominee Gore ahead of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush. Gore had 48 percent compared to Bush's 42 percent. Bush was
ahead by 11 points in the same poll after the Republican National Convention two
weeks ago. It may take a week or more to know whether Gore gets a meaningful
post-convention boost in the polls, but several early surveys suggest the vice
president will get enough of a gain to make the campaign very competitive as it
heads into the final two months.

areas where cancerous lesions were removed earlier this month. The surgery at
the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix followed tests that found no signs that
McCain's melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, had spread to other
areas of his body. Doctors also planned to test lymph nodes near the lesion on
McCain's temple. The surgery lasted more than five hours, and McCain was
recovering in the hospital this afternoon, McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives. McCain
planned to remain in the hospital overnight.

Russia Admits Sailors Probably Dead

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted today that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British
mini-sub and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in
the Arctic depths. What little hope remained for any survivors was pinned on the
new arrivals. The Norwegian team approached the site after midnight, but would
reportedly not start their dive until after dawn -- apparently to avoid diving
in darkness. Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes of
the disaster, when a massive explosion shattered the vessel Aug. 12 and it
slammed into the bottom of the sea, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said.

<HEADLINE> Russians in Iraq Without U.N. OK  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A Russian humanitarian delegation landed in
Baghdad's newly reopened international airport without U.N.
approval Saturday amid Iraqi hopes of more visits from abroad
following last week's defiant trip by Venezuela's president.
</P>
<P>
   Russia insisted that, since it was a humanitarian mission, the
flight did not violate U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990,
which include an air embargo -- an interpretation the United States
and other countries have disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not asked the United Nations for approval. ... We just
informed the U.N.,'' Russian Deputy Emergency Situations Minister
Ruslan Salikov told reporters after disembarking from the plane.
''We are on a humanitarian mission so we do not need approval for
the permission to fly into Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian plane landed Saturday evening at Saddam
International Airport, bearing a 35-member delegation from Russia's
Emergency Situations Ministry, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported. They will be in Iraq for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Past flights bearing humanitarian aid into Iraq have sought
waivers from the U.N. committee enforcing the sanctions on Iraq.
However, France and Russia, considered Iraq's strongest ally on the
council, say waivers are not needed for non-commercial flights,
while the United States and Britain insist they are.
</P>
<P>
   Salikov said his ministry plans more flights to Iraq in the
future. ''We have the right to fly to any place we want without
permission from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam International Airport reopened Thursday for the first
time since the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War -- part of Iraq's push
to end its international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has not seen commercial flight hours since the war,
although some humanitarian flights have used it since.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq hopes the airport will welcome other foreign visitors in
coming months. Indonesian President Abdurrhman Wahid has said he
would visit Baghdad soon, and Iraqi newspapers have reported that
French activists opposed to the sanctions plan an embargo-busting
flight to Baghdad next month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez became the first
head of state to come to Iraq since the war. Chavez, who entered
Iraq by car to respect the flight ban, was condemned by Washington
as bestowing undue credibility on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, has repeatedly pushed for the early lifting of sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions say the sanctions are to remain in place until
Baghdad complies with demands to dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Gore: I Will Clean Environment  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Iowa (AP) -- His borrowed campaign boat sandwiched by
the lush greenery of the Mississippi riverbanks, Al Gore told rural
Iowans Saturday that he's the one who will fight for the
environment -- not Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clean air and clean water are good for our families, good for
our future and I'll fight for it. The other side gives in to the
big polluters,'' said the Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, on Day Two of his of his four-day, 400-mile excursion down
the storied river, passed the hours aboard the paddle-wheeler
''Mark Twain'' with card game hijinks and birthday festivities for
wife Tipper, who turned 52.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop there were dockside rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Before shoving off in Dubuque, Gore told a crowd of some 2,000
enthusiasts that Bush, the Texas governor, had proven by his record
that he is no environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we reflect on the importance of clean water and clean
air, I reflect on the battles that are necessary in order to keep
it that way,'' said Gore, in a voice husky with overuse and
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent does not reflect that commitment in what's going
on in his home state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also suggested that Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
both former oil company executives, would not ''be willing to stand
up to the oil companies and the big polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston was crowned the nation's smog capital in 1999, and Texas
led the nation in toxic emission between 1995, after Bush was
inaugurated, and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that Al Gore is drifting off course when it comes
to the facts about Governor Bush and the environment,'' Bush
spokesman Dan Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas annually has more toxic releases from industry than
any other states because of its high concentration of petrochemical
plants, Bartlett said the state also has led the nation in
reductions in such emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The state cut emission by 43 million pounds from 1995 to 1998,
according to the Environmental Protection Agency, or about 14
percent compared to 5.3 percent nationally. Still, 23 states had
better performance than Texas on a percentage basis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to use his slowly snaking riverboat trip through
Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Missouri as a way to build momentum
bursting out of his nominating convention. Aides maintain it's
working. His small-town crowds have been large and enthusiastic.
Media attention has been heavy.
</P>
<P>
   In Bellevue, better than half of the town's 2,485 residents
turned out for a dinnertime rally. I feel a lot of enthusiasm in
the crowds,'' he said in a radio interview with CBS News. ''That's
fun. It feels real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly ceding the region, Bush was planning his own campaign
swing through Iowa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore got good news from a Newsweek poll out Saturday that showed
him leading Bush 48 percent to 42 percent among registered voters
with a 4 percentage point error margin. An earlier poll of likely
voters gave Bush an edge.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the Newsweek poll, Gore joked: ''I'm beginning to
think that polls have a little more relevance as we get closer to
the election.'' But he quickly added: ''I think there's too much
attention paid to polls. ... They go up and down and sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than two weeks of nonstop campaigning, Gore
appeared energetic and frisky.
</P>
<P>
   Told that reporters in the lower deck were playing a dice game
for a pile of dollar bills, Gore popped down and pretended to be
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you see what they're doing on your boat?'' he asked Sandy
Terry, the captain's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a casino boat,'' she replied a bit nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now,'' Gore laughed.
</P>
<P>
   He and Mrs. Gore had a private dinner party on the upper deck.
The night's final stop, in Clinton, was designated a birthday party
for Mrs. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's route was taking him past the Rock Island Arsenal in
Illinois, where thousands of workers have lost their jobs because
of defense cuts.

<P>
   The Bush campaign trotted out Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who
blamed the Clinton-Gore administration for the job losses.
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal is one of only two remaining Army weapons factories
in the country. The arsenal layoffs have been blamed on decisions
by the Pentagon to use more private contractors because of budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley called on Gore to stop at the arsenal and pledge to
protect its 1,200 current jobs. But there are no plans for such a
visit. Instead, Gore kept to his environment message.

<HEADLINE> 3,500 told to boil water after E. coli discovered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - About 3,500 residents in two Broome
County localities will have to boil drinking water until at least
Monday after samples showed traces of the E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just taking precautions,'' County Executive Jeffrey P.
Kraham said of the order issued in Port Dickinson and Hillcrest.
''We're not overly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   One strain of E. coli, 0157:H7, can cause flu-like cramping and
diarrhea, although it occasionally can be fatal to the elderly and
young children. The county was unable to determine which strain of
E. coli it was dealing with so it erred on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old Town of Binghamton girl is hospitalized in Syracuse
with an illness the county health department has linked 0157:H7,
but her condition is not believed to be linked to the water
supplies where E. coli was found. The county is still looking for
the source of the E. coli that sickened the girl and four other
children in her extended family.

<HEADLINE> British TV Crew Charged With Spying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Four journalists filming a documentary
for British television in Liberia were charged with espionage on
Saturday after they were arrested from their hotel room the night
before, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed after authorities reviewed their
videotapes and found material that was ''damaging'' to the Liberian
government and the security of the state, Justice Minister
Eddington Varmah told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists -- two Britons, a South African and a Sierra
Leonean, all of whom worked for London-based Insight News
Television -- were arrested late Friday at their Monrovia hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Varmah declined to comment further on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what punishment the journalists
could face if convicted. They had been in Liberia for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Britain's Channel 4, which had commissioned the
documentary, said the network was ''deeply concerned about the
welfare of those involved, but fully confident that they are in the
country on the correct visas and with permission from the Ministry
of Interior in Liberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 spokesman Matt Baker said in London that the filming
was for a three-part documentary was to look at Liberia,
Mauritania, Mali and Angola. The arrested crew included Sierra
Leonean cameraman Sorious Samura, who had been honored for his film
''Out of Africa'' about the 1999 war in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Paul Mulbah said police found information that
''raised eyebrows'' during a search of the journalists' rooms, but
did not elaborate. ''We acted professionally and legitimately by
first obtaining a court warrant before effecting the arrest,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   British and American officials have accused Liberian President
Charles Taylor's government of being the main conduit for diamonds
smuggled out of Sierra Leone by that nation's rebel army, the
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a former warlord in Liberia's seven-year civil war,
which ended in 1996, has long-standing ties to the Sierra Leonean
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Show Off Busy Schedules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESILLA, N.M. (AP) -- While George Bush talked about education
and Al Gore the environment, their campaigns Saturday skirmished
over another hot topic: which candidate is running harder.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan started it all after a reporter
asked why Bush had only one event Friday and none scheduled for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That sent McClellan to the scheduling charts. He quickly came up
with a list of Bush activities after the GOP convention that he
insisted showed Bush working harder.
</P>
<P>
   After the GOP gathering in Philadelphia, Gore over five days
made 22 stops in five states that represent 138 electoral votes,
beamed McClellan to reporters. Bush took two days off.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Gore's people to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Gore was on four-day 400-mile trip down the
Mississippi River and will follow that with more campaigning.
Altogether there will be 20 events in six states, representing 86
electoral votes, over seven days, said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is Al Gore who works 24/7 and George W. Bush whose
lightweight schedule is matched only by his lightweight agenda,''
chided Lehane. And, he added, Gore's not taking two days off.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Head Speaks for Detainees  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHIAM, Lebanon (AP) -- The leader of the Hezbollah guerrillas
warned Saturday that his group would do ''anything and everything''
to recover prisoners still languishing in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, speaking at a rally to express
solidarity with former detainees, also called on Palestinians to
follow the Lebanese example of resisting Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah spoke to more than 10,000 supporters of the Islamic
militant group on a soccer field in the southern Lebanese village
of Khiam. Nineteen vacant plastic chairs were lined up across the
stage, representing prisoners still held in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let the (Israeli) enemy and the whole word hear us: We will do
anything and everything to fill these chairs, ... no matter what
the price or sacrifice,'' Nasrallah warned.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Israeli military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul
Mofaz, said the army has information that Hezbollah is planning
attacks across the Israeli border and against Israeli targets
abroad after Lebanese parliamentary elections, slated for Aug. 27
and Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is fielding several candidates in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Israeli reports, Nasrallah said Saturday the
guerrillas will keep the Israelis guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has in the past fired rockets on northern Israel. But
since Israeli forces withdrew from southern Lebanon on May 24,
there have been no cross-border attacks, except for the throwing of
stones and firebombs across a border fence by Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli pullout, Hezbollah and the Lebanese government
have demanded the release of two guerrilla leaders as well as about
dozen other Lebanese held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the bearded, black-turbaned Nasrallah paid a
visit to the notorious former Khiam prison, which was run by
Israel's Lebanese militia allies during the occupation of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups had charged the prison was the site of
torture and detention without trial before it was abandoned as
Israel withdrew from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Nasrallah urged the Lebanese government to
compensate former detainees for the years they spent in Khiam. He
also suggested they be integrated into the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah, whose group fought Israeli troops in southern Lebanon
before they withdrew after 18 years of occupation, called on
Palestinians to rise up and learn from Hezbollah's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinian people should benefit from this historic and
golden opportunity to recover their land with blood -- not through
negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting that his group will not be content with Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Nasrallah said the liberation marks
the beginning of a new era in fighting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This victory will not be the only one. It will be the title of
the coming stage'' in Lebanon and the Palestinian areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hamm Twins Make US Gymnastics Team  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Olympics will be double the fun for Paul and
Morgan Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old twin brothers from Wisconsin parlayed their
steady upward climb into a stunning surprise Saturday in the
Olympic trials, becoming the first twins to make the U.S. Olympic
gymnastics team.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them in Sydney will be five-time defending national
champion Blaine Wilson, 1997 junior national champion Sean
Townsend, 1996 hard-luck gymnast Stephen McCain and 30-year-old
John Roethlisberger, who wept openly when he heard his name called
-- his performance good enough to send him to a third Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Going as an alternate is Jamie Natalie, the NCAA champion who
finished fifth in the overall scoring but apparently couldn't match
Roethlisberger for experience or Morgan Hamm for versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, Paul Hamm, Townsend and McCain finished first through
fourth in the two-day competition, where scores were combined with
those at U.S. nationals to determine four automatic slots.
</P>
<P>
   The final two spots were chosen by the men's selection
committee, headed by coach Peter Kormann.
</P>
<P>
   The committee gave one to Roethlisberger, despite his
seventh-place finish. He will become the sixth American male
gymnast to compete in three Olympics. The final spot went to
sixth-place finisher Morgan Hamm for his excellence on the floor
and vault. Left out was Natalie, a high-bar specialist who didn't
show the same consistency in other events.
</P>
<P>
   Whether intentionally or not, the committee also gave men's
gymnastics huge potential for a surge in popularity. After years in
the shadows of the women's program, the men have a pair of
all-American, freckle-faced teen-agers who look like a Wheaties box
waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   But it's big, powerful routines, not good looks, that have
brought the Hamms to the forefront in a shorter time than most
people expected.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hamm has always been a bit ahead of Morgan, and in two
dominating days at trials, he looked every bit the Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   On high bar, he executed a near flawless move called a Kovacs,
where he hurdled himself off the bar, then did two backward
somersaults to cross back over and catch the bar on the same side
he started. He scored a 9.775.
</P>
<P>
   His pommel horse was fluid and powerful, legs circling every
inch of the apparatus without a single break. He scored a 9.850 --
the highest score of the day on the horse -- and jogged off the mat
with a quick clap of his hands, a touch of emotion to break through
the icy-steel nerves he has shown all week.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Hamm had nothing sealed coming into the finals, sitting
in sixth and needing to shine for a wildcard spot. His vault in the
day's fifth rotation may have sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinting down the runway, he exploded off the springboard, then
did a handspring off the vault and somersaulted with a 1&AMP;frac12; twist to
a landing. He committed a small bobble there, but slapped hands
with his coach, Stacy Maloney, knowing he was one step closer to
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Roethlisberger's day was a study in relief. For the first time
since the qualifying process began, he didn't bobble a routine. All
his scores were 9.400 or better. During his floor exercise -- a
disaster in three previous meets -- he was smiling before he even
finished his last tumbling pass.
</P>
<P>
   After his final routine, the still rings, he waved at the crowd
with his right hand, then lifted his left fist before exchanging a
long hug with his dad and coach, Fred. He then suffered through a
15-minute period during which the committee gave him a four-week
extension on his decade-long career.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was his usual self, winning the meet with a clinching
rings performance worth 9.95 points. He celebrated with his first
fist pump of the day, a hug for coach Ron Brant and a salute to the
crowd, full of young girls with his name painted on their arms,
faces and backs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain earned his spot after a four-year soul-searching journey,
brought on by his flop in the 1996 trials. He traveled to South
Africa to avoid the Atlanta Games, then rededicated himself to a
sport that nearly ruined his life.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend finally cashed in on the potential he showed when he
became the junior champion three years ago. After a pair of mishaps
in preliminaries, he scored a 57.675, with no score less than
9.425, to finish the day second, 1.025 points behind Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Tewell Shares Novell Seniors Lead  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Doug Tewell, who turned down an
invitation to the PGA Championship, shot a 66 on Saturday to share
the second-round lead with Dana Quigley in the Novell Utah
Showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell used an eagle at the par-5 17th, while Quigley, who shot
a 68, birdied the par-4 18th to reach 11 under. They led by one
stroke over first-round co-leader Gil Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   After four birdies on the back nine, Tewell went ahead with an
eagle at the 17th moments after Morgan bogeyed the par-5 15th to
drop to 10 under. Tewell celebrated by shaking his hips and dancing
around the green.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Tewell won the rain-shortened PGA Seniors'
Championship and that was his ticket to Louisville. But after
finishing third last week in the AT&AMP;T Canada Open, he was on a roll
and decided to come to Park City.
</P>
<P>
   John Jacobs had four birdies on the back nine to reach 9 under,
where he was joined by Simon Hobday and Tom Wargo. Leonard Thompson
and Bob Eastwood also were within sight at 8 under.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thorpe, who shared the first-round lead with Morgan, shot a
73.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening round that included a 45-minute rain delay, the
sky cleared and the wind gusted between 10 and 20 mph on the second
day of the 54-hole event, slowing play as golfers took greater care
with shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley set a tournament record with a 62 in the second round
last year before losing to Dave Eichelberger in a playoff, had four
birdies on the back nine. His 15-foot birdie putt drew cheers from
the large gallery at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the 1998 champion, had everything working on the front
nine for the second straight day. He seemed stunned after rolling
in a 40-foot birdie putt on the par-3 7th that took him to 11
under.
</P>
<P>
   But after making the turn at 12 under and leading by two
strokes, he came back down with bogeys on the par-4 11th and par-3
12th. He pulled back to 11 under with a birdie on the par-4 13th,
but bogeyed the par-3 14th.

<HEADLINE> Woods Stumbles, But Leads PGA Golf  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Finally, a major championship that lasts
72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked as though Tiger Woods might take all the
drama out of the PGA Championship, a shocking turn of events
Saturday left him clinging to a one-stroke lead over Bob May and
the unflappable Scott Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Woods missed a 2-foot putt for his first double bogey in 153
holes of major championship golf, then had to survive some suddenly
errant shots for a 2-under 70.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 14th consecutive major round at par or better, but it
was nowhere near the kind of score available Saturday at Valhalla
Golf Club. Twenty-four players broke 70, and Jose Maria Olazabal
tied a major championship record with a 9-under 63.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods reached the par-5 18th with two rocket launches
from his 3-wood, two-putted for birdie and still has command as he
tries to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win
three majors in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was at 203, and has had at least a share of the lead for
six straight rounds in the majors. May recovered from an early
bogey for a 6-under 66, while Dunlap matched Woods shot for shot in
his round of 70.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm telling you, to shoot 70 as poorly as I struck the golf
ball, that was pretty good,'' Woods said. ''To have a one-stroke
lead is kind of a bonus. A lot of players up there will make it
more of a challenge and a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Hayes had a 68 and was at 205, while Australian Greg
Chalmers had a 66 and was another stroke back. Olazabal's
record-tying 63 put him in a group at 207 with Stuart Appleby and
Thomas Bjorn.
</P>
<P>
   This one still could be a runaway. Dunlap and May hardly have
the experience so often required in the final round of a major.
</P>
<P>
   May finally earned his PGA Tour card in November after four
years on the European tour. The 31-year-old from Las Vegas is
playing in his first PGA Championship, and would love to become the
first rookie to win the Wanamaker Trophy since John Daly in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He found everyone in the gallery cheering for Davis Love III,
his playing partner in the third round. Imagine what he's going to
experience playing in the final group with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is asking how I'm going to feel playing with Tiger,''
May said. ''It's going to be fun, and it's going to be a learning
experience. There's not a whole bunch of pressure on me. I'm not
supposed to win. He is.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was supposed to win it Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he effectively turned the U.S. Open and the British
Open into 54-hole events. He led by 10 shots after 54 holes at
Pebble Beach, and by six shots at St. Andrews in cruising to the
career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel got spliced on the back nine at Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-stroke lead on the 12th tee, coming off birdies on
three of his last five holes, Woods hit his drive into the trees,
came up short of the green and chipped to 15 feet. The first one
ran by the left edge. Then, he missed from 2 feet for his first
double bogey since the third hole of the third round at Pebble
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap, who had missed four straight birdie putts from inside 12
feet, finally got one to fall for a three-shot swing that tied him
with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the game was on.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap dropped a shot when he failed to save par from the bunker
on No. 14 -- Woods, also in the bunker, blasted out to 3 inches --
but got one back when Woods pulled his approach on the 15th in hay
so thick that grass clung to the back of his shirt. Another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who missed only four greens in the first two rounds,
missed four on the back nine alone. Instead of pulling away, he
brought a lot of people back into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Pockets of roars resounded throughout Valhalla as Woods and
Dunlap began their round, evidence that anyone could make a move
because of the relatively soft greens and only a trace of wind.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone did.
</P>
<P>
   First came Tom Watson, the 50-year-old who never won a PGA to
complete the Grand Slam. Watson holed almost every putt that
mattered and tied the course record with a 65. That held up for
only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Olazabal, the two-time Masters champion who had an 81
last week in the Buick Open and began the PGA with a 76. He figured
something out Saturday, and walked off with a 63 that could have
been even better.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal narrowly missed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 17th that
would have given him the record in major championships. Instead, he
became the 18th player to record a 63, and the first since Greg
Norman in the first round of the 1996 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Others made a move twice -- up the leaderboard, then right back
down.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson and Love each got to 9 under at the turn. Both
played the back nine in 2 over and were at 209, along with Paul
Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby birdied six of the first 11 holes and was at 11 under
until he was derailed by two bogeys sandwiched around a double
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   After Watson finished his round, he described Woods as a
phenomenon that golf ''may never, ever see again,'' and predicted
he would have opened up a four- or five-shot margin by the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, that seemed inevitable. Instead, Woods will have to
play one more round concentrating on another major, and not just
another record.

   TOSTON, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters raced to make as much progress as possible
against a menacing wildfire today before expected windy weather could whip the
flames into another dash across the countryside. The blaze near Toston had swept

quiet during the night, officials said, but a cold front was expected to arrive
during the night with strong wind and no moisture.

Gore: I Will Clean Environment

   BELLEVUE, Iowa (AP) -- His borrowed campaign boat sandwiched by the lush
greenery of the Mississippi riverbanks, Al Gore told rural Iowans today that
he's the one who will fight for the environment -- not Republican rival George
W. Bush. ''Clean air and clean water are good for our families, good for our
future and I'll fight for it. The other side gives in to the big polluters,''
said the Democratic presidential nominee. Before shoving off in Dubuque, Gore
told a crowd of some 2,000 enthusiasts that Bush, the Texas governor, had proven

Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer and is usually caused by
exposure to the sun. McCain's internist, Dr. John Eckstein, said today that the

N.M. Pipeline Blast Kills Six Campers

   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An underground natural gas pipeline exploded and sent
a giant ball of flames into the air today, killing six people who had been
camping nearby, and six other campers were in critical condition. The victims
were four children and two adults, said state police Capt. John Balderston. They
were members of at least two families who were camping along the Pecos River
about 200 to 300 yards from where the explosion occurred, he said. Balderston
said the cause of the blast was not known, but he speculated the 30-inch
pipeline, 3 feet underground, had ruptured.

Russians in Iraq Without U.N. OK
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A Russian humanitarian delegation landed in Baghdad's
newly reopened international airport without U.N. approval today amid Iraqi
hopes of more visits from abroad following last week's defiant trip by
Venezuela's president. Russia insisted that, since it was a humanitarian
mission, the flight did not violate U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990,
which include an air embargo -- an interpretation the United States and other
countries have disputed.

Crenshaw To Stop Using Reagan Ad
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A Republican congressional candidate has agreed to
a request by the staff of Ronald Reagan to stop using a photo of the former
president in campaign commercials. The commercial showing Ander Crenshaw and
Reagan together ran on cable systems this past week. Crenshaw was a co-chairman
for Reagan's 1980 and 1984 Florida campaigns. The Reagans do not want to imply
they are endorsing one Republican over another in a primary, Joanne Drake, chief
of staff for Reagan's office, said yesterday.

Woods Stumbles, But Still Leads PGA Golf
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Just when it looked as though Tiger Woods might take
all the drama out of the PGA Championship, a shocking turn of events today left
him clinging to a one-stroke lead over Bob May and the unflappable Scott Dunlap.
Woods missed a 2-foot putt for his first double bogey in 153 holes of major
championship golf, then had to survive some suddenly errant shots for a 2-under
70.

<P>
   OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Shooter held off a late charge by Snow
Ridge to win Saturday's $200,000 Sapling Stakes by a neck at
Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old colt raced the six furlongs in 1:10 3-5. Shooter,
owned by Bobby and Leslie Hurley in partnership with D.J. Stable,
is unbeaten in two starts at Monmouth. He won his first race by
more than eight lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time out, he went to the lead and never looked
back,'' jockey Joe Bravo said in a release. ''Today he rated before
making his run and that's the kind of horse that wins the big
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Shooter paid $6.60, $5, $2.60 and 2.30 as the favorite. Snow
Ridge paid $11.40, $6.20 and $13. TP Louie, who finished third,
paid $4.60 and $11.60.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Son Headed To Traffic Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CURRITUCK, N.C. (AP) -- Al Gore's son has a court date in North
Carolina to face charges of speeding and reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Gore III, 17, was arrested and charged Aug. 12 with
driving 97 mph in a 55 mph zone and reckless driving, said 1st Sgt.
A.C. Joyner of the North Carolina Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   He was driving on a state highway in a rural, sparsely populated
area along the Outer Banks just south of Norfolk, Va., authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Johnston, a spokeswoman for Tipper Gore, said Saturday
that the teen-ager was alone at the time and was heading home to
Washington after a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family vacationed on Figure Eight Island farther south
along the North Carolina coast near Wilmington in early August.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Gores are dealing with this as a family matter,'' Johnston
said.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing was for scheduled Sept. 13. Possible punishment
for the charges would be a fine and loss of driving privileges in
North Carolina as determined by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said Gore was cooperative during the arrest.

   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill paid
tribute to the Royal Air Force, saying, ''Never in the field of
human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.''
</P>
<P>
   On this date:
</P>
<P>
   In 1833, Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president of the United
States, was born in North Bend, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1866, President Andrew Johnson formally declared the Civil
War over, even though the fighting had stopped months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, Britain opened its offensive on the Western front
during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, pioneering American radio station 8MK in Detroit began
daily broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, the Soviet Union publicly acknowledged it had tested a
hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, hundreds of people were killed in anti-French rioting
in Morocco and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson signed a nearly $1 billion
anti-poverty measure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations began

</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the United States launched ''Voyager Two,'' an unmanned

greetings in dozens of languages, samples of music and sounds of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Benjamin Chavis Jr. was fired as head of the NAACP
after a turbulent 16-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: For the first time since Iraq began detaining
foreigners, President Bush publicly referred to the detainees as
hostages, and demanded their release. Three former Northwest
Airlines pilots were convicted in Minneapolis of flying while
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: In northern India, 348 people were killed when a
passenger train rammed another that had stopped on the tracks after
hitting a cow. The remnants of an American peace delegation headed
home from Bosnia-Herzegovina with the bodies of three diplomats
killed in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: the CIA pulled the security clearances for former
Director John Deutch for keeping secret files on an unsecured home
computer. Three Japanese banks announced a broad alliance plan that
would create the world's largest banking group with assets of well
over $1 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Drought Killing Trees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Critical drought conditions in the Southeast
are killing trees, leaving them so brittle their limbs snap or so
frail they become easy prey for fungi and insects.
</P>
<P>
   Florida forestry officials estimate drought will affect as many
as 4 million trees this year. With normal rainfall, about 1 million
trees die of disease and natural causes in the state annually.
</P>
<P>
   The primary culprit is the southern pine beetle, which becomes
more active in dry weather and is ravaging trees in Georgia and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm professionally, totally depressed,'' said Bob Der, of the
Hillsborough County Cooperative Extension Service in west-central
Florida. ''I've been a forester here for more than 20 years, and
I've been in forestry for 34, and I've never seen anything quite
this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy trees can fight infection -- sap from a strong trunk can
wash beetles away before they bore too deep. Hypoxylon canker, a
contagious fungus that eats through bark, can lie dormant inside a
tree for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make my money saving trees and doing sick tree diagnoses,
and it breaks my heart to see this,'' said arborist Loren
Westenberger. ''The only treatment is a chain saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry officials fear the hordes of beetles will invade
healthy trees once they have finished with the weak ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once they reach that level, it's like a forest fire. They move
from tree to tree,'' said Ed Barnard, a forest pathologist with the
forestry service.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable, diseased trees pose a danger to houses, power
lines and people.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Duncan, a University of Alabama maintenance worker,
narrowly escaped a 40-foot limb that snapped off a tree Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a popping noise and knew something was happening,''
Duncan said. ''I just didn't know what direction it was coming
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Storms could help relieve the drought but they would create
another problem, forestry officials said. Even in less severe
storms, the parched trees are likely to drop many branches.
</P>
<P>
   In Baton Rouge, La., a storm in July with 31-mph winds snapped
so many trees and branches it looked as if a hurricane had swept
through, said Eddie LeBlanc, a tree maintenance company operator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trees are in a critical state,'' said Randy Harris, assistant
director of the Baton Rouge city-parish Department of Landscape and
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana in general has more old trees than most states, making
its forests more vulnerable, said Bonnie Stine, head of the urban
forestry program in the state Department of Agriculture and
Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing landowners can do is aerate the soil, water
deeply, have a specialist remove any dead branches, and leave
fertilizer alone, she said.

<HEADLINE> Officials: No Threats at Sydney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- No specific groups or nations have
been identified as posing potential security threats to next
month's Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''An enormous amount of work has been done on what the potential
threats might and might not be and to whom, but we don't have any
particular indications of there being a threat at the Olympics,''
Alexander Downer, Australia's foreign minister, told the Seven
television network Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're not taking anything for granted. We're obviously
being extremely cautious and conservative in the way we approach
this issue and a large number of resources are being dedicated to
Olympic security.''
</P>
<P>
   Downer ruled out allowing other nations to bring weapons into
Australia to protect their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made it perfectly clear to all governments that might be
in any way interested in bringing weapons to Australia that here in
Australia we provide the security for the athletes and the support
for the teams and also for the VIPs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said security would particularly focus on teams from
high-risk countries such as Israel. However, Downer said Israel had
not asked to bring weapons into Australia.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 4, Athletics 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Deivi Cruz tied a Detroit record with three
doubles and Wendell Magee hit a bases-loaded triple, leading Brian
Moehler and the Tigers over the Oakland Athletics 4-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won their season-high sixth straight game. A win on
Sunday would get them to .500 for the first time since they were
1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's three straight doubles tied Billy Bruton's team mark, set
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler (10-7) extended his winning streak to four starts, the
longest of his career. He gave up two runs and seven hits in
seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moehler matched his win total from last year, when he went
10-16.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his league-leading 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Zito (1-2) lost to the Tigers for the second time in six
days, allowing four runs and nine hits in six-plus innings. He
walked one and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Zito struck out Detroit's first two batters of the game, but the
Tigers scored four times before he could get the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson singled to center and Juan Gonzalez followed
with a ground single off Zito's glove. Dean Palmer walked to load
the bases, and Magee followed with a long fly off the scoreboard in
right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz then hit a soft liner past center fielder Terrence Long for
a double that made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland put runners on base in each of the first four innings,
but couldn't get any of them home. The A's broke through in the
fifth when Ryan Christenson beat out an infield single, moved up on
two groundouts and scored on Mike Stanley's single.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cruz replaced Moehler after Ben Grieve walked to lead off
the eighth and allowed an RBI double to Stanley on his first and
only pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Adam Piatt singled off C.J. Nitkowski and Miguel
Tejada followed with an RBI single to make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   After the left-handed Nitkowski got an 0-2 count on pinch-hitter
Ramon Hernandez, Tigers manager Phil Garner switched to righty
Danny Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson finished the strikeout, then got Frank Menechino to
bounce into a forceout at second.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi pinch-hit for Sal Fasano and grounded out to end
the rally.
Notes: After allowing just seven runs in his first four career
starts, Zito has given up nine in two appearances against Detroit.
The Tigers have also handed him the only two losses of his career.
... Gonzalez's first-inning single extended his hitting streak to a
season-best 11 games. ... Jason Giambi (shoulder) and Randy Velarde
(neck) did not play for Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Coed Team Wins Softball World Series  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) -- An Arizona team playing with five boys
won the Softball World Series on Saturday after an all-girls team
from the Philippines forfeited the final game.
</P>
<P>
   The Eloy, Ariz., team beat the Philippines team 4-3 in the first
game of the championship round Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Damaso Sancon said he decided to forfeit because three
girls were injured in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Philippines team was undefeated in the elimination
rounds and beat the Arizona team 3-2 on Tuesday, Sancon said his
girls were the true champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not have to prove to them because we know that we are
the champions in the world,'' he said. ''If they hadn't had boys on
the team we would be the champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Ogle said there was no baseball program in Arizona for the
16-year-old boys, and the girls' softball team lacked participants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to keep our kids busy and out of trouble,'' Ogle
said. ''They wanted to play, we were short of girls, so we let them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Little League Baseball Inc. created what was meant to be an
all-girls' softball division in 1974. But after losing lawsuits in
California and Vermont filed by boys demanding to play softball,
Little League made both divisions ''non-gender-specific'' rather
than fight future legal challenges case-by-case, spokesman Lance
Van Auken said.
</P>
<P>
   The coed team advanced to the championship rounds after a team
from Inverness, Fla., forfeited its game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Florida team manager Pete Maggiore said the main reason he
forfeited was concern that his players would be injured. The
Florida team took third place, beating a Kentucky team 6-3
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament director Bud Vanderberg said earlier in the week that
he will do whatever he can to make sure the tournament excludes
boys in the future. He said he will take the issue to the national
Little League board of directors next week.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Release 12 Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) -- Byron Hanspard and Ken Oxendine,
Atlanta's top two rushers last season after filling in for injured
Jamal Anderson, were among 12 players released by the Falcons on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Jeff Paulk, cornerbacks Derrick Gardner and Reggie
Doster, tight end Rod Monroe, linebacker Whit Marshall, defensive
tackles Ben Huff and Doug Miller, and offensive linemen Everett
McIver, Ozell Powell and Jamie Wu were also released.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Ryan Johanningmeir was placed on injured
reserve with an ailing back.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard, selected in the second round of the 1997 draft out of
Texas Tech, and Oxendine, a seventh-round pick out of Virginia Tech
in 1998 both fumbled in the third quarter of Atlanta's 28-14
preseason loss to San Diego on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   They were the central figures of a rushing attack that was the
NFL's second-worst last season and became expendable when a healthy
Anderson returned this preseason and Ron Rivers and Maurice Smith
impressed coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Hanspard tried to fill the void left when Anderson tore his
right anterior cruciate ligament Sept. 20, but gained only 383
yards on 136 carries. He started four of his 12 games and averaged
only 2.8 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine started nine games last year but lost two fumbles at
New Orleans and never quite worked his way out of Reeves' doghouse.
He rushed 141 times for 452 yards, averaging only 3.2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who set an NFL record with 410 carries in 1998, rushed
only six times for 17 yards Friday, but he looked far less
tentative than he had the week before.

<HEADLINE> Dissident Released After 4 Years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Kurdish doctor sent to jail four years ago
based on secret government evidence that alleged he was a spy for
Iraq and Iran was freed by a judge who said the accusations were
ill-founded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ali Yasin Mohammed Karim walked out of the Immigration and
Naturalization Detention Center in San Pedro shortly after Friday's
decision by U.S. Immigration Judge D.D. Sitgraves.
</P>
<P>
   The judge reversed her earlier conclusion that Karim, 30, was a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Karim ''has sufficiently demonstrated that the government's
claims were ill-founded and has rebutted the presumption that he
constitutes a risk to the security of the United States,''
Sitgraves said.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his lawyer, Karim said: ''I was kept for four
years by the INS for things I never heard about. I am innocent, but
I have paid a high price.''
</P>
<P>
   Karim, who plans to stay in the United States, is a former
member of the Iraqi National Congress, a large political and
military organization that fought against dictator Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   He was among six dissidents evacuated from Iraq by the United
States in March 1997, then jailed by the INS and threatened with
deportation. The case against them was based on classified evidence
kept secret from defense attorneys during immigration hearings in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were freedom fighters,'' Karim's attorney, Niels W.
Frenzen, said.
</P>
<P>
   Their plight attracted national attention when former CIA
Director R. James Wooley, now a Washington lawyer, joined Karim's
defense team and led the effort to declassify the government's
evidence. The evidence contained little more than rumor, defense
attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   After the information was released, five of the Iraqis accepted
a government offer to remain in Nebraska until they could relocate
to another democratic country.
</P>
<P>
   Karim fought the allegations and press his claim for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Sitgraves wrote in her 123-page opinion that the FBI screening
process to determine if Karim was a potential security threat was
insufficient and conducted by agents who had limited knowledge of
Iraq and its people.
</P>
<P>
   Political asylum in the United States should be granted, the
judge ruled, because the doctor has established a well-founded fear
that he would be persecuted if sent back to Iraq. She issued the
same ruling for his mentally ill brother Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has 30 days to appeal the judge's
decision.

<HEADLINE> Fires Changing 'New West' Paradise  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG SKY, Mont. (AP) -- A couple in a white Mustang convertible
drives up the scenic Gallatin Canyon on a perfect Montana
afternoon, top down.
</P>
<P>
   They glide past families of hikers setting off into the forest,
fly-fisherman wading in the riffles, rafting guides loading bulky
boats onto trailers. This could be just another day in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But this paradise is under siege.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot feel the heat, but they know it's there. Twenty
miles to the south of the town of Big Sky, a 2,000-acre fire burns.
It threatens homes and businesses and a new West that has been
carved out of the wilderness -- a West of resorts and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a normal year,'' fire officer Bill Breedlove of
the U.S. Forest Service tells 200 anxious residents packed into the
Big Sky firehouse, a full quarter of the town's population. He
means that this year, more than 5 million acres have been consumed.
</P>
<P>
   But this year is different in a more basic way.
</P>
<P>
   This season's forest fires have inflicted more human anguish,
because in the newly developed West, more humans are in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not such a new story, really. People have always taken
risks in their pursuit of natural beauty. Streamside cabins get
flooded, mountain chalets avalanched, beachfront condominiums
battered by hurricanes. In Southern California, a seaside
metropolis with perfect weather straddles one of North America's
most active seismic zones.
</P>
<P>
   The forested West is no different. It's just that many Big Sky
residents don't understand that yet.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A lightning storm rolled through the area the previous Thursday
evening, Breedlove tells the crowd. The lightning ignited about a
dozen fires.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them have been put out already or gone out by
themselves. But on Sunday the Beaver Creek fire, named for the
small drainage where it started, suddenly made what firefighters
call a run. It marched up a hillside at about a mile an hour,
abruptly growing from 80 acres to 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Tuesday, Aug. 15. Crews are struggling to contain the
fire, Breedlove explains, working at its southern edge to clear a
swath about four feet wide of brush, leaves and topsoil. If the
crews can work all the way around the fire, they can lasso it
inside an unburnable ring and keep it from growing more.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems unlikely, Breedlove confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody needs to be told that. All afternoon, they have seen a
plume of white smoke rising like a mushroom cloud over the
mountains south of town.
</P>
<P>
   People shift around in their seats and mutter to one another
because they keep hearing things they don't like from the Forest
Service officials. They ask tough questions. Where will the Forest
Service make its last stand against the advancing flames? How much
warning will we be given if we have to evacuate?
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an interesting crowd to play to,'' fire information
officer Tom Lavagnino says the next day.
</P>
<P>
   When Lavagnino started working for the Forest Service in 1972,
the town of Big Sky didn't even exist. The West was a vast, empty
wilderness punctuated by towns where people made their living from
the land, by logging, mining or ranching.
</P>
<P>
   It still is pretty empty out here, relative to other parts of
the country. But now the West is sprinkled with sprawling
communities and year-round resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our footprint on the landscape is changing,'' says Jerry
Johnson, a political science professor at Montana State University.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century ago, national forests were essentially vast
tree farms where recreation was allowed as an afterthought. The
local communities were small timber and mining towns populated by
people who were more interested in a paycheck than fly-fishing or
mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   But since places like Aspen, Colo.; Jackson, Wyo.; Bend, Ore.
and Big Sky have grown up surrounded by millions of acres of scenic
public land, the national forests may be more valuable as
playgrounds than plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be it was timber that drove these local economies,
and now it's natural beauty brought to you by the federal
government,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Big Sky's residents live in a planned paradise carved out of the
Montana wilderness 25 years ago by television newsman Chet Huntley.
He dreamed of a beautiful resort high in the mountains of his home
state. And though he died a month before the grand opening,
Huntley's dream has come true.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the mountain, Big Sky has a first-class ski resort
with an impressive 4,350 feet of vertical drop. Down in the valley,
there's a golf course designed by Arnold Palmer. Thirty minutes
down the road is the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like some kind of Shangri-La, far removed from the
troubles of the world. But when the residents of Big Sky make that
drive up the Gallatin Canyon, they see what fire can do.
</P>
<P>
   On the charred hillsides above Fan Creek, the skeletal remains
of lodgepole pines that burned during the Yellowstone fires of 1988
are silhouetted 70 feet tall against the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just scared to death,'' says Tim Lampe, who moved to Big
Sky three years ago from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   It may look bad, says environmentalist Michael Scott. But fire
is a natural event in Western forests, a necessary force that
rejuvenates the soil and maintains a diversity of plants and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a renewing process. It's not a natural catastrophe,''
says Scott, who works for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a
Bozeman, Mont., environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the people of Big Sky. They are retired
CEOs, ambitious entrepreneurs, successful real estate developers.
They are not used to being at anybody's whim, even Mother Nature's.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-settlement West, natural fires thinned the forest
understory regularly, but spared the larger trees. As a result much
of the West looked park-like, with a few dozen trees per acre.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the 20th century the Smokey-Bear ethic reigned.
Fire was considered a bad thing, a destructive force that had to be
squelched at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ecologists realized the importance of fire in the
1970s, forests had grown choked with underbrush, sorely overdue for
burning. And about the same time, people started building their
dream homes there.
</P>
<P>
   Today the area threatened by the Beaver Creek fire is filling
with what Big Sky fire chief Bob Stober calls ''million-dollar
shacks,'' giant log homes nestled into the edge of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''They build tinderboxes inside tinderboxes,'' says Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the meeting, somebody proposes they take a vote
on whether to ask that the federal land around the town be closed
to the public. Much of the public land nearer the fire is already
off limits; the idea is to prevent campers from starting new fires.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a good idea, and about half the people in the
room raise their hands in support of the motion.
</P>
<P>
   But then Tracy Franks speaks up. She owns the Huckleberry Cafe,
and depends on tourism for her livelihood. If the forest is closed,
that means no more fly fishermen, no more trail riders, no more
whitewater rafters. No more visitors eating in her restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will go broke,'' she cries.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like this during the Yellowstone fires, says Brian
Wheeler, who has lived in Big Sky for 20 years. Those blazes came
almost as close as the current fire, but Big Sky was a different
place then. The town was about a third its present size. There was
no firehouse to meet in. There were no million-dollar homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just didn't have the same fear in the community,'' Wheeler
says.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, on Thursday, there is another meeting in the Big
Sky firehouse. This time about 300 people show up, filling the
sweltering upstairs room usually used to train volunteer
firefighters. The fire has grown to 3,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fire is still far from Big Sky, the prospect of
evacuation seems very real. There are rumors that the order to
leave will come before the weekend. Some people have rented
apartments in Bozeman, about an hour's drive to the north, and are
already moving their belongings. Others are preparing to fly back
to their primary homes.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there are demands to close the nearby national forest
land.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Stober begs residents to cut down trees and brush
within 40 feet of their homes. He asks them not to stack firewood
under their porches or next to their garages.
</P>
<P>
   These are mere Band-Aids though, and everybody knows it. The
development of the forested West over the past century has been a
recipe for disaster, and supper is ready.

<HEADLINE> Pope's Youth Day Rallies Rome Crowd  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Nuns clapping alongside bikini-wearing young
faithful, as many as 2 million candle-waving Catholic pilgrims lit
up the hills outside Rome on Saturday in a spirited World Youth Day
with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter ferried in the 80-year-old pontiff as a fat, red
sun sank below the hills, cooling a day that earlier had hit 100
degrees -- baking the crowds blanketing a 15-acre university campus.
</P>
<P>
   The pope smiled broadly as young people supported each of his
arms while he shuffled slowly to his ''popemobile,'' which drove
him to center stage for the evening vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Many faithful used binoculars just to study the far-off, giant
TV screens and their tiny image of the white-robed pontiff, while
rolling hills shut thousands of other pilgrims out of view
completely.
</P>
<P>
   With the Saturday night prayer pep rally, John Paul sought to
charge up the faith of these young Catholics so they will
steadfastly lead the church in a new era.
</P>
<P>
   As at least a few couples in the crowd kissed or cuddled, John
Paul acknowledged the difficulties of following some church
teachings, including ones against sex before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it hard to believe in the third millennium?'' the pope
asked the crowd. ''Yes! It is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard, but with the help of grace it can be done,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His speech was frequently interrupted by cheering, singing and
shouts of ''long live the pope.'' At one point the pope shot back,
''John Paul Two, he loves you!''
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in a T-shirt managed to break through security to
embrace the pope, resting her head affectionately against his for a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds lit candles as darkness fell. John Paul closed the
evening with an apology to those fans in back -- but added modestly
they at least had heard the ''chaos'' of his prayers and speech.
''Tonight they heard us in Rome,'' he said, ebullient. ''And they
will never forget it!''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul headed home before midnight, but most of the faithful
bedded down for the night in sleeping bags, waiting for him to
return early Sunday morning for a closing Mass for the week of
World Youth Day events.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were exhausted, and we've lost two of our friends, but when
he went by we just cried,'' said another pilgrim, 16-year-old Paula
Cortez of the Philippines. ''We felt so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnout appeared to be almost double than the Vatican's
prediction at the start of World Youth Day events on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the annual festival was held in Rome since
John Paul started it here 15 years ago. The pope created the
occasion to inspire young Catholics as other faiths gained
followers in much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're well over 2 million people,'' said Mayor Francesco
Rutelli, based on surveys from police helicopters flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, flag-waving throngs had streamed in from the
city, many walking the roughly 12 miles despite what turned out to
be the hottest weekend of the summer. Fire hoses, fans and fainting
tents worked to relieve countless young pilgrims overcome by heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''That. Feels. So. Goooood,'' said Katy Rothman of Somers, N.Y.,
reveling under the blast of spray that greeted the young woman
after a three-hour walk to the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pilgrims had been treated by doctors at the scene by
early evening, with more than a score of them needing
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Young people stripped down to shorts and bikinis around gushing
hydrants, splashing in welling mud pools.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hot, and I'm going to get wet anyway,'' said Dina Focina,
22, waving a hand at her two-piece.

<HEADLINE> No petting at the petting zoo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HORSEHEADS, N.Y. (AP) - When is a petting zoo not a petting zoo?
</P>
<P>
   When a camel and goat each bite a child and health officials
quarantine the critters to check for rabies.
</P>
<P>
   A traveling petting zoo called The Zoo set up shop in a
supermarket parking lot in this Chemung County town 70 miles
southwest of Syracuse only to have the big dromedary and the goat
bite a kid.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the county Health Department put the offending
animals in quarantine for 10 days and warned residents to be wary
of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to send up the panic flag at this time,''
said Joseph Egnaczak, Rabies Program Coordinator at the Chemung
County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Animals in petting zoos might not be vaccinated for rabies, and
the public should avoid contact with the animals, Egnaczak said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Engesser, one of The Zoo's owners, said that she has more
than 30 animals and they are free of rabies. Neither the camel nor
the goat had been vaccinated, she said, because there is no
approved vaccine for the animals. A veterinarian was to vaccinate
them anyway over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> McCain Recovering After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Sen. John McCain spent more than five hours in
surgery Saturday to remove skin cancer from his temple and upper
arm, and his doctor said preliminary findings show that the cancer
had not spread to his lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's internist, Dr. John Eckstein, said the surgery to
remove the two melanomas, the most serious form of skin cancer,
went exactly as expected and without complications.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the melanoma from his left arm involved a simple
excision, Eckstein said. The surgery on the left temple was more
extensive and included the removal of lymph nodes from the face and
neck and a salivary gland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased to let you know that the preliminary report on
the lymph nodes ... was clear without any evidence of melanoma
cells,'' he said. ''However it will take several days to fully
evaluate the removed surgical tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   The former GOP presidential candidate was recovering at the Mayo
Clinic Hospital and was expected to remain there for two to three
days, Eckstein said. ''At this time we are very optimistic and are
very pleased for Senator and Mrs. McCain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain was in excellent spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is now talking straight again after general anesthesia. In
fact when I asked him if he wanted me to pass anything along to
you, he said, 'Call Trent Lott. I know he'll be on pins and
needles,''' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery followed earlier tests that found no signs that the
cancer spread beyond the two new melanomas. The lymph nodes removed
Saturday from around the cancerous lesions were being tested to
help determine whether the surgery was the only treatment
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer had reached one or more of the lymph nodes,
treatment is more complicated and less likely to cure the cancer,
melanoma experts said. Options include anti-cancer drugs and
stimulating the immune system to try to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook would have been much worse if the cancer had spread
to McCain's organs, since that stage of melanoma is extremely
difficult to treat, said Dr. John Glaspy, a researcher at UCLA's
Jonsson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the melanomas after McCain left the Republican
National Convention to have biopsies performed at Bethesda Naval
Hospital near Washington on Aug. 4. His office announced the
results of the those tests on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who turns 64 on Aug. 29, said he has seen his doctor for
checkups every three or four months since he had a lesion removed
from his shoulder seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is usually caused by exposure to the sun. People with
fair skin, like McCain, have a higher risk of skin cancer. McCain
spent hours in the Arizona sun campaigning for Congress in 1982 and
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   The news of McCain's cancer came during the Democratic National
Convention and just days after he toured Western states with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the victor in a spirited Republican nomination
campaign in which McCain won seven primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has canceled about a dozen campaign events with GOP
congressional candidates since learning of the skin cancer
diagnosis. Republican leaders had counted on McCain's help to win
independent voters and keep the GOP majorities in the House and
Senate.

</P>
<P>
   Branch was president of Georgia Power Co. from 1951 to 1957 and

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Herbert James Coleman, a former managing
editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology and a Defense
Department official until his retirement in 1994, died Aug. 13 of a
heart attack. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman worked at Aviation Week from 1958 until 1986 when he
retired from the highly regarded technical publication as managing
editor. He then went to work at the Pentagon where he headed the
Current News &AMP; Research Service, which publishes the Early Bird, a
daily news summary for top government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was a Minnesota native and flew 31 combat missions over
Europe during World War II as a bomber aboard a B-17 ''Flying
Fortress'' bomber.
</P>
<P>
   He had served as vice chairman and governor of the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife and three sons.
Edward Craven Walker:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Edward Craven Walker, the inventor of the lava
lamp and an enthusiastic nudist who made movies promoting life in
the buff, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Walker got the idea for the lava lamp from seeing a ''blob
light'' -- a mix of oil and water heated by a light bulb at the
bottom. He spent a decade perfecting the design for what he called
the ''Astro lamp.''
</P>
<P>
   The product was launched in 1963, just ahead of the craze for
all things psychedelic, and Walker's factory in Poole, in southern
England, was soon busy meeting the demand.
</P>
<P>
   He promoted nudism with his films. ''Eves on Skis'' appeared in
1958, and ''Traveling Light,'' described as an underwater ballet
filmed off Corsica, followed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the latter film gave Walker the resources to buy
a club at Bournemouth on the south coast of England, which he
turned into a nudist resort. He once caused a stir there by trying
to ban overweight nudists.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Miss Chance To Catch Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Davis Love III was standing on the fifth
fairway, iron in hand, listening to the roars of the crowd. Up
ahead, Phil Mickelson was making a move, and Love seemed poised to
follow him.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the best players in the world were edging their way
toward Tiger Woods and the top of the leaderboard. Finally, it
seemed, they would get to take Woods on in a major championship on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Then a pair of back-nine 38s left Love and Mickelson wondering
yet again what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they just weren't meant to beat Woods in a major
championship. Perhaps they just can't beat him when all is on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very disappointing,'' Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
   While no-names such as Bob May, Scott Dunlap and Greg Chalmers
stayed in contention Saturday in the PGA Championship, Love and
Mickelson were six shots back going into the final round after
wasting their best opportunity at a major title this year.
</P>
<P>
   Their expectations were higher, but their play was not better.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know it's a big tournament,'' Mickelson said. ''We all
want to play well. I don't think it's any easier or harder for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mickelson and Love, the 1997 PGA winner, got to 9 under at
the turn, only a few shots back of Woods, and had the lead in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   They fell back once again with some bad mistakes, though,
leaving both to ponder their chances at a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Love's thoughts remained with him as he signed a ball for a sign
bearer, then stormed past reporters after finishing with a final
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was just as unhappy, but looking forward to one final
chance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to have to go out there and go exceptionally low
round,'' he said. ''It's still possible for someone to come from
behind and shoot 8, 9 or 10 under tomorrow to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time Saturday, it looked like Mickelson might do
just that as he started out with birdies on five of the first eight
holes to shoot 31 on the front side.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the PGA Championship was in reach again, with golf's
best left-hander 9 under and only three shots back of Woods, who
was only a few holes into his round. The possibility of his first
major championship in eight years was starting to grow on
Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a breakthrough front nine,'' Mickelson said. ''Today was
a really good opportunity for me to go low.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, it was a lost opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with a wedge in his hand in the fairway on the par-5
10th, Mickelson hit it over the green and, after chipping on,
missed a 5-footer for par. His momentum had stalled, and he would
never get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I thought I was going to get one and I give one back,
it's a two-shot swing and it really hurts,'' Mickelson said. ''It
took a lot out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson would go on to bogey the par-3 14th and, by the time
he missed an 8-footer on the final hole for birdie, he was in with
a 69 that put him 7 under, six shots behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same place Love finished, after stumbling to a
bogey on the 18th hole that left him at even par for the day.
</P>
<P>
   For Love it must have been even more painful, because of what
happened only a day earlier when he also got to 9 under, only to
bogey both the 17th and 18th holes as darkness settled on Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   At least it looked painful, though Love wasn't talking.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly got those shots back with birdies on the second and
fourth holes, but would make only one more birdie the rest of the
day and stumbled down the back side with poor iron play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, guys with names like Dunlap, May, J.P. Hayes, Greg
Chalmers and Franklin Langham were passing Mickelson and Love by.
The leaderboard had Woods, but was missing the players like Love
and Mickelson who were supposed to be his main challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just the way it is sometimes,'' Woods said. ''You can't
have the best players up there each and every major. It's just not
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it mattered much to Woods, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care who's behind me,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Son of Pro-Russian Leader Killed  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The body of a pro-Russia Chechen
official's son was found Saturday bound to a tree and bearing deep
wounds from a grenade explosion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old son of the mayor of Urus-Martan was kidnapped
Wednesday and killed with a grenade, said an official of the
pro-Moscow Chechen government.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Salavat Gibartayev appeared to be the latest in a
string of rebel attacks aimed at Chechens who cooperate with the
Russian government, the official said. The rebels have repeatedly
warned Chechens against joining forces with the Kremlin, labeling
them as traitors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian troops were on high alert in preparation for
an election Sunday to choose Chechnya's deputy to the lower house
of the Russian Parliament. The military has warned that rebels
would step up attacks for the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary elections were held in the rest of Russia in
December, when fighting in Chechnya made it impossible to hold a
local ballot. Human rights groups have criticized the planned vote
in Chechnya because rebels and federal troops are still battling,
and even areas long occupied by the Russians are not safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Russian troops arrested two rebel leaders on the
outskirts of the village of Gekhi-Chu and killed two others who put
up resistance in the area, the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a
1994-96 war, then moved back in last September in a bid to end the
republic's de facto independence and quash what the Kremlin called
a breeding ground for terrorists.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Sen. John McCain spent more than five hours in surgery today
to remove skin cancer from his temple and upper arm, and his doctor said
preliminary findings show that the cancer had not spread to his lymph nodes.

Russia: Almost No Hope For Sub Survivors

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted today that all 118 sailors

camping nearby, and six other campers were in critical condition. The victims
were four children and two adults, said state police Capt. John Balderston. They
were members of at least two families who were camping along the Pecos River
about 200 to 300 yards from where the explosion occurred, he said. Balderston

him clinging to a one-stroke lead over Bob May and the unflappable Scott Dunlap.
Woods missed a 2-foot putt for his first double bogey in 153 holes of major
championship golf, then had to survive some suddenly errant shots for a 2-under
70.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Nazi Groups March in Germany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Thousands of anti-Nazi activists
demonstrated in three German cities on Saturday, while a court
struck down a ban on a planned neo-Nazi demonstration in the
northern port city of Hamburg set for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people marched in Hamburg in a demonstration
organized by labor unions, churches, and citizens groups, while
1,000 marched in the northeastern city of Rostock and 350 people
took part in a demonstration in Eisenach in the eastern state of
Thuringia.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Nazi demonstrations came a day after Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called on Germans to help stamp out violence and
discrimination against minorities following a recent string of
attacks on foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Police said eight people were temporarily detained for carrying
baseball bats and knives in Rostock Saturday, while 22 neo-Nazis
were detained during a far-right demonstration in Eisenach late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, ruling
on an appeal by radical rightist leader Christian Worch, partially
overturned a Hamburg state court's ban on a neo-Nazi demonstration.
But the court limited the demonstration to 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday
in a square at the Axel Springer Publishers' building.
</P>
<P>
   The court also stipulated that the neo-Nazi demonstrators cannot
chant references, carry signs, or speak of Hitler's former deputy,
Rudolf Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Hess committed suicide in Berlin's former Spandau
prison in August 1987, but radical rightists claim he was murdered.
The prison was razed after his death to prevent neo-Nazi's using it
as a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Saturday's anti-Nazi rally, Dorothee Stapelfeldt,
the president of a Hamburg citizens committee, told the
demonstrators that: ''Everyone must show that they will not let
themselves be intimidated by racists and neo-Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-wing groups in Hamburg said they planned a counter
demonstration against the neo-Nazis beginning at noon Sunday in
another part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Police were bracing to prevent possible clashes between the
opposing sides.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Leaves Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan was discharged from a hospital as planned on Saturday
after successfully having his gall bladder surgically removed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was admitted to Washington Hospital Center after
experiencing repeated episodes of stomach pain during the last few
months, according to his sister Bay Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan had known he had gallstones, and was waiting until
after the November election to have them removed. But after an
episode of discomfort last week he decided to have them removed.
During the surgery doctors decided to remove the entire gall
bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's doctors anticipate a speedy and complete recovery,
his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's nursing office confirmed that Buchanan was
discharged Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 12th Hole Hurts Tiger Woods  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tiger Woods was in control and the rest
of the field was on the verge of battling it out for second place.
No big surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 12th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly on Saturday, the PGA Championship became more than just
another coronation for the world's best golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was 4 under for the day and three strokes ahead of his
closest pursuer as he stepped to the tee at the 467-yard, par-4
hole, a slight dogleg to the right that narrows in the driving
area. The second shot requires a long flight over a deep valley in
front of the green, which is surrounded by bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Woods pulled his 3-wood driver left and ended up in the heavy
rough between the tree line and the fairway. Standing behind his
ball, he could see the right edge of the green. His approach needed
to dive low out of the rough and between two trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit an 8-iron short of the green, which was what I wanted,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot flew between the trees, over the valley and ended up
in the dense, 9-inch long grass on the slope in front of the green.
He chopped a sand wedge under the ball and it rolled 12 feet past
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit a good pitch, but it checked up,'' he said. ''It
actually left a ball mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, playing partner Scott Dunlap followed the
conventional path on the hole. His drive was long and in the
fairway and his 5-iron from 208 yards landed in the heart of the
hilly green, 6 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to save his par, Woods' putt just missed the left corner
of the hole and rolled 2 feet past. He sized up his second putt
carefully, but pushed the comebacker past on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit a good third putt,'' Woods joked. ''I knocked it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap then holed his birdie putt, picking up three shots on one
hole. As the players went to No. 13, both were at 12 under. Not
only had Dunlap pulled even with Woods, but players five and six
shots off the pace found themselves back in the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that time I was pretty disappointed because I had missed
some pretty makable putts,'' Dunlap said. ''That double
bogey-birdie swing rectified all that in a way. I kind of felt like
I got let off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th has been the hardest hole at the Valhalla Golf Club
this week. It has yielded just 38 birdies, compared with 109 bogeys
and 25 double bogeys. Woods had abruptly become a part of those
negative statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Woods would stumble again with a bogey at the 15th hole, but
regrouped with a two-putt birdie at the par-5 closing hole. That
was enough for him to regain the lead by a stroke over Dunlap and
Bob May.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12th had done its damage, turning another Woods rout
into a test.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know tomorrow's going to be quite a challenge,'' Woods said.
''There are a lot of guys with a good chance to win. Fortunately
I'm still one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Right to Life Party endorses Pat Buchanan for president  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) - Shunned by George W. Bush and vehemently
opposed to Al Gore's pro-abortion rights record, the state's Right
to Life Party on Saturday overwhelmingly endorsed conservative
presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, running for president under the Reform Party banner,
won about 90 percent of the districts, said Donald M. Peters, a
vice chairman of the Right to Life Party, an organization that
opposes abortion in all cases. The endorsement automatically puts
Buchanan on the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few districts supported Howard Phillips, although party
leaders declined to release specific numbers, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people voting for Pat Buchanan felt that he would be the
most effective voice for unborn children,'' Peters said, following
the vote at a Ramada Inn. ''We're looking forward to Pat Buchanan
using his $12 million on pro-life ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Buchanan will be able to use the money at all remains
unclear. His party is in upheaval following its recent national
convention, where members divided there support between Buchanan
and physicist and Natural Law Party founder John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin drew support from many Reformers who back party founder
Ross Perot, and the party split in half as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was unable to attend Saturday's meeting because he had
been hospitalized in Washington, D.C. following the successful
removal of his gall bladder. He was later released from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Bay Buchanan accepted on his behalf, along with
Buchanan's vice presidential nominee Ezola Foster, a black former
teacher and a member of the ultra-conservative John Birch Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are thrilled to death - this is something that we had hoped
for, for a long time,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''It's an enormous boost
for us. Many of our supporters are hardcore pro-life ... and this
gives them a place to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election, the state Right to Life Party
endorsed Phillips, a conservative Washington lobbyist and the
candidate for the Constitution Party. In 1992, the party endorsed
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This year, party leaders made overtures to the president's son,
George W. Bush, but ''there was no response,'' Peters said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Consecrate Moscow Cathedral  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In an elaborate five-hour ceremony, Russian
Orthodox Church leaders on Saturday consecrated the Christ the
Savior Cathedral, the giant temple that has become a symbol of
Russia's religious rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Alexy II, dressed in a gold-embroidered robe and
flanked by bishops, began the ceremony with a procession outside
the recently completed church in the heart of Moscow. Once inside,
he anointed relics and blessed its main hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of onlookers, including Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyano,
and ordinary Russians who had traveled to Moscow from around the
country gathered under the cathedral's huge dome. Those who
couldn't fit in the church watched the ceremony on huge television
screens outside.
</P>
<P>
   The service included a prayer for the 118 crewmen of the Russian
nuclear submarine Kursk. The vessel sank in the Barents Sea a week
ago, and though rescue efforts continued Saturday, it appeared
unlikely that anyone aboard had survived.
</P>
<P>
   For many Orthodox believers, the cathedral has become a symbol
of Russia's religious rebirth after state-enforced atheism ended
with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The original church
was built to commemorate Russia's victory over Napoleon in 1812 and
was finished in 1883 after decades of construction. It was blown up
on the order of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin wanted to build a giant monument to the Soviet system in
its place, a skyscraper topped by a huge statue of Lenin called the
Palace of Soviets. Plans called for the building to be taller than
the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground at the site was swampy and unstable, and
construction was halted. The site was converted into an outdoor
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov made rebuilding the church a top
priority. He rejected criticism that the millions of dollars spent
on construction -- including money from the city budget -- would have
been better used to help impoverished Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Orthodox Church strongly backed the reconstruction, which
has been under way since 1995. Capable of holding up to 30,000
people in its main hall, the cathedral will become the location of
most major Orthodox religious services and ceremonies.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Fans Like New Stadium  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- There were long lines at ''Will Call'' ticket
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Non-working escalators forced some people to climb several
flights of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   But in its debut Saturday, Paul Brown Stadium got rave reviews
in a random sampling of fans at a preseason game between the
Cincinnati Bengals and the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beautiful -- especially from the other side of the river --
it's absolutely gorgeous,'' said Jane Grimm, of Fort Thomas, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, who have season tickets in the upper deck,
on the 45-yard line, had been eagerly looking forward to their
first trip to the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband's been like a 14-year-old all day,'' Grimm said.
''I really wanted to see the stadium and all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 66,500-seat stadium, named for the Bengals' founder, is next
to the Ohio River and on the edge of the city's business district.
Open notches in the four corners allow views of the skyline, river
and northern Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton County taxpayers in 1996 approved a half-cent sales tax
increase to build the stadium -- and a baseball park nearby for the
Reds -- after Bengals owner Mike Brown threatened to move his team
to another city.
</P>
<P>
   The $453 million stadium features curving canopies of woven
polyester fabric; heated, natural turf; and 114 private suites to
enhance the team's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really like it. It's state of the art,'' said Jay Atkinson
of Milford. ''It's amazing, when you think of the conservativeness
of this town, that we put that kind of money in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans cheered the opening ceremonies, including a perfectly timed
jet flyover after the national anthem, but had to endure two
Chicago touchdowns before the Bengals scored with two seconds left
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game, when Chicago led 14-0, suited Texas Love
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Love, from Springield, Tenn., wore a Bears cap and said he had
driven from suburban Nashville just to see his favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stadium's beautiful. But mostly I'm here to see the
Bears,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals fans will face a top ticket price of $50.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Mark 'Divided' Hebron  </HEADLINE>
By NASSER SHIYOUKHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Jewish settlers overturned market
stalls, Palestinians hurled stones and Israeli troops fired rubber
bullets in a three-way melee Saturday in this divided town.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence signaled how difficult it could be to carry
out a future peace treaty, including evicting Israelis from
communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said that was the message settlers in Hebron wanted
to send Saturday. ''The settlers want to put pressure on the
Israeli delegation (to the peace talks),'' said Mustafa Natche,
mayor of Hebron, a Palestinian town of 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leader Noam Arnon denied the allegations. He said
Palestinians have been throwing metal objects at settler homes in
recent weeks, and that two women were injured Saturday. Israeli
police said an Arab taxi struck and lightly injured a settler boy.
</P>
<P>
   In response, settlers closed Shuhada Street, a main thoroughfare
that passes by several of their heavily guarded compounds, to
Palestinian traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Fistfights erupted, and a group of about 40 to 50 settlers -- the
men wearing skullcaps and white Sabbath shirts -- walked into a
nearby outdoor vegetable market, overturning stalls. Israeli troops
intervened, scuffling with settlers and Palestinian vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes and cucumbers lay scattered on the ground. A
Palestinian woman shopper in a long robe and head scarf held her
hands to protect her head as she was hit by a young settler woman
who cursed her.
</P>
<P>
   Four soldiers pushed a Palestinian man into a van, pulling his
hair. Another soldier kicked a Palestinian with his boots and rifle
butt.
</P>
<P>
   The beatings angered Palestinian bystanders who hurled stones at
soldiers. Troops, in turn, fired rubber bullets to disperse the
stone-throwers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Palestinians were hospitalized with injuries from
beatings. An Israeli soldier was also hurt. Three settlers and
seven Palestinians were detained, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Amr, 25, one of the Palestinians involved in the
scuffles, said he would not accept any peace agreement that allowed
the Hebron settlers to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation will always remain tense between us and the
settlers. We cannot live together,'' said Amr.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been vague about his plans
for Hebron. Earlier this year he suggested that he wanted the
settlers to be able to remain indefinitely in the city, the burial
place of biblical patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Israeli media reports have said that in peace
negotiations, Barak was considering setting a limit of 13 to 15
years during which the settlers would have to leave Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he wanted to keep 80 percent of the 200,000
settlers under Israeli rule as part of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he would
declare the conflict with Israel over only after all issues have
been settled, including the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was responding to Barak's statement Thursday that he was
ready to accept Palestinian statehood, provided the Palestinians
proclaimed an end to the conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians face a Sept. 13 deadline to conclude
a peace treaty, and U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is visiting the region
to gauge prospects for a second Mideast summit at which a deal
could be wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, Ross met with the chief Israeli negotiator,
acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. Earlier in the day, Ross
held talks with Egyptian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Scott Dunlap Refuses To Wilt  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Done and dusted.
</P>
<P>
   Those were Scott Dunlap's words. That's what he remembered about
watching the majors on TV as a boy back in Georgia two dozen years
ago. Every time he saw Jack Nicklaus climb to the top of the
leaderboard, he knew the fate of everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Done and dusted.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dunlap put himself in the middle of that telecast,
knowing full well that the same thing has happened to everybody who
runs up against this generation's Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, in the
same situation. They wilt faster than lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   He did not.
</P>
<P>
   And by refusing to, Dunlap might have done more for himself, for
journeymen everywhere, and maybe more for golf than he is likely to
know. Dunlap started the day a stroke behind, then matched Woods
shot for shot, twitch for twitch and escape for escape, until the
only thing that separated at the end of the day was the same thing
separating them at the beginning -- a single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Both shot unsteady 70s, enabling Woods to remain the leader at
13 under. But because Bob May finished two groups earlier at 12
under, he goes off in the final group Sunday with Woods. Instead of
cursing his bad luck, Dunlap handed off Woods to his tag team
partner with some carefully chosen words.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, Bob will do the same thing I did,'' he said,
''which is get off to a good start and then ease into the round.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple enough. But this is what happened to some of
the names that found themselves paired with Tiger in the third
round of a major he went on to win:
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie was the fare on Saturday in the 1997 Masters.
Woods beat him by nine strokes. Lee Westwood took his place on the
menu in the PGA Championship a year ago. Woods waxed him by six.
Thomas Bjorn served himself up at Pebble Beach in June. Woods
drubbed him by 11. David Toms scored a moral victory in the British
Open. He only got beat by four.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, though, had a story like Dunlap's. There are
dozens of stories about journeymen in golf, but none of them read
quite like Dunlap's, either.
</P>
<P>
   He turned 37 on Wednesday. He's been a professional on three
continents, and maintained a playing card on five tours as recently
as last year. Dunlap used to joke that he was sponsored by
MasterCard, when what he meant was that he was constantly testing
his credit limit.
</P>
<P>
   He even lived with his parents until six years ago, so he could
chase his dream long after he'd exhausted every reason for doing
so.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long way from Duluth, Ga., to the final group Saturday.
Heck, it was a long way from where Dunlap began the second round
Friday. He had to make a pair of 12-footers to save par on the
first two holes, a 40-footer for birdie at No. 3 to kickstart his
round and another roller-coaster 35-footer at the 18th just to get
his shot at Woods. More impressive was what he did with it.
</P>
<P>
   A balky putter is what kept Dunlap picking his spots these last
few years, still circling the globe like some Ulysses in cleats. He
ranked 113th in putting on the PGA Tour last season and would have
had to stay on the move for this one until a change in his grip
wrought an even bigger change in his game and his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's opening round, Dunlap needed only 26 putts; on
Friday, 27. But Saturday, locked in a duel with the world's best
player, his trouble with the short stick returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just a little tentative with the putter,'' he said. ''Given
the situation, I guess it might be understandable. It's a little
bit disappointing, but I won't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's why: Dunlap figured he'd have two tests to pass this
weekend. The first was standing up to the pressure of major
championship golf, and in company of Woods, no less. He passed that
one, despite missing nine birdie putts inside 15 feet. The second
will be building on that result, trying not just to hold his place,
but to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tomorrow,'' Dunlap said before leaving for the day, ''is a
whole new test.''
</P>
<P>
   So it will be for Bob May, too. Like Dunlap, he has played
nearly all of his golf the last few years outside the United
States, choosing the European tour instead of the minitours back
home.
</P>
<P>
   But also like Dunlap, he has game now. And more important, a
chance to put into practice the lessons he spent all these years on
the road learning. He saw what Dunlap did with his shot, how he put
himself on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everyone wants to say I'm just a guy playing with Tiger,
that's fine,'' May said. ''Hopefully I'll have a good round and
maybe people will know me a little better.''

By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- With a spot on the Olympic team out of reach,
Trent Wells just wanted one good meet that he could look back on
with pride.
</P>
<P>
   An injury robbed him even of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wasn't in the hunt. I didn't see any way I was going
to make the team,'' he said. ''I just wanted to have a positive
meet to end on. It's unfortunate I couldn't finish out the meet I
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells over-rotated and undertwisted a somersault on his floor
routine and came crashing down on his left knee. He screamed in
pain as his kneecap shifted almost all the way to the back of his
leg, and a trainer ran out to help him.
</P>
<P>
   He lay on the ground for several minutes, writhing in pain,
before being helped to his feet. He couldn't put any weight on his
left leg as he left, but tests showed there was no ligament damage.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the floor later on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' injury ruined what had been a solid meet. He'd scored a
9.7 on parallel bars, a 9.475 on high bar and a 9.250 on the vault.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THORNTON OUT: Jay Thornton might be getting into the business
world sooner than he'd hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, a member of the last two world championship teams, was
expected to contend for a spot on the Sydney Olympic squad. But he
wound up 11th overall Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my dream. I came up a little short in '96 and came up
short again,'' he said. ''But I've had a good career. In the last
three years, I've made two world championship teams. I'm very proud
of what I did. I have every reason to hold my head high.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who started ''American Gymnast Journal'' with teammate
Stephen McCain, said he's not sure what he'll do now. He knows he's
going to go home and spend some time with his wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he might try his hand in the business world. Or
maybe he'll stick around for another year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to let this settle in and adjust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   WHERE'S BELA? It's not too hard to find Bela Karolyi during
the Olympic trials. Just find Vanessa Atler, and Karolyi will be
close by.
</P>
<P>
   With her bubbly personality and quick smile, Atler has the star
appeal of a Mary Lou Retton or Kim Zmeskal. Those were two of
Karolyi's favorites, and he's taken a similar liking to Atler.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Karolyi, who came out of retirement last November to
become the national team coordinator, isn't a personal coach
anymore, he's lent a hand in Alter's training the last couple of
months. So whenever she gets ready for an event, Atler looks to
Karolyi for a reassuring nod.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to look at him because it helps,'' said Atler, in sixth
place overall going into Sunday's finals. ''He's been really
motivating.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Karolyi kept a keen eye on Atler as she moved
from apparatus to apparatus. When she was on the uneven bars, the
event that's given her plenty of trouble the last couple of years,
Karolyi wandered out into the middle of the floor so he could get a
better view of her routine.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi's presence must have helped because Atler made it
through her bar routines with only a minor glitch and scored a
9.212.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't as fortunate on the balance beam, however. She
slipped on her dismount and went crashing to the floor, landing on
her back with a loud smack. As the audience gasped, Karolyi rushed
to the edge of the floor to comfort Atler.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked worse than it was. It didn't hurt,'' she said. ''I
think he was just trying to make sure I didn't get discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOT RESTING EASY: If anyone seems to have spots sewn up on the
women's Olympic team it would be national champion Elise Ray and
runner-up Kristen Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell them that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone sleeps easy at these things,'' said Ray's
coach, Kelli Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they don't, no matter how good their last performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ray scored a 38.811 in the first round of trials Friday, better
than either of her scores last month in St. Louis, when she became
national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the national title, you put a little more pressure on
yourself because you know people are looking at you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney echoed the sentiment. She is in second place in the
overall standings after another solid performance. Nationals marked
her first full competition since operations on her right shin and
shoulder late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more pressure because once you get there, everyone
expects you to stay there,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DOWN AND OUT: Kendall Beck first felt the inflammation in her
left hip earlier this week, but she hoped she could tolerate it
long enough to make it through the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   After a fall on the uneven bars, her first event Friday night,
she realized the pain was going to be too much to continue. The
19-year-old withdrew before her second event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really tough to be out there at all,'' she said. ''I
kept thinking the last couple of days that I wouldn't be able to
make it, but I just couldn't make myself say it. It was probably
the hardest decision of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EXPERIENCE COUNTS: While the rest of the gymnasts battled
nerves, Amy Chow treated the first round of the Olympic trials like
it was any other meet.
</P>
<P>
   She's been here before, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, a member of the Magnificent Seven and a silver medalist on
the uneven bars in the Atlanta Olympics, finished second Friday
night and is in third place overall heading into Sunday's finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what to expect now because I've been through this
before. That makes it a little easier,'' she said. ''I felt pretty
calm. I felt like I was ready to go out there and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow will have even more fun if she makes the Olympic team. She
took a year off from Stanford, where she's a junior majoring in
biology, to train for the Sydney Games.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas hit his AL-leading 38th homer,
doubled and drove in four runs as Mike Sirotka and the Chicago
White Sox beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 7-0 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka (11-10) combined with three relievers on a three-hitter
as the White Sox won for the sixth time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez reached 100 RBIs for the second consecutive
season, and fifth time by a White Sox right fielder. He singled
home a run in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning, leaving him
three shy of his career high set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also doubled home a run in the third. He has 115 RBIs,
three behind league leader Edgar Martinez of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka won for the second time in his last six starts, giving
up three hits and five walks and striking out two in six innings.
Bill Simas, Kelly Wunsch and Lorenzo Barcelo each pitched one
inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (10-9), who was coming off back to back complete
game wins, gave up seven runs -- six earned -- on 10 hits and two
walks over 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham singled to lead off the Chicago first, advanced on
Jose Valentin's bunt single and scored one out later on Ordonez's
single.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a double with two outs in the third to score
Valentin, who had singled.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fifth, Charles Johnson walked, reached third
on Durham's double and scored when Valentin grounded out to make it
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez reached second on left fielder Steve Cox's error to lead
off the sixth. Ordonez hit a fly ball to shallow left center and
shortstop Felix Martinez appeared to call for it. But Cox ran in,
Martinez backed off and Cox dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Herbert Perry singled to score Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pitcher Ken Hill, who was released earlier this month by
Anaheim and signed a minor league contract with the White Sox, gave
up two runs on six hits and no walks over four innings for Triple-A
Charlotte Saturday night. He struck out seven. ... 2B Bobby Smith
was reinstated from the disabled list and started for Tampa Bay.
Smith had been sidelined since July 6 with a sprained right knee.
... Saturday night's crowd of 38,926 was the eighth sellout this
season at Comiskey Park. The White Sox have had 21 crowds of
30,000-plus at home. Last year, they had six.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Orioles 0  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mac Suzuki became the second Kansas City
pitcher in two days to pitch his first major league complete game
against Baltimore, scattering four hits Saturday night as the
Royals stretched their winning streak to four with a 7-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Randa hit a three-run homer and Jermaine Dye had a solo shot
for the Royals, who ended the five-game winning streak of Baltimore
starter Jose Mercedes (8-5). It was the right-hander's first loss
in eight starts since July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki (7-7) struck out four and walked three in his 40th career
start. He allowed only one runner past second base in beating the
Orioles for the second time in six days.
</P>
<P>
   It was his second straight win following a four-game stretch in
which he went 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Stein pitched his first complete game Friday night for the
Royals, who outscored Baltimore 11-1 in the first two games of the
series. Kansas City is 7-1 against the Orioles this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brook Fordyce had two hits for the Orioles, who have lost seven
of 10 to fall a season-high 16 games under .500 (53-69).
</P>
<P>
   The Royals led 1-0 before Randa connected in the sixth, hitting
his 12th homer of the season an estimated 374 feet into the
left-field seats with two aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City made it 6-0 in the seventh when Johnny Damon tripled
in a run and scored on a single by Mike Sweeney. The hit extended
Damon's hitting streak to 14 games, and the RBI was Sweeney's
109th.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's hit chased Mercedes, who had a 2.30 ERA since the
All-Star break. He gave up six runs and eight hits in six-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dye hit his 29th homer in the ninth off rookie Jay Spurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore missed a chance to score in the third when a two-out
drive in the right-center gap by Fordyce bounced into the seats for
a ground-rule double, forcing Jeff Conine to stop at third. Ryan
Minor then grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals loaded the bases with no outs in the fourth, but
managed only one run on a grounder by Mark Quinn.
Notes: Damon scored his 106th run to remain tied with Alex
Rodriguez for the league lead. ... Minor went 0-for-3 and is
1-for-23 in his last eight games. ... KC is 11-7 in August. ... The
Orioles fell a season-high 15&AMP;frac12; games out of first place in the AL
East.

<HEADLINE> Two Melanomas Removed from McCain  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Preliminary findings show that cancer has not
spread to Sen. John McCain's lymph nodes, his doctor said Saturday
after more than five hours of surgery to remove skin cancer from
his temple and upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's internist, Dr. John Eckstein, said the surgery to
remove the two melanomas, the most serious form of skin cancer,
went exactly as expected and without complications.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the melanoma from his left arm involved a simple
excision, Eckstein said. The surgery on the left temple was more
extensive and included the removal of lymph nodes from the face and
neck and a salivary gland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased to let you know that the preliminary report on
the lymph nodes ... was clear without any evidence of melanoma
cells,'' he said. ''However it will take several days to fully
evaluate the removed surgical tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   The former GOP presidential candidate was recovering at the Mayo
Clinic Hospital and was expected to remain there for two to three
days, Eckstein said. ''At this time we are very optimistic and are
very pleased for Senator and Mrs. McCain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery followed earlier tests that found no signs that the
cancer spread beyond the two new melanomas. The lymph nodes removed
Saturday from around the cancerous lesions were being tested to
help determine whether the surgery was the only treatment
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer had reached one or more of the lymph nodes,
treatment is more complicated and less likely to cure the cancer,
melanoma experts said. Options include anti-cancer drugs and
stimulating the immune system to try to fight the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook would have been much worse if the cancer had spread
to McCain's organs, since that stage of melanoma is extremely
difficult to treat, said Dr. John Glaspy, a researcher at UCLA's
Jonsson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found the melanomas after McCain left the Republican
National Convention to have biopsies performed at Bethesda Naval
Hospital near Washington on Aug. 4. His office announced the
results of the those tests on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who turns 64 on Aug. 29, said he has seen his doctor for
checkups every three or four months since he had a lesion removed
from his shoulder seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is usually caused by exposure to the sun. People with
fair skin, like McCain, have a higher risk of skin cancer. McCain
spent hours in the Arizona sun campaigning for Congress in 1982 and
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
   The news of McCain's cancer came during the Democratic National
Convention and just days after he toured Western states with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the victor in a spirited Republican nomination
campaign in which McCain won seven primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has canceled about a dozen campaign events with GOP
congressional candidates since learning of the skin cancer
diagnosis. Republican leaders had counted on McCain's help to win
independent voters and keep the GOP majorities in the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain said Friday he planned to return to campaigning
by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy McCain said her husband was cracking jokes in his room
after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of my prayers have been answered,'' she said. ''My husband
is in wonderful shape.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Castellano charged with larceny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COCHECTON, N.Y. (AP) - Actor Richard Castellano was arrested
Friday and charged with taking more than $5,000 in exchange for
Screen Actors Guild cards he never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano, who had a role in ''Analyze This,'' was charged with
a felony count of grand larceny after police said he kept the money
but never delivered the cards, needed to work in major films.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for SAG told the Middletown Times Herald-Record
there is ''no way'' Castellano can get anyone the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano was arrested while he was in court answering charges
of misdemeanor assault and writing a bad check for $5,000. If found
guilty, he could face more than a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano also faces $11,215 in claims from 14 actors who
worked on his film, ''Four Deadly Reasons,'' who say they are owed
back pay. His former lawyer also sued the actor, claiming he owes
her $330 in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano has said he owes more than $200,000 to people who
lent him money or acted and invested in the film which has yet to
be released.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Egypt Discuss Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
By JASPER MORTIMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross met with
Egypt's foreign minister on Saturday, as Egyptian officials said
they were drawing up ideas in a bid to break the stalemate over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa discussed ''overcoming
obstacles'' in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process during their
talks near the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria, a
government statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross then returned to Israel, were he held talks with Israel's
chief negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami, Saturday night. He is expected to
meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy is looking in to possibilities for progress after
the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian summit at Camp David last
month. With journalists kept far from the Alexandria talks, unusual
secrecy has surround the consultations in Egypt, a key mediator in
the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, say they are working with the Palestinians to develop a
plan for Jerusalem that will be submitted to the United States and
Israel. They did not reveal any details.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based Al Hayat newspaper reported Friday that Egypt
was consulting international law experts, presumably to ensure the
plan would be compatible with U.N. Security Council resolutions on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiator Ben-Ami said he would meet Thursday with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and a senior Palestinian official
said Jordan's King Abdullah would hold talks with Arafat in the
West Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian political analyst Mohammed Sid Ahmed said a fear of
violence if attempts to secure a peace deal fail is a strong
motivation for all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties cannot afford to accept defeat because they have a
common interest in not having the situation get out of hand,'' Sid
Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, that may not be grounds for optimism that a final
solution on the fate of east Jerusalem -- one of the toughest
remaining issues -- is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is more likely trying to find a way to make it easier for
Arafat to postpone the Sept. 13 date he has set for declaring
statehood, Sid Ahmed said. One way to do so, he said, is by making
progress on the main obstacle at Camp David: sovereignty over east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the July summit, Barak reportedly offered the Palestinians
limited control over parts of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
The Palestinians held firm in their longstanding position that the
entire area, which includes the third-holiest shrine in Islam as
well as Christian and Jewish holy sites, must be under Palestinian
control.

<HEADLINE> Groups Want FDA To Approve Eclipse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Twenty-two public-health
organizations have asked the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate Eclipse, a new reduced-smoke cigarette that R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. claims is safer than other cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The groups, including the American Cancer Society and American
Medical Association, signed a petition sent to the FDA this month
seeking the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm concerned people will switch to Eclipse falsely believing
it's been proven it will reduce their risk of disease,'' said
Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who
wrote the letter. ''It is precisely these types of claims the FDA
protects the American public against.''
</P>
<P>
   Eclipse is a nicotine-delivery system, not a cigarette, making
it eligible for government regulation, the petition says. The
Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that Congress did not give
the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds says testing of Eclipse, which heats tobacco instead of
burning it, shows the cigarette lowers a smoker's risk of cancer,
chronic bronchitis and possibly emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   ''The claim that Eclipse may present smokers with less risk of
cancer, chronic bronchitis and possibly emphysema is fully
supported by extensive scientific research,'' RJR spokesman Seth
Moskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates and the Clinton administration are
skeptical of such claims and say Eclipse still doesn't eliminate
the health risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA plans to investigate the issue. ''We are looking into
it, and we are concerned,'' said FDA spokeswoman Laura Bradbard.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, anti-tobacco forces pressed for FDA regulation
of Premier, Reynolds Tobacco's first attempt at a smokeless
cigarette. Reynolds pulled the brand from the market in 1989 before
the agency made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The group also sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission
calling for action against Reynolds for what the letter calls false
and misleading advertising of Eclipse.

McCain Healing After Surgery
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Sen. John McCain spent more than five hours in surgery today
to remove skin cancer from his temple and upper arm, and his doctor said
preliminary findings show that the cancer had not spread to his lymph nodes.
McCain's internist, Dr. John Eckstein, said the surgery to remove the two
melanomas, the most serious form of skin cancer, went exactly as expected and
without complications.

Clinton Celebrates 54th Birthday
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated a quiet 54th birthday
Saturday with his family in the Adirondack Mountains, careful not to divert
attention from Al Gore's campaign. The president, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, daughter Chelsea and family dog Buddy holed up at the home of Arthur
Lussi, a wealthy real estate man who owns area resorts. Gore, meantime, was
continuing his Mississippi River boat trip -- and celebrating wife Tipper's 52nd
birthday, also Saturday -- on his first post-convention political trip as the
Democratic nominee for president.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Newsweek poll of registered voters out today put
Democratic nominee Al Gore ahead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Gore had 48

poll after the Republican National Convention two weeks ago.

Anti-Nazi Groups March in Germany
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Thousands of anti-Nazi activists demonstrated in
three German cities on Saturday, while a court struck down a ban on a planned
neo-Nazi demonstration in the northern port city of Hamburg set for Sunday.
About 2,000 people marched in Hamburg in a demonstration organized by labor
unions, churches, and citizens groups, while 1,000 marched in the northeastern
city of Rostock and 350 people took part in a demonstration in Eisenach in the
eastern state of Thuringia. The anti-Nazi demonstrations came a day after
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called on Germans to help stamp out violence and
discrimination against minorities following a recent string of attacks on
foreigners.

Son of Pro-Russian Leader Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The body of a pro-Russia Chechen official's son was
found Saturday bound to a tree and bearing deep wounds from a grenade explosion,
officials said. The 18-year-old son of the mayor of Urus-Martan was kidnapped
Wednesday and killed with a grenade, said an official of the pro-Moscow Chechen
government. The killing of Salavat Gibartayev appeared to be the latest in a
string of rebel attacks aimed at Chechens who cooperate with the Russian
government, the official said. The rebels have repeatedly warned Chechens
against joining forces with the Kremlin, labeling them as traitors.

Russia Losing Hope For Sub Survivors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials admitted today that all 118 sailors trapped
for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British mini-sub
and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in the Arctic
depths. What little hope remained for any survivors was pinned on the new
arrivals. The Norwegian team approached the site after midnight, but would
reportedly not start their dive until after dawn -- apparently to avoid diving
in darkness.

Warmer Weather Melts North Pole Ice
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in 50 million years, visitors to the
North Pole can see something extraordinary: water. The thick ice that covers the
Arctic Ocean at the North Pole has melted, leaving a mile-wide stretch of water
at the top of the world, The New York Times reported Saturday. The water could
be the result of global warming, although there is a debate among experts about
the cause. Some believe it could simply be a natural occurrence rather than the
result of a ''greenhouse effect'' caused by manmade pollution and increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Woods Falters, But Leads PGA Golf

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Just when it looked as though Tiger Woods might take
all the drama out of the PGA Championship, a shocking turn of events today left
him clinging to a one-stroke lead over Bob May and the unflappable Scott Dunlap.
Woods missed a 2-foot putt for his first double bogey in 153 holes of major
championship golf, then had to survive some suddenly errant shots for a 2-under

Francisco Giants beat the Atlanta Braves 12-3 today for their sixth straight
win. With the Braves leading 3-2 in the sixth, Barry Bonds was hit by a pitch,
went to third on Jeff Kent's single, and scored when J.T. Snow's popup to left
was lost in the sun by B.J. Surhoff.

<HEADLINE> JFK and Son Statue Planned in Mass.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARNSTABLE, Mass. (AP) -- President John F. Kennedy died when his
son John Jr. was just a toddler, but a bronze statue will picture
an imaginary moment the two might have shared as adults.
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 statue will depict the two men walking along a
beach, with Kennedy's arm around his son's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnstable Town Council approved a request by the Hyannis
Area Chamber of Commerce on Thursday to place the statue on town
land, perhaps as soon as the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce commissioned sculptor David Lewis to
create the statue after consulting with President Kennedy's
brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and daughter, Caroline
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both father and son were cut down in the prime of their
life,'' said Robert Sennott, who heads the chamber's statue
committee. ''This makes poetic, if not literal, sense.''
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy was 46 when he was assassinated in Dallas in
1963. His son was 38 when his plane crashed into the Atlantic on
July 16, 1999, killing him, his wife and her sister.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Try To Recover From Minn.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals have had it with
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   The last two times they've played on it, they've lost four
players with serious knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victims were big-play wide receiver Rob Moore and
reserve cornerback Coby Rhinehart, both hurt in the team's 35-17
loss to Minnesota in the Metrodome on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona's final game on turf last season, in Atlanta,
defensive tackle Rashod Swinger and safety Tommy Bennett went down
with knee injuries. Neither has returned to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turf is terrible,'' running back Michael Pittman said
Saturday. ''My wife taped it and I saw Coby's knee and Rob's. If it
was grass, I guarantee you they'd still be playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A subdued coach Vince Tobin said at his morning-after news
conference that injuries on artificial turf should be an obvious
concern to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not the only team that's had injuries on artificial turf
and I'm certainly sure that the league is exploring all of the
options of what they can and can't do to make the game safer,''
Tobin said. ''That's been a source of concern on late hits and a
lot of things, and I'm sure that surface is one of the things
they're studying very, very hard, but there aren't a lot of easy
answers right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had four guys hurt in two ball games on turf, and it's
been awful hard on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also lost J.J. McCleskey, a key special teams
player as well as backup defensive back, with a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly lost a big part of our depth, that's for sure,''
Tobin said. ''Coby Rhinehart had been playing very well for us.
J.J. McCleskey has been a very valuable part of our team for
several years, not only for what he brings on the field but what he
brings off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very competitive young man and a great special teamer
and he's going to be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tobin said he had not received the MRI results from
team doctors, Moore and Rhinehart are believed to be out for the
season. Moore has a torn medial collateral ligament in his left
knee, Rhinehart a torn MCL and lateral collateral ligament in his
right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Three other players went out with lesser injuries -- outside
linebacker Johnny Rutledge with a sprained right knee, defensive
tackle Jerry Drake with a sprained right knee and middle linebacker
Ronald McKinnon with a bruised thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that it's been a blow to our psyche, but
we've got to put it behind us and move on,'' Tobin said. ''Nobody
cares who you've lost. The only thing they care about is whether
you win on Sunday. I think our players understand that and they'll
bounce back and we'll get ready to play and have a good football
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals figured to enter the season with one of the NFL's
best trio of wide receivers -- Moore, Frank Sanders and David
Boston. The injury to Moore increases the pressure on Boston and
leaves the team searching for a third receiver. The candidates have
all struggled in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Mar Tay Jenkins, a fast, second-year receiver who has yet to
catch a pass in a regular season game, dropped two Friday night,
including one that would have been a touchdown. Mac Cody and Andy
McCullough are among the other possibilities, but both have been
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spotlight falls on Boston, a second-year player who had
six catches for 68 yards Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''He certainly has the ability to be a star in this league,''
Tobin said. ''I don't think there's any question about that. He's
very, very young. He needs to develop as a starter now. I've got to
believe that he's going to step up and see this as an opportunity
and run with it.''

Athletics-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi was expected to miss both weekend games
with a strained left shoulder. He has seen limited action since
leaving Monday's game with the injury. ''We're going to give Jason
a couple days off to see if it gets better,'' manager Art Howe
said. ''If that doesn't help, we are going to have to take a long,
hard look at the future.'' ... Howe made two changes to Saturday's
lineup to try to jump-start his offense, giving starts to CF Ryan
Christenson and C Sal Fasano.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers have won or split 13 of their last 16
series, which manager Phil Garner credits with Detroit's run to
.500. ''After that miserable 9-23 start, we've been playing really
solid baseball,'' he said.
Rangers-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers started two players who had appeared in just
five major league games each this season -- catcher B.J. Waszgis,
who was 4-for-9, and designated hitter Pedro Valdes, who was
0-for-5. They were a combined 1-for-6 Saturday. ... Texas batters
had walked eight times in their previous five games and went into
the game with little hope of doing batter against Pedro Martinez,
who issued three walks in his previous five games. On Saturday, he
walked none. ... Texas has lost nine straight games decided by two
runs or less.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: A youngster in the front row received a souvenir after
Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek apparently made contact with him
while trying to catch a pop fly along the third-base line. Home
plate umpire Wally Bell handed the boy, who appeared to be fighting
back tears, a baseball. Varitek rubbed the boy's head. After the
inning, Bell walked over to the boy and gave him a high-five. ...
In Boston's last two games, starters Tomo Ohka and Martinez retired
41 of 49 batters they faced. Each pitched seven innings. ... Asked
if he had seen much difference in 3B Lou Merloni since he returned
after starting this season in Japan, manager Jimy Williams said,
''His Japanese is probably a little better.'' Merloni has three
three-hit games and is 14-for-24 in six games since being called up
Monday from Triple-A Pawtucket.
White Sox-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Cal Eldred, sidelined since July 14 because of an
irritated nerve in his elbow, threw 28 pitches from the mound
Saturday and had no pain. Eldred, throwing from the mound for the
first time, will next throw on Monday. General manager Ron Schueler
said he hoped to get Eldred a rehab start in the minors soon. ...
RHP Jon Garland, who was hit on the right forearm in Friday night's
game, received medical treatment Saturday. Manager Jerry Manuel
said he still did not know whether Garland would miss a start. ...
Sunday is ''Dog Day'' at Comiskey Park in which pet owners can
bring their pooches. The dog section, located in the bleachers, is
sold out.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: INF Bobby Smith, who has been on the DL since July 6
because of a sprained right knee, was activated Saturday. OF
Quinton McCracken was optioned to Triple-A Durham to make room for
Smith, who was 5-for-18 during a rehab assignment at Durham. ... OF
Gerald Williams is one home run away from becoming the 25th player
in major league history to hit at least 20 home runs from the
leadoff spot. Williams, who hit his 19th on Friday night, would
become the 14th American League player to do so.
Twins-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins are 19-16 since the All-Star break. ... RHP
Brad Radke is 4-3 with a 5.44 ERA in his last eight starts. ...
David Ortiz walked four times in Saturday's game, one short of the
club record.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Toronto's starters have combined to pitch 13 2-3
scoreless innings in the first two games of the series. ... SS Alex
Gonzalez's hitting streak ended at 15.
Angels-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Darin Erstad, the major leagues' hit leader with 189,
left with a muscle spasm in his left rib cage. He is day-to-day.
''Hopefully, he's not going to be out any extended period of
time,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ... RHP Brian Cooper was
recalled from Triple-A Edmonton to make the start and RHP Al Levine
was activated from the 15-day DL. The Angels optioned INF Keith
Johnson and outrighted RHP Eric Weaver to Edmonton. Cooper gave up
eight runs -- six earned -- and eight hits in four innings. ''I was
just getting behind in the count and you just can't do that with
these guys. The ball just ain't going where I want it to go,'' he
said. ... The Angels, the only team to win the season series from
the Yankees the past two seasons, are 4-5 against New York with one
game remaining in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: OF Bernie Williams, mired in a 3-for-32 slump, was
scratched after feeling a twinge in his right rib cage during
batting practice. ''Hopefully it will improve tomorrow and he'll be
able to play,'' manager Joe Torre said. ''If not, we'll have to
figure out what to do.'' Clay Bellinger made his first career start
in center. ... The Yankees blew a five-run lead at home in the
ninth inning for only the second time in franchise history Friday.
On Aug. 18, 1953 -- exactly 47 years earlier -- New York also blew an
8-3 lead, losing 10-8 to the Washington Senators. ''That one hurt a
lot,'' closer Mariano Rivera said. ''It was ridiculous. It was
tough to deal with, but today is a new day.''
Mariners-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Jamie Moyer couldn't stop the Mariners' losing streak,
which grew to seven games after a 10-4 loss to the Indians on
Saturday. During the streak, Mariners starters are 0-5 with a 8.64
ERA. ... Odds favored the Mariners to win on Saturday. Although
they are now 0-9 in the first game of a road trip, the club was 7-1
in Game 2s before the loss. ... Seattle hasn't lost eight straight
since a club record 14-game slide in 1992. ... The Mariners have
been alone in first place since June 29. However, with Saturday's
loss, they dropped to 18-19 since the All-Star break. ...
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manny Ramirez's 13 career grand slams are a franchise
record and the most ever by a Latin American player. Danny
Tartabull hit 12. Ramirez is also tied for 12th on the career slams
list. Lou Gehrig holds the record with 23. ... CF Kenny Lofton, who
homered for the second straight game, is batting .342 (13 for 38)
with two homers and five RBIs in his last nine games. ... RHP Jason
Bere underwent ''Tommy John'' elbow surgery in 1995, but it wasn't
until this year that he had been able to effectively throw a
curveball again. ''Being a two-pitch pitcher is tough to do against
big league hitters,'' Bere said after beating Seattle on Saturday.
''Especially for seven-plus innings.''
Royals-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: With three games remaining against Baltimore, the
Royals have already clinched the season series. KC won six of seven
before Saturday. ... Rookie Mark Quinn, who had his eight-game
hitting streak ended Friday, got his 47th start at DH Saturday.
He's also started 49 in the outfield. ... After making six errors
in his first 30 games at first base, Mike Sweeney made just two in
his next 58 games at the position.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Pat Rapp returned home to Louisiana to be with
his critically ill father. ... SS Melvin Mora was in the starting
lineup Saturday despite making errors in each of his last five
games. ''Melvin is not playing tired right now,'' manager Mike
Hargrove said. ... The Orioles are last in the AL with a 5.78 ERA.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Pokey Reese was held out of the Reds' lineup for the
second consecutive game because of tightness in his left hamstring.
... Barry Larkin didn't play after experiencing soreness in his
left knee in Friday night's game. He remains one hit shy of 2,000.
... Saturday's paid attendance of 34,370 brought the Reds' season
total to 2,030,505 in 61 home dates, the fastest the Reds have
reached the 2 million milestone.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: 3B Aramis Ramirez left Saturday's game with a
bruised left hand after being hit by a pitch in the second inning.
It was the second time this week he was hit on the hand, and he was
taken to a Cincinnati hospital for a bone scan.
Brewers-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Geoff Jenkins, who broke up Wade Miller's no-hit bid
with a seventh-inning home run Friday night, is batting .330 with
13 home runs and 33 RBI on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Entering Saturday's game, Astros starting pitchers had
won four straight games, the longest streak since Sept. 11-14,
1999. In that span, the starters had a 3.81 ERA. ... Jeff Bagwell
is just two home runs short of reaching the 300-homer mark and will
become the 87th player to do that. Bagwell has hit six home runs in
his last eight games. ... Houston has never been good to the
Brewers. They are 4-13 overall, including a 4-12 record in the
Astrodome.
Marlins-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Manager John Boles turned 52 Saturday. When asked if he
was going to celebrate, Boles said: ''Playing in this park is wild
enough for me. This is like New Year's Eve coming to Colorado. This
is as heart-pounding as it gets for me. ... OF Cliff Floyd took
batting practice Saturday and could return from the disabled list
next Friday. Floyd has been sidelined by torn cartilage in his left
knee. ... SS Alex Gonzalez (sprained knee) took ground balls
Saturday but no date has been set for his return from the DL.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Manager Buddy Bell kept OF Larry Walker out of the
lineup to give his right elbow some rest. Walker has not fully
recovered from offseason surgery. ... C Brent Mayne missed his
second straight start because of a sore ankle. He was available to
pinch hit Saturday night. ... When asked if he had been through
anything like Todd Helton's chase for .400, Bell said the only
comparison was when Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb's career hit record in
1985.
Phillies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies manager Terry Francona says he is holding
up despite being booed at home games and a newspaper reader's poll
asking fans if he should be fired. Francona was booed every time he
appeared on the field during the Phillies recent homestand, but he
says he is not upset. ''I've been released five times, I'm bald and
I have a big nose,'' he said. ''I'll make it through this, I'll
handle it.'' ... The Phillies are considering replacing their
artificial turf with a more grass-like surface in time for next
season. One surface being considered is the type used at Tropicana
Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''One of the things we don't know is
how that surface would hold up outdoors,'' said Phillies assistant
general manager Ruben Amaro.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Britt Reames will make his major league debut when he
starts for the Cardinals against the Phillies on Sunday. Reames has
been activated to replace Andy Benes, who went on the disabled list
with an injured knee. Reames was 6-2 at Triple-A Memphis with a
2.28 ERA in 13 starts. ... The Cardinals will unveil a statue of
Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby outside Busch Stadium before Sunday's
game. Hornsby's grandson and great grandson will attend the
ceremonies. ... The only player in professional baseball with 100
steals this season is Esix Snead, who plays for the Cardinals'
Class A Potomac club in the Carolina League. He has 100 steals in
117 games.
Cubs-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Sammy Sosa, who hit two homers Friday night, has tied
Carlton Fisk for No. 46 on the career home run list with 376. Sosa
has 40 home runs this year, the fourth time in five years that he
has topped the 40 mark. With 147 hits, Sosa is on pace for 54 home
runs and 198 hits. Only three players have had more than 50 homers
and 200 hits in one season -- Babe Ruth in 1921, Hack Wilson in 1930
and Jimmie Foxx in 1932. ... Friday night's 11-2 loss to Arizona's
Curt Schilling marked the first time in three years that pitchers
had thrown consecutive complete games against the Cubs. Darryl Kile
had a complete game victory in Chicago on Wednesday. ... In the
seven games leading up to Saturday night, the Cubs had scored just
16 runs, batted .215 and stranded 53 runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Todd Stottlemyre threw three innings in a simulated
game Saturday and remained on schedule for a return to the starting
rotation on Sept. 2 or 3. Stottlemyre threw 50 pitches before the
team took batting practice at Bank One Ballpark. He is scheduled to
pitch two minor league rehab outings, probably with the
Diamondbacks' Arizona Rookie League team. Stottlemyre has been on
the disabled list since June 26 with tendinitis in his right elbow.
... RF David Dellucci got his first start Saturday since being
recalled from Triple-A Tucson. Dellucci's career nearly ended last
year because of a rare condition that threatened the use of his
left wrist and hand. After surgery, his comeback this year was
slowed by a dislocated finger and tendinitis in his right wrist.
Mets-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets' bullpen has not blown a save opportunity
since July 14, converting all 15 save opportunities since then and
winning all seven decisions. Armando Benitez has allowed only one
earned run over 23 innings since June 21, and his save ratio (32 of
36) is the best in the NL. ... Lenny Harris leads all active major
leaguers with 124 career pinch-hits, 26 fewer than all-time leader
Manny Mota. ... Todd Pratt started Saturday's game behind the plate
instead of Mike Piazza, who caught Friday night's three-hour,
42-minute marathon. ... Rick Reed's 4-1 loss Saturday was his first
in five career decisions at Dodger Stadium, and first in nine road
starts since a 7-2 setback at San Francisco on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Of the Dodgers' 62 victories, 39 have been
come-from-behind efforts -- the most in the majors. ... Chan Ho Park
has allowed no more than three earned runs in any of his last eight
starts, but is only 3-3 during that span. ... Saturday's crowd of
53,051 on ''Backpack Day'' represented the Dodgers' sixth home
sellout this season. The other five sellouts were on Opening Day,
''Pokemon Trading Card Day,'' ''T-Shirt Night,'' ''Sports Watch
Night,'' and ''Rally Towel Night.'' ... Gary Sheffield's two homers
Saturday raised his season total to 40, tying him with Mike Piazza
for the most by a Dodger since the team moved from Brooklyn to Los
Angeles in 1958. Sheffield is two homers shy of his career high,
set in 1996 with the Florida Marlins. ... When Antonio Osuna
pitched the ninth inning of Friday night's 5-3 loss to the Mets, he
earned a $35,000 bonus for making 35 appearances this season.
Another 1 2-3 innings will bring his season total to 55 and earn
him an additional $50,000. It wasn't easy for the right-hander, who
didn't pitch for the Dodgers from May 18, 1999, through May 5 of
this season because of elbow problems. ... Eric Karros, who usually
has a slow first half and a strong second half, has reversed that
trend this season. He is batting .243 with only three homers and 16
RBIs in 33 games since the All-Star break, after hitting .265 with
25 homers and 70 RBIs in 83 games before the break.
Braves-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Manager Bobby Cox is four wins away from tying Tommy
Lasorda on the all-time victories list for a manager. Lasorda has
1,559 wins. ... Cox was tossed out of Saturday's game for arguing a
call, the fifth time he's been tossed this season. ... Andruw Jones
is the only major leaguer to have played in every inning of every
game this season. ... B.J. Surhoff was learning about Pacific Bell
Parks little quirks, including a rather sunny outfield this time of
year. Surhoff missed a fly ball hit by J.T. Snow that scored a run.
''I don't know what else I could have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants are 13-5 in August. ... The flu the
kept Ellis Burks out of the lineup Friday night is traveling around
the Giants' clubhouse. ''I hope I don't get it,'' manager Dusty
Baker said. The flu is marked by a headache and sore throat. But
Burks made a quick recovery, hitting two homers and driving in four
runs on Saturday. ... After Friday night's game, the Giants
activated Joe Nathan from the disabled list and optioned Miguel Del
Toro to Triple-A Fresno. Baker said before Saturday's game that
Nathan would be used in long relief.
Expos-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: RHP Carl Pavano and LHP Scott Downs, two of the Expos'
10 pitchers on the disabled list, will visit Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham, Ala., on Monday. Pavano (right triceps tendinitis)
started a throwing program on Aug. 1, while Downs (sprained left
elbow) has yet to throw after injuring his arm on Aug. 8. ... A
bruised left thumb continues to keep LF Peter Bergeron out of the
starting lineup. ... RHP Felipe Lira, Sunday's starter, will make
only his second start of the season. Lira is one of 13 starting
pitchers the Expos have used.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Scouting director Brad Sloan is being reassigned to a
position as a special assistant to general manager Kevin Towers.
Sloan has worked out of his home in Illinois and Towers wants his
scouting director to be located in San Diego. ... Former Padres
star Dave Winfield was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame.
Winfield, who played the first eight years of his career with San
Diego, had his uniform number (31) retired and a banner with his
picture hung from the top of Qualcomm Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promotes Education Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESILLA, N.M. (AP) -- George W. Bush sharpened his attacks on
rival Al Gore on Saturday as he began a post-convention campaign
and advertising blitz of battleground states with a focus on
education.
</P>
<P>
   ''My legislative priority will be to improve public education in
America,'' the Republican presidential nominee asserted at rallies
here and in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his campaign released the text of a new
education-oriented television ad that will begin airing Monday in
21 states.
</P>
<P>
   The ad includes footage from Bush's GOP convention speech pledge
to ''teach all our children to read and renew the promise of
America's public school.''
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, the ads are timed to coincide with visits by
Bush or running mate Dick Cheney between now and Labor Day, aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two, either together or separately, will visit 19 states
between the end of the Democratic convention last Thursday and Aug.
31, including 16 states carried by President Clinton in 1996, said
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   After a boisterous home state rally in Dallas, Bush traveled to
New Mexico, which voted Democratic in both 1992 and 1996, to
promote a proposal to provide federal assistance to repair and
upgrade Indian reservation schools.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed $802 million for overdue school repairs and another
$126 million to replace six schools and said he would seek the
funds from Congress next year if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tragically, schools on tribal lands are often in poor physical
condition and lack basic resources,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor met with 10 tribal leaders to discuss the
narrowly focused aid proposal, then broadened his appeal at a town
square rally in this former trading-post community adjacent to Las
Cruces.
</P>
<P>
   While education primarily remains a state responsibility, the
federal government can ''demand strong accountability,'' Bush said.
He pledged a campaign against ''schools that will not teach and
will not change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be bold enough to challenge the status quo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed school vouchers to provide tax breaks to
parents of children in private schools, a restructuring of the Head
Start program to put more emphasis on reading, a $5 billion grant
program to encourage states to fund pre-school reading programs and
new standards of educational ''accountability'' for states to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway replied that, unlike the vice
president, Bush's plan ''does little or nothing'' to help local
communities build new new schools, repair old ones and reduce class
size.
</P>
<P>
   ''The centerpiece of Bush's education agenda is a voucher that
would drain money away from public schools,'' Hattaway added in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up his attacks on the vice president, Bush said Gore's
Thursday night speech to the Democratic convention was rife with
''name-calling, finger pointing...and passing blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, campaigning with Bush for several days, told the New
Mexico rally, ''We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore
routine. After eight years as the junior partner, Al Gore thinks
his time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And it has,'' Cheney added. ''His time has come and it's time
for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new television ads with convention footage,
the campaign will also be running a second, older and more
generalized ad with Bush looking directly at the camera and saying,
''Now is the time to do the hard things.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ad buys for both ads represent the largest so far
for the campaign, said spokesman Ari Fleischer; and the first since
the end of the GOP National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   They will be run in Pennsylvania, Washington, Ohio, Florida,
Michigan, Louisiana, Delaware, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky,
George, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Maine, Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa,
Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada and West Virginia.	   The campaign will spend the
next two weeks dwelling on
education, Fleischer said. ''It's the governor's top priority. Al
Gore's top priority is repairing his image.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a rally at Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
Bush told a packed gymnasium audience, ''I know you're not supposed
to take anything for granted in politics, but Texas is in good
shape...We're counting on you to keep the base intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he told cheering supporters, ''The message is: Don't mess
with us in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign boasted that Bush, in a series of
plane and train trips in the days immediately after the GOP
convention, had visited more states with more electoral votes than
has Gore with his riverboat trip down the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Bush visited five states in five days, states with 138 total
electoral votes, said Bush spokesman McClellan. He said that
compares with four stops for Gore on the river.

<HEADLINE> Vigil Held for Protesters at DNC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fifty of the nearly 200 protesters arrested
during the Democratic National Convention remained jailed Saturday,
many of them on a hunger strike, as supporters outside the
jailhouse demanded their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six of the 27 men and 19 of the 23 women began refusing
to eat Friday afternoon, said Sgt. Bob Killeen of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department, which oversees county jails.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have medical staff monitoring them. Nobody appears to be in
any distress,'' he said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, about two dozen demonstrators carried
cardboard cutouts depicting their comrades behind bars. ''We are
asking for a fair and just plea bargain,'' protest organizer Lisa
Fithian said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of those still in custody refuse to give authorities
their names, even though if they did so, they likely would be given
court dates and released with a minimal amount of bail.
</P>
<P>
   One 21-year-old inmate who has refused to give his name said in
a telephone interview that he knew about the demonstrators outside.
''It's very encouraging to know we have support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another jailed protester said: ''We're fasting in order to speed
up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Fithian and Kevin Rudiger of Direct Action Network said they
hoped the demonstration would persuade prosecutors to drop
misdemeanor charges against the jailed protesters and free them
with credit for time served.
</P>
<P>
   ''People committed civil disobedience. They expected to be
arrested. They also think they should be released immediately,''
Rudiger said.
</P>
<P>
   An after-hour call seeking comment from the city attorney's
office was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 194 people were arrested during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, 129 misdemeanor cases and four felony cases
had been filed. The most serious charge was felony assault with a
deadly weapon on a police officer filed against a protester who
allegedly threw a chunk of concrete at an officer.

<HEADLINE> Folk legend Pete Seeger searches for stolen banjo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEACON, N.Y. (AP) - Pete Seeger has inspired generations to seek
a better path.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's hoping they'll help him find a missing banjo he made
and has played for 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   The lignum vitae long-neck banjo he made in 1945 has been
missing since Aug. 8, believed stolen from Seegers car during a
trip to a political rally in Rosendale.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the missing banjo has generated international intrigue,
an imposter showing up on an anonymous Internet auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation is still on,'' said Rosendale police Sgt.
Perry Soule. ''Obviously its getting a ton of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Soule said the Internet banjo is probably a company-brand
instrument that looks like Seeger's, even carrying the message:
''This machine surrounds hate and forces it to surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeger, 81, started his career 62 years ago. In 1940, he formed
the Almanac singers, which another folk icon, Woody Guthrie, joined
a year later. Seeger was an anti-war protester and a peace advocate
and was a founder of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater. He saw
commercial success with the Weavers.
</P>
<P>
   He has offered a $1,000 reward for the return of the banjo.

<HEADLINE> Redskins 24, Browns 0  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Skip Hicks scored two easy touchdowns and
Washington's starters pushed Cleveland's first team all over the
field Saturday night as the Redskins rolled to a 24-0 victory over
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Johnson and Jeff George, the Redskins' high-priced
quarterback combo, each completed a TD pass for Washington (2-1),
the preseason favorite to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If the Redskins were looking for a game, Cleveland wasn't the
place to find one. It figured to a be a mismatch, and it was.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Norv Turner only played his first-stringers
until early in the third quarter. By then, the Redskins' Pro
Bowlers, superstars and future Hall of Famers had shown they're in
a different league than the young Browns (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made several costly penalties and blew two scoring
chances in the second half on fumbles inside the 20.
</P>
<P>
   The game was also a reunion for former Penn State All-Americans
-- LaVar Arrington and Courtney Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, currently behind Greg Jones on the Redskins' depth
chart at strongside linebacker, plugged the hole to deliver a
bone-jarring tackle on Rahshon Spikes in the first half and
recovered a fumble in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wasn't nearly as visible, making his biggest play in third
quarter when he was called for roughing on George.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, battling Adrian Murrell for the backup job behind feature
back Stephen Davis, had a 6-yard TD catch from Johnson and a
12-yard scoring run in the second quarter when the Redskins'
offense outgained Cleveland's 127-11.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland quarterback Tim Couch completed 11 of 20 passes for 83
yards in three quarters. Couch, the Browns' second-year QB and
future, has been under fire all summer after throwing four
interceptions during the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   But Couch showed some nice flashes in the third quarter, even if
it came against Washington's second-unit defense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson completed 7 of 10 passes for 69 yards and a score, and
George, who came over as a free agent this winter for $18.25
million for four years to back him up, finished 9-of-14 for 104
yards.
</P>
<P>
   George hooked up with Albert Connell for a 36-yard TD in the
third quarter to put the Redskins up 24-0.
</P>
<P>
   Two defensive penalties against the Browns helped Washington
take a 14-0 lead in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland safety Marquis Smith was assessed a personal foul at
the end of a 5-yard pickup by Hicks, giving the Redskins a first
down at the Browns 28. Two plays later, rookie cornerback Lewis
Sanders got caught pushing Westbrook out of bounds, giving
Washington a first-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Hicks was left uncovered in the right flat and
caught a swing pass from Johnson for an easy score.
</P>
<P>
   George entered with 5:44 remaining and took the Redskins on a
16-play drive, which ended with Brett Conway's 21-yard field goal
with six seconds left to give Washington a 17-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks scored on a 12-yard run with 12:56 remaining in the first
half to give the Redskins a 7-0 lead. Sweeping left, Hicks picked
up a couple of nice blocks and went in untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Browns running back Errict Rhett, signed last winter to be
Cleveland's every-down back, didn't play after breaking his nose
during practice this week.

   TOKYO (AP) -- A fairly strong earthquake struck Japan's
northernmost main island of Hokkaido early Sunday, the
Meteorological Agency said. There were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor with a preliminary magnitude of 5.8 hit at 2:26 a.m.

<P>
   Nemuro is about 608 miles northwest of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Brands 2 Doctors as Traitors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba branded as traitors Saturday a physician and
dentist who defected while on assignment in Zimbabwe and have since
gained asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the communist youth daily, Juventud Rebelde,
Cuban officials charged that the doctors' move was part of a plan
to derail Cuba's international medical aid program. They said Cuban
medical workers on international missions have received financial
offers to defect from anti-communist exile groups.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Cordova Rodriguez, 31, a physician, and Noris Pena
Martinez, 25, a dentist, had been on a mission with about 100 other
Cuban medical specialists in Zimbabwe when they abandoned it in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   They say they were jailed for more than a month in Zimbabwe
after declaring their intention to defect, and that Zimbabwean
security forces then helped Cuban diplomats force them onto a
flight to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Air France refused to let them board during a stopover in South
Africa after the doctors slipped a note to a crew member saying
they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   They were granted asylum in the United States earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has denied any involvement in the alleged kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who has persecuted them on the island? Neither Cordova nor
Pena have done anything in Cuba to make us believe this story that
they have the caliber of political refugees,'' the newspaper said.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fifty of the nearly 200 protesters arrested during the
Democratic National Convention remained jailed today, many of them on a hunger
strike, as supporters outside the jailhouse demanded their immediate release.
Twenty-six of the 27 men and 19 of the 23 women began refusing to eat yesterday
afternoon, said Sgt. Bob Killeen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,
which oversees county jails. ''We have medical staff monitoring them. Nobody
appears to be in any distress,'' he said tonight.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- After more than five hours in surgery today to remove skin
cancer from his temple and upper arm, Sen. John McCain's doctor said preliminary
findings show that the cancer had not spread to the McCain's lymph nodes. The
internist, Dr. John Eckstein, said the surgery to remove the two melanomas, the
most serious form of skin cancer, went exactly as expected and without
complications.

Groups Want FDA To Approve Eclipse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Twenty-two public-health organizations have asked
the Food and Drug Administration to regulate Eclipse, a new reduced-smoke
cigarette that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. claims is safer than other cigarettes.
The groups, including the American Cancer Society and American Medical
Association, signed a petition sent to the FDA this month seeking the
regulation. Eclipse is a nicotine-delivery system, not a cigarette, making it
eligible for government regulation, the petition says. The Supreme Court earlier
this year ruled that Congress did not give the FDA authority to regulate
cigarettes.

   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated a quiet 54th birthday
Saturday with his family in the Adirondack Mountains, careful not to divert
attention from Al Gore's campaign. The president, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, daughter Chelsea and family dog Buddy holed up at the home of Arthur
Lussi, a wealthy real estate man who owns area resorts. Gore, meantime, was
continuing his Mississippi River boat trip -- and celebrating wife Tipper's 52nd
birthday, also Saturday -- on his first post-convention political trip as the
Democratic nominee for president.

Russia Losing Hope For Sub Survivors

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials admitted Saturday that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British
mini-sub and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in
the Arctic depths. What little hope remained for any survivors was pinned on the
new arrivals. The Norwegian team approached the site after midnight, but would
reportedly not start their dive until after dawn -- apparently to avoid diving

<HEADLINE> N.M. Pipe Explosion Kills 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An underground natural gas pipeline
exploded and sent a giant ball of flames into the air Saturday,
killing six people who had been camping nearby. Six other campers
were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The four children and two adults who died in the explosion were
members of at least two southeastern New Mexico families who were
camping along the Pecos River about 200 to 300 yards from where the
explosion occurred, said state police Capt. John Balderston.
</P>
<P>
   Balderston said the cause of the blast was not known but the
30-inch pipeline, 3 feet underground, had ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion left a large crater, which Balderston estimated
was 86-feet long, about 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The fire was
visible from Carlsbad, 20 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a large ball of flames,'' he said. ''The fire
department was able to find six people in the river, walking west
of the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The six injured were taken to a hospital in Lubbock, Texas,
about 160 miles from Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   ''All are in very critical condition and are being closely
guarded. It's going to be nip and tuck for the next 24 hours,''
spokeswoman Kim Davis said. ''It's very grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said a 5-year-old girl suffered the worst injuries, with
burns on 75 to 80 percent of her body. The other survivors were
three females and two males.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Natural Gas Co. spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the
explosion could have been ignited by anything from a spark from
striking rocks to someone lighting a cigarette or coal for a
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Gas from the pipeline goes to customers in Texas, New Mexico and
California, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Khodadad Azizi scored in the 53rd minute as
the San Jose Earthquakes snapped a six-game losing streak Saturday
night with a 1-0 victory over the D.C. United, eliminating the
defending MLS champions from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   The United (6-16-6), who also won the first two MLS
championships in 1996 and 1997, failed to make the playoffs for the
first time in league history. D.C. was the runner-up to Chicago in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi drove to the right side of the United goal and struck a
left-footed shot from point-blank range just inside the post. Dan
Calichman and Ryan Tinsley assisted for the Earthquakes (6-14-8),
who won for only the second time on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute, Eddie Pope's final chance for D.C. soared
wide right. In the 73rd minute, United forward A.J. Wood, who
registered a game-high six shots, missed wide right on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The United, who lost their fourth straight game, had 20 shots on
goal compared to 12 for the Earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   The league record for fewest wins in a season is seven, set last
year by New York-New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Saunders Lasts 3 1-3 Rehab Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Saunders lasted 3 1-3 innings in a
start Saturday night for Class A St. Petersburg, and later said he
did not expect to pitch for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays this season.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders broke his upper left arm on May 26, 1999, while
pitching for the Devil Rays. He did not pitch again the rest of the
season, and has four rehabilitation starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Sarasota Red Sox in a Florida State League game,
Saunders allowed three runs on five hits, while walking two and
striking out one.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started off pretty good but like the last game, I got tired
again late,'' Saunders said. ''But all in all, I felt better than
the last time out there. Now everytime I go out there I just want
to feel better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   As to when he'll return to the Devil Rays, Saunders said, ''I
don't expect to be back this year, I expect to be back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was limited to four innings and 60 pitches. He threw 57
pitches -- 28 strikes -- with his fastball topping out at 86 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders will make his next start in 5-7 days.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Wilson Alvarez, also on the disabled list, watched his
Tampa Bay teammate from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty amazing to do this after only a year,'' Alvarez
said. ''The other guys who had broken arms are now out of baseball.
He's progressing good and the way he looks he'll be back pretty
soon.''

<HEADLINE> Bengals 24, Bears 20  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith and Peter Warrick broke in the
Cincinnati Bengals' new stadium with a win.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick scored on a reverse and Smith pounded his chest after
his two touchdown passes rallied the Bengals to a 24-20 preseason
victory over the Chicago Bears on Saturday night in the first game
at Paul Brown Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called it a ''must-win'' game that ranked among the most
important in franchise history. He played up to the hyperbole,
leading three consecutive touchdown drives after the NFL's worst
team of the 1990s fell behind early.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals (1-2) won their first preseason game since 1998 --
they went 0-4 last year and had lost seven in a row -- by overcoming
Marcus Robinson's two touchdown catches and a 14-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The first game at the 65,600-seat stadium failed to sell out as
the Bengals sold only 56,180 tickets. Fans were grumbling when the
Bears (2-1) scored on their first two possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Bears' leading receiver last year who missed the
first two preseason games with an abdominal strain, scored the
first two times he touched the ball. He got 15 yards behind the
secondary for a 45-yard scoring catch from Cade McNown, who rolled
left to avoid a cornerback blitz and saw the Bengals' breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Bears' next possession, Robinson took a short screen and
outran the secondary for another 45-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson had a banner return, Bengals running back Corey
Dillon was ineffective in his first game since ending a holdout. He
carried seven times for 16 yards and dropped a pass in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Warrick led a 21-point spurt that put the Bengals
ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, the Bengals' top draft pick, went 14 yards on a reverse
for his first touchdown and the first against the Bears in
preseason. Smith then threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to uncovered
tight end Tony McGee and a 3-yard scoring pass to third-round pick
Ron Dugans -- Warrick's teammate at Florida State -- for a 21-14
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was 13-of-14 for 139 yards during the three drives and
pounded his chest repeatedly after throwing his first touchdown
passes of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Smith completed 21 of 29 passes for 184 yards without an
interception as he played all but 12 seconds of the first three
quarters -- another indication of how badly Cincinnati wanted to
win.
</P>
<P>
   McNown played the first two series of the third quarter and was
12-of-18 for 177 yards with one interception overall.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams closely watched their kickers with roster cuts ahead
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The place kickers were perfect. Cincinnati's Doug Pelfrey, a
long shot to hold onto his job, was good on a 20-yard field goal.
Chicago's Paul Edinger, a rookie trying to beat out Jaret Holmes,
hit a 40-yarder but was short and wide on a 54-yard attempt late in
the game. Holmes hit the upright while making a 25-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Brad Costello had punts of 36, 34, 23 and 22 yards,
drawing boos and hurting his chances of holding onto his job.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Files Suit Over Tire Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A new class-action lawsuit says a recall of
6.5 million Firestone tires is so complicated it discourages
motorists from seeking replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the companies can spread this out over several years by
giving customers the runaround, then they can discourage people
from even trying to get replacement tires,'' said attorney Stanley
Chesley, who filed the lawsuit Friday against Ford Motor Co. and
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been replacing these tires in other countries for
two years, so why should Americans be treated as second-class
citizens,'' Chesley said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone announced a rolling recall Aug. 9 of 6.5
million P235/75R15 size radial ATX and ATX II brands, as well as
Wilderness AT tires of the same size made at a plant in Decatur,
Ill. The tires are mostly on Ford trucks and sport utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Chesley says the recall restricts the availability of
replacement tires. He claims Ford Motor Co. and
Bridgestone/Firestone save about $500 in tires and labor every time
a customer decides not to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone's rolling recall was to begin in four
states and later spread to the rest of the country. But Ford
dealers nationwide quickly began running out of Firestone's
replacement tires, and Ford authorized them to use the tires of
Firestone competitors if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone last week announced it would reimburse
customers who replace recalled tires with its competitors' tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a few class action attorneys trying to capitalize
on this situation after the recall,'' Ford spokeswoman Susan Krusel
said Saturday. ''But right now, Ford is helping Firestone. We're
working around the clock. Our No. 1 priority right now is to
resolve this issue for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesley's lawsuit says a court order to improve the recall
process is the only way to protect motorists' lives. The suit asks
for unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   Chesley said he will work with attorneys in Ohio, Kentucky and
West Virginia to expand his class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, tire owners have asked for an emergency order to
force Firestone to issue vouchers for new tires to allow
replacements with competitors' tires at Firestone's expense up
front.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to get a speedy hearing Friday on a lawsuit that
would cover all Florida motorists with recalled Firestone tires was
thwarted when the company got the case moved from state to federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is
investigating the tires in connection with accidents that caused 62
deaths and 100 injuries.

<HEADLINE> Colts 24, Steelers 23  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts' Triple Threat is
definitely ready for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning threw two perfect touchdown passes, including a
77-yarder to Marvin Harrison, and Edgerrin James had a 2-yard
touchdown run, all within the first 7:26 of the Colts' 24-23
victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (2-2) managed to win over an incredibly
pro-Steelers crowd of 87,145 in Mexico's Azteca Stadium, turning
pregame boos into cheers while scoring on three straight drives in
the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (3-1) gave the fans plenty to scream about in the
final minutes as third-string quarterback Tee Martin capped a long
scoring drive with a diving 1-yard run with 10 seconds left.
Running back Pepe Pearson was stopped on the 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers starter Kordell Stewart showed some improvement, but
not enough. He failed to get a first down on four of six drives and
had to convert fourth downs on the other two series, which ended in
a field goal and a 1-yard touchdown run by Jon Witman.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was 8-of-18 for 82 yards with an interception in the end
zone and a sack. Still, that's better than the 1-of-13 and 6-of-22
marks he brought into the game. Best of all, he actually got some
cheers when his name was announced before kickoff, something that
hasn't happened much at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Azteca, though, is far different from most NFL venues starting
with the capacity of 102,000. Primarily a soccer stadium, the grass
field turned muddy quickly because of an hourlong pregame rain that
also dropped temperatures into the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of fans wore black and yellow and seemed to
all be waving Terrible Towels. Flashbulbs illuminated the field at
kickoff and on the Steelers' first offensive snap. Cheers of
''Defense'' were common before big plays for Pittsburgh's defense
and flags against the Steelers were booed. A bee-like buzz hummed
all game from plastic horns popular among the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Things were so loud on the field that both offenses were using
hand and foot signals most of the first half. Manning often walked
up and down the line barking out signals. Stewart unsuccessfully
tried quieting them a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Hank Poteat couldn't blame the noise for fumbling a
punt deep in his own territory following Indianapolis' first
possession. The Colts recovered at the 11 and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Manning tricked the entire Pittsburgh (1-3)
defense on a fake handoff left, then rolled right and softly tossed
a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide-open tight end Ken Dilger.
</P>
<P>
   The next series, which began at the Steelers' 29 following a
54-yard punt return by Payton Williams, was all James.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-yard run was followed by a 3-yard gain that had another 8
yards tacked on for facemasking. James got 6 yards on the next
play, then bounced off two blocks for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:20 later, Indianapolis took over again its 23. On first
down, Manning heaved a pass down the right sideline that Harrison
caught practically in stride just past midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Chad Scott dove at Harrison from behind and safety
Scott Shields gave chase for a few yards, but there was no catching
him -- or the Colts, who led 21-0 four seconds shy of the halfway
point of the first quarter against a defense that had allowed 20
points all preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh answered with a 72-yard, 13-play drive that ended
with a 23-yard field goal from Kris Brown. Stewart was 4 of 5 for
51 yards on the series and Amos Zereoue, starting in place of the
injured Jerome Bettis, had 23 yards, including 3 when he dove over
the line on fourth-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers made it 21-10 on Witman's touchdown and were
driving for another score in the final minute of the first half
when Stewart threw an interception in the end zone. The Colts were
able to set up kicker Mike Vanderjagt for a 52-yard field goal try,
but he missed wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Graham replaced Stewart to open the third quarter and he
threw a nice touchdown pass to Malcom Johnson while being thrown
down by Josh Williams. From his back, Graham shook his arms and
feet with joy after realizing Johnson scored.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis went back up by a touchdown when Danny Kight kicked
a field goal early in the fourth quarter.

<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell hit two homers, making him the first
Houston player to reach 300 in a career, and drove in five runs
Saturday night as the Astros beat the Milwaukee Brewers 10-8.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the eighth inning.
Julio Lugo walked with two outs and Bagwell connected against Juan
Acevedo (2-5) for his 37th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell has 102 RBIs, the fifth straight year he's had at least
100 RBIs. All 300 of his lifetime home runs have come for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their season-high sixth in a row. Bagwell has six
home runs in his last six games, and a 17-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell had his 22nd career multihomer game, including fur this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera (2-2) pitched two scoreless innings, striking out
three. Octavio Dotel pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 11
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou scored on a single by Chris Truby in the Houston,
and Mitch Meluskey hit an RBI single in the seventh that made it
8-all.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored five times in the fifth to take an 8-6 lead.
Jeromy Burnitz singled, Charlie Hayes reached on a catcher's
interference call and both runners advanced on a wild pitch by
Chris Holt.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard hit an RBI single, Henry Blanco doubled home a run,
James Mouton hit a two-run triple and Mark Loretta added an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz hit a three-run homer, his 24th, in the first. Bagwell

</P>
<P>
Notes: Since going to the bullpen July 6, Dotel is 1-0 with eight
saves in 10 opportunities and a 2.29 ERA. ... Bagwell and Richard
Hidalgo are only the second Astros duo to have 30 or more homers in
the same season. The other was Moises Alou (38) and Bagwell (34) in
1998. ... Bagwell's longest hitting streak in his career is 18
games. ... Milwaukee's Marquis Grissom is two stolen bases short of
400 for his career. ... Bagwell is the eighth player in major
league history to record five straight seasons with 30 home runs,
100 RBIs and 100 runs scored.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Alberto, the longest-lived August
tropical storm on record, intensified Saturday as it spun over the
open Atlantic with maximum winds of 110 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, the third named storm of the hurricane season, weakened
and its winds dropped to 25 mph as it continued its northwesterly
course. Its remnants were 225 miles northwest of the Caribbean
island of Antigua and not expected to threaten any islands during
the weekend, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't foresee an immediate intensification,'' said Lixion
Avila, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. ''There's a possibility the wave could regenerate, but we
don't see that happening any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was about 1,065 miles west of the Azores islands, west
of Portugal. It was moving north at about 5 mph. Alberto formed
Aug. 4 and hasn't posed a threat to land.
</P>
<P>
   Since hurricane record keeping began in 1900, Hurricane Felix
was the longest-lived August storm, surviving 14 days in 1995. The
longest-lived Atlantic storm on record is Hurricane Ginger, which
kept its name for 21 days in September 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Monday before forecasters can tell whether Chris'
remnants could redevelop into a tropical storm and pose any threat
to the continental United States.

<HEADLINE> Bills 31, Rams 27  </HEADLINE>

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kurt Warner ignored his sore right shoulder and
threw two first-half touchdown passes in the St. Louis Rams' 31-27
preseason loss to the Buffalo Bills Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's MVP was held out of practice for two days following
the Rams' Monday night loss at Tennessee, but played most of the
first half. He hit Marshall Faulk and Torry Holt for scores of 21
and 27 yards and was 14-for-21 for 196 yards, and missed a third
touchdown when Roland Williams, attempting to vault into the end
zone, fumbled at the goal line for a touchback.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rams' first two preseason games, Warner threw only six
passes, completing four for 65 yards. The only curious aspect to
his outing is he was removed in the middle of a drive.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Rob Johnson also had a big half in an often sloppy
game, going 8-for-12 for 237 yards and three touchdowns. Johnson
hit a wide-open Jeremy McDaniel for a 51-yard gain to the Rams 5 on
the third play of the game. He and McDaniel also hooked up for an
85-yard touchdown with 2:32 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit Jay Riemersma for a 5-yard score and Bobby Collins
for a 26-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk also got a lot more action, with 58 yards on 10 carries
and three catches for 15 yards. Faulk totaled 16 yards on five
carries with no receptions the first two games, and topped his
rushing total with a 20-yard run on his first carry.
</P>
<P>
   Holt also caught a 22-yard pass from backup Trent Green as the
Rams (1-2) scored 17 points in the last 4:07 of the second quarter
to take a 24-21 halftime lead. Holt, St. Louis' first-round pick
last year, caught six passes for 109 yards in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams committed three turnovers, two interceptions by Green
and a fumble on a kickoff return by Curtis Jackson, in a span of
three plays to hand the Bills the lead in the second half. Shawn
Bryson scored on a 3-yard run on the first play of the fourth
quarter to give the Bills a 28-27 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hilbert added a 36-yard field goal with 12:30 to play for
the Bills (2-1), who met the Rams in the preseason for the first
time since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills stopped the Rams at the Buffalo 28 with 17 seconds to
go.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' second-team defense had a highlight in the third
quarter, with a goal-line stand that stopped the Bills at the 1 to
preserve a 27-21 lead. The last three plays came from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   New Rams coach Mike Martz twice challenged rulings in the first
half, and he won one and lost one. An apparent touchdown return by
Sam Cowart off a fumble was overruled by replay in the first
quarter, but the touchback ruling on Williams' fumble into the end
zone was upheld.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rams offensive tackle Orlando Pace strained the patella
tendon in his left knee in the second quarter and did not return.
Safety Devin Bush strained his right groin in the second quarter
and cornerback Dre' Bly injured his right hamstring in the third
quarter. ... Offensive linemen on both teams wore battery-operated
noise-reducing devices in an ongoing experiment aimed at reducing
the effect of crowd noise in domed stadiums.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars 26, Chiefs 22  </HEADLINE>

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mike Hollis kicked four field goals and
rookie Shyrone Stith broke a 78-yard touchdown run as the
Jacksonville Jaguars held on for a 26-22 preseason victory Saturday
night over the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, winless in three preseason games, sacked three
Jacksonville quarterbacks a total of seven times, exposing the
weakness in an offensive line beset by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Stith, a seventh-round draft pick out of Virginia Tech, raced 78
yards with 3:50 left, breaking through a hole on the right side and
outrunning cornerback Eric Warfield for a 26-16 lead. He totaled
103 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Todd Collins immediately marched the Chiefs
downfield and hit Kirby Dar Dar for a 6-yard scoring pass. The
2-point conversion failed, leaving the Jaguars up by 4 with 2:51
left.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-yard punt by Jacksonville's Steve Lindsey gave the Chiefs
the ball on their own 49 with 2:15 to play, but linebacker Danny
Clark sacked Collins on third and fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   Bracy Walker sped 20 yards into the end zone with Jamie Martin's
fumble following Kansas City's sixth sack, giving Kansas City a
16-13 lead with 13:04 left.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Duane Clemons, signed as a free agent to help
supply the pass-rushing void left by the death of Derrick Thomas,
had two sacks in the first half. Defensive tackle John Browning
also had two sacks for the Chiefs (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars (3-0) were leading 13-9 when Walker broke through
against the Jaguars' second-team line, knocked the ball out of
Martin's hands and picked it up and went 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Martin hit R. Jay Soward for gains of 29 and 34 yards on the
next possession and Hollis tied it 16-all with a 32-yarder. One
play earlier, he was wide left from 37 yards but was given a second
chance five yards closer when the Chiefs were called for offsides.
</P>
<P>
   Following a Chiefs' turnover, Hollis connected on a 27-yarder
for a 19-16 lead with 6:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a battle of first-team quarterbacks and
expected regular-season starters. Mark Brunell hit 9-of-14 for
Jacksonville for 115 yards and one touchdown and got sacked twice.
Brunell also led the Jaguars on a 46-yard march at the end of the
half to set up a 46-yard Hollis field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Grbac was 10-for-17 for 83 yards but managed only two
field-goal drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars scored the only touchdown of the first half when
Jimmy Smith got behind cornerback Cris Dishman and hauled in
Brunell's 32-yard scoring play on third and 10. The pass capped an
8-play, 64-yard drive and made it 7-3 with 13:15 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs made it 7-6 on a 39-yard goal by Pete Stoyanovich
with 38 seconds left. But the Jaguars got the ball on their own 30
and went 42 yards in five plays to set up Hollis' 46-yard field
goal for a 10-6 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stoyanovich also connected from 28 yards when the Chiefs marched
79 yards in 16 plays on their first possession. Tony Gonzalez drew
a 15-yard late-hit penalty and caught a 15-yard pass on consecutive
plays in the drive. Mike Cloud, bidding to be the No. 1 running
back, carried six times for 23 yards.

N.M. Pipe Explosion Kills 9
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An underground natural gas pipeline exploded Saturday,
killing nine people who had been camping nearby. Three other campers were in
critical condition. The victims, four of them children, were members of at least
two southeastern New Mexico families who were camping along the Pecos River
about 200 to 300 yards from where the explosion occurred, said state police
Capt. John Balderston. The pipeline was 8 to 15 feet underground at the rupture
point, El Paso Natural Gas Co. spokeswoman Norma Dunn said. The rupture occurred
about 500 feet east of the river, around 20 to 30 miles south of Carlsbad in
southeastern New Mexico.

Russia Losing Hope For Sub Survivors

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted Saturday that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British
mini-sub and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in
the Arctic depths. Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes
of the disaster, when a massive explosion shattered the vessel Aug. 12 and it
slammed into the bottom of the sea, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told
reporters Saturday. Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak said in a special announcement on
state-run RTR television that any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled
with water.

Lawyer Files Suit Over Tire Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A new class-action lawsuit says a recall of 6.5 million
Firestone tires is so complicated it discourages motorists from seeking
replacements.''If the companies can spread this out over several years by giving
customers the runaround, then they can discourage people from even trying to get
replacement tires,'' said attorney Stanley Chesley, who filed the lawsuit Friday
against Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. Bridgestone/Firestone
announced a rolling recall Aug. 9 of 6.5 million P235/75R15 size radial ATX and
ATX II brands, as well as Wilderness AT tires of the same size made at a plant
in Decatur, Ill. The tires are mostly on Ford trucks and sport utility vehicles.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Just when it looked as though Tiger Woods might take
all the drama out of the PGA Championship, a shocking turn of events Saturday
left him clinging to a one-stroke lead over Bob May and the unflappable Scott
Dunlap. Woods missed a 2-foot putt for his first double bogey in 153 holes of
major championship golf, then had to survive some suddenly errant shots for a
2-under 70.
